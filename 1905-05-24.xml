                    <p>Paris, May 23.</p>
                    <p>The sculptor Paul Dubois is dead (Havas.)</p>
                    <p>Paul Dubois, who was one of the greatest of modern sculptures, was born at
                        Nogent-sur-Seine, July 18, 1829. He was destined by his father for the legal
                        profession, but his artistic tastes constrained him to devote himself to
                        sculpture, and he went to Paris to become the pupil of the sculptor
                        Toussaint, with whom he remained three years. In 1859 he went to Italy, and
                        in 1860 executed at Florence the model for "St. John a Child," which was
                        finished at Rome, exhibited at the Salon of 1863, and is now at the
                        Luxembourg, together with “A Florentine Singer of the Fiftienth Century."
                        This last is in silvered bronze and thought its many reproductions in
                        smaller size has become very popular. Other works which may be cited are the
                        tomb of General'la Moriciere, one of the masterpieces of modern statuary
                        (1878), which is at Nantes; and busts of Bonnat, Cabanel, Paul Baudry,
                        Gounod, Pasteur (1890), and other celebrities. M. Dubois also studied
                        painting, and had executed nine portraits and beautiful copies of old
                        masters but was a very irregular contributor to the Salon exhibitions. In
                        1873 he was appointed keeper of the Luxembourg Museum, and director of the
                        Ecole des Beaux-Arts, May 30, 1878. Elected a member of the Academie des
                        Beaux-Arts in 1876, he was one of the Jury of Admission for the selection of
                        sculpture at the Exposition of 1878. He was a grand officer of the Legion of
                        Honour (1889). </p>

                    <p>London, May 23.</p>
                    <p>The scene in the House of Commons is without parallel in the history of the
                        House. The speakers, chiefly Mr Lyttelton, were greeted with angry cries of
                        "Bring in the Guards!” “Where are the police!” and by the blowing of police
                        whistles. After Mr. Austen Chamberlain and Mr. Brodrick has sat down, Sir
                        Henry Campbell-Bannerman again appealed to Mr. Balfour declaring that by his
                        silence he alone was responsible for the disturbance. This renewed the
                        uproar and Mr. Balfour rose and severely rebuked the House for its unseemly
                        behaviour. Never in his experience had it refused to listen to a Minister
                        speaking for the Government, nor had the Opposition presumed to dictate the
                        order of speeches. To-night's precedent, if followed, would absolutely ruin
                        the Commons. Mr.Lyttelton again rose, but the storm burst with redoubled
                        fury. The Deputy Speaker adjourned the House by virtue of the new rule
                        reffering to a grave disorder. The prolongation of the scene is attributed
                        to the fact that the Deputy-Speaker, who presided in consequence of the
                        Speaker's illness, has no power to suspend individual Members.(Reuter.) </p>
                    <p>London, May 23.</p>
                    <p>House of Commons.- The House to-day was thronged, and Sir H. Campbell
                        Bannerman and Mr. Balfour were received with extraordinary ovations on
                        entering. Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman asked whether in view of the
                        confusion created by the recent declarations of Ministers with reference to
                        the fiscal question and the Colonial Conference, Mr. Balfour would fix a day
                        for a vote of censure. Mr. Balfour said that two Ministers were prepared to
                        clear up any confusion yesterday, when they wore prevented by the
                        disgraceful proceedings which Sir H. Campbell-Bannerman did nothing to
                        prevent. He had no objection to fixing a day provided he had an undertaking
                        that the debate would be conducted with ordinary de ceney and fair play. The
                        matter was then dropped. (Reuter.)</p>

                    <head>THE COTTON WORM.</head>
                    <p>The seriousness of the present situation can be grasped when we state that
                        the actual loss due to the worm during the cotton season last year is
                        estimated at between 1,000,000l. and 2,000,000l. at least. </p>
                    <p>The life-history of the worm is as follows : About the beginning of June the
                        moth lays eggs (about 300) on a leaf near the bottom of the plant. These are
                        easily soon on examination. The period of incubation is from three to four
                        days. The young worms begin to feed on the leaf on which they are hatched.
                        They grow very rapidly, and in a few days spread over the entire plant.
                        After feeding (from 18 to 22 days), the worms burrow into the soil,
                        construct cells, and pass the pupa stage (8 to 10 days). The moths then
                        hatch out and commence laying again. The whole life-history is thus from 30
                        to 40 days, depending to a certain extent on climatic conditions. In July,
                        therefore, we bare a second brood, followed by a thud in August, after which
                        the worms find food elsewhere. It is clear that the pest can be most
                        satisfactorily attacked by picking the leaves on which the eggs are found.
                        When the worms have spread over the plant, they eat the young buds, flowers,
                        leaves, &amp;c., and it is impossible to do much. Fields have to be examined
                        every few days when eggs are being laid. It is evident that the more
                        thoroughly the June brood is kept in check, the less severe will subsequent
                        generations be. </p>

                    <head>ATTEMPTED MURDER IN MOHAMED ALY SQUARE.</head>
                    <p>This morning, at about 10.30 ’o'clock, a serious outrage took place in
                        Mohamed Aly square, Alexandria, which resulted in grave injuries to Ahmed
                        Khalil, late consular janissary to the American consular agency and at
                        present bowab to St. Mark's Small Building. While the man was on an errand
                        and was walking through the square to collect some money , an unknown person
                        rushed up to him and folded him to the ground with a sharp instrument,.
                        evidently some iron weapon. His upper lip was cut clean open and a gaping
                        wound extends under the nose. The aggressor at once made off, leaving his
                        victim lying in a pool of blood. The injured man has been taken to the
                        Government Hospital. He is quite unable to identify his would-be assassin,
                        who fortunately did not plunge the weapon far enough into the man's mouth to
                        inflict fatal injuries to the throat. It is strange that such a bloodthirsty
                        outrage could have been committed in Mohamed Aly square, which was crowded
                        with people, at that hour, and the assassin have escaped scot free. </p>

                    <head>NYAM-NYAM EXPEDITION.</head>
                    <p>It appears that Yambio, the Nyam-Nyam chief, whose death we announced in our
                        Saturday’s issue, had been the mainstay of the whole revolt, and that from
                        the first his people wanted to come in, but were kept back by him. He ruled
                        his people with extreme severity, his only punishment was death, and this
                        was meted out frequently for the slightest offence. Large numbers of women
                        and girls were found closely confined and jealously guarded in his village.
                        All were released and sent book to their villages whenever possible. Among
                        the trophies captured was the Sultan's great war drum. It stands four feet
                        high, is cut out of a single tree trunk, and is carved to represent a
                        buffalo. At Yambio's funeral there was no great display of grief, and on
                        this being pointed out by a British officer, an Arab-speaking native
                        answered “No ; they are not sorry, for if Yambio had died a natural death
                        and had been buried by his own people, least 300 of them would have been
                        slain at the same time. "After establishing posts throughout the whole
                        district, and explaining the object of the Government, the remainder of the
                        force returned to Waw at the end of March. The expedition was an unqualified
                        success, and reflects great credit on Major Boulnois and all the officers
                        under his command. On the way back one of the officers had rather a narrow
                        escape. A leopard he had wounded badly came straight for him, and though hit
                        again in the neck, was not finished off before it had bitten him deep in the
                        arm and crunched the right hand with its powerful jaws. </p>

                    <p>Addressing the Royal Geographical Society on Monday week on “The Nile

                        Wadelai, on the left bank, in a fair state of preservation, though the
                        buildings had disappeared. The natives remembered Emin well. Of Gordon only
                        a few natives seemed to know anything, though most of those living near the
                        river had heard of “Godun," as he was called, and an interesting relic had
                        been secured in the shape of an Austrian bentwood chair, which Gordon had
                        given to the chief Gimorro. The chair was to be seen in a room adjoining the
                        lecture theatre. </p>

                    <p>Yesterday, for the second time during the past month, a certain house
                        situated in the Greek quarter, not for from the bazaar, caught fire. The
                        house if built of wood and was much damaged. No lives were lost end the fire
                        was extinguished without the assistance of the Fire Brigade. There are many
                        blocks of this class of wooden building in Port Said, which were constructed
                        soon after the opening of the canal and arc now very unsafe and insanitary.

                        arrangements evidently formulated by the officials of the Gouvernorst of
                        Alexandria, but which appear to be words only, as no one needs the
                        instructions. I refer to the "writing on the wall" here and there stating
                        that "there is room here for a stand of 4 cabs and in others for 6, and so
                        on." I have never yet found any cabs taking up their positions on these
                        legalized stands but crawlers are still crawling and others place their
                        carriages and horses half across the end of a street so as to be seen down
                        the whole of it, to the great inconvenience of those turning into these
                        streets when the abuggies are begged to "kasskiss” and get out of the way.
                        In the early morning no cabs are to be found down the whole length of
                        Rosetta-road, which is a long one, and this is a great inconvenience to
                        people who do not keep their own carriages. The same thing occurs late in
                        the evening. If the “writing on the wall" has any in it why are there
                        instructions treated as null and void. </p>

                    <head>THE SULTAN'S DANGER,</head>
                    <head>THE REVOLT IN YEMEN.</head>
                    <p>The revolt of Southern Arabia against the Sultan may prove to be an event of
                        much more than local importance. The eastern shores of the Red Sea are to
                        little frequented by Europeans that it is only on rare occasions that any
                        news from the vast tracts of country which were known to the Romans as
                        Arabia Felix reaches the outside world. Running from north to South, the
                        three divisions of territory known as the Hedjaz, the Azir, and the Yemen
                        are nominally provinces of the Turkish Empire, though Turkish rule has never
                        effectively penetrated into the less accessible mountain districts. The
                        Hedjaz is by far the most important of those divisions, for it contains the
                        holy cities of Mecca and Medina, the possession of which is the visible
                        proof to the Mahomedan world of the Sultan’s title to be regarded as Caliph.
                        The Azir is the wildest and the most inhospitable of these regions, and is
                        peopled largely by tribes which adhere to the doctrines of the Shia sect,
                        and consequently repudiate altogether the claim of a Sunnite Sultan to
                        spiritual supremacy. The Shia doctrine is also widely held in the Yemen,
                        which, owing to the fertility of its mountain valleys and the comparative
                        excellence of its climate, is economically a possession of considerable
                        importance. This fertility has attracted settlers from the earliest times,
                        and the Yemen can show traces of a very remarkable civilisation, believed by
                        some to Ira coeval with that of ancient Egypt. The Yemen, from its
                        geographical position, was one of the new forces which were born into the
                        world with Mahomed, and many of the Imams, the semiecclesiastical,
                        semi-civil rulers, who for centuries exercised an uncertain sway over the
                        Arab tribes which peopled it, were of the blood of the Prophet. The Turkish
                        power was first effectually established in the country in the reign of
                        Suleiman tho Magnificent, and by the middle of the sixteenth century all the
                        coast of Arabia acknowledged the Turkish rule, and Sanaa became the seat of
                        the Pasha of Yemen. The Turkish occupation came to an end in 1630, and one
                        Kasim, a descendant of the Prophet, founded a line of Imams which continued
                        in power for more than two centuries, until the lawless state of the
                        country, which rendered caravan trade impossible, induced the Turks to
                        reoccupy the country and restore the direct rule of the Porte in 1872. The
                        Yemen, however, has proved no bed of roses to the Turks during the last
                        thirty years. The prevalence of the Shia doctrine, which makes the rule of a
                        Sunnite Sovereign highly repugnant to the Arab trioesinen, the spirit of
                        independence which characterises mountaineers all the word over, and the
                        incompetence and rapacity of the Turkish officials have all militated
                        against the establishment of a lasting peace. A dangerous revolt broke out
                        in 1892, and the existence of a representative of the ancient Imams, in the
                        shape of Ahmed ed-Din, who, however, does not appear to have been very
                        anxious to play the part of national hero, gave it the character of a
                        religious war. The Porte, by a lavish expenditure of men and money, managed
                        to scotch the rebellion, but the embers of disaffection have continued to
                        smoulder, and at no time has the Yemen been completely free from
                        trouble.</p>
                    <p>The proximate cause of the present outbreak is not clear, though the German
                        semi-official Press, by the way, has already satisfied itself that it is due
                        to a deep-laid scheme on the part of the British Government to prepare the
                        way for the establishment of British supremacy in the Arabian peninsula.
                        Putting aside this ingenious fabrication, which is probably intended chiefly
                        for consumption in Constantinople, we can entertain no doubt as to the
                        serious proportions to which the rising has attained. News reached this
                        country at the end of February that the whole country south of Sanaa was in
                        a state of insurrection, and that the towns of Kataba and Tais had already
                        fallen into the hands of the insurgents Ominous reports began to arrive of
                        wholesale desertion from the Turkish ranks, and, though the town of Sanaa
                        held out stubbornly for a time, Ali Riza Pasha, who attempted to relieve it
                        with seven battalions of infantry and a battery of artillery, only succeeded
                        in entering the town with the loss of his guns and a large portion of his
                        force. A few days afterwards, on April 30, the town surrendered to the
                        insurgents, whose booty included thirty - guns and 20,000 rifles, with a
                        considerable quantity of ammunition. So far we have beard nothing of any
                        attempt to proclaim an Imam; but, if it is true that Mahmud Yahya, who is
                        described as the principal Sheikh of Yemen, has arrived in Constantinople to
                        submit to the Government certain proposals for the autonomy of the Yemen in
                        return tor the payment of an annual tribute, it is clear that the insurgents
                        will not be content with the mere redress of abuses or the dismissal of
                        unpopular officials.</p>
                    <p>The Ottoman Government appears to be doing its best to hurry troops and
                        stores down to Hodeida, but the Syrian reinforcements which have already
                        arrived have proved unsatisfactory, and the attempt to mobilise Redif
                        battalions in Albania has been attended with great difficulties. Drafts are
                        also being sent from the Adrianople command, and orders have been given for
                        the calling out of a division of the Angora Re Ids, whose headquarters are
                        in Constantipole. Rita Pasha, who is either killed or a prisoner, has been
                        succeeded in the command by Marshal Ahmed Fevzi Pasha. The secession of the
                        Yemen, if carried out, would be a very serious blow to the Turkish power ;
                        for the ridings of a successful revolt could not fail to spread to the Azir
                        and the Hedjsz, and might raise throughout the Arabian peninsula the racial
                        fanaticism of all the bribes whose traditional hatred of the Turk has never
                        been curbed except by fear. Even in modern times the Wahabi movement has
                        shown how sudden end overwhelming such outbreaks are apt to be amongst the
                        fierce tribesmen of Arabia. Less than a hundred years ago, Mecca and Medina
                        themselves fell into the hands of the Arab Puritans, and were wrested from
                        them only by the military intervention of Egypt under Mohamed Ali. Happily
                        for Egypt, Egyptian troops are no longer at the beck and call of the Sultan.
                        The magnitude of the military preparations ordered by Abdul Hamid gives,
                        however, the measure of the anxiety into which events in the Yemen have
                        plunged tho Imperial mind. A general uprising in Arabia is not, perhaps, a
                        likely contingency, but it does not need any very intimate acquaintance with
                        the workings of the Mahomedan mind to be able to form an estimate of the far
                        reaching effects upon the position of the Sultab as a factor in
                        international politics if he were ultimately to lose his bold over the
                        cradle of Islam. (The Times).</p>

                    <head>THE PHYSICAL EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL.</head>
                    <p>A largely attended meeting was held in the great hail of the Church House,
                        Loudon, last week by the Women's Union of the Church of England Temperance
                        Society. Canon J. W. Horsley presided. At this mooting an address was given
                        by Sir Frederick Treves on "The physical effects of the use of alcohol,"
                        which should prove of much interest in this country, owing to the prominence
                        given to the drink question of late-especially by the remarks made by Lord
                        Cromer. The hands of all temperance reformers ought to be greatly
                        strengthened by such a speech as the following. </p>
                    <p>Sir Frederick Treves in his address said that alcohol was, of course,
                        distinctly a poison. It had certain uses, like other poisons, but the
                        limitations on its use should be as strict as on argenic, opium, and
                        strychnia. It was a curiously insidious poison, producing effects which
                        seemed to be only relieved by taking more of it a remark which applied to
                        another insidious poison, morphia, or opium. It had a certain position as
                        medicine, but in the last 25 years its use by the medical profession had
                        steadily and emphatically diminished. People were often heard to say that
                        alcohol was an excellent appetiser when taken before meals. But the appetite
                        did not need artificial stimulation; if the body wanted feeding it demanded
                        food. As for its "aiding digestion," it hindered digestion even when taken
                        in small amounts, as could be easily demonstrated. Then there was the idea
                        that alcohol was strengthening. As a fact, it curiously modified the
                        nourishment of the body ; it greatly lessened the output of carbonic acid—a
                        very important matter—so that the drunkard was necessarily aa ill-nourished
                        man ; and to reach the acme of physical condition was impossible if any
                        alcohol was used. Its stimulating effect was only momentary, and after that
                        had passed off the capacity for work fell enormously. Alcohol, as it were,
                        brought up the whole of the reserve forces of the body and threw them into
                        action, and when those were used up there was nothing to fall back on. It
                        dissipated rather than conserved bodily energy. As a work producer it was
                        exceedingly extravagant, and might lead to a physical bankruptcy ; and he
                        was not speaking, he would remind them, excessive drinking. It was a curious
                        fact that troops could not march on alcohol. In the Ladysmith relief column,
                        which he accompanied, the first men to drop out were simply the men who
                        drank. The fact was as clear as if they had all borne labels on their backs.
                        As for the statement that alcohol was "a great thing, for the circulation"
                        it increased the heart-beat and reddened the skin by using up the body’s
                        reserve power, but then the heart’s action became emphatically weaker, a
                        temporary effect being got at an enormous cost. The action of alcohol on the
                        central nervous system was very definite, and was that of a functional
                        poison, first stimulating and then depressing the nervous system. The higher
                        nervous centres went first, becoming slightly dulled. The mar who worked on
                        even a moderate amount of alcohol was not at his best. Fine work could not
                        be done under that condition. The use of alcohol was absolutely inconsistent
                        with a surgeon’s work, or with any work demanding quick and alert judgment.
                        He was much struck by the number of professional men who for this reason had
                        discontinued the use of alcohol in the middle of the day. The last notion he
                        would refer to was that alcohol kept out the cold—that a "little nip” was
                        good when going out into cold air, and so forth. In the words of a great
                        authority, alcohol really lowered the temperature of the body by increased
                        loss of beat and to some extent by increased oxidation, and much reduced the
                        power of the body to resist cold. Finally, he would say that the great and
                        laudable ambition of all, and especially of young men, to be "fit” could not
                        possibly be achieved if they took alcohol. It was simply preposterous to
                        suppose that any young healthy person needed any alcohol whatever; and,
                        indeed, he was much better without even the smallest amount of it. Having
                        spent the greater part of his life operating, he would say, with Six James
                        Paget, that of all people those he dreaded to operate on were the drinkers.
                        He hoped that what he had said would help his bearers to answer such
                        absolute fallacies as "a glass of port can do you no harm."</p>
                    <p>Mr. W. Joynson-Hicks afterwards spoke on the economic aspects of the
                        temperance question, and Canon Horsley on the spiritual side of the work.

                        <p>To the editor of the Egyptian Gazette</p>
                        <p>Dear Sir,—I should be glad to know through the medium of your paper what
                            is the obejection on the part of the Municipality to the forming of a
                            good driving road round the eastern harbour. In civilised countries the
                            roads are made first and then houses. The rule hitherto in Egypt
                            generally has been the contrary. Property at once goes up in value when
                            good roads have been made. The plans for the building allotments, I
                            hear, are all drawn up and to be seen at the Municipality, and I
                            therefore suggest that the esplanade should be taken in hand at once to
                            enable people at any rate to drive round to Ras-el-Tin by an airy and
                            pleasant route instead of through the smelly slum which up to now has
                            been the only way for Ministers attending Councils at the Palace,
                            Consuls paying official calls on board men-of-war, and for all those who
                            attend receptions at Ras-el-Tin (to say nothing of the frequenters of
                            the Yacht Club), to arrive at their destination. In the name of
                            commonsense let us have the enjoyment of this new outlet after all the
                            public money that has been spent on improvements which may be carried
                            out when the mish-mish are ripe, and most of us dead and buried. As I
                            said above in Europe roads come before houses.—Faithfully yours, Common
                            Sense.</p>

                        <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette: Sir I beg to call your attention
                            to the extreme carelessness of the man employed at the level crossing on
                            the Pyramids road. On several occasions, notwithstanding the new
                            regulating bell, which announces the approach of the train, the gates
                            have barely been closed before the train rushed past To- day (May 20)
                            about 5.30, if it had not been for the intelligence of a small child,
                            who woke the sleeping attendant, the train would have passed the
                            crossing at full speed with all the gates wide open! As it was there was
                            only time to close one pair of gates. It is hardly necessary to point
                            out how serious a danger this is to the public on such a frequented road
                            as that of the Pyramids.</p>
                        <p>I may also state that the driver of the passenger train failed to sound
                            the whistle, which he should do according to the rules, on nearing a
                            level crossing. I enclose my card, and remain, Sir, etc., Pro Bono

                    <head>THE HASHISH TRAFFIC.</head>
                    <head>THE EGYPTO-HELLENIC CONVENTION</head>
                    <p>The negotiations in regard to the terms of the new commercial convention
                        between Egypt and Greece have not yet armed at any definite hasis. The
                        Egyptian Government insists on the prohibition of hashish cultivation in
                        Greece, but the Hellenic Government demurs to this concession, as the
                        cultivation of hashish is one of the thief resources of the central plateau
                        of the Peloponnesus. The attitude of the Egyptian Government in this matter
                        is alluded to in the following terms in Lord Cromer's Report:-</p>
                    <p>In the course of last year, the Egyptian Government denounced tho Commercial
                        Convention with Greece. The terms of a new Convention are now under
                        discussion. It is of great importance in Egyptian interests that the
                        importation of hashish should be stopped, and also that greater facilities
                        should be accorded to the police to deal with smugglers and keepers of
                        disorderly houses, of whom a large number are Greek subjects.</p>
                    <p>The "Messager d'Athenes" remarks as follows:-</p>
                    <p>(XXXXX) parait que le gouvernement bellenique pourrait tout au plus prendre
                        l'engagement de restreindre la culture de cette plante que l'on introduit en

                    <p>The spread of hashish smoking among the inhabitants of Athens and the Piraeus
                        must sooner or later force the Hellenic Government in the interests of its
                        own people to come round to the standpoint of the Egyptian Government. In
                        regard to the baneful effects of the drug, it is worth noting that the
                        number of persons, whose insanity is due to the use of hashish, admitted to
                        the lunatic asylum at Abbassieh, has been steadily decreasing ol late years.
                        In 1897, these constituded 33 per cent. Of the total number of male
                        patients. In 1904, out of 350 male patients, only 53, or about 15 per cent,
                        were insane owing to the use of hashish. But these figures cannot be
                        considered as conclusive evidence that the use of hashish is decreasing. The
                        diminution may tie, and perhaps is, due to the fact that, by reason of the
                        very limited accommodation available at the asylum, instructions have been
                        issued to the local doctors only to send the worst cases to Abbassieh. Thus,
                        out of 208 cases of insanity from all causes, admitted into the Alexandria
                        Hospital during the past year, only 37 were sent to Abbassieh. The campaign
                        against the use of the drug continues, but, except in, so far as its result
                        is to raise the price, which is now as high as 50 fr. a kilog., it cannot be
                        said to be very successful. There is a considerable demand for the drug. The
                        individual consumer is not very greatly affected by the rise in price. A
                        large number of low class Europeans and Egyptians find the wholesale and
                        retail trade very lucrative. The Coastguard, Customs, and Police seized
                        21,369 kilog. of hashish in the course of last year. This was about 3,000
                        kilog. less than in 1903. The diminution is mainly due to the fact that
                        formerly the greater portion of the hashish brought into Egypt came from
                        Tripoli along the coast to Alexandria. It is now landed in Tripoli, thence
                        carried south to the Oasis of Baharieh siid Dakhleh, and so into Egypt. The
                        change of route enhances the difficulty of capture. The case is, in many
                        respects, the same as that of the Slave Trade. So long as the demand and the
                        supply exist, it is almost impossible to prevent evasions of the law; no
                        sooner is one route closed to the smuggler, than another is opened up. The
                        difficulties of the Coastguard and the Customs with regard to the smugglers,
                        and those of the police with regard to retailers and consumers, are obvious.
                        It is difficult to do very much more than we already do in Egypt What is
                        wanted is that Greece should prohibit die cultivation of hashish. In this,
                        as in some other instances, the regime of the Capitulations tends to the
                        demoralisation of the country. At the same time, a'recent change in the law,

                    <head>A STATUETTE OF ISIS.</head>
                    <p>For the purpose of its being included in the Corpus of Semitic Inscriptions,
                        M. Gaston Maspero forwarded to Paris a photograph of a statuette of Isis
                        having a Phoenician inscription. The figure is of the ordinary Egyptian type
                        of the goddess, with the infant Horus upon her lap, and it may be seen by
                        visitors to the Cairo Museum. The Phoenician text, as read by M. Clermont
                        Gannesu, is as follows "Gertsaphon son of 'Azer, son of Chalcat...to his
                        mistress Achtoret” The text proves that the donor of the statuette
                        identified Isis with the Syrian Achtoret, whom we know, on the other side,
                        was closely connected with the Bsbylonian Ishtar. The style of the statuette
                        and paleographical character of the inscription indicate early in the 4th
                        century B.C. as the date of its manufacture.</p>

                    <head>OFFICIALS' INDEBTEDNESS.</head>
                    <p>A correspondent writes —Although repeated references to the present trade
                        crisis have not, so far as I know, led to a formal Government enquiry, they
                        appear to have caused, many independent enquiries to be made, and from a
                        number of communications received I gather that the present “trade financial
                        crisis" is to a great extent caused by the evil efforts or traders of a
                        Khedivial decree promulgated during the last Ministry of Riaz Pasha, with
                        the approval of Lord Cromer, depriving creditors of the right established by
                        the laws of the country (and very freely used up till then) to lay or levy
                        claims for debts against the salary of any employe of the Egyptian
                        Government.</p>
                    <p>When this decree became law the indebtedness to local tradespeople of
                        Government employes was very considerable, and it kept on increasing, until
                        it now amoun's to a sum estimated at over a million sterling. The trader, on
                        the one hand, being able to take any step with a view to its recovery, the
                        Government employs, on the other, feels perfectly secure from oven the risk
                        of his indebtedness becoming known to his chief. It is from the date of this
                        decree that traders have found it necessary to demand the long credits for
                        which Egypt has now become famous in the manufacturing centres of
                        Europe.</p>
                    <p>It causes no little surprise in commercial circles that Lord Cromer should
                        hare given his approval to such a law—knowing as he must how it was likely
                        to be abused in a country like this—more especially at the present moment,
                        when he recommends a revision of the Capitulations, while he keeps in force
                        a decree which, to say the least of it, affords undue protection to the
                        Government employe, as it protects him from the usual liability to be called
                        upon to pay his just debts, etc. For full evidence of its evil effects on
                        traders we have only to refer to the official daily records of the Mixed
                        Tribunals, where failures are the order of the day.</p>

                    <head>THE MAID OF HONOR</head>
                    <head>A PLEASANT GLIMPSE OF QUEEN ALEXANDRA.</head>
                    <p>The Court lady of old days, says Lady Violet Greville, in the "New York
                        Tribune," was merely a superior kind of servant ; the Maid of Honor of
                        to-day is a charming, accomplished girl whose duty is to make herself
                        pleasant to the guests and talk agreeably to the important personages who
                        may be visiting at the castle. She should be a good linguist, have read the
                        most talked-of books of the day, and possess musical tastes. She is expected
                        to take a hand at bridge, if required to make up a rubber ; but she must not
                        play for money, as the Queen disapproves of girls gambling or playing for
                        larger stakes than they can well afford. Smoking cigarettes, too, which is
                        such a modern craze, is discountenanced by the Queen.</p>
                    <p>The life of a Maid of Honor is an interesting one: she is brought in contact
                        with all sorts of illustrious people ; she constahtly meets celebrities; she
                        hears talk on all kinds of subjects ; she receives in fact a most
                        cosmopolitan education—the education that makes a wise woman of the world.
                        She learns tact, sense, courtesy, and becomes infinitely adaptable. Court
                        life being so much simpler than in the past, it also has become more human
                        and more real. Much precious time no longer is wasted in idle etiquette or
                        the trivial gossip and petty jangling and scandal mongering of a superior
                        housekeeper’s room, of which we get such vivid glimpses in the d’Arblay
                        Memoirs.</p>
                    <p>A delightful story is told of Queen Alexandra, which exhibits the pleasant
                        relations existing between her and her Maids of Honor. On one occasion one
                        of the young women arrived at the castle minus her luggage, and quietly
                        informed her Majesty of the fact. The Queen, instead of reproving her for
                        carelessness, merely remarked : “My dear child, how did you manage it? I
                        never lose mine."</p>

                    <head>AUSTRIA AND MONTENEGRO.</head>
                    <p>It is significant of the armed neutrality which has existed between
                        Montenegro and Austria- Hungary since the occupation of Bosnia and
                        Herzegovina by the latter after the Berlin Congress, that no treaty of
                        commerce has ever been drawn up between the two countries. This is owing to
                        no backwardness on the part of Montenegro, for as soon as his State was
                        actually independent of Turkish control Prince Nicolas made a point of
                        entering into treaties with the Powers of Europe, and that between Great
                        Britain and Montenegro was drawn up as far back as 1881. At present, Mr.
                        Moisanovich, the Montenegrin Minister of Finance, is in Vienna, negotiating
                        with Herr Call, the Austrian Minister of Commerce, on the subject of the
                        conclusion of a treaty. The want of a commercial convention is very
                        prejudicial to the little mountain principality, as its goods are very
                        heavily taxed by the Austro-Hungarian Custom House. But, on the other hand,
                        the present position of affairs gives rise to an immense amount of smuggling
                        across the frontier, with the result that “untoward incidents" are always
                        owning between the smugglers and the Austrian Custom House guards. The
                        frontier is an extremely difficult one to watch, and the Montenegrins are
                        always ready for a fight. The consequence is that however friendly Vienna
                        and Cettigne may be, relations on the border are very strained. But a
                        commercial treaty will do away with the tension which at present exists.</p>

                        cottage hospital or nursing home at Alexandria, special interest is attached
                        to the report on the work of the Deaconesses’ Hospital in our city for the
                        year 1904, which has just been issued. The committee, in their report, state
                        that last year they were preoccupied with the question of removing the
                        hospital to another site. The necessity for this imposed itself on them
                        owing to the fact that the lands contiguous to the hospital are now covered
                        with houses inhabited by a very dense population. Again, the removal of the
                        isolation ward for contagious diseases had become an urgent matter. It not
                        haying been found suitable to build on the only piece of vacant ground in
                        the immediate vicinity, the committee decided to dispose of the present site
                        and acquire another, of a more suitable character. They selected a large
                        piece of ground at Hadra, opposite the new prison, and favorable terms
                        having been obtained from the Government, the purchase was concluded. As
                        soon as a satisfactory offer can be obtained for the actual site of the
                        hospital, the construction of the new building will be begun. In the
                        meantime, several improvements and additions have been made to the present
                        premises to meet urgent requirements. It is very regrettable, however, say
                        the committee, that in making the now operating-theatres, the major portion
                        of the rooms formerly need as a polyclinique had to be taken, and the latter
                        was consequently closed. Statistics showed that 9,627 patients only were
                        treated in the polyclinique in 1904, as against 24,562 in 1903. To allow of
                        this work—which is of great benefit, especially to the native
                        population-being carried on, therefore, a kiosk was erected in the
                        north-east corner of the garden. For some time past, the report continues,
                        the necessity has been felt of cresting another isolation ward for serious
                        contagious maladies, such as smallpox, etc., and it was decided to establish
                        this ward as conveniently as possible.</p>
                    <p>Coming to the statistical portion of the report, we find that during last
                        year, 1,606 patients (including 91 remaining over from the previous year)
                        were treated in the hospital. This was the largest number on record, the
                        next highest figure being reached in 1903, when 1,624 patients received
                        treatment. Of the total last year, 1,177 were men (170 of them Bailors), 346
                        women, and 83 children. 1,191 left the hospital cured, 178 got better, 70
                        were discharged as incurable, and 73 died, leaving 94 under treatment at
                        December 31. Classed according to their religious beliefs, 266 were
                        Protestants, 264 Roman Catholics, 3 Greek Catholics, 79 Greek Orthodox, 51
                        Copts, 63 Armenian Orthodox, 17 Maronites, 36 Jews, 836 Moslems, and 1
                        Theosophite. These represented no less than 21 different nationalities.
                        Among Europeans, the British predominated, there having been 195 British
                        subjects in hospital during the year (128 are classed as “English" and 72
                        from British possessions). The next largest number of Europeans treated were
                        Germans, viz., 115. Of Americans there were 12. On an average, 94 beds were
                        oocupied per day during the year. 45 patients occupied first-class rooms,
                        270 were in the second-class, and 1,291 in the wards. Only three Englishmen
                        were treated gratuitously during the year, while 49 Germans received free
                        treatment.</p>
                    <p>The receipts of the hospital during 1904 amounted to P.T. 120,429 and the
                        expendi- ture P.T. 339,671. The rooeipts included a subvention from the
                        British Government (for 1903) of P.T. 4,875, from the German Government of
                        P.T. 2,925, from the Swiss Government of P.T. 775, and from the Alexandria
                        Municipality of P.T. 5,000. The subscriptions amounted to £194. A large
                        number of gifts were received during the year, including one of a complete
                        Routgen Ray apparatus from Mrs. Bindernagel.</p>

                        <p>Reports from various parts of the Island show that considerable damage
                            was done to crops by the severe hailstorms at the end of April. The
                            barley suffered perhaps the most, but oats, vines, potatoes, and certain
                            fruit trees were also injured to some extent. The weather for the last
                            week has been hot, though not unpleasantly so.</p>

                        <p>It is believed that several Anglo Egyptum officials and their familiar
                            contemplate visiting Mt. Troodos during the summer-season. It is
                            certainly a delightful and most healthy place during the hot months. It
                            is, however, very necessary that intending visitors should make their
                            arrangements beforehand as to camping, as the accommodation is very
                            limited and the only “huts", are allotted to Cyprus Government
                            officials. A small hotel was opened last year by Mr. Selim Houry, of
                            Limassol, and I believe that one is to be started this year by Mr.
                            Majous Houry, of Limassol. There has been a rather larger number of
                            visitors to the Island than usual during the winter, and several intend
                            remaining until the autumn.</p>

                    <p>HALL’S SANITARY WASHABLE DISTEMPER is rapidly superseding wall papers in all
                        tastefully furnished homes. It is made in 70 artistic tints, and only
                        requires the addition of water to make it ready for use. It is quickly and
                        easily applied with a whitewash brush, with half the labour and at one third
                        the cost of paint. HALL’S DISTEMPER ensures cleanliness, and is pleasing to

                        pleasing colours, great weather-resisting and germ-destroying properties, it
                        lends itself to every kind of wall, wood, brick or stone coating, possessing

                    <head>JEROME HART IN THE SAN FRANCISCO "ARGONAUT"</head>
                    <p>The newspapers of Egypt are not very daring sheets. Possibly their birth and
                        growth may have something to do with this timidity. Most American
                        newspapers, like Topsy, "jest growed" ; the Egyptian newspapers seem to have
                        been born "brought up by hand.." This winter, the death of Haikalis Pasha,
                        founder of Le Share d' Alexandrie, brought forth is all the papers some
                        columns of reminiscences concerning the deceased editor—all of most kindly
                        nature. They all agreed on one point—that Haikalis Pasha had founded his
                        paper simply and solely because Khedive Ismail paid him for that purpose an
                        annual subsidy of £7,000. There was no savor of satire in the comment— it
                        had perhaps a slight tinge of envy—that was all. It was unite evident that
                        in the opinion of the scribes of Egypt the jingling of the guineas healed
                        the hurt honor of Haikalis Pasha. This subsidy he received for many years.
                        But when the influence of the deposed khedive ceased to have weight Haikalis
                        Pasha was told that he would have to run his paper without a subsidy.
                        Confronted with this dreadful lot—menaced with the terrible task of meeting
                        his expenditures with his receipts— what did Haikalis Pasha do?</p>
                    <p>He ran his paper straight</p>
                    <p>Probably this was the first time it was ever attempted in Egypt. The other
                        papers looked on with awe and admiration. All of the editorial fraternity
                        expressed the highest admiration for his nerve and pluck. One paper said he
                        "lost-several thousand pounds the first year." In fact, all spoke of
                        Haikalis Pasha’s continuing to' run an old-established paper after the
                        cessation of the subsidy in the same tone of admiring deprecation that we in
                        America would adopt in speaking of the demeuted editor; who would attempt to
                        run a religious and temperance daily in any large American city.</p>
                    <p>With these traditions clinging to the Egyptian press, if is easy to
                        understand that the Egyptian editors speak rather guardedly, not only of
                        persons in power, but of the great hotel-keepers and of the rich
                        shop-keepers. Their caution is so extreme, however, that at times it becomes
                        very droll. As I have said, they are cautious even in talking about the
                        weather, that not committal topic so dear to us all ; for in Egypt it is
                        possible for a newspaper to injure itself with the great hotel- keepers and
                        the rich shop-keepers by talking too freely about the weather when it is
                        bad. In Egypt the weather during the past winter has been by no means all
                        that tho tourists' fairly painted it.</p>
                    <p>It is not only concerning subsidies that the Egyptian newspapers, from the
                        American newspaper point of view, seem rather odd. I am speaking only of
                        those printed in English and French; there are many journals printed in
                        Arabic, but I know nothing of them. The newspapers published in European
                        languages are mainly remarkable for excluding anything that could offend
                        anybody. Not only do they taboo the weather, but other topics as well. As
                        they depend largely for their income on the advertisements of a limited
                        number of large hotel companies and business houses, they naturally find it
                        difficult to print any unpleasant news concerning them. Therefore they adopt
                        the simple expedient of printing disagreeable personal news in a cryptic
                        fashion without any names. Here is a sample item :</p>
                    <p>Melancholy Death—Yesterday afternoon a clerk who is very well known, and in
                        the employ, of a prominent merchant, committed suicide in the merchant's
                        office by blowing out his brains with a revolver. His face was much
                        disfigured.</p>
                    <p>Reserve over the peccadilloes of those in high station is, of course, not
                        followed by tho papers in discussing the misdoings of the lowly. But the
                        editorial habit is hard to lay aside and the crim. con. cases of the
                        populace are told with a brevity which is startling. The following
                        paragraphs (grouped under "Tantah Notes") from a Cairo paper are certainly
                        remarkable:</p>
                    <p>"Tantah Notes—At Tantah yesterday, George Kantikopoulos returned home
                        unexpectedly to his wife and her paramour, and chopped both their heads off
                        with an axe.</p>
                    <p>"The Tantah authorities are enforcing the code of contraventions against
                        natives who defile the streets."</p>
                    <p>“After next Wednesday at Tantah ownerless dogs will be shot by the
                        police."</p>
                    <p>The same brevity is extended to items not in the line of conjugal revenge,
                        such as the following:</p>
                    <p>Murder and Robbery- Madame Galli and Madame Benetti were murdered by five
                        ruffians the night before last at Zagazig. The object was plunder. The
                        murderers were arrested.</p>
                    <p>Here is an excellent four-column story for on American daily told in four
                        lines :</p>
                    <p>Girl's Body Found-Yesterday the body of a young native girl, daughter of
                        Hassan Ali, was found floating in the Mahmoudieh Canal. Her parents say it
                        was not suicide, as her rings had been torn from her ears.</p>
                    <p>The arrival of the famous squadron that went around the seas ""'seein'
                        things" was thus briefly chronicled: </p>
                    <p>Russian Fleet- The division of the Baltic fleet: commanded by Admiral
                        Botrovsky arrived at Port Said yesterday afternoon at two-thirty, and leaves
                        this morning.</p>
                    <p>A fire in the largest mercantile house in Egypt is thus set down:</p>
                    <p>Big Fire — The enormous Walker-Meimarachi stores were destroyed by fire
                        yesterday. Two firemen were killed and many injured. Loss £50,000.</p>
                    <p>Imagine an American daily devoting a few lines only to a fatal fire involving
                        the loss of a quarter of a million. Really, Egypt is not the place for-a
                        hustling American city editor to visit. To read such items as these and to
                        think of the columns of "stories" and the acres of pictures they would make
                        in America would drive such an editor into a highly nervous condition.</p>
                    <p>But lot us present a few more of those startling items told in this
                        matter-of-fact way :</p>
                    <p>The Mecca Pilgrims—Over three thousand persons have arrived since Wednesday
                        from Algiers, Morocco, and Stamboul, en route to Mecca. Near Djeddah the
                        last lot of pilgrims found a formidable force of Bedouins awaiting them for
                        plundor. After the fight the pilgrims withdrew, leaving fifty-two of their
                        number dead on the field.</p>
                    <p>This mild paragraph is calculated to give travellers pause. </p>
                    <p>Annoyances of Tourists.—A party of twenty tourists went to Sakkara on Monday.
                        The guardian of the rains refused to recognise their tickets of admission. A
                        heated debate followed, which was adjourned to Marietta's house. No
                        satisfaction followed. On emerging the tourists found a-horde of threatening
                        Arabs waiting. Their donkey and camel drivers remained neutral, and the
                        tourists fled amid a shower of stones. Some were seriously injured. The
                        tourists were much annoyed.</p>
                    <p>Here is another ill-mated husband who settles disputes with murder:</p>
                    <p>Killed His Wife—A public scrivener, a native, living at Gabbari, had a
                        conjugal discussion with his wife which ended by his striking her over the
                        head with an iron bar, killing her instantly. He fled and has not been
                        arrested.</p>
                    <p>The incidental way in which the robbery of $ 40,000 is just alluded to at the
                        end of this paragraph is altogether delicious :</p>
                    <p>‘The Mahmal (Holy Carpet) sailed from Suez this afternoon for Jeddah on its
                        way to Mecca. </p>
                    <p>"A theft of £8,000 took place from the Mahmal train at Abassieh. All search
                        for the culprits lias proved 'fruitless.'"</p>
                    <p>By committing suicide this young gentleman may have saved himself from
                        committing uxoricide :</p>
                    <p>Suicide—A young native gentleman of Cairo committed suicide yesterday in
                        order to avoid contracting a marriage which his family were bent upon.</p>
                    <p>This paragraph is not without singular phases :</p>
                    <p>Tailors Attack Cafe—Yesterday three British tailors; refused to pay their
                        bill for wine and beer at the Cafe du Phare, Alexandria. When Cesare
                        Giolotti, the cafe-keeper, attempted to force them they assaulted him, and
                        his Arab waiters, beat them severely, smashed chairs and tables, and wrecked
                        the cafe. They then fled, pursued by the police, but reached the quay, and
                        before they could be arrested the three tailors reached their ship, which
                        was just leaving.</p>
                    <p>I had never associated such wild and reckless brawling with the manners of
                        the gentlemen who wield the shears and goose. Therefore it was with a
                        distinct shock that I read of some tailors—even British tailors —cleaning
                        out a cafe and beating the waiters. I could readily understand it if done by
                        British lords or British navvies. But British tailors! —it seemed
                        incredible. Only the close of the item made me comprehend it—the tailors
                        were sailors.</p>
                    <p>During the winter just past items like this were by no means rare in the
                        Cairo papers: </p>
                    <p>Burned to Death—Yesterday a native, Hassan Yussuf was warming himself at a
                        small fire he had made in the street, when his clothing caught fire, and,
                        despite his frantic screams, he was burned to death.</p>
                    <p>That it should be so cold in Cairo as to cause the natives to make fires in
                        the street may surprise many. It is a very common belief that the Egyptian
                        winter is always hot. True, it is often hot during the winter in Lower
                        Egypt, but it is also frequently cold, and sometimes bitterly cold. The wise
                        traveller takes with him at all times and everywhere, in summer and in
                        winter, both light and heavy clothing. He will find use for both during the
                        Egyptian winter. </p>
                    <p>The first time I visited. Egypt I shared the common delusion concerning the
                        Egyptian- winter climate; when we went ashore at Alexandria I put on the
                        thinnest garments I had, and took with me a palm-loaf fan and a Panama straw
                        hat. At the last moment some faint gleam of lucidity pierced my darkened
                        brain, and I took with me a railway rag. This, however, was scarcely
                        reasoning—it was probably automatic : "Rail-rug ; rug-rail ; going rail—take
                        rug." It was fortunate for me that I did so, for I verily believe that
                        without it I would have frozen to death between Alexandria and Cairo. Lest
                        that be considered exaggeration, let me add that this winter a train broke
                        down between Alexandria and Cairo ; that no relief train was sent out; that
                        the passengers speedily hired all the spare blankets in the sleeping-car;
                        that the price rose from ten piastres to one hundred piastres per blanket;
                        and that when morning brought a train along two or three of the richest men
                        were wrapped in all of the blankets, and the remainder of the passengers had
                        to be thawed out by exhaust steam from the engine. Seriously, the poor
                        wretches when found were stiff with cold and many of them were made
                        seriously ill.</p>

                    <head>THE CHEMIST IN CAIRO.</head>
                    <head>BY HORACE WYNDHAM. </head>
                    <p>The Arabic word for chemist is "hakim," although it is more generally applied
                        to a doctor. The vocation is in Egypt one of considerable antiquity. It
                        dates, indeed, from Biblical times, as is proved by hieroglyphics that have
                        been discovered showing the practitioners at work. Those early chemists,
                        however, were very much what we should nowadays term herbalists, and
                        combined doctoring with drag dealing. Every tribe had its own "hakim," the
                        calling being handed down from father to son, much as is the case in India
                        to the present day. The methods employed by their descendants remain almost
                        identical with those first adopted, and as a natural consequence, they are
                        scarcely up to date. Among the European chemists, however, doing business in
                        such large centres as Cairo, Alexandria; Port Said, Suez, etc., there is not
                        much to complain of on this account, for the great majority of the
                        practitioners at these places are fully qualified men. Many of them hold
                        London diplomas, while others havo French, German, or Italian ones. The
                        native houses, too, are (with certain exceptions) well conducted.</p>
                    <p>The European chemists in Cairo are of all nationalities, English, French,
                        German, and Italian predominating. There are also a few Levantines chiefly
                        Turks and Greeks - engaged in the business. These latter, however, minister
                        for the most part to the requirements of the native population, and have
                        their premines in the Muski (or Arab) quarter. This is an overcrowded and
                        evil-smelling district in the eastern part of the town. It is a good trade
                        centre, however, as, on account of the numerous mosques, bazaars, and
                        curiosity shops contained within its boundaries, it is much resorted to by
                        sight-seeing tourists.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the best class of chemists’ establishments—i.e., those kept by
                        Europeans —nearly all are to be found in the vicinity of the Esbekieh
                        Gardens. They are situated either in the Sharia Kamel Pasha, or the Place de
                        l'Opera-- the chief commercial quarters of Cairo. The principal among them
                        are the New English Dispensary, the Anglo-American Pharmacy, and the London
                        Pharmacy. In the pages of the plain spoken "Boedeker" attention is drawn to
                        the high charges that most of them impose. This complaint is a well-founded
                        one, for the scale is in many cases quite excessive. With regard to
                        proprietary articles this is especially marked. A shilling, for example, is
                        quite a common price to demand for a sixpenny cake of Pears' soap ; while
                        pills and tooth powders are all sold at something like 90 per cent above
                        their face values. There is no real reason for this, as the import duties
                        are quite trifling. A little healthy competition is badly wanted. It would
                        also be good for trade generally, since the host of invalids who flock into
                        Egypt every winter are in the habit of bringing supplies of medicine with
                        them. If they could depend on obtaining what they required at a moderate
                        cost, however, they would undoubtedly patronise the local firms to a greater
                        extent than they seem inclined to do at present.</p>
                    <p>A good many of the Chemists in Cairo do a brisk business in the sale of
                        photographic goods and the preparation of amateurs' negatives. Every tourist
                        includes, as a matter of course, a camera among his equipment, and is not
                        happy until he has snap-shotted the Pyramids and the Sphinx. These works of
                        art then have to be developed, and the chemist who is not above doing such
                        work finds it highly remunerative. As the customary charge is something like
                        a shilling per film this is not to be wondered at. Another source of profit
                        is derived from the sale of cameras and accessories. Here, again, rates rule
                        very high. The theory that these goods are sold at the same price all over
                        the world does not apply to Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As in many places abroad, dentistry is often combined with drug selling in
                        Cairo ; at any rate, among the natives. "First-class toothpulling," indeed,
                        is quite a common inscription to find in the shop windows of the Egyptian
                        chemists. Others add dispensing, and also do a little in the way of giving
                        medical advice. Their customers, however, are for the most part drawn from
                        among the Arab residents, as the average European wisely prefers to consult
                        a properly qualified doctor when he is ill. The European chemists do very
                        little advertising, beyond sending out circular letters and price-lists at
                        regular intervals to everyone included in the official directory, and also
                        to the different hotel-managers. The greater part of their business comes to
                        them direct from the local doctors. Of those there are a good number in
                        Cairo and the vicinity, for the host of invalids who winter in the Egyptian
                        capital give the medical fraternity plenty of employment. The chief demand
                        is for tonics and drags calculated to build up the system, while pyretic
                        saline and disinfectant powders are also asked for during the hot weather.
                        There is not much sale for cough-mixtures, as the usual prescription in
                        cases of pulmonary affections is the simple one of open air. If only the
                        Cairo chemist could bottle this up and sell it by the ounce he would
                        speedily realise a fortune!</p>
                    <p>A line in which a good deal of remunerative business is done by the European
                        firms is that of toilet preparations and j-perfumery. There is always a
                        large and steady demand for these, as lady-visitors find that the strong sun
                        even in December and January, plays havoc with their complexions. On the
                        occasion of a ball at the British Agency, or a big reception at the
                        Khedivial Palace, a tremendous demand arises for pearl powder. In connection
                        with this it is reported that on one occasion, when an important social
                        function was about to take place, a certain astute house created a "corner
                        in this commodity, with the result that it went up to famine price. In vain
                        were heartrending appeals made for even the smallest supply at the old rate;
                        the holder of the stock was deaf to both entreaty and reproach alike. He did
                        not do himself much good, however, by his perverseness, for a rival firm
                        telephoned to Alexandria in time to get enough to satisfy the market. What
                        threatened to develop into a serious crisis was thus happily averted.</p>
                    <p>Another profitable line is that of supplying medicine chests for
                        shooting-parties who intend visiting the interior, or for tourists
                        contemplating a voyage in a Nile boat. As expeditions of this sort mean
                        travelling to places remote from chemists’ establishment, the possession of
                        a stock of drugs beforehand is necessary. The most popular are those put up
                        in tabloid form, and the experienced tourist never dreams of being
                        unprovided with a selection of these. With the aid of a simple draught
                        (taken at the right time) an attack of fever which might become serious if
                        neglected can frequently be checked. To have recourse to the "remedies"
                        famished (at exorbitant rates) by the local dragomans (guides) is simply
                        suicidal.</p>
                    <p>The various hospitals in Cairo and the neighbourhood also prove remunerative
                        customers of the leading chemists. During the course of the year three
                        institutions get through a large quantity of drags, as well as surgical
                        appliances. Some of the hospitals are for natives. There is also a big
                        school of medicine in the town where students are trained. This
                        establishment is situated close to a mosque that is famous all over the
                        country as the place in which the "howling Derwishes" go through their weird
                        performances.</p>
                    <p>The Oriental’s innate love of haggling is, perhaps, nowhere more marked than
                        in the shop of a native chemist. It is impossible, indeed, at these places
                        to buy even a piece of sticking-plaster without first entering upon a vast
                        amount of discussion with regard to the price. To the question “Kam?" ("How
                        much?") a figure out of all proportion to the one that will eventually be
                        accepted is demanded. Thereupon the would-be purchaser shrugs his shoulders
                        and prepares to depart. Before he reaches the door, however, he is lured
                        back by the promise to reduce the charge by the fraction of a farthing. An
                        amount of bargaining then ensues that would make an Englishman think that
                        the purchase of the entire shop was being discussed. In the end the
                        proprietor—calling on Allah and the Beard of the Prophet to witness that he
                        is robbing his wife and family—names a sum that is paid with many protests
                        by the customer. Even then, however, the question of “backsheeh" has to be
                        settled. This is usually not by paying for a cup of coffee. With its
                        consumption peace and goodwill are once more restored.</p>
                    <p>In their anxiety to secure British patrons some of the native chemists avail
                        themselves of the services of touts. Those men (low class Arabs for the most
                        part) haunt the vicinity of the big hotels resorted to by tourists, and
                        poster the travellers with offers of guidance to the establishments of their
                        employers. At times they scarcely hesitate to drag them off by main force,
                        while at others, on pretence of conducting them to a mosque, they lead them
                        in triumph to the drug shop which they represent. If no purchase is effected
                        here they become abusive. The mention of the word policeman, however,
                        speedily reduces them to politeness again, for the average native has a
                        wholesome respect for the Cairo police. Of course, the best class of native
                        chemists do not descend to these manceuvres at all, while the European ones
                        conduct their businesses with proper regard for dignity. They reap the
                        reward of this, first, in the building up of a remunerative trade, and,
                        secondly, in the establishing of pleasant relations between themselves and
                        their customers.</p>
