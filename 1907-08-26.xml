                    <p>SOUTH AFRICAN LOYALTY</p>
                    <p>Loyalty to the Crown is happily an axiom in all parts of the Empire. The
                        subjects of the King, in whatever quarter of the world they may be, and
                        however diverse their sentiment in other respects, are at least united in
                        the respect they pay to the supreme head of all. They consider it
                        unnecessary to mark their loyalty by effusive gifts : they would hold it
                        absurd to suspect that loyalty was lacking or lukewarm in the absence of
                        such gifts. And the older States of the Empire have extended the same
                        feeling of confidence to the newest addition to them all : General Botha and
                        his Cabinet have taken the oath of fealty as His Majesty's Ministers; we
                        look on our Boer fellow-subjects in the same way as upon the
                        French-Canadians, as foreigners by race, but as British as we ourselves in
                        honourable allegiance. That being so —and General Botha during his late
                        visit to England was careful to emphasize his loyalty on several occasions—
                        it may perhaps be regarded as a work of supererogation on the part of the
                        Transvaal Government says the "Globe" to propose to present the great
                        Cullinan diamond to the King. That its eventual destination should be the
                        British Crown, side by side with the Koh-i-Noor and the other precious gems
                        of the Imperial diadem, few would be found to question. But that the present
                        moment should have been chosen for the gift seems inadvisable. Such a gift,
                        to be acceptable, should be the unanimous act of the whole Transvaal
                        Legislature; as it is, the Pro gressive party will be forced to oppose a
                        suggestion that looks extravagant at a time when the Colony is in a state of
                        not too great prosperity and industrial stability. If the Progressives
                        refuse to vote for the acquisition and presentation of the Cullinan diamond,
                        their action may be misunderstood in some quarters. It will certainly be
                        assailed in others. More especially will it be the subject of vituperation
                        in those Radical circles in Great Britain which find pleasure in distorting
                        every motive of their fellow countrymen in South Africa, and in uttering
                        hysterical glorifications of every Boer leader. Yet we have no doubt that
                        their action is dictated by motives of sincerity, and not by any factious
                        desire, the truest loyalty to the King lies in forwarding the prosperity of
                        his dominions, and not in spending hundreds of thousands that cannot be
                        afforded. The Crown's most resplendent Oriental jewel is not the Koh-i-Noor,
                        but the work of the British Raj in India: a far finer gift from South Africa
                        than the Cullinan diamond would be the news that the sub-continent stood at
                        last on as firm a foundation as the other self-governing States of the
                        Empire, and that it was developing as rapidly and as peacefully as they. In
                        considering the question we must remember that the finances of the Transvaal
                        are in such a condition that the British Government have had to guarantee it
                        a loan of five millions sterling, and that therefore the precious gift will,
                        in sense, be purchased with our own money ; and that this extravagance will
                        lead to enforced administrative economies which will necessitate the
                        retirement of a large number of Englishmen from the public service of the
                        colony. The period of tension through which South Africa as a whole is
                        passing has been strikingly proved daring the last fortnight. The Budget of
                        Cape Colony, introduced at Cape Town on Monday last, showed a deficit of
                        £640,455. The revenue has fallen from £11,250,000 to £7,000,000 in four
                        years. And next year, in spite of additions to the Income-Tax and other
                        revisions and economies, a deficit of nearly £300,000 is anticipated. Natal
                        is still feeling the cost of the native disturbances early last year. The
                        Orange River Colony, as a purely agricultural State, has indeed no pressing
                        problems, either financial or economic, to face ; but the railway difficulty
                        affects it as well as the other provinces. And the shifts to which the
                        Transvaal is reduced by its enforced gratitude to the British Government and
                        the consequent necessity for interference with the supply of coolie labour,
                        is sufficiently indicated by its abortive Liquor and Native Administration
                        Bills. In these diffioult circumstances, to refrain from extravagances of
                        any kind is the first duty of all the Governments concerned. After a few
                        years of economical administration and political quiet, federation would be
                        not merely a local aspiration or a states man's dream: it would be an
                        accomplished fact. When that time comes, a symbolic gift to the Crown would
                        be a graceful act : at present, it is unfortanately open to
                        misconstruction.</p>

                            prices. The chief cause of the decline has been the unsettled state of

                            reports, principally from Texas, where the drought had caused so much

                    <p>To the Editor of the "Egyptian Gazette"</p>
                    <p>Dear Sir,—I wonder how many sports men witnessed the racing between the four
                        Rowing Clubs of Alexandria yesterday in the harbour without being amused at
                        the farce the same represented. Of the four races two were "row-overs"; and
                        in the other two fouls occurred and nobody knew who was the winner. There
                        was apparent ly no umpire but a sort of Committee launch which also acted as
                        starter. At the end of each race this launch was besieged by some of the
                        competitors and their compatriots, and it appeared to an onlooker that the
                        one who shouted the loudest won the race. This was particularly the case
                        after the sculling race when one gentleman went along side the launch in a
                        boat specially to fight the cause of his man. Why was there no independent
                        umpire who should have been in a launch of this own and whose decision
                        should be absolutely final? Apparently these things are not understood here
                        like they are in Europe. <lb/>Yours truly, <lb/>Britisher. <lb/>Alexandria,

                            on all hands that it requir es many years of careful and patient study

                            General Assembly at its recent meeting, and which appear to us to be of

                    <p>From a racing point of view there was no cause for grumbling at Saturday's
                        August Skye Meeting, but it is a pity these enjoyable "off season"
                        gatherings are not more numerously attended. It gives the organisers no en
                        couragement to increase the number of meet ings, which the majority of
                        race-goers would no doubt appreciate. Amongst those present on Saturday no
                        lack of enthusiasm was shown, and in spite of a couple of runaway wins by
                        Kara Aslan, and the consistent Radium, the rest of the programme produced
                        some interest ing and keen sport. An excellent selection of music was
                        performed by the Band of the Royal Dublin Fusiliers under the conductorship
                        of Bandmaster A. Fawcett and it was with a feeling of regret, as one heard
                        the strains of the National Anthem, to think that another month would elapse
                        ere such an enjoyable atternoon would be repeated.</p>

                    <p>According to the statistical return of pupils attending public and private
                        schools in Egypt issued by the statistical department of the Ministry of
                        Finance, there were in 1906 throughout Egypt 505 schools with 92,107 pupils,
                        71,666 of which were males and 20,441 females. Of these 505 schools 200 were

                        <p>Attached to the 200 Egyptian schools of Egypt there were 2,355teachers
                            for 51,431 pupils of which 49,877 were Egyptians, and of the 305 foreign
                            schools there were 1,986 teachers for 40,676 pupils, of which 20,578
                            were Egyptians. It will thus be seen that although there were 105 more
                            foreign than Egyptian schools, the number of teachers attached to the
                            latter exceeded the former by 369, and it is also notable that more than
                            half the pupils of the foreign institations were Egyptians.</p>

                            noticeable. The number of foreigners receiving instruction in Egyptian

                        <p>Of the total of 70,455 Egyptian pupils 914 were under five years, 2,695

                            to twenty, and 63 about twenty years. The fall in the number of pupils
                            between 15 to 18 years of age is somewhat remarkable, but can doubtless
                            be accounted for by the number who are sent to Europe to complete their

                            was, of course, Al Azhar University, the date of which is given as 972,
                            and the next founded school which still exists was the Cairo Medical
                            School, which dates back to 1824, after which came the Kalusdian School
                            of the Orthodox Armenian Patriarchate in 1828. Since 1880 forty-one
                            Egyptian educational in stitutions have been founded in Cairo 14 of
                            which are private Musulman schools, and 11 of which depend upon the
                            Egyptian Govern ment. Of the nine English institutions in Cairo five
                            depend upon the Church Missionary Society, the first of which was
                            founded in 1884. The American Mission founded a boys' school in Cairo in
                            1854 and a girls' school in 1856, Of the seven English educational
                            institutions in Alexandria four depend upon the Church of Scottand
                            Mission, and were all founded in 1860, one upon the Egypt General
                            Mission, one upon the Maltese Benevolent Society and one, Victoria
                            College, is private.</p>

                            17 were preparatory, 166 primary, and 27 secondary. Of these 210 pupils
                            72 were Egyptians, 15 English, 7 Austrian, 5 French, 1 German, 25 Greek,
                            and 58 Italian. Seventy- six pupils of the college were Jews, 55 Musul

                    <head>A EUROPEAN "RAG."<lb/>A DISGRACEFUL EXHIBITION</head>
                    <p>Consequent to the regatta of yesterday held by the four rowing clubs of
                        Alexandria, some forty or fifty members thereof decided to pass the evening
                        by indulging in a "rag", Commencing at the Germania Bar, where they
                        comported themselves with perfect repectability, they consumed a quantity of
                        beer which must have been gratifying to the heart of the proprietor.</p>
                    <p>About half past ten, the party proceeded to the Olympia café chantant, where,
                        we are informed by the proprieter, who showed us, the broken property, 6
                        chairs, 1 table in wood and 2 in iron, and 6 glasses were broken while to
                        make matters worse the debanchers forced their way into the music hall
                        without even offering to pay entrance.</p>
                    <p>After leaving the Olympia, which they had taken care to make as objectionable
                        as possible by throwing small blocks of ice, which they carried, on the
                        ground, and from which they had compelled several persons to leave, owing to
                        their rowdiness, the party proceeded to the Tour Eiffel, and enjoyed
                        themselves by extinguishing on route the street lamps and stopping the
                        arabeahs which they met, in order to extinguish theirs'. Opposite the Tour
                        Eiffel a lamp was extinguished by one of the party who, being arrested by a
                        shawish, was promptly rescued by his comrades. At the Tour Eiffel an
                        entrance fee of one piastre tariff per head was offered, and we are not
                        surprised that this was promptly refused. In no way deterred, however, by
                        the refusal, the party charged through the obstructing proprietor and his
                        staff and swarmed into the boxes, from which they took with them six hat
                        racks.</p>
                    <p>It is notable, and altogether foreign to the custom of respectable Europeans,
                        whatever their state of inebriety may be, that though doing considerable
                        harm to both places of entertainment by refusing to pay entrance, stealing
                        the hat racks, and breaking chairs etc., not a single half piastre,
                        according to the information of the proprietors, was expended by the
                        party.</p>
                    <p>From the Tour Eiffel the party proceeded to Walker and Meimarachi's bar,
                        which they passed through almost without halting, and from there a
                        detachment went to the Belle Vue café where they created a great disturbance
                        by shouting and singing. Chairs were broken, the globes of the electric
                        light installation were removed, and the debauchers generally disgusted the
                        public by their uproarious behaviour.</p>
                    <p>Reports of further disgraceful conduct have reached us, but these we refrain
                        from reproducing these as we having been unable to obtain confirmation. The
                        report that we have given above has been confirmed by personal visits to the
                        various scenes of the debauchery, and interviews with the proprietors
                        concerned.</p>
                    <p>The proprietor of the Olympia having warned the police authorities of the
                        scenes which were being enacted, a captain of the police was sent to watch
                        the party and see that no serious harm was done, and from the moment that he
                        arrived he followed their every movement</p>
                    <p>The public, however, is asking why was this "rag" allowed to reach such a
                        stage, and why did the police give such a remarkable exhibition of their
                        feebleness inefficiency by allowing such a disturbance to continue
                        unchecked. Well may our French contemporaries ironically head their articles
                        on the police service "Nos bons chaoniches".</p>
                    <p>The rowing clubs will be interested to learn that the proprietors of the Tour
                        Eiffel and the Olympia music halls have decided to taken action against
                        their committees in the Mixed Tribunals. The proprietor of the former
                        informs us that his claim against the clubs will amount to at least £10,</p>

                    <head>GOMMES ARABIQUES</head>
                    <p>La saison est terminée. Les derniers lots qu'il y avaita Duem étaient plus ou
                        moins endommagés par les pluies et se sont vendus 4 P.T. 83 le cantar de 140
                        rotolis (100 rotolis de gomme équivalent 4 kilos 45). A Omdur- man, on @
                        pratiqué le prix de P.T. 95 le canter de 110 rotolis,pour un ou deux lots
                        senlement, les derniers de la saison. Contrairement aux années précédentes,
                        en pareille saison, il n'y a pas de stock a Omdurman.</p>
                    <p>Cette année-ci, les prix ont eu une tendance presque continuelle 4 la hausse.
                        Ceci est df aux deux causes suivantes:</p>
                    <p>1° La récolte des gommes au Sénégal ayant &amp;éte trés mauvaise, les divers
                        marchés d'Europe n'ont pu s'y approvisionner 4 bon compte et ont df accepter
                        la hausse quien est résaltée au Soudan.</p>
                    <p>2°. Bien que l'année derniére il y ait eu des pluies torrentielles, ce qui
                        prédispose toujours les arbres &amp; produire beaucoup de gomme, les
                        indigénes, natarellement indolents, pour ne pas dige fainéants, ayant.eu une
                        bonne récolte de lear assurant de quoi vivre,ont négligé complétement de
                        recueillir la gomme.</p>
                    <p>C'est ainsi que, bien que les arbres du.Kor- dofan aient donné cet année
                        beaucoup de gommeé d'une qualité exceptionnellement bonne, personne n'a pa
                        en profiter puisqu'elle n'a pas été recueillie.</p>

                    <p>The "Egyptian situation" says "The New York Tribune" is a term which has
                        appeared for the first time in cable dispatches within the last few weeks.
                        No one knows exactly who or what a Pharaoh was, except that one of them had
                        something to do with various plagues brought about by his refusal to follow
                        the advice of the Jewish Moses. A "fellah" is not revised spelling for the
                        "fellow" who lives by agricultural pursuits on land fertilized by the Nile.
                        "Pharaoh" may be taken, however, as the equivalent of the master of the
                        situation, while the "fellah" is the cotton planter, who is becoming
                        increasingly—and unpleasantly—an important power in the financial world. If
                        not as great as the American King Cotton, he holds the next highest
                        rank.</p>
                    <p>When Wall Street shivers because Holland takes $500,000 in double eagles and
                        Berlin obtains $1,000,000 in gold bars, while £500,000 is passing through
                        Vienna on its way to Cairo, paid for by consols at a record low price, and
                        the Continental banks take five-sixths of the weekly output of the Rand
                        mines, and all this happéns in a week, it is evident that Egyptian cotton
                        and its planter and owner are financial factors of great magnitude. The
                        foremost security of the world, the British consol, has been offered for
                        sale, at constantly lowering prices, in millions, from a source variously
                        described as the Caisse (Egyptian Sub-Treasury), the Egyptian government,
                        and the Egyptian banks, which were never hitherto suspected of having a
                        surplus to invest at 8 per cent. There is, therefore, a feeling that, as in
                        the case of the Baring failure, the sales of these consols show that one (or
                        more) of the old conservative banking houses in London is carrying Egyptians
                        at the expense of its English investments,</p>
                    <p>The "fellah" is rapidly becoming a kind of Mahdi or Raisuli. He is raiding
                        the banks all around the world and carrying their reserves to his hoards.
                        The important question now is. What will he do with his next crop? This is
                        interesting St. Petersburg and Yokohama, as well as Boston and
                        Manchester.</p>
                    <p>It is an indisputable fact that for more than a thousand years, from A.D 700
                        to A.D. 1876 more gold and silver went into Egypt than ever came out. The
                        cotton crops of 1860-76 were sold for £530,000,000, and there was no gold
                        worth mentioning retained during that period in the United States. But in
                        1876 Mr. Goschen, M. de Blignieres, Major Baring, R.A. and Rivers Wilson
                        visited Egypt in the interests of the European capitalists. Thenceforth the
                        hoards of both "Pharaoh" and "'fellah" began to be depleted. Gold by the ton
                        and silver in quantity as well as value, at 16 to 1, flowed out to all
                        points of the compass north of the equator.</p>
                    <p>In 1892 there were no more hoards and no more princes. The "fellahah" or
                        peasant girl, wore a brass hangle instead of a silver one. The cotton crop
                        after 1876 was taken to pay interest on debts fabricated to meet the demand,
                        and so far as exchange was concerned it cost Europe nothing. But about ten
                        years ago the tide showed signs of changing, and Pactolus is now running a
                        veritable Colorado River into the Egyptian Salton Sea.</p>
                    <p>The gold arrives at Alexandria and disappears. According to the chairman of
                        the Egyptian Estates Limited, £125,000,000, vanished last year. The Fellah
                        is apparently willing to repeat the operation in the ensuing twelve months.
                        He does not care for paper money, and has no more stomach for "interest
                        bearing securities" than for champagne or bottled beer. So there is "nothing
                        doing" on the Cotton Exchange of Alexandria, and as manufacturers of the
                        world have been accustomed to receive their raw material weekly throughont
                        the: year, there ts not a month's visible supply of this year's crop afloat
                        and in Liverpool.</p>
                    <p>There are also other demands to be met. The "get rich quick" purchaser of
                        suburban property, builders of "Savoy Chambers" and government officials who
                        have taken up land in Egypt borrowed money in Europe, and the local
                        creditors are now pressing for payment. Even the Swiss have invested largely
                        in land which was to have been perennially fertilized by the Assouan
                        reservoir, but is not more productive now than the Rhone glacier. The "men
                        higher up" are to be found at the very summit of social and financial
                        eminence.</p>
                    <p>Egypt is therefore a "creditor nation" entirely apart from the cotton crop,
                        which, it is expected, will equal in weight and value half the copper output
                        of the world and about double the value of the exports of the Standard Oil.
                        There is no corner in cotton to be broken by its own weight, through
                        interest, storage, or carrying over charges. The staple is fairly firm at
                        from 20 to 29 cents a pound, but it sold at 40 cents in 1863, and its
                        present price is altogether normal.</p>
                    <p>The forty thousand holders of Egyptian cotton will be perfectly willing to
                        sell, but they want a commodity in exchange, and that commodity is gold
                        coin. Now, if American bankers send $5,000,000 to Egypt to keep the crop
                        moving it would be good business. It must be remembered that we have an
                        advant age (as well as a danger) in our gold certificates. The Continental
                        banks of issue when they pay gold are paying at least two for one, but our
                        gold secured currency is a warehouse re ceipt for so much minted metal.</p>

                    <head>THE EMPRESS EUGENIE.</head>
                    <p>The personality of the Empress Engénie has long been familiar and sympathetic
                        to English people, both because of her romantic and eventually tragic
                        history, and also because ot her firm friendship with Queen Victoria. But in
                        spite of the eagerness and interest which is still aroused by anything that
                        concerns her recent meeting with the Austrian Emperor and her interest in
                        the young Queen of Spain are but two illustrations—Mr. Philip W. Sergeant
                        has set himself no easy task in attempting to tell the story of her life
                        from such a very short perspective. It is greatly to his credit, therefore,
                        that, while omitting no essential personal details, he has maintained an
                        atmosphere of history throughout his story, and has left it when it became
                        too private and personal for contemporary survey.</p>
                    <p>It is a story which might well tempt every lover of romance. Indeed,
                        superficially it is the veritable fairy-tale, except that it lacks the
                        "happy ever after." The most interesting part of Mr. Sergeant's book is
                        perhaps his account of the Empress's girlhood. The time is far enough away
                        for him to be hampered neither by the inconveniences of truth nor by the
                        lack of perspective, and he has given us a picture which in every way
                        foreshadows the character of the Empress of the French. The friendship of
                        the Countess of Montijo with Mérimée was productive of many interesting
                        notes and memories concerning the girl Eugénie and her early life, though on
                        the whole the evidence is scanty enough. Washington Irving speaks of "having
                        dandled her on his knee" when on a visit to Granada, but it is Mérimée alone
                        who has recorded the essentials of what we know of her. The Countess of
                        Montijo, a clever, talented, woman, was extremely ambitious as to her
                        daughter's future, and was well satisfied when she married the elder of the
                        two, Francisca, to the Duke of Berwick and Alba. This helped to give the
                        Montijosa good position in Madrid, and it is surprising that Eugénie, with
                        her captivating beauty, high spirits, and charm, should not have followed
                        sooner in her sister's steps. It is suggested by the author that her
                        somewhat "tomboy" disposition, which delighted in the unconventional, and
                        which sometimes led her into wild pranks, may have had something to do with
                        it. Yet it would have been remarkable had offers been lacking. There were
                        many stories. of her being reserved for a higher destiny. At all events, she
                        was 27 years of age before Napoleon III, invited her to share his
                        throne.</p>
                    <p>Now that the Empress has so long obtained full recognition, and that a clear
                        judgement of Napoleon III is gradually becoming possible, it is easy to
                        forget the enormous obstacles which had to be overcome before he married as
                        his heart rather than his head directed. The author does not attempt to
                        gloss over the fact that he had already made overtures to several Royal
                        princesses, which received but scant attention. Never theless, in spite of
                        the insecurity of his throne, which would have heen consolidated by a Royal
                        marriage, in spite of the serious apposition of his family and the sneers of
                        his opponents, he remained firm in his de termination to marry a subject of
                        Queen Isabella of Spain.</p>
                    <p>In his life of the Empress Mr. Sergeant gives a well-balanced estimate of the
                        Emperor, at the same time quoting the views of many well-known people.</p>
                    <p>"Louis Napoleon Bonaparte," says one of them, "is endowed with incontestable
                        power of resistance, a 'vis inertiae' ; but what he lacks in the very
                        highest degree is the power of initiative.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Sergeant notes Moltke's remark that the French Emporor "suffers from a
                        want of men of ability to support him," and adds further:-</p>
                    <p>If he is to be judged, it must be by the whole of his career, not merely as
                        the Man of Sedan. And if he is thus judged by his whole work there will be
                        found much to be said for this dreamer who. . . took neither France nor
                        Europe into his confidence, but unaided at the start except by the equivocal
                        sound of a great name, bent both to the acceptance of what he himself called
                        the dictates of his reason and of his heart.</p>
                    <p>Two chapters on the Court and the notable names of the time contain nothing
                        particularly new, but give a fair and interesting account of the human
                        influences of the Second Empire. The friendship with England was eagerly wel
                        comed by the Imperial pair as an official recognition of their status in
                        Europe, and the Historic ball at Versailles brings back Victorian memories
                        of beautiful women with curling hair and drooping shoulders, and even the
                        ccrinoline suggests a certain romance taken in connexion with them and the
                        beautiful Empress who introduced it.</p>
                    <p>The differences between the Emperor and Empress on the Italian question are
                        fully discussed by the author, with particular reference to the Empress, who
                        began to be recognized as a power after the birth of the Prince Imperial.
                        The tragic story of the Franco-German war, the escape of the Empress, and
                        her exchange of the Tuileries for Chislehurst, is well known, and is also
                        described at length.</p>
                    <p>It is a fascinating story, and Mr. Sergeant has told it well. The
                        illustrations which accompany it are good and add very greatly to the
                        interest of an interesting book.</p>

                    <head>ARITHMETIC 1700 B.C.</head>
                    <p>Probably the oldest copy book for home lessons in arithmetic was unearthed in
                        Egypt. The papyrus, which was found in excellent con- dition, dates from the
                        period about 1700B.C. —that is, abont 100 years before the time of Moses, or
                        almost 8,600 years ago. It proves that the Egyptian had a thorough knowledge
                        of elementary mathematics almost to the extent of our own. The papyrus has a
                        long heading, "Direction how to attain the knowledge of all dark things,
                        etc. Numerous examples show that their principal operations with entire
                        units and fractions were made by means of addition and multiplication.
                        Subtractions and divisions were not known in their present form, but correct
                        results were obtained nevertheless.</p>
                    <p>Equations are also found in Papyrus. Among the examples given is this one:
                        Ten measures of barley are to be divided among ten persons in such a manner
                        that each subsequent persons receives one-eighth of a measure less than the
                        one before him. Another example given is: There are seven men; each one has
                        seven cats, each cat has eaten seven mice, each mouse has eaten seven grains
                        of barley. Each grain of barley would, if cultivated, have yielded seven
                        measures of barley. How much barley has been lost in that way? The papyrus
                        also contains calculations of area, the calculation of the area of a circle
                        and its transformation into a square and finally calculations of the cubic
                        measurements of pyramids.</p>

                    <head>THE LIVER IS A GOOD FRIEND<lb/>BUT A BAD ENEMY.</head>
                    <p>The liver is a large and powerful organ, composed of a great multitude of
                        blood-vessels, nerves, absorbents, and bile channels, held together by a
                        reddy-brown substance. The liver's great work is to supply the bile, which
                        helps to prepare our food for converting into rich, life-giving blood.</p>
                    <p>But when the liver becomes sluggish, there is not enough bile made to digest
                        the food, so the blood becomes starved—thin, pale, and without nourishment,
                        and the food ferments, giving off bad gases which cause flatulency,
                        headache, and foul breath. The bowels become clogged, and constipation
                        begins.</p>
                    <p>One of the first signs of sluggish liver is a feeling of despondency and
                        weariness (due to the impure blood stupifying the brain and failing to
                        nourish the body. The complexion will be yellow, and the eyes heavy ; there
                        will be wind in the stomach, variable appetite, palpitation of the heart,
                        and bad taste in the month.</p>
                    <p>Liver trouble should always have prompt treatment, and, in its early stages,
                        careful dieting, in conjuction with a thorough course of Doan's Dinner
                        Pills, will effect a cure. But if neglected, enlargement of the liver may
                        result, and the action of the organ may be ruined ; there will be dyspepsia,
                        anaemia, and perhaps skin disease. The muscles that drive out the poisonous
                        waste will be numbed, and there will be constipation. Doan's Dinner Pills
                        are the great liver corrective ; their action is mild but reliable ; they
                        give a healthy stimulus to the liver, so that sufficient bile is produced to
                        digest the food and ease the passage of waste.</p>
                    <p>Doan's Dinner Pills are the best medicine for biliousness, indigestion,
                        constipation, for headache, retching, dizziness, distress after eating, poor
                        appetite, yellow eyes, heartburn, wind and for every liver, stomach and

                        celui-ci n'opère bien que lorsqu'il est pris avec de bons aliments et des
                        boissons fortifiantes, telles que vin, café, thé. Chacun choisit, pour se

                        occupations. La fatigue de la purgation étant annulée par l'effet de la
                        bonne alimentation, on se décide aisément à recommencer autant de fois que
