                            the sole object of assisting British trade in this country. The services
                            of the Chamber are always at the disposal of any member desiring
                            information on trade matters generally, including the question of
                            appointing suitable agents. As no fee is charged for such advice, it is
                            obviously in the interests of all British traders here to become
                            members, especially when it is remembered that the annual subscription
                            is merely the nominal one of £1. 'The latter payment also includes a

                    <head>THE SOCIETE DES SUCRERIES. HON. A.J. DAVEY INTERVIEWED.</head>
                    <p>Through the courtesy of the Hon. A. J. Davey we are enabled to place before
                        our readers the exact position at this moment of the above company, whose
                        shares have been so greatly depreciated on our, local bourses since the
                        receipt of the news of the tragic end of its late chairman. </p>
                    <p>When this became known several sinister rumours wore set afloat, and, as we
                        stated in a previous issue, the fact that no definite news was forthcoming
                        at that time as to whether the Sucreries would eventually be losers by the
                        catastrophe that had led to M. Cronier's sad suicide brought about the great
                        and sudden depreciation of the shares which took place. Up to the present
                        the company has paid regular and handsome dividends, the last being at the
                        rate of 8 per cent, and carrying over about £2,600 to this year's account.
                        The net profit for the twelve months ending 31st October last was no less
                        than L.E. 76,780, after payment of interest on the debentures and all other
                        charges, so that until M. Cronier's failure, the company's affairs were in a
                        prosperous state. </p>
                    <p>In reply to enquiries made by our representative, Mr. Davey said that as
                        regards the bills for some 24 million francs drawn on the Sucreries by the
                        succession Henri Say, the company would probably contest their validity, and
                        the question was one for the law courts to decide. In the meanwhile the Hon.
                        A. Davey acting in the capacity of general manager, and in the name of the
                        company, had applied for a concordat preventif, or a stay of execution, and
                        the Commercial Chamber of the Mixed Tribunal in Cairo will meet on the 19th
                        instant to consider the application. In the meanwhile there are ample funds
                        in hands to meet all payments, a sum of no less than £12,000 haring been
                        disbursed only two days back, which fact completely refutes the adverse
                        rumours spread that the company's offers were empty. Monsieur Girard, the
                        head accountant, is busily engaged preparing a full and detailed statement
                        to be presented to the pretiding judge of the Commercial Chamber on the date
                        when the application will come up for consideration. </p>
                    <p>Until then every account as it becomes due will be met at once in cash, and
                        Mr. Davey has given orders that the utmost economy most be practised in
                        every department until the decision of the Court becomes known. "It would be
                        unfortunate, indeed, it would in fact be nothing less than a calamity," said
                        Mr. Davey, "should the company at this juncture have to suspend operations,
                        for the very good and simple reason that its suspension would spell ruin to
                        many cultivators of sugar cane in Upper Egypt. Once its factories were
                        closed the next crop would be practically valueless. The company bad entered
                        into a contract with the Dalra Sanieh Co., for the supply of 12 million
                        cantars of cane at P.T. 3 per kantar, to be delivered between now and March
                        next, and this large quantity, as well as that of private individuals, would
                        be lost" </p>
                    <p>It does great credit to Mr. Davey to bave temporarily withdrawn his
                        resignation, which he had sent in before the Cromer crash occur-red, now
                        that the company is in temporary difficulties. As regards the resignation of
                        Messrs. A. Leroux and de La Bouglise which has been rumoured of late,
                        nothing is yet known at the head office in Cairo. Maltre Carton de Wiart the
                        company's legal adviser, is expected back in a few days and it is hoped that
                        with his advent everything will be arranged to enable the Société des
                        Sucreries to continue its career, and this hope we most sincerely endorse,
                        as much in the interest of the shareholders as in that of the fellaheen, who
                        supply the cane for the factories. We may add that if the concordat is
                        granted the names of Sir Elwin Palmer, Harari Pasha, and probably M.
                        Dubourg, a French gentleman well known in Cairo, will be submitted as
                        liquidators. It would, in oar opinion, be impossible to make a better
                        choice.</p>

                    <head>CONSULAR REPORTS ON EGYPT. PORT SAID.</head>
                    <p>In his report on the trade of Port Said in 1904 Mr. Cameron, after giving
                        tables of exports and imports, to some of which we will revert later,
                        remark* that the ohief point of interest in the export tables is the steady
                        increase of the quantity of cotton exported. In 1901 8,066 kantars of a
                        value of LE. 5,246 left Port Said and Ismailia. The export increased
                        enormously in 1902, and in 1904 amounted no less than 89,480 kantars valued
                        at L.E. 244,790. </p>
                    <p>This cotton came from the Sharkieh province, being brought from Zsgazig, as a
                        rule, down the sweet-water canal to Ismailia and being then put on board
                        steamers on Lake Timsah. An increase of rolling stock and the opening of the
                        new boat service across Lake Menzaleh will probably bring cotton to Port
                        said in quantities sufficient to justify shippers in chartering steamers,
                        many of which would be available after discharging coal at the port. </p>
                    <p>The total import trade of Port Said in 1904 amounted in value to LE.
                        1,869,290. Turkey with a trade of LE. 466,490 was the leading contributer,
                        followed by the United Kingdom (L E. 287.280) and France (LE. 197,200). We
                        need not inform our readers that almost the whole export trade of Palestine,
                        Syria, and Southern Asia Minor comes to Port Said, which explains the
                        preponderance of Ottoman imports, which at first sight is a little
                        perplexing. </p>
                    <p>Coal imports showed an increase of some 70,000 tons, and the author of the
                        report notes the increased proportion of German coal in that supplied by the
                        Deutsches Kohlen Deput of Bremen to the principal German lines of steamers
                        in transit Of the exports in 1904 some 55 % went to the United Kingdom,
                        Germany with about 31 % coming second. In discussing the future of the port,
                        Mr. Cameron makes the following interesting re marks -.—"With the opening of
                        the ordinary gauge government railway on June 1, 1904, a new ere of
                        prosperity has begun for Port Said. The journey to Cairo has been -shortened
                        to fire hours and the number of daily trains has been increased both for
                        goods and passengers, thus enabling the town to cope with the large and
                        increasing demands of the traffic in connection with the thousands of
                        tourists who pass through Port Said in the winter season. </p>
                    <p>Another important project is approaching completion ; the New Egyptian and
                        the Men-xaleh Canal and Navigation Companies have obtained a concession for
                        making a deep and wide channel across the shallow water of Lake Menzalaeh,
                        in order to establish a daily service of steam ferry boats of shallow
                        draught between Kharputi (Port Said) and Matarieh, the eastern point of the
                        fertile district of Mansou-rah rah. The journey would take about throe
                        hours, and in co-operation with the light railway which has its termination
                        at Matarieh, this proposed route across the lake ought to prove of the
                        greatest value in connecting Port Said with the interior of the Delta." </p>
                    <p>In discusing the transit of belligerent vessels, during the war that has just
                        closed, Mr. Cameron states that the total Russian force that passed through
                        the canal amounted to three battleships, three coast defence ships, seven
                        cruisers, eleven destroyers and seventeen transports. Very few merchantmen
                        were actually detained by their passage, and those that were detained at
                        Suez when homeward bound, were granted extra facilities through the canal on
                        the following day. The work of deepening the canal progresses steadily, as
                        may be shown by the increase of the maximum draught allowed. Till the end of
                        1901 this did not exceed 95 feet 7 inches. On January 1901, the maximum
                        draught was raised to 8 metres (26 feet 3 inches) and on January 1 1906 it
                        will be raised to 27 feet On the same date the tariff for laden ships will
                        be reduced to 7 francs 75 c. </p>
                    <p>The conclusions at which the author arrives re British shipping are very
                        satisfactory. The percentage of British vessels using the canal has risen
                        from 56 percent, in 1901 to 63-2per cent in 1904, and their net tonnage from
                        57-8 per cent in 1901 to 65.9 per cent. last year. These figures apply only
                        to the general total of 4,937 vessels ; but if we consider only mer-chant
                        vessels, the British percentages have risen daring the last four years from
                        67 to 74 per cent in number and from 71 to 76 per cent in net tonnage, or
                        three-quarters of the mercantile traffic of the Canal. </p>
                    <p>During the last three years the percentages of German vessels have been 12-9
                        per cent in 1902, 13-1 per cent in 1903 and 19-8 per cent in 1904 ; and of
                        their net tonnage 15-2 per cent in 1909, 14 9 in 1903 and 14-7 in 1904.
                        France, the Netherlands, Norway. Austria-Hungary, and Italy combined furnish
                        a total of 10.5 per cent of the vessels and 8.7 per cent, of the tonnage
                        These facts are reassuring, and show that the British mercantile marine is
                        more than holding its own in the Canal traffic. A proof of this may be seen
                        in the table of the great companies which use the Canal Of these 40, 27 are
                        British, 5 German, 3 French, 9 Dutch, and 1 each Autro-Hunga-rian, Italian,
                        and Spanish.</p>

                    <p>The "Eastern Press," an Armenian weekly paper, published in Smyrna, gives the
                        following details of the discovery of bombs in that city </p>
                    <p>Thanks to the vigilance of the Governor of Smyrna, H.E. Kiamil Pasha, the
                        Armenian revolutionary movement was detected before any great harm had been
                        done, and what promised to become a series of bomb outrages has been
                        checked. The police, who had discovered the meeting place of the
                        revolutionaries, surrounded the house, which is situated in the Greek
                        quarter, Tabahine, but word had reached the conspirators, and they managed
                        to escape. The house was however, searched by the police, and eighty large
                        bombs, with chemicals and apparatus, and three clock-work wore found on the
                        premises. All of there were seized and taken to the palace for examination.
                        Several searches were subsequently made in houses in the St. Dimitri Greek
                        quarter, and several person* were arrested on suspicion of having
                        manufactured these infernal machines. A spatial committee, under the
                        presidency of Kiamil Pasha, has been appointed to con-duct investigations
                        into the characters of inspected persons and to march houses. One hundred
                        and eighty persons have been arrested up to the present, but eighty of there
                        were released after being examined. The reports appearing in the Athens
                        papers describing the arrest of two thousand are grossly exaggerated. </p>
                    <p>As the result of the investigations it is con-oluded that the movement is
                        entirely a revo-lutionary one instigated by Armenians from other countries
                        and that they hope to excite the sympathy of their fellow countrymen in

                    <p>The people can rest assured that the Government will do all in their power to
                        put a stop to this state of affairs and restore the normal tranquillity of
                        the city. The assassin of the late Baliozian has been hung as an example to
                        other plotters. The number of police agents has been increased by fifty, so
                        that the work of checking attempt* at outrage may be more effectively
                        carried out. Many of them bare left for the villages inland by special train

                    <p>The condition of the Nile flood has improved distinctly in the last month,
                        and though it cannot be regarded as a high Nile, the readings of the various
                        gauges, which we receive, do not compare unfavorably with those of last
                        year. In some cases higher readings are shown, whilst in others they are
                        somewhat lower, but the difference in no instance is remarkable. </p>
                    <p>The measures which have been taken by the Ministry of Public Works will
                        happily, avert any danger of the country suffering from a shortage of crops
                        and the perfection to which the irrigation of the country has been brought
                        is of great credit to Sir William Garstin, Mr. Webb, Mr. Verschoyle, and
                        their subor-dinates.</p>
