                    <head>CHRISTMASTIDE.</head>
                    <p>Christmas comes but once a year,</p>
                    <p>And when i comes it brings good cheer."</p>
                    <p>So runs the old couplet-and as far as the first line is concerned it is
                        almost universally correct. But it fails to take into account such an
                        exceptional state of things as that to be found in this country. Here we
                        have a large, Greek element, and while the Anglican Pro- testant Church and
                        the Latin Churches gene- rally celebrate the birth of Christ on December
                        25th, the Greek and Eastern Churches defer. their celebration till the 7th
                        of January-the period of the Epiphany. Consequently we get in Egypt two
                        Christmas Days in the year, each observed by a large number of commercial
                        meb; indeed, so large is the Greek community here that practically business
                        is suspended in most houses on the later as well as the earlier date. What a
                        boon would this be considered in the busy City of London- at least by the
                        employés, for such a state of things would hardly commend itself to the
                        heads of firms, so greatly would it interfere with business of all kinds in
                        that world's centre.</p>
                    <p>It is interesting to study the early records of the observance of Christmas
                        Day. In our Christmas article last year we showed that its origin was
                        distinctly pagan and quite unconnected with the birth of Jesus Christ.
                        Indeed, many early writers hold that it was a <cb n="6"/>special providence
                        that appointed the birth of Christ to take place in the midst of pagan
                        festivals, Neander gives a long account of these, and considers that a
                        festival held on the shortest day-the winter solstice-presented the
                        opportunity of a transition to the Christian point of view; Christ, the sun
                        of the spiritual world, being compared with the sun of the material world.
                        The comparison was, carried still further, "for as in the material world it
                        is after darkness has reached its highest point that the end of its dominion
                        is already near, and the light begins to acquire fresh power, so, too, in
                        the spiritual world Christ, the spiritual sun, must appear to make an end of
                        the kingdom of darkness. But the date to be observed presented a difficulty,
                        and while the Western Churches decided on the 25th December, the Eastern
                        Churches deferred it till the Epiphany. Hence the difference of dates at the
                        present time.</p>
                    <p>The "good cheer" of Christmas is too well established a thing for the old
                        customs ever to be broken. The fashions may change and the Yule Log
                        disappear, but never will Christ- mastide cease to be associated with family
                        reunions and general feasting. Of late years, a growing tendency has
                        manifested itself to make the festival a time for a more general loosening
                        of the purse-strings than formerly, and we note with very great pleasure
                        that many of the London news papers have joined in the movement for giving a
                        share of the good things of the festive season to those unable to afford
                        them themselves. One paper is arranging for suppers to 10,000 of the
                        destitute and has already entertained more than one of the parties of 1,000
                        each who are to be the recipients of the bounty. That Christmas-time is the
                        only period of the year that many open their hearts and their purses for the
                        benefit of the poor is a sad reflection, and reminds us of so many people
                        who only put on religion with their Sunday clothes and feel when they take
                        them off that there is no necessity to think about spiritual matters for
                        another six days. None the less do we rejoies to see the movement extend
                        year after year, and if the progress is slow we trust that it will be sure.
                        In the large cities of Cairo and Alex andria we have some destitute
                        wanderers who may be glad to receive some of the good things of the season,
                        andino doubt the Rudolph and, other Homes will receive an increase of
                        support that will enable them to give the poor who, apply to them a good
                        Christmas més</p>
                    <p>Christmas is a time when absent friends claim a goodly share of our thoughts.
                        Coupled with these, no doubt, in the minds of many Englishmen resident in
                        Egypt, is the regret that they cannot be in the old country "to put their
                        legs under the parental mahogany," and enjoy the roast beef of Old England,
                        or the plump Norfolk turkey. These are things that are not obtainable in
                        this country. Bat we would say to our young friends, "Cheer up: Cold storage
                        is in sight, and if you cannot feast on a good sirloin of Scotch beef,
                        perhaps next year you may be able to get that excellent substitute, a joint
                        of the rich meat that comes from all parts; North Central, and South, of the
                        American conti- nent and which loses so little of its flavor in the freezing
                        process, that it is often enjoyed as much as, and even preferred before,
                        when the source from which it comes is not known -the home fed beef. And the
                        children-(bless them), what of them at Chritmas time! A glance at the shop
                        windows fully assures us that they are not forgotten. It is worth while to
                        pay a visit to the bazaars and large drapery establishments if only to note
                        the plethora of dolls, mechanical toys, and novelties of all descriptions
                        that are offered to the purchasers of presents for the little ones. The
                        Christmas tree, too, is quite an in- stitution in Egypt, and seems to us
                        more frequently seen here than in the old country, So we wish to "one and
                        all, both great and small," a very Merry Christmas and Happy New Year. Now a
                        days it is the custom to alter the wish to that for a Happy Christmas, and
                        taking into consideration the very many cases where the season from various
                        causes cannot be a merry one, the old wish often seems a mockery. We can
                        wish everybody happiness from the bottom of our hearts</p>
                    <p>The close of the year brings the opportunity for a very wide range of thought
                        over the whole world, and the events in the different countries that stir
                        us. Next week we may refer to some of these. We close our present remarks by
                        simply expressing the hope that the Christmas holidays may not be stildened
                        by news of fieros struggles and bornle carnage so dreadful to read of, and
                        that the festival may also be free from the disasters on land and at sea
                        that so often come to cast a gloom over our happiness. May the Christmas of
                        1904 be in every respect a time of joy to all of us.</p>

                    <head>ANGLO-AMERICAN HOSPITAL.<lb/>APPEAL FOR FUNDS.</head>
                    <p>The total subscriptions. to the Anglo- American Hospital at Cairo for 1904
                        amount to L.E. 452. The total donations during the same period amounted to
                        LE. 369. The dona- tions for free beds came to B.E. 307. The total thus
                        collected is therefore L.E. 1,128. This is the first year that the hospital
                        has been practically open, and considering the excellent service it renders
                        to the many Anglo-American visitors and tourists at Cairo, we cannot think
                        that it is meeting with the amount of financial support which we should have
                        expected. The community, who ought to support this worthy institution, is so
                        large and in such easy cir cumstances, generally speaking, that it reflects
                        greatly on the generosity of the British and American colony at Cairo, that
                        the total of the financial aid during the year now drawing to a close has
                        been so small. The ex- ecutive committee of the hospital has con- sequendy
                        been obliged to stir up public opinion, and a circular has been issued,
                        signed by Lord Cromer and Mr. Riddle, calling the attention of the members
                        of the British and American community in Cairo to the advantages) offered by
                        the hospital, and asking for further financial support. Sir Ernest Cassel
                        very generously adds a like sum to the annual subscriptions raised in Cairo
                        for a period ot ten years. We sincerely hope that the appeal contained in
                        this circular will meet with a ready response, and that the community, to
                        whose members this hospital is so useful, will come forward and generously
                        respond to this appeal. If all Britishers and Americans in Cairo subscribed
                        to the hospital in pro- portion to their wealth and salaries the income the
                        hospital in the coming year could very easily be doubled or even
                        trebled.</p>

                    <p>Friday was colder than Wednesday, with m bitter north wind and threats of

                    <p>SANTARELLINA.</p>
                    <p>This very amusing operetta, more familiarly known as Mam'zelle Nitouche, was
                        produced at the above theatre, last evening, and proved a rollicking
                        success. Signa. Amelia Soares, who has already won the hearts of all
                        Alexandrian playgoers, was a delightfully naughty Dionisia. She acted the
                        part with her usual vivacity, and sang the various numbers allotted to the
                        part in a bright and pleasing manner. Sig. Gravina, who made his debut as
                        the organist Celestino, was a tremendous success. His comical methods and
                        antics kept the audience in roars of laughter the whole evening. His lo
                        dicrous grimaces during his conversation with the Mother Superior were
                        sufficient to make the proverbial cat laugh. We think Sig. Gravina as near
                        an Italian counterpart of poor old Dan Leso as is possible. The other
                        characters were in good hands, and the operetta was certainly very
                        successfully performed from every point of view. We strongly recommend our
                        readers who wish to hear a really first-class entertainment to pay the Abbas

                    <head>MAGASINS STEIN.</head>
                    <p>The new and handsome building, one of the finest in Cairo, of this well-known
                        house of ladies' and gentlemen's outfitters, is situated in the
                        Ataba-el-Hadrs district of the Eebekieh quarter, just before reaching the
                        Mousky, and is the largest establishment of its kind in the Capital. In
                        fact, it is a palace where goods from the leading English and Continental
                        manufacturers are to be found, and we would recommend residents and tourists
                        requiring an outfit not to fail to pay the great emporium a visit.</p>
                    <p>Like Whiteley in London, the founder of the firm of Stein has had as
                        successful and prosperous &amp; career, and his secret, like the- former's,
                        has been the supplying of the best claas of goods at the sinullest possible
                        profit, in fact, on the principle of large sales and quick returns. The
                        business was first started in a small way sa far back as August, 1865, just
                        spon 40 years ago, in the Mousky-street, by Mr. S. Stein. Three years later
                        Mr. Stein founded his own factory at Vienna, and the year following the
                        business had so increased that the proprietor found it necessary to build
                        premises of his own. Shortly after the well-known branch house was
                        established in Alexandria on the Grand Square. Meanwhile, the Cairo house
                        was being con- stantly enlarged to meet the augmenting business, and this
                        continuing, the proprietor decided upon erecting the present palatial
                        warehouse. Besides the Cairo and Alexandris houses, other branches were
                        opened in 1881 in Constantinople, Smyrna and Tantah. Since the death of the
                        founder, in 1898, other branches have been opened at Salonics and
                        Johannesberg, in South Africa. It has been the same with the factory in
                        Vienna; as the original only could not supply the demands of all the houses
                        in Egypt and elsewhere, another and a much larger manufactory was erected a
                        short time back. So great are the sales in the new Cairo premises that Mr.
                        Doro Stein, the pre- sent proprietor, will soon have to think about making
                        additions to them. The factory has ob tained the decoration of the Imperial
                        Eagle of Austria and its goods have gained the first prizes at most of the
                        great International Exhibitions. We should not omit to mention that the firm
                        is, by special warrant, purveyors to H.H. the Khedive. Sach, in brief, is a

                    <head>EGYPT IN 1904.<lb/>THE NEW FINANCIAL ERA.</head>
                    <byline>BY SIR ELDON GORST.</byline>
                    <p>As we mentioned in our review of the latest edition of Lord Milner's "England
                        in Egypt," there is an important appendix entitled "Egypt in 1904" from the
                        pen of Sir Eldca Gorst. As it contains the clearest account of the new
                        financial arrangements, inauguratel by the Anglo-French Convention, we have
                        made the following extracts from the article:-</p>
                    <p>By the terms of the Anglo-French Agree ment, France has recognised the
                        permanency of the tish occupation, and has given us free h Egypt. With the
                        cessation of the ha French, oostruction has also ceased all danger of
                        international obstruction as regards other Powers. The attitude of France
                        towards our occupation of the Nile Valley was based on a variety of
                        considerations-historical, political, and financial, none of which apply in
                        the cas of the other European Powers. With the turn of the diplomatic wheel,
                        the latter may have, from time to time, thought it their interest to aid and
                        abet French hostility in Egyptian affairs, but they only came in as
                        accessories after the fact, not as principals, and there is no fear that in
                        future they will ever take the initiative in embarking on any such protless
                        enterprise. Henceforward-and this is a point of the first importance--we can
                        pursue our task in Egypt without the feeling that the situation is a weak
                        spot in the diplomatie armour. Above all, our occupation is no longer a bone
                        of contention and an obstacle to the maintenance of friendly relations
                        between our selves and our neighbours across the Channel. From the point of
                        view of Great Britain, it may be said that the Anglo-French arrange ment has
                        swept away all the political and diplomatic objections to the great
                        undertaking to which we are committed in Egypt.</p>
                    <p>The change effected in the local conditions under which the country itself is
                        administered is no less complete. All the cumbersome arrangements for the
                        security of the bondholders prescribed by the law of Liquidations and the
                        London Convention have been abolished. The whole complicated mass of
                        Egyptian financial legislation has been swept away and replaced by a new
                        Khedivial decree, which will henceforth be the sole law regulating the
                        relations between the Egyptian Government and their creditors. The
                        provisions of this decree were negotiated between England and France, and
                        were subsequently approved by the four other Powers whose consent was
                        necessary -vin, Italy, Austria, Germany and Russia. The broad principle
                        underlying the new law is that suggested by Lord Milner in Appendix 1. of
                        this work ten years ago, where he says (p.366) no one would object to the
                        continuance of the arrangement by which certain revenues were paid in the
                        first instance to the Caisse de la Dette. But as long as these revenues
                        suffice to cover the interest on the debt and to provide any sinking fand
                        which the powers may deem adequate, the balance ought simply to be handed
                        over to the Egyptian Go vernment to deal with as it pleases, and the
                        antiquated distinction of "authorised" and "nauthorised" expenditure should
                        be awept away. These words prophetically de scribe what is now an
                        accomplished fact,</p>
                    <p>Under the new arrangement the Caisse de la Dette remains. But it is ahorn of
                        all its powers of interference in the financial adminis tration of the
                        country, and has reverted to its original functions of being a mere receiver
                        of certain revenues specially assigned to the service of the debt. Those
                        revenues have also been changed, and their amount brought into conformity
                        with the annual charges which the Caisse has to meet. The Egyptian
                        Government resume full liberty to deal as they please with their Customs
                        revenue, and the receipts from the state railways and telegraphs and from
                        the port of Alexandria, and in their place pledge the land tax in all the
                        provinces of Egypt, with the exception of Keneh, the taxes of which were
                        already contingently assigned to the Domains loan. The land tax has been
                        selected, firstly, because, being the most stable branch of the revenue, it
                        provides the best seirity for the boudholders; and, secondly, because it is
                        the tax which the Government are least likely to wish to diminish. It is
                        provided in the new decree that its assessment may not be reduced below four
                        millions without the consent of the Powers. The annual charge on account of
                        the debt, including the expenses of the Caisse de la Dette, fixed at LE.
                        35,000, amounts at the present moment to about L.E. 3,600,000. The assigned
                        land taxes produce over LE 4,200,000, so that there is an ample margin to
                        insure the punctual payment of the Egyptian creditors. It is, however,
                        undesirable to permit further accumulations in the hands of the Caisse, and
                        it has therefore provided that, as soon as the amount of land tax in any one
                        year paid into the Caisse reaches the sum required for the debt charge,
                        during the remainder of that year the tax will be paid by the collecting
                        authority directly into the Ministry of Finance. Further, as the receipts
                        from land-tax come in principally during the autumn months, and will not,
                        there fore, be sufficient to pay the interest during the first half of each
                        year, the Caisse has been provided with a working balance of LE 500,000,
                        which will be carried gver from year to year. Istly, the Caisse holds a sum
                        of LE 1,800.00 qual to a half-year's coupons, as a res ve faal was recourse
                        may be hal in the wry habe event of the Egyptian Government making deault.
                        The latter sum is invested in Egyptian stocks, and the interest thereon goes
                        towards the payment of the annual debt charge, thereby preventing further
                        accumulation. The Caisse retains its right, both individually and
                        collectively, to bring an <cb n="2"/> action against the Goverment in the
                        event of any infringement of the stipulations of the pew law, And that is
                        the whole story, so far as the Caisse is concerned. It will be seen that its
                        functions are no longer very arduous or very responsible.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, the Egyptian Treasury hasat last entered into possession
                        of its own. The old reserve fund, with its liabilities and assets, the
                        economies fund, and certain minor special accounts which had grown up under
                        the former state of affairs, have all been transferred from the Caisse to
                        the Ministry of Finance, At the end of 1903 these funds made up a sum of
                        about LE7,800,000. Deducting the amount of LE2,300,000, which is retained by
                        the Caisse, it will be seen that the Egyptian Go verament obtained
                        possession of a lump sum of five and a half millions. The suppression of the
                        Mixed Board which presided over the administration of the railways,
                        telegraphs, and port of Alexandria, has given the Govern ment a free hand to
                        deal with a department which, more than any other, stands in need of reform,
                        and the efficiency of which concerne very nearly the material prosperity of
                        the country. In the event of the sums placed at the disposal of the
                        Government proving insufficient for the heavy capital expenditure required
                        for the development of the resources both of Egypt and the Sadan, the
                        "assent of the Caisse de la Dette will no longer be neces sary before a
                        further loan can be issued.</p>
                    <p>Without unduly extending this brief account, it would be impossible to
                        enumerate all the many financial trammels which have now been, swept away,
                        but one point of considerable importance deserves special mention. Bince the
                        time when Egyptian bonds entered the cate gory of gilt-edged securities, and
                        the conver sion of the Unified Debt on favorable terms came within the range
                        of practical politics, Egypt's right to carry out that conversion has been
                        seriously contested, not only by the bondholders, but also by some of the
                        foreign govern ments in the countries where the Debt is held. The question
                        is a legal one, and the arguments on both sides are too technical to be
                        reproduced here. It may, however, be said that the mere shadow of illegality
                        would have been sufficient to prevent the conversion being carried, through
                        on anything like reasonable terms. The right of the Egyptian Government to
                        convert all their debts has now been accepted by the Powers interested on
                        the condition that the Guaranteed and Privileged Debts will not be paid off
                        before July 15, 1910, and the Unified before July 15, 1912. The postpone
                        ment of the proposed conversion for a few years is a small price to pay for
                        the removal of all extraneous difficulties whenever the propitious moment
                        for so extensive an opera tion arrives.</p>

                    <head>CAISSE DE LA DETTE.</head>
                    <p>A correspondent writes from Cairo to the Times: "The Khedivial Decree
                        defining the powers and constitution of the Caisse de la Dette on and from
                        the first day of the New Year only gives effect to the provisions con tained
                        in the Anglo-French Convention, and there is no departure from the already
                        recog nised understanding, according to which the Caisse de la Dette is to
                        vanish from the stage of Egyptian politics simultaneously with the
                        conversion, or the extinction, of the public debts over which it has so long
                        exercised its stewardship. Nevertheless, the appearance di the decree has
                        given rise to not a few rumours, both in the public Press and elsewhere,
                        ooncerning the future destinies of the Commission, whose existence, though
                        nominally prolonged until 1910 or 1912, will, it is generally believ ed,
                        virtually cease at an earlier date."</p>

                        palatial block of buildings now ap proaching completion, situated in the

                        at £80,000, and the building will form one of the handsomest ornaments to

                    <head>THE CLIMATE OF EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>Dr. Engel Bey has rendered a service to the public by republishing his
                        lecture before the Egyptian Medical Congress on the Egyptian climate. The
                        subject is, it is needless to say, of the greatest importance, and the
                        unique character of the Egyptian climate raises some interesting
                        meteorological problems. One topie discussed by Dr. Engel is as to whether
                        the climate has been modified, and he thus sums up his observations so far
                        as Cairo is concerned:- Toutefois, il est intéressant de constater que, pour
                        la ville du Laire, un abaissement de la tetaperature a eu lieu réellement,

                    <p>The Ses up river can now be said to have fairly commenced. Although early, at
                        that ever-increasingly popular. b stel, the Crict, at Aswoman, numerous old
                        travellers (in blition to first-year visitors to Bypt) have already taken up
                        their winter rosid nee, and one hears continually the remark, "How pleasant
                        it is to get back to our old winter quarters." Owing to the splendid sits on
                        which this hotel is built, it is rapidly and deservedly coming into
                        increased popularity year by year, and its splendid dining hallsecond to
                        none in Egypt-already presents a very animated appearance. The chief charm
                        of Assinan, as every visitor knows, is the dry atmosphere and equable
                        climate, and a visitor to that lovely and unique spot need never have any
                        ncern as to "what to-morrow's weather will be like," each day being, if
                        possible, a little improvement on the previous one. At this time of the year
                        the weather can only be described as "charming," sunshine all day and every
                        day, tempered with a most refreshing breeze, being the invariable rule. The
                        Cataract Hotel, being built on the very fringe of the desert, affords the
                        visitor the fullest possible benefit to be obtained by a visit to Assouan,
                        enabling, as it does, each guest to enjoy the greatest obtainable advantage
                        from the desert air, and at the same time providing the same luxury and

                        stands unbeaten, if not actually unrivalled, and we have no hesitation in
                        saying that any visitor to Assouan will be well advised to pay a visit to
                        the Cataract Hotel, where he will find that not only is every consideration
                        given to his expressed wishes, but that as far as possible such wishes are
                        anticipated and carried inté effect before the expression of same. We append

                    <head>THE ZEFTA BARRAGE.</head>
                    <p>This work was completed early in 1903, and inaugurated by His Highness the
                        Khedive in the month of March. The subsidiary canals, taking off right and
                        left of the river above this work, were not sufficiently advanced to enable
                        full advantage to be taken off the Barrage during the summer months.
                        Nevertheless it</p>
                    <p>played a metal part at a very critical moment. It was regulated throughout
                        the summer, and yielded small supplies to the Rayyah Abbas for short
                        intervals during the rotation periods. The great service rendered by this
                        work, however, was during the important time when the flood was first
                        rising. The effect of this first use is generally very slowly felt, and, as
                        every leddan of land in the upper reaches of the canals is taking water at
                        that moment, the tracts to the north, particularly in northern Gharbieh,
                        suffer severely by the delay in the arrival of the extra supply. In 1903,
                        water was passed down the Damietta branch, between the 3rd of July and the
                        14th of August, in south cient quantity to quable the Rayyah Abbas, by means
                        of the Zafta Barrage to feed the Bahr Shebin. The water taken from the river
                        up stresin of the Deita Barrage, was thus used for the negation of the
                        southern area of the Delta, while the northern tracts derived their supplies
                        from the Ziita weir. The effect was to increase the water supply of the 2nd
                        Circle of Irrigation by 30 per cout. during the latter halt of July, and
                        throughout August. This permitted the early abandonment of the futa- tions,
                        and largely assisted the sowing of maize and rice. (P.W.D. Report for
                        1908.)</p>

                            had the cool cheek to point out to a shaweesh that we were obstructing
                            the public footway and causing pedestrians to make a wide detour into
                            the street, at the imminent risk of getting knocked down by the dense
                            traffic or flattened out by a tramcar. Naturally, the shaweesh soon put
                            matters right and the Englishman didn't get a look in, though he made
                            use of some very strange language. (I know him very well by sight as he

                        her of her catarrh and her system was entirely rid of it.</p>
                    <p>This is what Pernns was doing all the while. Not a day, and probably not an
                        hour, passes but someone has a similar experience with Peruna.</p>
                    <p>The first step toward consumption is catching cold. The next step is a
                        failure to cure it promptly. The third step is the development of catarrh,
                        which grad-" usually becomes chronie. The fourth step, the estarrh begins to
                        spread from the head to the throat. The fifth step, the catarrh spreads to
                        the bronchial tubes and lungs. It then becomes cobrump- tion in its first
                        stage.</p>
                    <p>At any time during the progress of the catarrh, from the first onset of the
                        cold to its final settlement to the lungs, Pe runs can be relied upon to
                        stop the dis- ease. 11 eures entirely. Even after consumption has become
                        thoroughly developed, mapy cases have found in Peruns a permanent care.
                        After they have been given up by physicians to die of consumption Peruna has
                        eared them. We have hundreds of testimonials that declare these facts in the
                        most enthusiastic language,</p>
                    <p>U.B. Benator John M. Thurston, from Nebraska, writes the following letter
                        from Washington, D. C., under date of April 6, 1901:</p>
                    <p>"I have used Peruns at various times</p>
                    <p>during the past year or two with most satisfactory results.</p>
                    <p>"It entirely relieved me from a Jeri tasting cough, the result of excessive
                        effort in the Presidential campaign, and I am a firm believer in its
                        efficacy in any such trouble."-Jno. M. Thurston.</p>
                    <p>To take quieting medicines to stop a cough is absurd and harmful. The only
                        way to stop a cough permanently and without doing more injury than good is
                        to cure the catarrh, which is exactly what Peruna does. It cures the catarrh
                        of the bronchial tubes and the cough ceases.</p>
                    <p>At the slightest appearance of a cough s bottle of Peruns should be taken
                        according to directions. One bottle in the beginning will do more than a
                        half dozen bottles after the catarrh has fastened itself on the lungs.</p>
                    <p>If you do not derive prompt and astia- factory results from the use of,
                        Peruna, write at once to Dr. Hartman, giving a fall statement of your case,

                    <head>QUESTIONS MUNICIPALE </head>
                    <p>Les agissements de la Delegation </p>
                    <p>M. Alderson ayant posé le dilemme "ou les conseillers municipaux seront
                        autorisés à assister à titre consultatif aux séances de la Délégation, ou
                        bien je maintiendrai ma démission", la Commission apurement et simplement
                        voté pour cette dernière alternative et retranché de son sein le membre
                        récalcitrant. </p>
                    <p>Sans rechercher ce que cette conduite peut avoir de contraire aux habitudes
                        de nos édiles et à la correction de leur manières, hâtons-nous de dire
                        qu'elle est profondément contraire à l'esprit de la loi. </p>
                    <p>La question qui se pose, en effet, est celle-ci : la Commission avait-elle le
                        droit d'accepter la démission d'un elu du peuple uniquement parce qu'il
                        réclamait 'admission des conseillers municipaux aux séances de la Délégation
                        ? </p>
                    <p>Non, certes. Et. le bon sens le plus élémentaire le démontre en l'absence
                        même d'un texte : la Délégation n'est autre que le mandataire de la
                        Commission et à ce titre de mandant celle-ci a évidemment droit de contrôle
                        sur son mandataire. Mais le texte existe d'ailleurs qui donne aux
                        conseillers ce droit de contrôle. Il ne pent être plus explicite "Tout
                        membre de la Commission peut à tout moment prendre connaissance, dans le-
                        bureau meme de la Délégation, de toutes pièces dont il a fait la demande au
                        secrétaire." On oppose, il est vrai, l'art. 36, ainsi conçu : "La Délégation
                        pourra inviter à ses réunions tout membre de la commission , ou toute autre
                        personne qu'elle croira utile pour avoir des renseignements ou des
                        éclaircissements". Mais de ce que la Délégation peut inviter à assister à
                        ses séances, cela ne veut pas dire qu'elle peut empêcher d'exercer 5/16, le
                        cours a clôturé à 2 9/32.On a fait plus un contrôle, lorsque, surtout il y a
                        un texte Nombreuses transactions également en Sait explicite qui l'autorise. </p>
                    <p>Quoiqu'il en soit, la Commission, par son vote du 1er mare dernier, a' décidé
                        qu'aucun membre étranger à la Délégation n'avait le droit d'assister aux
                        séances de celle-ci. </p>
                    <p>Est-ce bien la Commission qui a décidé cela ! N'est-ce pas plutôt la
                        Délégation elle-même ! </p>
                    <p>Si des dix-huit conseillers qui étaient présents à la séance du 1er mare nous
                        déduisons les membres de la Délégation, il restait 9 voix seulement, dont
                        deux ont protesté et une s'est abstenue. Ce sont donc en définitive six
                        membres indépendants contre trois qui ont accepté la démission d'un de leurs
                        collègues. Ce vote est donc nul de plein droit, comme ayant eu lieu sans le
                        quorum nécessaire. </p>
                    <p>Il était de rigueur, en effet, d'exclure du vote les membres de la
                        Délégation, comme directement intéressés dans l'affaire. L'article 28 du
                        décret est catégorique à cet égard : "Les membres de la Commission ne
                        peuvent prendre part à des délibérations relatives aux affaires dans
                        lesquelles ils ont intérêt, soit en leur nom personnel soit comme
                        mandataires." On ne pourrait imaginer rien de plus précis. La Délégation ne
                        veut pas de contrôle. M. Alderson en exige un et propose à cet effet
                        l'admission des conseillers aux séances de la Délégation. </p>
                    <p>Celle-ci, étant directement intéressée dans la question, n'avait donc pas le
                        droit de voter. En le faisant elle a violé la loi. </p>
                    <p>En admettant même qu'il n'y ait pas eu de texte de loi explicite pour
                        empêcher la Délégation de prendre part au vote, la question était de celles
                        qu'il n'appartient pas plus à la Commission qu'à la Délégation de trancher.
                        Cest au Gouvernement à interpréter ses décrets et en L'occurrence il était
                        autant sinon plus indiqué de s'adresser à lui que dans la question des
                        maisons ouvrières. L'article 33 du décret le dit formellement : "Les lois,
                        décrets ou règlements ne peuvent faire l'objet des délibérations de la part
                        de la Commission Municipale. Les mesures prescrites par les lois, décrets et
                        règlements, ou par arrêtés ministériels sont applicables purement et
                        simplement." </p>
                    <p>Le texte de loi, qui donne à tout membre de la Commission le droit de prendre
                        connaissance à tout moment dans le bureau même de la Délégation de toutes
                        les pièces qu'il juge à propos, lui donné à plus forte raison celui
                        d'assister aux séances à simple titre consultatif. La loi est donc claire,
                        Messieurs les délégués ; il n'y a qu'à l'appliquer. </p>
                    <p>Lorsqu'un collègue en réclame l'application, Vous l'acculez à la
                        démission—mais le Gourer-renient , qui a reconnu au public un droit de
                        Contrôle sur les affaires municipales (voir le rapport de Lord Cromer), ne
                        voudra pas sanctionner une décision qui refuse ce droit à un élu du peuple —
                        décision d'aillenrs contraire à la loi et aux règlements. Z. </p>

                    <p>Délit de Presse </p>
                    <p>La Cour d'Appel Mixte vient de débouter M. Télémaque Sapountzaki,
                        propriétaire du théâtre de l'Abassieh au Caire, de sa poursuite contre M. R.
                        G. Canivet, propriétaire et ré dacteur du "Journal du Caire''. </p>
                    <p>Le 8 octobre 1903, ce dernier publiait un long article sur les théâtres où il
                        était dit entre autres "Le théâtre de l'Abbassieh eu état de faillite ferme
                        ses portes ces jours-ci." </p>
                    <p>En dépit d'une rectification publiée quelques jours apres M. Sapountzaki
                        attaquait le journal en diffamation, mais perdait son procès devant le
                        tribunal mixte du Caire. Ne se te nant pas pour battu, il a fait appel de ce
                        jugement. </p>
                    <p>Son avocat a prétendu devant la Cour que la rectification n'avait été
                        imaginée que comme moyen de défense, que peu importait d'ailleurs qu'il y
                        ait eu légèreté ou mauvaise foi dans la publication diffamatoire, que
                        l'article fût l'œuvre d'un simple collaborateur ou du rédacteur même : un
                        dommage matériel en était résulté, le propriétaire ne trouvait plus
                        d'artistes ni de fournisseurs, les Cies. d'assurances refusaient de
                        l'assurer et quelque temps après <cb n="2"/>un incendie se déclarait dans
                        son théâtre, lui causant une perte de 2,000£. De plus, dans l'article
                        rectificatif, le journal aggravait encore sa faute en écrivant "que le mot
                        faillite n'avait pas été employé dans son sens juridique mai-dans le sens
                        dont on s'était servi de cett-épithète en parlant des écoles de M. Dunlop."
                        Pour tous ces faits, M. Sapountzaki réclamait 500£ de dommages-intérêts. </p>
                    <p>Se référant aux conclusions de la défense, la Cour déboute l'appelant de sa
                        demande et le condamne aux frais. Elle estime que l'erreur commise était
                        sans conséquence dommageable, qu'elle était dégagée de toute intention mal
                        veillante et que d'ailleurs elle se trouvait suffisamment réparée par
                        l'insertion de la rectification. </p>

                        larger trade with India, China, and Australia. He believed that Japan would

                        countries and by means of subsidies and bounties, of cheap labor and great
                        mineral resources, would strain every nerve to make her power felt in the
                        commercial markets of the world-The report was agreed to.</p>
