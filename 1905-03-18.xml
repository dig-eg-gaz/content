                    <head>Japanese Secrecy</head>
                    <p>Nothing has been more remarkable in the present war than the extraordinary
                        secrecy maintained by the Japanese Naval and Military General Staffs. The
                        losses of the Japanese fleet are absolutley uncertain ; no one can tell us,
                        for example, whether the "Hatsuse" is the only Japanese battleship that has
                        succumbed to the Russian mines, and what was the vessel that left the
                        Japanese line during the battle of August 10, 1904. There is a vague
                        impression that two Japanese ironclads have gone down ; four only took part
                        in the great sea fight off Port Arthur, while nothing whatever is known of
                        the losses of the larger cruisers. The "Daily Telegraph" stated some time
                        back that the "Takasago" had perished on the same day that the "Sai Yen" ran
                        on a mine, and what loss the Japanese torpedo flotillas have sustained is
                        very variously estimated.</p>

                    <cb n="6"/>
                    <p>In most cases the Mikado's Government has neither affirmed nor denied the
                        loss of ships reported almost weekly during the blockade of Port Arthur, and
                        silence has proved golden in that the Russian succours wandering aimlessly
                        off the East African Coast have not the slight-est notion of the strength of
                        Admiral Togo's fleet. They may have to face five battleships, they may have
                        to face three. The strength of the Japanese destroyer and submarine
                        flotillas is equally unknown. Now and again stories come of fleets 20 strong
                        seen cruising 100 miles E. of Hongkong or of a host of torpedo craft
                        patrolling Formosan waters, but nothing definite and precise.</p>
                    <p>And if the Japanese secrecy in regard to their naval operations has been
                        successful it has been more successful on land, where, what with Chinamen
                        and correspondents, the chnces of leakage of important news are infinitely
                        greater. But Japan has succeeded up to the great fight at Mukden in keeping
                        concealed the whereabouts of some of her principal units. At Liao-Yang the
                        Guard, 2nd and 12th divi-sions under Kuroki, the 5th and 10th under Nodzu,
                        and the 3rd, 4th and 6th under Oku, with several reserve brigades, formed
                        the Ja-panese army. The 1st was known to have been left at Port Arthur ;
                        where were the rest? In the autumn it became known that the 9th and 11th
                        were at Port Arthur, and early in 1905 it transpired that the 8th had played
                        a promi-nent part at Heikontai. Then there was the 7th; it was only a few
                        days ago that the "Times" correspondent informed the world that this force,
                        destined to conquer Saghalien (said some) or hold Korea, according to
                        others, had actually arrived in November in time to storm the 203-Metre
                        Hill. As for the indepen-dent reserve brigades, no one seems sure of their
                        exact position, nor of the nature of the army of occupation in Korea</p>
                    <p>And then in the height of the battle of Mukden three territorial divisions
                        under General Kawamura, who, as all the world believed, was landing in N.
                        Korea and pre=paring to assail Vladivostock, appear on General Linievitch
                        and for all the Russian leaders. For this successful calculated secrecy
                        means that you have a whole people before you that is not only patriotic -
                        most people can feel and talk for their country - but has the power of
                        understanding what the pro-secution of a successful war demands. Other
                        nations have scarificed lives in war with the same iron patriotism, others
                        have trained their hearts and wills to accept war, not as a horror and an
                        abomination, nor as a field for theatricals, but as a necessary if highly
                        disagreeable incident in international relations; but none have sacrificed
                        their comfort so far as to refrain from writing or talking copious-ly in
                        war-time, to the great comfort of them-selves and their enemy's Intelligence
                        Depart-ment.</p>

                    <p>At Tieling the Russians set fire to the pro­visions and fodder, which were
                        piled round the station, two-thirds being destroyed. N umerous spoils were
                        captured. *</p>

                    <p>The newspapers’ despatches estimate the casualties at the battle of Tieling
                        at 19,000. KsAipatkin was obliged to abandon his stores and 80 guns.

                    <p>London, March 17.</p>
                    <p>Reuter’s correspondent with General Oku says that Tieling was occupied after
                        a severe fight, the Russians retiring in confusion. It is not believed that
                        the Russians will make an­other stand south of Harbin. The Japanese covered
                        almost 90 miles in a fortnight, fighting practically every inch of the way.

                    <p>Goverment's decision</p>
                    <p>Sir WM. Wilcocks Interviewed.</p>
                    <p>(Special to the "Gazette")</p>
                    <p>Our representative found SirW. Willcocksat an early hour in the new office he
                        has just opened for himself next door to Me. Carton de Wiart, and at once
                        proceeded to ask him his opinion on the recent decree deciding to postpone
                        for three years the raising of the Assouan dam and as a corollary to this
                        measure to stop selling land to reclamation companies.</p>
                    <p>“i desperately WEAK DECISION.'</p>
                    <p>What do you think, Sir William, of the decision not to raise the Assouan dam
                        1—1 think it a desperately weak decision, a regular going back to the old
                        days which preceded the Occupation. There is a large book containing the
                        decisions of oommitteee which advised sno- oessive Khedives not to raise the
                        water on the Barrage at the head of theDelta.Sir Colin Soott- Moncrieff got
                        me out from India (I was only 31 then) and told me to sit down on the
                        Barrage and advise him. “Mind,” he added, “have as your motto—L'audaoe,
                        Candace, toujowt Candace, and if you decide to raise the water and sin
                        accident happens I shall take the responsibility; if you suooeed I shall see
                        that you get oredit for it There is Mr. Macdonald at the Assouan dam; he has
                        seen every stone laid and watched the dam ever since and knows it as no man
                        oan know it I spent two days with him last June and learnt much. He was keen
                        on raising it If I had keen chief I should have taken his opinion against
                        all the engineers and professors of Europe together, 'those two professors
                        with their tittlebat theory thrown in.</p>
                    <p>SIB HKNJAKTN RAKER'S ADVICE.</p>
                    <p>But mind, Sir William, you are criticising Sir Benjamin Baker.—No; I am not
                        Sir Benjamin ought not to have been asked to take the responsibility tor
                        raising the dam. Sir Benjamin is no longer as young as when he projected the
                        Forth Bridge, and if you turn to the 12th chapter of Ecclesiastes you will
                        find that one of the unfailing signs of age is “an abiding fear of things
                        that are high.” The decision to raise or not raise should have been left to
                        Mr. Macdonald, the resident engineer ; and the decision once taken. Sir
                        Benjamin might have been asked his opinion on the measures proposed, and
                        ^advantage taken of his great experience. Sir Williai) Jarstin might with
                        advantage have imitated Sir Colin Scott-Moncrieff, and taken the advice of
                        the youngest man. Mr. Macdonald is a hard and clear-headed Scotchman from
                        Aberdeen, who would have taken any responsibility.</p>
                    <p>THE PROTECTIVE WORKS.</p>
                    <p>Would you tell us what are the protective works they are carrying out below
                        the dam 1— All dams over or through which water flows soour out big holes
                        wherever the rock is weak. Nothing but the aotion of the water can disclose
                        where the weak rook is. When found the rook is repaired, and on the solid
                        repaired bed walls are raised and the water falls into compartments and
                        pockets which break its force. I remember at the Betwa dam, which I* built
                        in India, we did the same thing. There we have floods whiqbT are twice those
                        of the Nile in flood, though of short duration, and where the same holes
                        were dug out and repair­ed in the regular established way. There is no rook
                        in the world with less uniformity than granite,, but water is a splendid
                        searcher and soon lets one know everything.</p>
                    <p>THE SALE OP LAND.</p>
                    <p>And what do you think, Sir William, about the decision to stop selling land
                        for reclama­tion t—At first I thought I had stepped into Mesopotamia and was
                        faced with all those difficulties which the Turk lays in the way of progress
                        and advancement, but I recovered my­self on meeting a would-be
                        concessionaire who had stepped into Inferno itself and written up over his
                        office door “Let all who enter here abandon hope.” “Ah 1” he said, “the
                        irriga­tion engineers want a soft time of it for three years, and they will
                        all the time be drawing their salaries, while we poor wretches who get no
                        salaries but are paid bythe job will starve.” I immediately took hope. I
                        know the Irriga­tion Department better. Did I not belong to it for 25 years
                        1 I knew they would be sick of their soft time before a couple of months
                        were over.-</p>
                    <p>UR WXXLLAjrS ALTERNATIVE SCHEME.</p>
                    <p>Wbat dffyou propose to do t—It was only about ten days ago that’I had the
                        pleasure of meeting Mr. Quellenec, chief engineer of the Suez Canal, He
                        asked me why companies did not store their own summer water on part of the
                        ground they wanted to reolaim ; because he had often thought of the easiness
                        of this being done during his frequent journeys be­tween Port Said and
                        Ismailia, I replied at once that the Government were going4o store it for
                        them at Assouan, and that would be cheaper than storing it for themselves.
                        He contended that companies would be happier if they stored their own water.
                        This has been a very favorite project of mine. In the first edition of my
                        book on Egyptian Irrigation, written in 1888, before the Assouan reservoir
                        was thought of, I was very keen on it and devoted many pages to it In the
                        seoond edition, written in 1898, even after it had been decided to store
                        water at Assouan, I was still keen on it Now that the Government has decided
                        not to raise the Assouan dam for three years, I shall imme­diately mollify
                        my projects for reclamation, and everywhere provide for summer reservoirs on
                        the properties to be reclaimed. This will meet every difficulty. That
                        milliard of oubio metres of water which was to have ben stored at Assouan
                        will be available for storage in the lowlands of the Delta. Snob water will
                        be</p>
                    <cols n="6"/>
                    <cb n="5"/>

                    <p>not only available for irrigation during thi hard time of summer, but will
                        sweeten the land it lies on. Pumped on to the fields it will be sweet and
                        fresh. Why, even Lake Mareotfr, where water has been evaporated for
                        centuries and is in part evaporated to-day, has begun to become sensibly
                        sweeter since the Mex pumps have worked. Last May I got up sopie speci­mens
                        through the courtesy of tyr. Williams and found that the salt was only 500
                        per 100,000. In ten years it may be possible to irrigate with the water, if
                        it continues to get sweeter every year. This for a salt lake. With one of
                        our own fresh-water reservoirs, we should have abundance of good water
                        always at hand, and not be dependent on the uncer­tain supplies at the tails
                        of low canals.</p>
                    <p>RECLAMATION OW LAND.</p>
                    <p>So, Sir William, you do not take a gloomy view of the situation f—Certainly
                        not If Sir William Garstin will telegraph to Mr. Mac­donald to raise the
                        dam, the water will be stored there. If the Adviser does not care to do
                        that, the water can be stored in the low­lands of the Delta. Indeed, I see
                        more work for engineers than ever. Reclamation of land will become a regular
                        scienoe, and it may he that this system of reclamation of which M. Quellenec
                        is so strong an advocate, will hurry on reclamation more than the water from
                        Assouan could luve done it.</p>

                    <p>Important decree</p>
                    <p>With reference to the letter from the oom­mittee of the International Chamber
                        of Shipping to the port authorities which we published yesterday, we
                        understand that the latter view with extreme regret the interrup­tion in the
                        hitherto continuously excellent and harmonious relations, existing for more
                        than a quarter of a century, between them­selves and the numerous shipping
                        agencies at Alexandria, of which the above-mentioned Chamber is said to be
                        composed, now caused by a letter full of aspersions and animadver­sions on
                        the administration of the port, emanating from this association. The
                        existence and claim of this body to represent the entire shipping interest
                        of the port only became known to the Administration by its letter to the
                        Earl of Cromer. It does not appear in the annual publication called the
                        “ludicateur Egyptian,” which professes to contain a list of all important
                        commercial and maritime associations in Egypt, nor has it ever placed itself
                        in offioial relations with the port in the above oapaoity.</p>
                    <p>The aspersions and animadversions are made the subjeot of a long “addenda” to
                        a communication of half-a-dozen lines on an entirely different subjeot, and
                        are aooompanied by a request for information as to the circum­stances under
                        which the Rubattino S. S. “Cairo” has been wrecked on the reefs outside the
                        tariff limits of the port.</p>
                    <p>The public, and therefore the Chamber, having been made aware, through the
                        press that actions at law are pending in the Mixed Courts by the passengers
                        of the “Cairo” against her captain and against the company to which she
                        belongs, the port authorities express them­selves surprised that the Chamber
                        has not recognised the impropriety of the information it asks for being
                        given to the public whilst the matter is yet “aub-judioe.” Any information
                        however, (which the Goveramentlawyersconsider it permissible to give, is
                        always at the dispo­sition of the agenoy needing it for its own gonoerns,
                        without any necessity for the iuter- ventioa of the International chamber of
                        Ship­ping, whioh, the port authorities think, should confine itself to
                        matters affecting the general interests of the shipping oommnnity as a
                        whole.</p>
                    <p>In the present case they think it a matter of great regret that the
                        International Chamber of Shipping should have published in the local 'press
                        the letter-it has addressed to them,</p>
                    <p>' as it contains an admission of the entire disre­gard by the captain of the

                        Alexandria by the Boghas Pass, which niay have a prejudicial effect in a

                    <p>The seoond appendix to Sir William Garstin’s note on . the Assouan Dam
                        consists of the following extracts from the Foreign Office Blue Booh. Egypt
                        (No. 3) 1897, containing his former report as to sites for a dam in the
                        Dongola Province</p>
                    <p>A comparison of the different Cataracts &lt;u Site* for Id Dam and
                        Reservoir.</p>
                    <p>> Assouan.—A summary examination of the different cataracts between Assouan
                        and Hatinek strengthens the conviction that the former site is, taking all
                        oonsiderationrinto account, better suited than any of the others fot the
                        construction of a great dam, and at tlw same time for the formation -of a
                        storage reservoir.</p>
                    <p>The soundness of the rock, the width of the river, and the’ distribution of
                        thre summer dis­charge into a number of shallow channels afford immense
                        facilities for the successful completion of such a work. t</p>
                    <p>Again, south of the 1st oataract, there exists a long reach of river, 345
                        kilometres fodength, with a slope of 1/12500. The storage oapacity of the
                        channel is, therefore, large in proportion to the height of dam required to
                        hold up the necessary quantity of water.</p>
                    <p>Lastly, the cultivation in this locality is very scanty, and the hills on
                        either tide closely approach the water’s edge, thus forming of themselves
                        natural boundaries to the reservoir.</p>
                    <p>Other possible sites.—The sites next best suited to Assouan are, taken to
                        order, those of Khaibar, D»lt Hannex snd Wady. Haifa.</p>
                    <p>As regards the first and third of these, De Gottbeeg’s plans give very
                        complete informa­tion regarding their section, depth of water, eto.</p>
                    <p>Khaibar,—The Khaibar bar is to many respects admirably suited for the
                        construction of a masonry dam. The granite is compact and good, and the
                        depth of water in summer is not greater, in any channel, according to De
                        Gott­berg, than 2 metres. It is true that the year 1857, in which his
                        measurements were taken, was one of exceptionally low summer supply, but
                        even in an average year the depth of water cannot be great.</p>
                    <p>The width of the river here is about 1,560 metres (very muoh the same as that
                        or Assouan), and the mass of rocks which fortes the bar is some 400 metres
                        wide. The reel crosses this river at an angle of between 60 and 70
                        degrees.</p>
                    <p>The flanking works on either side would, for a high darn, be rather costly,
                        as the construc­tion of long masonry retaining walls would be involved. The
                        ground surface at the edge of the channel does not appear to be more than 10
                        metres above low-water level. The laud rises gradually, and with a moderate
                        slope, away from the river on either bank.</p>
                    <p>' The great drawback to Khaibar as a possible storage reservoir is that it is
                        practically at the end. of the 3rd cataract, and may be said to forte a
                        portion of the latter. The river in the flistuuw of 63 kilometres between
                        Abou Fatmeh and Khaibar falls between 11 and 12 metres, with a slope of
                        about 1/5000.</p>
                    <p>This must naturally reduce tfle possible storage area-very largely, and, in
                        order to obtain the required quantity of water, a very high dam would be
                        necessitated.</p>
                    <p>The strip of land sonth of Khaibar, tooludfog the villages and date palms,
                        would be sub­merged by the reservoir. The cultivated area, although larger
                        in extent than the average of Northern Nubia, is not very great, and, as
                        most of the villages are deserted, the loss to the inhabitants would' not
                        assume very large proportions.' Thie Sudan railway, whioh. at ' KeHdain runs
                        close to the river, would also be put under water, and the alignment would
                        require considerable alteration were a dam tb be constructed here. Khaibar
                        is well worth thinking of as a site for a comparatively small “ storage
                        reaiervoir,' supplementary to that of " AssOtiafo should such ever be
                        needed.' "</p>
                    <p>DAt.—1 DM is1 perhaps another site which might bO hsed for the 'construction
                        of a dam. 'It is practically the head of the second cat*- ract, as between
                        it and the Amara rapid, some 82r Mlbmetres upstream, there is only a
                        differ­ence in level of 3 metres. From thence to ‘Khalbar there is a
                        comparatively level stretch of water, 118 kilometres in length, with ah
                        average Slope of 1/13000.</p>
                    <p>"The river at Dal is of considerable width, and is divided by large and rocky
                        islands into -three principal channels. The main stream at the head of the
                        rapid appears to follow the east bank. The flow of water is so strong, and
                        of such volume, as to give rise to the fear that the depth of water, even at
                        low Nile, must be considerable. Without soundings taken at the above period
                        it is impossible to say to wbat extent the water-level in this channel will
                        fal), bat there are indications to show that the depth mast be much greater
                        than at either Khaibar or Assouan, and it is this fact which renders the
                        site a doubtful one so far as a dam is ooncerned.</p>
                    <p>Rooks and granite reefs are visible at many points of the stream, but the
                        river is not subdivided into a large number of channels as «t Assouan; and
                        the barrier i» not so well defined as either there or at Khaibar. Flank
                        protective works would be easy of construction pere, as the granite hills
                        closely approach the river on either side, more particularly on the eastern
                        bank.</p>
                    <p>A dam, supposing that the depth of watef "permitted of its construction,
                        might be bulb here to Almost any height required. The reservoir would*
                        however, submerge the villa gee and plains of Firfcet; Kosheh, and Ginnis,
                        but the cultivation in tense localities is not of L fihy very great
                        importance.</p>
                    <p>ty would be-the drowning |K (faf Sudan railway, which from Firket to</p>

                    <p>Kosheh skirts the river at a comparatively lov level. Owing to the natare of
                        the'country, the line oouid not well be removed without verj considerable
                        expense in the shape of blasting or tunnelling.</p>
                    <p>Hanjtek.—At first sight of HannAf, one is struck with the advantage possessed
                        "by this cataract for the formation of alow dam, which would permanently
                        raise the bed and sur&amp;cf levels of the river, and thus reduce’ the heigh
                        to which the water has to be raised in summ' i for irrigation purposes. The
                        formation am! position of the reef seem to lend themselves ft such projects.
                        Situated at the north end o the great Merawi-Abou-Fatmeh reach, in which the
                        chief part of the cultivation of theDongols Province is to be found, it
                        is’evident that i: the summer witter-surface coulfl be permanent ly raised
                        fir a few metres, unfcea-iiirabh advantages to irrigation would' be
                        attained</p>
                    <p>Unless, however, this dam were pierced wit! sufficient openings to permit of
                        the free passage of the river in flood, such a work would entail an annual
                        rise in the flood levels for a consider­able distance up-stream. This might
                        involve not only the drowning-out of a considerable area of existing
                        cultivation, but also the sub mersiou of important places like Hafir, New
                        Dongola, eto. Without very careful leveling and a study of the dood-levels,
                        extending ovei a series of years, it would be impossible fit estimate the
                        effect of the construction of s solid dam here. The afflux which might be
                        caused in flood by the raised crest wonld have to be very carefully
                        calculated</p>
                    <p>As a reservoir site Hanufek would be useless A dam of any height oonsistent
                        with the re quirements of water storage would pul a great portion of the
                        provtooe annually under water, and the country upon eithei side of the river
                        being comparatively flat, (he wings on both banks would have to be carried
                        out a great distance.</p>
                    <p>In other respects this cataract is favorable to the construction of such a
                        work. The granite appears to be sound, the islands are numerous, and,
                        according to Da Gottberg, the deepest water in any channel during the summer
                        of 1867 was not more than 2'60 metres</p>
                    <p>Wady Halfa.—The Wady Haifa, or Gamai cataract, although in many ways
                        eminently suited as a site for dam, is, owing to its situation, useless as
                        regards storage area. The river valley up-stream of this point rises
                        steadily some 19 metres in a distance of 179 kilometres, which is equivalent
                        to a slope )f 1/4000.</p>
                    <p>AB8ENCE OF LIMESTONE SoU?H OF ASSOUAN. — In comparing the foregoing Sites
                        with that >f Assouan, it must not be forgotten that south >f the latter
                        place no lime is to be met with, ill required for the work would therefore
                        have x> be imported from a long distanoe, and the sost of masonry would be
                        largely increased.</p>
                    <p>Conclusion. — In conclusion, the Assouan sataraot is, taking into acoount the
                        conditions rath of a good site for a dam and good storage japacity for a
                        reservoir, greatly superior to all itbers. As regards the first point
                        Khaibar is equally good, if not better, but as regards the second, it is

                    <p>Finally, the Irrigation Servioe has always nsisted upon the necessity for the

                        will be delivered, in order to edaoe to a minimum the loss resulting from
                        iv&amp;poration, percolation, eto. If the above be, is it mast be, taken
                        into consideration, then 10 comparison is possible between^UsgjMnfahtk he
                        sites lying further south. The former is rat only the best, but the most
                        northerly site; herefore, even if a series of dams be eventually tODstruoted
                        upon the southern rapids, one at he first cataract will always be a
                        necessity.</p>

                    <p>Ghalib Bey's Rejoinder</p>
                    <p>In our issue of Saturday last we passed some remarks on the subjeot of the
                        recently published pamphlet of Moussa Bey Gbalib,, of> the Ministry of
                        PiiWic ’ 'Works, on the cotton worm. Wpisave since received the following

                        opinion, and we may state furthermore that we are surprised the Ministry of
                        Public Works allowed the writer to issue the work with his official
                        designation appended, as a false impression is thereby giveii to the public,
                        who will consider that the erroneous statements contained therein are
                        endorsed by the imprimatur of the P.W.D.</p>
                    <p>Sir,—I beg to request yotf will kindly allow me to reply to yonir review
                        (against my pam­phlet on the cotton-worm) given in your “Gazette” No. 7145
                        of 11th inst., in which yon say “It is a pity it was ever written and it is
                        so fall of errors that we hope it will not have any wide circulation,” and
                        have the present inserted in your newspaper.</p>
                    <p>The oommon oj^cle of the ootton-wbrm, is lmown lfidre than 35 years ago, and
                        till now no useful method was obtained to prevent the evil effected'Bjf worm
                        to the crop*.</p>
                    <p>In my pamphlet(quite disapproved by yon) off this sihject fo: which 1 pointed
                        out the measures to be talked For prevention against this calamity, F did
                        not mention that the Worm a PmdUqodtr^ta the de^ I Jmd down that dew and
                        continuation of dampness are a means for the production and appearaneq of
                        wqrms, basing my prospect upon the worm which never apjfoart in crops before
                        the faji of dews. For this reason I stated that the eggs must be in the air,
                        and the moths do not Jay eggs directly on the leaves; and specially traces
                        of this incalculable bevy of moths are scarcely seen before the production
                        and apparition of worms in (Stops.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, no one of the cycle-inquirers stat­ed that he saw by his own eyes
                        the moth in time it lays its eggs directly on the leaves of crops in fields.
                        All their depositions were based upon the sight of eggs of this insect on
                        the leaves and their hatching and upon the know­ledge of its last phase
                        which is tee moth.</p>
                    <p>All experiments made for keeping in moths in some particular places in order
                        to know the manner of production did not come to a deci­sive point as to
                        whether moths lay directly eggs on the leaves or in the air whereby descend
                        on the plants. If I have admitted the presence of eggB in the air, that was
                        after, many observations and reasonable arguments I stated in my
                        pamphlet.</p>
                    <p>Now I can give yon a new proof. The worm of cotton, maize, clover, wheat,
                        being of the same order, where does it, sometimes in some lands of Upper
                        Egypt which remain flooded more than 8 months, appear from, and then eats
                        roots of corn aud olover whereas some years wonld have passed before its
                        last apparition !</p>
                    <p>Where, were the chrysalides kept in and how did moths and eggs appear, if not
                        transported by wind from other places 1</p>
                    <p>As to the foot that worms appear in land or on leaves, in some crops without
                        reaching others, that depends on the middle proper for the egg hatching to
                        which oontribnte the early and late sowing, foil and less watering, the
                        dis-! tanoe between the plants, the quantity of ma-1 unre and difference of
                        its org&amp;nio constituents.</p>
                    <p>However I told in my note that whether be exact the theory of presence of
                        eggs in the air, (according to my opinion) or the moth lays direotly eggs on
                        the leaves, the measures sag-j gested in my pamphlet must at any rate be 1
                        followed to prevent the evil, which measures do not require any expenses or
                        imply fatigues to the proprietors. Also I have not asked more than try these
                        measures in some fields for preventive against apparition of worms, aim of t
                        ery agriculturist.</p>
                    <p>Notwithstanding I did not pretend to be a zoologist. I merely set forth my
                        own opinion as irrigation engineer and expert in matter of Egyptian culture.
                        I think there is no evil .i.</p>
                    <p>I-hope the near future will disoover the truth.</p>
                    <p>Now I request you will kindly read again my pamphlet in original (vernaoular)
                        and thjC translation so that you may be oonrinoed of the acouraoy of my

                    <head>Under the Mosquito Net</head>
                    <p>Two letters that I have received on some of the various subjects relative to
                        the Egyptian people npon which I have written in this column, merit more
                        than passing notice, and I regret that the space at my disposal will not
                        permit ofmy dealing with them at the length I should like to. »</p>
                    <p>One is from the writer who signed himself “A Resident in Upper Egypt” in a
                        letter to the “Gazette” upon which 1 commented some weeks ago, the other
                        from a well-known resident in the Fayoum. Both these gentlemen write from
                        long experience of the village life of Egypt, and as 1 know that full
                        relianoe can be placed upon their testimony I am exceed­ingly glad to be
                        placed in .possession of their views.</p>
                    <p>On the subject of “Missions to Mohamedans,” which I hope will be the topic of
                        a good many more letters to the “Gazette” than have already appeared,—for it
                        is one of the most important questions of the day,—my attention is called to
                        a sermon by Canon Oldfield, who recently left Egypt alter working here for
                        some years as the representative of the Association for the Furtherance of
                        Christianity in Egypt I have only space for a very few extracts lrom this
                        sermon, which has been published by the S. P. C. K. and shuuld be read by
                        all interested in: the question.</p>
                    <p>The Canon, after showing that Western melhuds. are quite unsuitable with
                        Eastern people aud must inevitably fail,goes on to say; —“The educated Copt
                        of the future will be the natural means of placing Christianity in a light
                        that Mohamedans can accept,” and that “Here is God’s instrument, ready to
                        hand.”</p>
                    <p>The Copt “has higher intellectual ability; greater power of mental
                        concentration; a na­tural capacity for assimilating the teaching of the West
                        and clothing it in an Eastern garb; he knows all the unexpected twists and
                        turns of an Eastern mind—here’ surely is the instru­ment ready to hand, only
                        requiring to be brightened and sharpened.” But, he adds, “a Copt turned into
                        a Western tjpe of Christian ] is often spoiled in the process.”...“He is
                        capable l of forming a natural link between the thought of East and West;
                        but if he be wholly Westeri * ised this capacity ceases to exist.”</p>
                    <p>And, adds my correspondent, this Westernis­ing is the sole work of tbe
                        American mission­aries in Egypt, and they do a lot of harm.</p>
                    <p>I trust that before long he will 6end an­other letter to the “Gazette,” for
                        he says he has “determined to write about very important questions? and to
                        tell the English sincerely and i frankly the views of the natives on
                        important i topics,” adding, - “I am an Egyptian (Copt) 1 right to the
                        backbone.” .</p>
                    <p>In the days to come it will doubtless be seen that the best way of governing
                        the Bgyp- 1 tian people will be by means of native officials who are in
                        touch with English advisers. As things^re now, the ’'native subordinates of
                        an English official ask themselves this question, “What mast we do not to
                        get into trouble with that man T” whereas, if the ofijcial is a : native,
                        the question is, “What can we do to please our chief 1” Willing or
                        un­willing service, which is best, all the world over, and in every
                        conceivable situation in life?</p>
                    <p>I am again reminded of the urgency of the question of curtailing the
                        facilities enjoyed by the fellaheen for obtaining intoxicating liquors.
                        Here, .again, Ii think it isi the native teacher who is wanted in order that
                        real and permanent good may be dene, and the growing habit of drinking in
                        excess cheeked.</p>
                    <p> And another question is pressed upon,me, that of the baksheesh demanded
                        from, or-as I would put, it the blackmail levied on the fellaheen by the
                        officials upon whom the small</p>

                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>landowners are so greatly 'dependent for th&lt; lecessary water for their
                        crops. Here are a lev ixtracte from the Fayoum letter: ‘‘Baksheesl ond
                        bribery still exist in the provinces amonj he native district irrigation
                        engineers, anc Jso the young employes of the Moudireh specially in
                        thetinance department.”.. .“ifriArrj j-ists in the country as much as during
                        t/u "urkish rule.”</p>
                    <p>1 sincerely hope that this latter statement 3 true to only a very limited
                        extent, otherwiw t would seem that while British rule hai .bolished the
                        extortionate tax-gatherer, it hat ett untouched another evil ot only less
                        mag litude. As 1 remarked a week or two ago, tb&lt; oseate picture drawn by
                        Sir Howard Viuceni vas too highly coloured.</p>
                    <p>The worst featureconuected with this systen >f demanding baksheesh for all
                        and everj iervice rendered by the native, is the fact that t extends to such
                        work as should be willingl) jerfurmed for the benefit of suffering humanity
                        tut no I 1 am told that unless poor peoph rho meet with accidents resulting
                        in broker uubs, etc., are prepared to pay baksheesh, tht lakim (or native
                        doctor) reports unfavorablj s to their cases to the Markaz.</p>
                    <p>This is certainly a serious state of things, nd when, in addition, the tact
                        is considereo hat the duties of the hakim frequently extend vera large area
                        of ground and to severaJ lhages, so that his services are often noi •vanabie
                        in cases ot emergency, it appears at f an opportunity for enquiry in this
                        direction undoubtedly presents iteelt, and should only equire to be brought
                        to the notice of th&lt; authorities, in order that the present lament ,ble
                        state ot things may be altered for the letter.</p>
                    <p>It is a great pleasure to me to commend t&lt; he notice of readers of the
                        “Gazette” the urrent number (dated 16th March) of “Orienl aid Ueeideut.”
                        Mission work on which all cat ordialiy agree f orms the principal topic of
                        this reek's issue, viz., the exercise of love instead f cruelty in our
                        treatment of the animal rorid.</p>
                    <p>I will not anticipate, or spoil the reader’s ujoyment,by writing on the two
                        very excellent .nicies that the magazine contains, but contenl ay self with
                        expressing the hupe that they wifi ie widely read, and rivet themselves on
                        the niuds of people who, 1 fear, do not think hall inough about the
                        sufferings wantonly indicted in the animal kingdom by man.</p>
                    <p>Heartily do I hope that in one way or au ither public opinion may be aroused
                        on thn [uestiou. 1 will indulge in just one quotatior rom one of the
                        magazine articles which accu ately sums up the whole matter: "Cruelty ii
                        tegradiug to the individual and injurious to tin ational life ; it is part
                        of the duty of philan hropy and patriotism also to fight it in everj
                        iossible way.”</p>
                    <p>The S.P.C. A. does excellen t work, especially n such a hospital as that at
                        Boulac, when .nimals found suffering from inhuman treat cent receive care
                        and attention. The societyi ifforts, however, are confined to horses, asses
                        miles, and camels only, aud cases of cruelty u ither animals and birds are
                        apparently allowec o pass unnoticed.</p>
                    <p>But surely some law exists by which sue! sruelty to birds as that described
                        as taking ilace along the route of the Nile steamers, ii t latter to the
                        ‘(Gazette” afow days ago, can, u iome measure, be prevented! And yet,
                        grievoni isit is tb read of birds being maimed in ordei o get money from
                        tourists, it should be equal y repulsive to think of pigeods being woundec
                        jy gun shot in matches at which a fashiunabliirowdenjoys the “sport"</p>
                    <p>One is the cruelty of ignorance and greed o noney combined, the other the
                        refined cruelt; of selfish, well-dressed, and presumably well educated

                        d’irrecevabilite.</p>
                    <p>Attendu, au fond, que e’est d’une manure vague et sans precision suffisaute
                        que la de- inauderesse compagnie formule les motifs sur lesquels elle se
                        base pour soutenir la nullite de la procedure suivie par la Municipality
                        dans l’impositiou de ses immeubles, nullite resultant de la non-observation
                        des dispositions pree- crites p&amp;r le decret du 13 mars 1884.</p>
                    <p>Que ueanmoins ces motifs pourraient se resumer: a) à la cumulation entre Us
                        mains des services municipaux dee operations de receusement et devaluation,
                        b) au defant de publicite des etats de receusement et deva­luation, ce qui
                        anrait empAchA les propriAtaires et autres intAressAs de presenter lours
                        observa­tions et c) à la non production des procAs-ver. baux constatant
                        l'extraction par la voie da sort des nomB oomposant les commissions
                        devalua­tion et de revision, conformement à l’art 4 du subdit deoret.</p>
                    <p>Attendu d’abord que e’est fort douteux, si la Municipalite, une lois la
                        procedure de l’impo- sition terminAe, est tenne de oonserver à l’Ater- nite
                        les prooAs-verbaux de publicite, affichage et extraction au sort, pour
                        servir à oeux qui auraient un jonr envie de l’attaquer pour inobeervation ;
                        que la production des extraits, certifies conformes, de ses regis- tres,
                        dans lesquels on voit figurer sur le oorps de la feuille le reoensement fait
                        par l’administration et en marge revaluation de chaqe bktisse reoensAe, aveo
                        mention dee noins des membres de oes commissions fait presumer que la
                        designation de oes membres a ete faite confonmAment à la loi, car on ne
                        pourrait an- trement s’expliquer comment toutes oes per­sonnel appartenant k
                        la oategorie des propriA- taires de laville d’Alexandrie, auraient pn
                        accepter leur designation et procAder aux ope­rations 4? revaluation et de
                        la revision s’ils savaient d’avance que leur designation etait entachee
                        d’une nullite radioale et n’etait que l’ceuvre d’un tripotage.</p>
                    <p>Mais attendu dans tous les cas que la Cie demanderesee ne dAnie pas
                        formeUement la sincerity des registras de la Muaioipalite, ni des extraits
                        produits</p>
                    <p>Que la Cie demanderesee est loin de pou- voir se plaindre de dAfaut de
                        publicity</p>
                    <p>Qn’ainsi la pretendue nullitA dels procedure suivie par la Municipality dans
                        l’unposition des immeubles de la demanderesae n’est pas snffi ■anunent

                        et, malgrd lei faibles arrivages, les coure sont restds trks bas, Ainsi,
                        alora que depuis Ddcembre dernier or escomptait des prix dlevds pour cette a
                        mule, ce qui permettait à tout le monde de se rattrapei des pertes subies
                        l’anude derniere, il s’est pro dnit le contraire, et de Fes. 52 à 53 pour
                        IOC kilos cat port frangais, que valait Particle fir Ddcembre 1904, il est

                    <p>Ceci est dft principalement aux stocks ac cumulus en Europe chez les
                        consommateurs, con fiseurs, droguistes, etc., voire chez les gro: ndgociants
                        importateure. Les consommateurs pourvns poor plusieure mois, ne se
                        ddoidaieni plus à faire de nonveaux achats qu’k des prix ddrisoires et dans
                        le seul but de se order ur stock permanent pour parer à toute dventua Ltd.
                        En outre, les offiies qu’ils recevaient direc tement de l’Egypte
                        contribuaient à les rendre plus mdfiants et plus exigeants.Les ndgociants, k
                        leur tour, ont dtd obligds de nous offrir des prix qui n’ont jamais dtd
                        pratiquds à ce jour.</p>
                    <p>En second lieu, l’argent manquant au marche d’Omdurman, par suite duf refus
                        formel das banquiere d’avancer de 1’argent aux petits nd- gociants, il n’y a
                        pas eu la concurrence ndees- saire et e’est ainsi que malgrd les arrivages
                        peu importants, Particle est tombd, faute d’ache- teure, à P.T. 51,50 le
                        cantar soudanais de 49 kilos environ. Ce prix s’entend merchandise prise k
                        Omdurman et dquivaudrait, tous frais ajoutd*, à Fes. 49 environ ponr 100
                        kilos ca( Marseille ou le Hkvre.</p>
                    <p>Ces prix prdjudiciables ont influence les in­digenes au point de diminuer
                        encore les impor­tations (d’ailleurs, par suite du froid exception- nel, il
                        y a cette anude moins de gomme qu’er 1904), de sorte que ces derniere jours
                        lea am vages à Douem sont tombds à 250-300 cantars par jour, alore que
                        l’annde demidre il en arri vait 1.000 à 1.200 joumellement. Si ceci
                        continue, tout fait prdvoir que d’ici fin Juillet,dpoque à laquelle les
                        arrivages finissent, la rdcolte totale atteindra à peine 110 à 115.000
                        cantars, contre 235.000 l'annde dernidre, à moins que les prix augmentant,
                        les arrivages n’augmentent dgalement. Ces prdvisions ont produit une
                        certaine activitd à Khartoum et, comme oonsdquence, nous venons d’avoit une
                        hausse de 3 £ piastres par cantar. On ne void pas actuellement au dessous de
                        P.T. 55 le can- tar et peutAtre nous verrons des prix plus dlevds, sinon

                    <p>The present position of the company's various holdings</p>
                    <p>The fourth annual general meeting of the £ shareholders of the Egyptian Mines
                        Explora- tion Company, Limited, was held on the 7th u . rest., at Wiuchosier
                        House, Old Broad-street, g( London, E.C., Mr^fyndale White (the chair- w
                        man) presiding. j</p>
                    <p>The Secretary (Mr. E. S. G. Malius) read the gj notice convening the meeting
                        and the auditors’ u report. . ^</p>
                    <p>. The Chairman said : You have all had for g( some days copies of the report
                        and balance- v sheet in your possession, and I presume you will wish to take
                        the same as read. That being a your pleasure, I may say our financial
                        position t is so clearly set out in the balance sheet, and | the information
                        contained in Mr. Alford’s c report respectingthe work at the different
                        places g where exploration is proceeding is so full, that j very little is
                        left for me to add by way of £ further inlormation. Your directors have
                        every , reason to believe that in the near future the ^ 129,499 shares held
                        by your company in the £ subsidiary companies already formed will show t a
                        very- handsome profit, and you must not 0 forget that your company «is
                        entitled to a con- j siderable interest in any companies hereafter £ formed
                        to take up and work mining leases in the Fatira and Eridia Companies’
                        districts. A • j property in which the developments justify the | early
                        flotation of a mining company is Atallah, j where, you will notice, the
                        assays are of an j exceedingly encouraging nature, and since Mr. 1 Alford’s
                        report was written thefollowing assays have come to hand :•— No. &lt; 1

                        results also at £ Eridia are very encouraging, and here we have an area of
                        valuable reefs over five miles in ^ extent, which should one day support a
                        great j many companies, in all of which we shall Le , large shareholders.
                        I#S« not outside the bounds j of possibility that-Eridia might one day
                        become the Kalgurli of Egypt. We expect great things j at Semna, where the
                        indications left by the 1 ancients are of great extent and apparent depth,
                        and the vein is wider than we have found it at any other centre so far. Work
                        has been suspended at Fatira, mainly because it would require a considerable
                        expenditure on ; pumping machinery to go further, and the | development
                        there is amply sufficient and encouraging to justify a subsidiary company
                        with sufficient capital to take out a mining lease and develop a good mine,
                        with every prospect of success. The ancient workings here extend over a very
                        large distriot, and the ancient slime heaps in the wady contain thou­sands
                        of tons of slime. Mr. Alford considered, however, that it was much more in
                        all our in­terests to suspend the work here for the pre­sent, and to spend
                        money in proving what we believe to be a very valuable property at
                        Semna.</p>
                    <p>From Um Rus we are expecting to hear any day the results of the first
                        crushing, which should make your holding in this company a valuable asset.
                        Well, we have secured for you the 129,499 shares set out in the note in the
                        balance-sheet for a total expenditure of £29,873, and, ss I mentioned just
                        now, we are entitled to fur-! (her shares in any company or companies</p>

                    <p>Making up mining leases, in the Fatira and g iridia Companies’ districts, and
                        we have, in e Edition, a vast district south of the Wady ilammama, where we
                        know of seven ancient ( nining centres ; but this district has prac- ,
                        ically not yet been touched. By the balance- j iheet you will see that we
                        have in cash and j alls (the latter payable at fixed rates) some ( £9,300,
                        and also £1,000 invested, and you s sill further notice we have 35,000
                        shares still ( inissued ; so that our financial position is , sound,
                        especially when you consider that the t rork now being carried on on your
                        concession | s being done at the expense of the several sub- r iidiary
                        companies.The boring forcoal which was s mdertaken by the Keneh Company last
                        year j las not so far resulted in fiuding a workable s seam; but I can
                        assure you there are many men, f who ought to know, who believe thatcoal
                        exists, , and we feel confident that if those gentlemen ; are right, if
                        must, from the geological forma-tion of a portion of our concession, exist
                        there. ( Nothing has yet been done with the extensive deposits of phosphate
                        of lime on the western , side of our concession. In March last year we { had
                        further samples of these deposits sent home, and they were analysed iu
                        London by Messrs. Voelcker and Sons, with the result</p>
                    <p>that one sample gave 71’78 per cent., three others gave 60 per cent., while
                        the average of the seven samples resulted in giving 5875 per cent of
                        tribasic phosphate of lime. We have little doubt that presently these
                        deposits will be worked, and on terms very favorable to ' your interests. As
                        stated in -Mr. Alford’s re¬port, there is no difficulty in obtaining nil
                        the. labour we require, and the Arabs are develop¬ing into good, practical
                        miners. You will also be pleased to know that at alLlhemines where work is
                        proceeding, there is an ample supply of water from the wells that have been
                        con¬structed aud reopened on our prospectingarea.</p>
                    <p>It will also, I am sure, be a great satisfaction to you, as it has been to
                        us, to know that during the past year the staff of Europeans have enjoyed
                        excellent health, aud accidents or sickness among the native employes have
                        been. rare. In conclusion, -I would say no praise could be too great for Mr.
                        Western and our engineers working under him, and 1 am sure you will
                        authorise the directors to add your thanks to theirs to these gentlemen for
                        the loyal and efficient manner in which they have carried out their work
                        during the past year. I now have much pleasure in moving the following
                        resolution : “That the directors’ re¬port and balance sheet to December 3
                        if1904, now submitted to the shareholders, be, and is hereby, adopted.’’
                        (Applause).</p>
                    <p>Colonel M. Lockwood, M.P., seconded the motion.</p>
                    <p>Mr. P. E. Beachcroft said : I am sure’ we are- all satisfied with the very
                        conservative report and accounts which you have presented to us, and, if I
                        may say so, they strike me as being a little too conservative. It is true
                        that in some cases it is impossible to put a value upon the shares which you
                        have received from some of the subsidiary companiesbut in other cases I
                        apprehend that it is not so difficult. Now, With regard to the Um Rus and
                        the Central Egypt Exploration shares, there is, I believe, a market value
                        for them. In a rough estimate I have made of the assets which you hold, I
                        take it that we have at the present moment a known value—without taki*g into
                        considera¬tion any potential value — of close upon £160,000 ; and taking the
                        Fatira and Eridia a3 being only of the value that you have put upon them,
                        namely, £25,000, and taking the Um Rns at the present value of l^V and the
                        Central Egypt at If—you would not.be able to dispose ot 30,000 or 50,000 at
                        that price,</p>
                    <p>| but it is a fair market value—their present ( market value would be
                        £160,000 of valuable</p>
                    <cols n="6"/>
                    <cb n="3"/>
                    <p>assets, including the £10,300 yon have al¬ready taken credit for. It
                        therefore seems to me that you are too conservative when you put a footnote
                        stating “it is not possible to place a value on the above shares at the
                        pre¬sent time,” and, if you will allow me, I take exception to that. I wonld
                        like to ask you, having taken into' consideration this portion of the assets
                        that you have disposed of by way ( of subsidiary companies, what ypu
                        estimate to be the balance of the property which we hold —what would be,
                        roughly speaking, the area 1 Because, if I am right in my estimate, the
                        remainder of the capital only amounts to some¬thing like £50,000 or £55,000.
                        Now, if we have w good value for that £55,000, all I can say is w that we
                        are not shrewd men of business ^ when we allow the shares of this company ^
                        to be knoclung about for 15s. each, p That is a criticism L make, and, if I
                        am right g in my assumption, I would like to know why this should be. I do
                        not suppose any mining j company in this country possesses a mining ■y
                        expert and engineer of the unsullied reputation j of Mr. Alford. (Applause.)
                        Mr. Alford is a min g who is known to everybody connected with 0 mining, and
                        I had the pleasure of seeing j him with regard to the Um Rus Mine, which I E
                        understand is now not a prospect, but a paya- t ble mine. We are working
                        under the auspices t of a man in the front rank of mining engineers, £ I am
                        a little sorry that, out of all the assets s I you have disposed of, only in
                        one oase, namely, c the Um Rus, have you obtained your conside- £ ration in
                        cash. In the other instances you have j. received shares. You no doubt had
                        your reasons a for that, and, as I have said, you are a very £ conservative
                        body ot men, and it is a pleasure j to be under such a careful
                        administration. You £ have a good cash balance, and with all the c assets
                        and the cash balance I would venture to suggest that perhaps you will
                        hesitate before £ you issue any of those 35,000 unissued shares, B unless
                        there is very good reason for doing so. 5 I think it would be better if our
                        capital re¬mained at £215,000, instead of the authorised t capital of
                        £250,000, unless you are going to make a considerable profit out of it I
                        congra- r tulate you upon the progress you have made, and I only hope that
                        when we meet next year t</p>
                    <p>we shall hear from your lips a resolution which 1 will be that we shall
                        receive something more c</p>
                    <p>substantial than promises—I hope a very sub- ( 1 Btantial dividend. s</p>
                    <p>The Chairman said that he was very much n 1 obliged to Mr. IWchcroit for his
                        criticism,</p>
                    <p>who always said what he had to say in a j “ terse and friendly manner. With
                        regard to the 1 footm te to which Mr. Beachcroft took ex- 3 ception, he
                        might say, without divulging any „ 1 secret, that he was a little bit of his
                        way of ></p>
                    <p>thinking that those were shares to which t 8 value should be attached, and
                        that therefore c 3 they might have made a better show in the « 1 1
                        Milan.-e-shcef. His opinion, however, was over c ' ruled by the auditors,
                        who insisted upon j 3 stating it iu the manner in which it appeared 1 r in
                        tl-c accounts, and they were obliged to</p>
                    <p>satisfy them. The auditors were in the room, j</p>
                    <p>and they would confirm what he had stated i 3 with_regard to the footsote to
                        which Mr. , 1 Beachcroft had alluded. He would ask Mr. ,</p>
                    <p>Skinner to reply to the question with regard , ~ to the company’s remaining
                        interests. Mr. ,</p>
                    <p>Skinner had been all through their concessions, ( Q and he could therefore
                        give them better in- | e formation on that important question than he ]</p>
                    <p>himself could. i</p>
                    <p>y Mr. C. Weeding Skinner: As some of you </p>
                    <p>are aware, when our last annual meeting took I ® place, I was in Egypt. I
                        went out there with ’ ' Mr. Alford, and I went over all the concessions | r
                        that yofl hold. I can assure you that, after ] ® what I saw there, I was
                        quite surprised at the 1</p>
                    <p>extent and the^normous number of old work- 0 ings and the vasthxss of them.
                        Of course, the</p>
                    <p>few places that we have been developing to a 1 8 condition to be leased and
                        taken up by mining</p>
                    <p>companies are really a very small bit of the ■</p>
                    <p>whole of our concession. On the north of the concession we have several
                        properties which</p>
                    <p>y look like turning out very variable mines, and</p>
                    <p>1 on the other side, in the south part of the con¬cession—the Keneh-Kosseir
                        Road—there are</p>
                    <p>t seven or eight large ancient workings, which we have seen. They have not
                        been touched,</p>
                    <p>and, if we only have the money, and if the</p>
                    <p>shareholders, after seeing and hearing what they have heard to-day, are
                        prepared to come</p>
                    <p>(l in and subscribe for the balance of the capital, n I have no doubt that
                        they could make very ^ favorable terms with the people who have the options
                        on those shares. If you would do that, .you would put us in a position to
                        expend . money on this other part of the property which we have not yet
                        touched, and that 0 would make the time shorter when you would ’ t receive
                        large profits. At the present time we have Um Rus, which is undoubtedly a
                        very i valuable property. I weut down 450 ft. there, and I saw the first
                        shot put in to get into the '</p>
                    <p>10 level at 450 ft. Since I was there, they hhye gone down a lot further;
                        they have made</p>
                    <p>re- their shaft a permanent on6, and, as the chair- rt man has told you, we
                        are expecting any day, s, and every day, to receive information announc- a
                        ing the first crushing taking place there.</p>
                    <p>e When I was there the place was more or less le a wilderness, with only two
                        wooden houses of inhabited by the Europeans ; but now, judging es from the
                        photographs, and from the informa- w, tion I have received, it is quite a
                        little town, al The machinery that has been put up there is a of the very
                        latest description, and we expect</p>
                    <p>very great things from there. There was a I very large amount of ore at grass
                        when I was</p>
                    <p>a out there, which, from a very large sample, a- showed over 1 oz. to the
                        ton. I can assure un you that, in my opinion, you have a very lia valuable
                        concession there, and that yon will ut derive very large profits, if you
                        have the he money to go on and develop it. he Mr. Beachcroft: Mr. 8kinner’s

                        another mine at Atallah, which we sha! «in a position to taka a lease of and

                        certainly we have not disposed c nore than a fourth of our property.</p>
                    <p>Mr.' Beachcroft: If I remember right w iave some 10,000 square miles, or
                        thereabout ,nd may I ask if we have disposed of onl 1,500 square miles, or
                        one quarter ?</p>
                    <p>Mr.-Skinner: I should say that we ha\ lot disposed of that.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Beachcroft: That means that we hat low three-quarters of our property in
                        hand.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Skinner : We have disposed of it t he development companies—the one to tb
                        lorth of the Keneh-Kosseir road has bee liapoeed of to the Central Egypt
                        Exploratio Company, and the part untouched you ma ay is more than one-half
                        below that—th ;outh of the road.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Beachcroft: Still, we have at least 5 >er cent, of our original holdings
                        iu hand.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Skinner: Undoubtedly.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Beachcroft: I did not ask the questio ibout the water supply; but 1 think
                        it is rery material one which ithiuk you willbeabl o answer satisfactorily.
                        There have been som sriticisms made to the effect that at Fowahki ind on the
                        Atallah Mine we have not sufl iieut water to carry on operations. I believ
                        rou have got sufficient water: but I shoul ike to hear your remarks on this
                        subject.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Skinner : With regard to the water, tb particular place Mr. Beachcroft
                        meutione s Fowakhir. There is a well there always fu red always running, aud
                        it is in fact one of tb wells of the desert, and we have opened ai ither
                        well there, and there is any amount 1 water to be had at that particular
                        place. I ma »y yon will find partridges and all sorts i birds and animals
                        that come iu from differei parts of the desert because of the water to l
                        found there. It is the most watered part of tl lerert. At all the ch^ier
                        places where we ha\ been working we have opened up ancient wel which had
                        been filled up by the Arabs in timi gone by simply to keep Europeans and
                        othi people out of the desert, because you canm live there without water.
                        The Arabs do ever thing >to keep the place to themselves, ar therefore
                        filled up the wells. We have take stones out of these wells
                        weighingsomehundrei weights. We have put down *a lot of wel of our own, and
                        in one out of every thn where we have gone for water, we have four it. We
                        have in every fttie of our mines plenl of water, both for drinking and other
                        purpose</p>
                    <p> A Shareholder said the prospectus stati that they had in the Fatira property
                        1,(X square miles, in the Eridia property !,0( square miles, and in Central
                        Egypt a litt over 1,000 square miles, which left 7,0 miles unexplored, and
                        probably Mr. Beac croft would remember that in the Eridia at Fatira this
                        company was- entitled to on third of everything ; so that only thre sevenths
                        of the property was disposed c and they would get one-third of whatev was
                        found.</p>
                    <p> Mr. Beachcroft stated that he had ma the remarks, he had because the public
                        large did not know what they had got. I sould not understand why their
                        shares sto their present depreciated value, whi</p>

                    <p>the Nile Valley Company’s shares were standing at a good premium.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman remarked that he was quite of Mr. Beachcroft's opinion that it
                        was not for the directors to concern themselves about the prices of shares.
                        With regard to water he would like to direct their attention t( the remarks
                        of Mr. Alford, who said that some of these places would have to be worker
                        under one comprehensive scheme.</p>
                    <p>The resolution was carried unanimously. Mr. Skinner proposed the re-election

                    <p>In most cases the Mikado's Government has neither affirmed nor denied the
                        loss of ships reported almost weekly during the blockade of Port Arthur, and
                        silence has proved golden in that the Russian succours wandering aimlessly
                        off the East African Coast have not the slight-est notion of the strength of
                        Admiral Togo's fleet. They may have to face five battleships, they may have
                        to face three. The strength of the Japanese destroyer and submarine
                        flotillas is equally unknown. Now and again stories come of fleets 20 strong
                        seen cruising 100 miles E. of Hongkong or of a host of torpedo craft
                        patrolling Formosan waters, but nothing definite and precise.</p>
                    <p>And if the Japanese secrecy in regard to their naval operations has been
                        successful it has been more successful on land, where, what with Chinamen
                        and correspondents, the chnces of leakage of important news are infinitely
                        greater. But Japan has succeeded up to the great fight at Mukden in keeping
                        concealed the whereabouts of some of her principal units. At Liao-Yang the
                        Guard, 2nd and 12th divi-sions under Kuroki, the 5th and 10th under Nodzu,
                        and the 3rd, 4th and 6th under Oku, with several reserve brigades, formed
                        the Ja-panese army. The 1st was known to have been left at Port Arthur ;
                        where were the rest? In the autumn it became known that the 9th and 11th
                        were at Port Arthur, and early in 1905 it transpired that the 8th had played
                        a promi-nent part at Heikontai. Then there was the 7th; it was only a few
                        days ago that the "Times" correspondent informed the world that this force,
                        destined to conquer Saghalien (said some) or hold Korea, according to
                        others, had actually arrived in November in time to storm the 203-Metre
                        Hill. As for the indepen-dent reserve brigades, no one seems sure of their
                        exact position, nor of the nature of the army of occupation in Korea</p>
                    <p>And then in the height of the battle of Mukden three territorial divisions
                        under General Kawamura, who, as all the world believed, was landing in N.
                        Korea and pre=paring to assail Vladivostock, appear on General Linievitch
                        and for all the Russian leaders. For this successful calculated secrecy
                        means that you have a whole people before you that is not only patriotic -
                        most people can feel and talk for their country - but has the power of
                        understanding what the pro-secution of a successful war demands. Other
                        nations have scarificed lives in war with the same iron patriotism, others
                        have trained their hearts and wills to accept war, not as a horror and an
                        abomination, nor as a field for theatricals, but as a necessary if highly
                        disagreeable incident in international relations; but none have sacrificed
                        their comfort so far as to refrain from writing or talking copious-ly in
                        war-time, to the great comfort of them-selves and their enemy's Intelligence
                        Depart-ment.</p>
