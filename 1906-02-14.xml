                    <head>THE FRONTIER QUESTION</head>
                    <p>The newa that the Akaba frontier qnef tior will in all probability be settled
                        in the cex few days, will be received with general satis¬faction, bat in
                        view of the maidents on tb» western and eastern boundaries of Egypt which
                        have ooonrved during the paet eighteen nenthe, it would, ia oar opinion, be
                        well if the Porte and the Khedivial Government fmnd it pos¬sible to arrange
                        for the early and thorough delimitation of the land frontiers of Egypt and
                        Tripoli on the one hand and of Egypt and Syria on the other. As long ai
                        theie frontiers remain urrdefinel, there is always a certain risk of what is
                        ejphemistiorily termed ‘an incident' oooorring, and happen ng-i of this
                        nature, though regarded at present with a light heart in Alexandria and
                        Cairo, might have a disturbing iufiuenoe in thd future. An finoideut’ on any
                        fro itier is in ninety oine oases out of a hundred settled by the good senre
                        of the «fR rials oivil or militvy on each side, and Sinai is at present of
                        in¬terest and importance to none hat arobeeo- logists, and students of the
                        wanderings of the twelve tribes. But when the Akaba and perhaps El Arish and
                        Port Said are linked with Constantinople by a system of military railways,
                        and when the Turkish hand has closed tightly over Syria and Northern Arabia,
                        the ohanoe of unintentional violations of the frontier will iu or ease pari
                        passu with the augmentation of the Ottoman forces in those regions, and the
                        delimitation of the frontier will become absolutely neoessary. ‘Incidents’
                        under such oircumstanoes mast oause a certain amount of disquiet and react
                        injuriously on oommeroe and tr^de. Fi- nance is always sensitive to
                        political possibili¬ties and when the Turkish Government be- oomes capable
                        of transporting large foroes by rail to Syria and N. Arabia, where six
                        divisions —seme ninety thousand men —oan already be mobilised, the slightest
                        inoident, aud much more an accidental collision—always poasib’e on an
                        ill-defined frontier—might oause consi¬derable alarm in Egypt. The relations
                        of the Khedivial Government with its Suzerain are excellent, and the British
                        Government, which is deeply interested in the fature of Egypt and the Sudan,
                        has always shown itself amiosbly disposed towards the Porte on all Egyptian
                        questions. But whatever the relations between the above-mentioned Statee, no
                        amount of friendliness between Governments need ever prevent their obtaining
                        guarantees against future difficulties. We write under correction, but it
                        seems to ns that a delimitation of the frontiers between Tarkey and Egypt is
                        neoessary, aud that the adoption of this course may save con¬siderable
                        trouble in the fature. Of course it takes two to make a bargain and to mark
                        a boundary, and the Porte m«y, for reasons of its own, be unwilling to
                        despatch a oommission to the Tureo-Bgyptian frontier, but we can see DO
                        reason why the Ottoman Government should refuse to follow a polioy than can
                        do it no injury, and should make the relations between the governments
                        involved even more friendly than before. </p>

                    <p>INDEPENDENCE OF SUEZ CANAL. The military value of the line of railway
                        connecting Berber with the Red Sea, a military authority points out, may be
                        secondary to the development of the Sudan provinoe, but it has also great
                        importance. It his its stra-tegic advantages, for it must obviously shorten
                        'he land route to India, and makes us inde¬pendent of the Suez Canal should
                        it eyer be blooked at a oruo;al moment, or should any international
                        difficulties arise as to the conveyance of troops along its neutral waters.
                        It implies, of coarse, the free use of the Mediterranean, bat we hardly dare
                        to con¬template its being denied to ns, or that we should surrender it
                        lightly. There are those who argue, not without reason, that our ultimate
                        communication with India is by sea, round the Cape of Good Hope, but time is
                        the essence of the problem, and safety may depend entirely upon the saving
                        of a few weeks. Egypt will be far superior then to South Afrioa as ao
                        advance base, and could be filled with a considerable force ready for prompt
                        reii forcemeat if danger came suddenly on the north-west frontier. When or

                        the long ron is firmly believed by experts, Lird Roberts among the number,
                        and on such a scale that not even the loyalty of our Japanese allies, if we
                        oan count upon and choose to accept their assistance, can saffioe for the

                    <p>The cab strike at Akxaadria still continues, much to the dissatinfactioa of
                        the inhabitants, who are immensely inconvenienced. The Commandant of Police,
                        this morning, advised the strikers to resame work and pro¬mised that the new
                        tariff wonld be considered to-day by the Municipal Commission, but the
                        oabmen staunchly refused to follow his advice aud eviuoed a firmer desire to
                        go on with the strike.They hope that by adopting this attitude their demands
                        will be satisfied. At the Municipal meeting held this morning, the question
                        of the strike was not discassed owing to the non-pessumus attitude of the
                        men. The Commission will not meet again for a month, and the Commandant of
                        Police has a* andoned his pn ject of drawing up a new tariff. The Parquet
                        summoned a number of oab- m«n, a rested during the past few days, and held
                        an enquiry into the oharges against them. They were chiefly aoonsed of

                    <p>SUEZ, Tue>day. A few dayi ago, two very audacious rob¬beries took place in
                        Suez and Port Tewfik, and the victim* were two ve y well koown Eng’i-h
                        families. In broad day ighc last Friday, a thief entered a hou e in Suez aud
                        made off with a new overcoat and a very valaable Persian carpet, and
                        subsequently the same man com¬mitted a similar robbery at Port Tewfik.
                        Finally, thanks to the moBt energetic steps taken by H.E. the Govaruor of
                        Sues, Ibrahim Bey Helmi, and the ohief of polioe, Mr. De Touris, who took
                        considerable interest in the matter, the robber was caught, and the missing
                        articles, which had been already sold, have been restored intaot to their

                    <p>SECOND NOVELTY OF THE SEASON. The sooond novelty of the Cairo season,
                        Catalani’s WaUy, was given on Thursday and Saturday night. Composed about
                        1895 this opera was at first a fiasco. Catalani did not live to see it
                        obtain any sneoess. Bronght on the stage again two years ago, it was receiv
                        ed more favourably and, had the oomposer been present at the last
                        representation of WaUy in Cairo, the enthusiastic approval of tha audience
                        wonld surely have consoled him for the bitter disappointment which he must
                        have felt, when his work was denied its well- deserved merits. The opera
                        transports ns to the Tyrolese Alps, represented by some good stage soenery,
                        and on Tharsday night by a convkoing blast of cold air from the snow-clad
                        mountains at the back of the stage. The delightful music, original and
                        exhilarat¬ing, qnite suits the place and the plot, an intricate story of
                        love and jealousy between the rivals to the hand of Wally. The gdJling of
                        the Tyrolese hanters and farmers, the blowing of horns and the ringing of
                        cowbells, the rushing of the molten snow down the slopei of the hills, all
                        the familiar sounds of Tyrolese mountain life,are interwoven with the mnsio.
                        In the first act, a delioious solo *‘Undi verso il Mnrzcll,” sang by Walter
                        (Madame Zeppili Alice J, more entioing than ever in a tight- fitting
                        tronbadonr’s snit, gives this charming artiste an opportunity to show the
                        capacities of her light soprano to the beet The act winds up with a
                        passionate love scene, in which Gellner (Mr. Amato Pa-quale) declares his
                        love to Wally, and is rejected by her. Mr. Amato Pasquale’s rich amorous
                        baritone salts the melody to perfection. In proounng as this young artist,
                        who is only 27 years, and has already sang in the principal theatres of
                        Europe, Convent Garden, La Soala, etc., etc., the much-abused 8. A. E. has
                        done something towards deserving the gratitude of the Cairo public. A
                        special word of praise is also due to Vally (Madame Russ) Giannina, whose
                        voioe showed to admirable effect through a long and difficult rdle. The
                        orchestral opening of the third not, a oharming bit of music, was encored
                        both evenings. Mr. Paint's rendering of the rdle of Hageubaoh in the fourth
                        act, and espe¬cially his solo “M’hai Balvato, hai volnto obliar l’offesa
                        mia,” was deserving, and as a whole ihe representation of Wally may be
                        considered as one of the most oreditable per¬formances of the season. </p>

                    <head>THE SERATO CONCERT.</head>
                    <p>An extremelyinterestingconoertwasgivenon Monday night at the New Khedivial
                        Hotel by the distinguished violinist, Serato, before an audtenoe, whioh,
                        considering the musical opportunity given to the Alexandria public, was a
                        very small one. The performance open¬ed wiih Wieneawski’s Concerto with
                        three movements. Of the three the last, the Finale aliaZmgara(or Gypsy)
                        movement, was decidedly the best played and the most enjoyable, being of a
                        light and tuneful character, and at times exhibiting very distinct
                        reminisoenoes of the Bizirria in D major by the same oomposer. The first
                        movement, Allegro Moderate, we thought rather sorappy and dieronsive, and it
                        was not played with qui’e the same oonviotion as the other two. A Beiceau by
                        Jamefeld was au excellent example vf ihe graver and more solemn class of
                        mnsio, which is after all more satisfying than the more difficult bat much
                        less pleasing florid style The simple but im¬pressive harmonies of this
                        latter piece were magnificently rendered, and there, oan be no donbt that in
                        the interpretation of what we may call tha more religious and less purely
                        Whetio’ side of musical exaresaion, Signor Serato, in hit sphere, is
                        supreme. Ries’ Perpetuem Mobile waa an interesting example of technical
                        skill, and was played with marvel-lous precision and aoonraoy, bat such
                        pieoes unquestionably arouse our wonder without exoiting oar sympathy.
                        Baeh’s air on the 4”h string was finely played and Sarasate’s
                        Z’gennerweiser, appareut'y another ‘Gypsy’ theme, was received with immense
                        applause. B it we oannot help thinking that the contrast between the two
                        subjeots of this latter piece was too abrn£t to be entirely satisfactory.
                        The grave opening, ‘can Sordino’ especially with the exquisite tones that
                        Signor Serato in his pla’ ingextraotei from his instrument, left one
                        somewhat unprepared for the extremely light and almost vulgar “dance”
                        subject that followed, expressing less any masioal idea than 1 ’he somewhat
                        startling antics of a mountebank. Perhaps the gem of the performer was the
                        “Little Song” by d’Amhrono, given as the first encore i anything more
                        delightful than the quaiut and expressive ending to eaoh variation of the
                        theme as it reourred oan hardly be imagined: it left one in doubt whether to
                        ory or laugh, and stirred up those diBtinot but rather indefinite emotions
                        that ranstitute perhaps the ohief joy is listening to good mnsio. p||lt only
                        remains to ton *h briefly unnn the plsyingof Madame MaUtesta. As an aooom-
                        panist she was magnificent, exhibiting all ’hat twt and restraint that are
                        so needful to keep the due relationships bet ween principal and agent dearly
                        defined. Her p’vying of Raohmaninoff’s Prelude and Chamidnade’s T> ocata
                        showed great technical skill and masio4tseling, and in the latter piece
                        especially, which most be a d'ffioolt one, she received all the applause
                        that her spirited but dignified rendering deserved. </p>

                        philosophy are conveyed in the anoient form of the fable, bat expressed in

                        philosophy, although distinctively Amer¬ioan, are of universal oarrenoy

                            Sir,—R’garding the new regulation of the Post Offi;e Administration to
                            which you drew attention iu your leader of the 12th inat., itap nears to
                            u=t a most unwarrantable proceeding to wilfully detain letters addressed
                            to well-kn- wu firms, who have been in the habit of receiving letters f
                            ,r many years with no o*her address than "Alexandria” on them, and whose
                            addres ses are perfeotly well known to the postal authorities, and which
                            in must civilised ooun- triea might render the postmaster liable to
                            legal proceedings should loss or damage be oaased through the wilful
                            detention of letters. We ourselves have on several occasions receiv¬ed
                            daring the toarist season whole sackfals of letters for the passengers
                            and orews of steam- mers, hardly any of which have more than
                            "Alexandria” as an address on thsm.the senders naturally concluding that
                            that woald be amply sufficient to find any firm of long standing in
                            Alexandria. The detention of such letters for a day might mean their not
                            reaching the receivers by the time they left Alexandria, and it might he
                            weeks afterwards before they received them, and who can say what
                            incon¬venience and loss this might cause to some of the receiver*. Again
                            we are often receiving letters from comparative strangers, some of which
                            it is of the utmost importance should be answered by return of post, and
                            the detention may mean not only actual inooavenienoe, but actnal loss.
                            We are perfeotly well aware that the diffi¬culty might be got over by
                            having a box at the post office, and sending ourselves for the letters
                            by each mail, but iu the first place we understand all the boxes in the
                            post office are engaged, and secondly we are too far from the post
                            office to intake it easy or convenient for as to send there for oar
                            letter*, which mast be the oase with mary other firms besides oarselves.
                            This is a matt nr of s ch general importance to the commercial
                            communities of Alexandria and Cairo, that we feel con vine ed that it
                            has only to ba brought to the attention of the higher authorities, to
                            have this most arbitrary and unjnstifiab’e rule modified. W« can quite
                            understand the d ffioulty that the Postal Authorities have in finding
                            the addresses of many private individuals and of firms newly
                            established, and in such cases where the actaal address is not at once
                            known by the post office sorters, they are perfectly right to retain the
                            letters for s post, but in oases where the address are well-known, to
                            deliberately sort out the letters which are not fully addressed and to
                            forward the others, is not only aa absurdity, hut almost amounts to a
                            crime. We beg to remain, Sir, yours faithfully, P. P. JOHN Ross &amp;

                        <p>Sir,—I quite agree with "a correspondent” in his account of the Assouan
                            fancy dress ball, especially as to the voting for the best costumes. It
                            is a disgrace for any lady to parade before native men servants, eto.,
                            in a costume, other than one belonging to her sex, and it is no wonder,
                            that in one of the latest books on Egypt, by a foreigner, remarks, other
                            than complimentary, to fjmale tourisms, should be made. Thus the
                            majority suffer for the foolish minority. I oannot help thinking that
                            the lady (?) who, as your correspondent right¬ly says, "had the
                            hardihood to hlaok her face and appear as a Cook’s dragoman" resembles
                            some of our heroes of antiquity, who, failing to gain notoriety by good
                            deeds, had to resort to anything hot laudable ones iu order that their
                            names be carried to posterity. That such oon- duot can encourage
                            Egyptians in the eman¬cipation, or liberty, of their womenkind is very

                    <p>THE FRONTIER DISPUTE. HELOUAN SPORTING CLUB. AN ANTICIPATION. The following
                        official note has boon com’- mnnicated to the Press. Incons- qnenee of
                        certain artioles appearing in the local Pre-s with reference to the Sinai
                        frontier, the Ministry of War informs the public that there are oertaiu
                        differences of op’nion as to the frontier, which has not yet been
                        delimitated. Negotiations are bring carried on in a most amicable spirit,
                        and a friend¬ly settlement will doubtless be effected in the near futnre. A
                        correspondent sends ns the following "jeo d’esprii” from the ‘ Express” of
                        1935. We arehapvyto state that the developments he foreshadows are not
                        likely to ensue from the present incident, owing to the prospect of an
                        amicable settlement : — As some of our readers have not had the leisure to
                        follow the history of the numerous boundary disputes between Turkey and
                        Egypt, we give the following short summary otthe successive stages of the
                        negotiations as to the frontier relations between E^ypt and Turkey from 1905
                        to the present date, which show the slow progress of the frontiers of the 0
                        toman Empire towards the Suez Canal, which has led to the present strained
                        situation. Had our home politicians only realised, etc. etc. 1905. A Turkish
                        force takes deserters from au Egyptian vessel and constructs storehouses on
                        the Egyptian side of the Tripoli frontier. Egypt being an integral part of
                        the Ottoman dominions no frontier questions can arise between Egypt and the
                        Porte. Negotiations commence. t 1906. Ma’An-Akaba line begun. Turks
                        estab¬lish a post at Dabah on the Egyptian ride of the Akaba el Arish line;
                        negotiations continue. 1908. Ma’an Akaba line completed. Turkish garrison at
                        Dab*h trebled. Egyptian protests are met with the deolarat on (see under
                        1905). Negotiations continue amicably. 1909. The Turkish authorities
                        establish a post between Solum and Kanais. Energetic protests meet with the
                        rrp’y that Egypt etc. 19'0. Akaba fortified, the Turkish forces evaouate
                        Dabah. Negotiations re the Tripoli frontier progress most amicably 1911. The
                        Turks oooupy Dabah el Sugheiyer eight miles N. of the Dabah and on the
                        Egyptian side of the frontier. 1913. A boundary commission from Cairo
                        arrives at Akaba to meet Turkish delegates. Three ot its members arrested
                        for espionage. Representations to Stamboul and the despatch of over 500
                        telegrams from the Egyptian Foreign Office and the British Ageroy result in
                        the release of the captive dehmitators snd the punishment of a Turkish
                        Ynzbariri. The Boundary commission meets. It being discover-ed that
                        thefTurkish Commission has no powers, the delimitation is postponed. 1914.
                        The Boundary Commissions meet at El Arish and proceed inland, tut return
                        owing to rumours of a Bedouin conspiracy under Sheikhs Abou Dagu and Abu
                        Shenab against the TaTkish party. 1920. The boundary onmmissio'’s having at
                        laat completed their labours, the Sublime Porte before signing the frontier
                        treaty demands a rectfioation of the frontier near both Akaba and El Arish.
                        1921. A Turkish boundary commission leaves Dam* from Solum by land, but
                        owing to a general confusion officially attributed to a standstorm arrives
                        ak. Diamond near Siwa, where it hoists the Tarkifih flag and retarne. 1925.
                        The Turkish Government sends strong military forces into the disputed
                        territories near Akaba and El Arish The Emperor Eitel I. visits Alexandria
                        and Ca'ro.“Al Lewa’ recommends the ce«sion of the Sinai and Mariout to the
                        Porte. Excrement in E/ypt. 1928. Negotiations reported to be on the eve of a
                        fi'ial settlement. 1930. Negotiations reported to be on the eve of a final
                        settlement. 1933. Tripoli frontier negotiations settled after the despatch
                        of five commissions and 18.000 official telegrams. R»joioings at Sharia El
                        Dawaweeu and Kasr El D mbara. 1935. On the ground of its occupation (by a
                        hundred Z»ptiehs) for 24 years, the Porte refuses to evacuate Dihah and S

                        spectators. Lark started the game for the vi-itors.The College team quickly
                        settled down, and for about ten minntes kept the Saints defending. Cowie
                        initiated the first run into the homest* r’s end, but he was indifferently
                        sup-ported and the ball was put pas’-. Saiuts main-tained the pressure fora

                        second halt strongly and the Saints’ defence h*d a lot to do. It was some
                        time before the Saints could break away. The forwards seemed at no time
                        during the game to get proper control of the bnll, and their movements in

                        The Viotoria front line was full of running. Yaghen was the smartest forward
                        on the field, and bounced along full of vitality. Mastard was the most
                        prominent man in the defenoe. He was always ready in .intercepting every
                        pass which was not mathematically aoonrate, and got his head on the ball
                        whenever it rose to any reasonable attitnde, and made judicious and
                        well-timed passes to the men in front of him. He was a host in himself. The
                        Saints’ backs were also very safe. Keill’s recovery work was good, and
                        Hopkins was always to the re-cue whenever the home forwards were getting too
                        close to Curtis. The College oustodian was not overburdened with work, but
                        was ever ready when called upon. The game was thoroughly enjoyable

                    <p>Emigration to tho Sadan. “Ai Lew*” ia a leading article remarks: ‘‘Emigration
                        is very useful and advisable, and it was approved by the Prophet, who
                        emi-grated from Mecca to Medina, 1,323 years ago when the Hegira’s date
                        began. To emigrate from one country to another is, for people.to leave their
                        homes seeking fortune, prosperity and better IHe in another oountry; aud the
                        Sudan can hardly be the land to give prosperity and happiness to the
                        Egyptians at present. Our people will have no privileges in the country
                        which cost us too dearly, but will be there like the Italians and Greeks,
                        who paid no money and sacrificed no lives to restore the Sadan. This is not,
                        therefore, the proper time for our oountrymen to emigrate to the Sadan. We
                        must first dema- d our rights in that land and secure our i-hare and
                        privileges. The Sadan is a very large country which will not be filled up by
                        emigrants in a shore time. The area ot Kurd >f an Moudirien alone equals
                        that of France, which is inhabited by 40 millions of population. Therefore
                        the Egyptians would not be losing an opportunity if they remain, for the
                        time being, at home, until their rights in the Sudan are quite secured. The
                        time will come when the sons of the valley of the Nile will gladly emi-grate
                        to thpir second land”. The New Sudan Railway. “Al Ahram” publishe* a letter
                        from a native of Cairo to the following »ffeot : — The native press, owing
                        to the opening of the Nde-Red Sea railway, has been dealing for the last few
                        days with the Sudanese question, keenly b’aming the Egyptian Government and
                        severely criticising its policy in sending no offioial representatives to
                        attend the ceremonial inauguration. The absence of Government men on such an
                        important ceremony has indeed caused a sensational exo’tement among the
                        natiVhs, who consider now that Egypt will shortly be deprived of its share
                        in the Sudan. as its influence was suppressed. Now every patriot should ask
                        what should the Govern¬ment cour-e be in regard to the Sudan ; should E?y ’t
                        sustain the loss, while England avails itself by the benefits, or what, we

                        out of the Sudan when the State is, as we see, turned against Egypt’s
                        interests ? What answer would our ministries give, if the times were ohanged
                        and they were asked to give an aocoant of the work they had performed in
                        Egypt, and about their unsatis- Lotory aot which put Egypt to a great los* ?

                        paragraph : ‘ As the privileges allowed to Egypt are a part of the natnral
                        right of our power, the Khedivial Government has to keep all these
                        privileges very carefully, and must not in way alter all or any of them, or
                        allow a plot of Egyptian land to pass into the hands r f any other Power.”
                        Egypt has lost Massawa and is about to lose the Sudan, and has disposed of
                        the Ottoman privileges by concluding an agieement with the British

                        two trains were provided by the Natal Government Railway for’heir
                        accommodation. It is interesting to note that these trains were equipped
                        throughout with Stone’s Patent Eleotrio Light System, and that althongh the
                        trains w^re in use for five weeks, going right up to the Zambesi, this

                        principally for battalions in the Panjab. The liner is due at Port 8aid on
                        the 15th inst, and at Karaohi on the 26 h following. Captain P. M. Dove, 2nd

                        Highlanders, have been seleoted for service with the Khedive’s army. Captain
                        C. K. Morgan, Royal Army Medical Corps, serving in Egypt, has been promoted
                        major, a grade he has reaohed after less than twelve years’ service. He got
                        his first commis-sion in July, 1894. Brevet Colonel S. G. Bird, D.S.0.,will
                        vacate the command of the 1st Battalion Royal Dublin Fariliers in Eyypt, in

                        Ireland, should get the command. Under the schema for the reorganisation of
                        the Royal E g n«ers, it is i >tendel to introduce a change of considerable
                        imoortance. Hitherto there has been no cohesion between the units told off
                        specially as field companies. This is held to be a defective arrangement,
                        and steps are, therefore to fee taken to form the*e into battalion for
                        service in war. The fortress units created by the abolition of the submarine
                        min-ing companies, will, it is believed, be similarly treated. 4 A smart

                        in the first instance. The coming concentration of sixty battleships and
                        a’moured oruisers of the Atlantic, Medi¬terranean and Channel Fleets at
                        L*goa Bay, will aff »rd another instance of the mighty naval power of Great
                        Britain. It will be an unmistaka¬ble proof that the premier naval power is
                        one in being and not one on paper. Yet it is only a preliminary to the great
                        demonstration of the coming summer, when 340 battleships, cruisers, and
                        smaller ships, will share in the manoeuvres. The lessons of the late
                        struggle in the Far East will fiad a place in the programme, which a9
                        already stated in these notes, will thoroughly test the present distribution
                        of the naval forces of our Empire both at home and abroad. The British
                        Fleet, independent of its primary duty, the defence of our country, is au
                        important factor in the peace of the world, bat if it were backed up by au
                        army, raised to the standard laid down by Lord Roberts, the position would
                        be still more satisfactory. If any other Conti¬nental power had a navy of
                        the same descrip¬tion, it would be a standing menace to peace, instead of
                        being one of thebeit guarantees of it </p>
