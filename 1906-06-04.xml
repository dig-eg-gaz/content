                        rise. The curtain has fallen on the first and second acts of a tragedy; let
                        us hope that the third will disappoint the expectations of the pessimist. If
                        rumour is to be trusted the composition of the new board is a guarantee that
                        the management of the Sugar Company will henceforward bs prudent but
                        energetic, economical but foreseeing. The results of the "Concordat
                        homologue' are, roughly, as follows. The shareholders do not really suffer.
                        The redaction of the value of the shares by two thirds is inevitable, and
                        the shares have for some time past touched a far lower figure than fr. 33.
                        If, as we trust, matters improve the shareholders cannot but benefit. The
                        holders of bills (porteurs des traites creancier) are privileged by
                        comparison with the former shareholders, but are under tha same obligations
                        in regard to their common creditors. They abandon 25% of their claims, but
                        recover that amount on reimbursement. The position of the debenture-holders
                        remains unchanged, while the creditors by simple contract renounce the right
                        of immediately recovering their claims. The Daira Sugar Compony has agreed
                        to the sale of the Sugar Company's railways to the State, thus reducing by
                        50% the debt due to it As for the remainder of the debt it becomes "mortgage
                        creditor" instead of privleged creditor, reduces the annual interest due to
                        it by 1 per cent., and surrenders the six-monthly payments formarly made for
                        repayment over a period of years by the drawing of the debentures it
                        receives. Wa are now to see whether sugar cultivation will pay in Egypt. The
                        company is in good hands and we are confident that if the industry can be
                        made remunerative the new directors will succeed. In the meantime the
                        satisfactory termination of a long and painfal affair is a great personal
                        triumph for Me. Carton de Wiart, the brilliant avocat of the Sucreries,
                        whose skill and patience has been sorely tried, but have at length won a
                        well merited success. </p>
                    <p>HAILO MIRIAM'S END.</p>
                    <p>Referring to the recent capture and death of Hailo Miriam, the "Evening
                        Standard and "St. James’s Gazette" says Gussassa, the Abyssinian chief, has
                        spared the world a good deal of trouble, it may be, by his summary dealing
                        with Hailo Mariam, his outlawed and irreconcilable countryman. To have
                        released his prisoners while the Outlaw lived would have been an awkward
                        matter for the liberators, for this is a matter on which the Ethiopian has
                        strict views. During the war with Italy an Abyssinian soldier out
                        "exercising" a prisoner was persuaded by the Italian to let him try the
                        paces of his (the Abyssinian's) horse. No sooner had he set foot in the
                        stirrup than the prisoner galloped for dear life and got clear away. A day
                        or two later the disappointed janitor was found creeping stealthily through
                        the woods, and explained the object of his foray. If, he said, he turned up
                        at the next inspection minus his prisoner there would be a frightful row.
                        Therefor he went out stalking every morning to see if he oould catch
                        another.</p>

                        Secondary Eduction.. A Sohag correspondent writes : For some time past the

                        examina¬tions for a secondary education certificate (Baccalaureate) in
                        Arabic. These examinations are made to stiff by the sheiks, who let the
                        candidates fail either purposely or else by not knowing what questions to

                        correspondent is one I have often heard in Turkey, where it is not unusual
                        to hear of some weary rustio peacefully reposing in the shade of a tree to
                        wake up and discover tho tail of a grass-snake in his mouth and the
                        reptile's head in his stomach. It is said that the reptile is attracted
                        thither if the person should have drunk some milk, of which all snakes are
                        fond The usual remedy is to put a saucer of milk near the unfortunate's
                        mouth, when the snake is attracted out. The strange part of it all is how
                        the snake knows about a man having a throat; certainly instinct is stronger
                        than reason. Camel Corps Dinner. The Camel Corps dinner took place on the

                    <head>THE SUCRERIES.</head>
                    <p>NEW ERA OPENS FOR INDUSTRY. On Saturday the Mixed Court of Cairo gave its
                        final judgment in the case of the Societe des Sucreries et de la Raffinerie
                        d'Egypte. Judge Tuck presided and the 8ucreries and their creditors were
                        represented by Me. Carton de Wiart. The distinguished counsel pleaded the
                        case of his clients with eloquence and skill, and his efforts were crowned
                        with success, the concordat judiciare and the recon¬struction of the company
                        being granted. We understand that the new directors of the company are
                        Boghos Pacha Nubar, M. Raphael Suards, Harari Pacha, Birch Pacha, and M. J.
                        A. Cattaui. A better board could not have been formed, and we look to the
                        future of the company under its direction with the utmost confidence. In the
                        course of his pleading for the com¬pany, Maltra Carton de Wiart declared
                        that the number of creditors favourable to the concordat had been increased
                        after it had been signed, and that at the present moment this number was
                        54,402. To silence adverse criti¬cism, he enumerated the several advantages
                        which the concordat offered to all parties concerned, and dosed his pleading
                        with a short peroration which made the best impression on all in Court. As
                        not one contested his declaration the greffier then read the summing-up of
                        the Judge Commissioner, of which the substance follows : '-This bankruptcy
                        has been proceeded with according to the formalities required by law, and a
                        concordat was arranged on May 23 between the company and its creditors,
                        without opposition. Criminal proceedings against certain members of the
                        board of the company were dismissed by a verdict of not guilty. We therefore
                        propose to you to ap¬prove the concordat ao that it may be carried out."
                        This recommendation was seconded by Bayram Boy, who declared that a
                        concordat can be ratified in all cases except in that of fraudulent
                        bankruptcy. “As a matter of equity," said Bayram Bey, "could you deny the
                        benefits of a judicial concordat to an im¬portant company to the fault of
                        one or more of its directors?" Judgment was then given. Thw following is the
                        text thereof :— "P.C.M. Oui le Juge Commissaire en son rapport et le

                        fashion. Perhaps a meeting of the magnifi¬cence and pomp we have for this
                        opera in the Khedivial Opera House was wanting, but then the scenery for the
                        latter was espe¬cially made, as was indeed the opera house itself, for the
                        opera. The performance was excellent except for a slight deterioration in
                        the chorus in the 4th act. The tenor (Sig. Scalabrini) caught the intection
                        himself for that matter, and most grievously too, singing the first few
                        notes of his duet in the tomb most vilely out of tune. But apart from this
                        he was the star of the evening. He has a great fine "robusto tenore,” which
                        he knows well how to moderate at times, and he interprets the part in a fine
                        manner and in most complete accordance with the orchestra. This —we must
                        repeat our attack—is more than we can say for Sig. Arrighetti, who, as
                        usual, tried the conductor’s patience over and over again, for his would
                        be-effective long high notes. Sig. Manceri has a fine bass, and was a most
                        stately king. Sig. D’Audina as Ramfis war poor, and completely spoilt the
                        "Radamos, Radames, Radames" effect at the end. It is the great effective
                        point of the act, almost of the whole opera, but his ren¬dering moved the
                        audience to unseemly yet natural laughter, For the rest, Signore Gorreta and
                        Riga were good. The latter has delightful low notes. The chorus was fair;
                        and the Inniskilling Fusiliers’ band was or most material assistance. We
                        must note one curious feature about this company : they have now four
                        tenors, all of them unusually good. Sig. Battani is far and away the best
                        tenor Cairo has had for years, Anselmi not excepted. Signori Grandi and
                        Scalabrini are both of them very much above the type of singer supplied by
                        the Cercle Artistique, and Sig. de Carpi as a light tenor is most excellent.
                        So much the better for us : but why will not the company engage at least one
                        soprano of the same level as the tenors! Without condemning the charming
                        ladies who have so far appeared, and who are undoubtedly good, we cannot
                        avoid seeing the contrast; there is quite a class between the tenors and the
                        sopranos. We have to bear how Sig. Vecohioni takes Mefistofele in Faust. But
                        as it stands the company is remarkable for having these four tenors and
                        practically no one else of the same merit, and that seems an anomaly. The
                        company are doing very well as far as receipts go, and they will do even
                        better with this addition; besides which the balance will be kept true. Sig.
                        Battani, for example, does not sing at all at his best when he is not
                        thoroughly supported in parts of Uiqoletto and one or two other pieces. When
                        8ig. de 8pada rose to the occasion for a time (as she certainly did) be
                        exerted himself; but the rest of the time he was evidently careless, whereas
                        we should like to hear him at his very best all through. </p>
                    <p>Faust</p>
                    <p>Faust was given on Saturday night. We will begin by announcing the programme
                        for this week ;— Monday, Traviata; Tuesday, Tosca; Wednesday, Ernani;
                        Thursday, Il Trovatore, and Friday Mefistofele. The com¬pany are doing their
                        utmost to keep the public, and especially the English public, acquainted
                        with the prospective performances, and it is only fitting that we should
                        assist them as far as possible by announcing these, as we hear of them.
                        Faust was rather uneven. The chief features were the singing of Faust
                        himself (Sig. Baltani) and the acting of Sig. Vecohioni as Mefistofele. He
                        was made up to the last point of perfection,—it is curious, by the way, to
                        notice the resemblance between Mefistofelp, Napoleon III., and the
                        caricature type of early Yankee; that goatee heard has a great suggestion of
                        hard devilry and subtlety. His acting was as good as his appearance; and if
                        only he recovers from his cold, we shall enjoy his appearance as the far
                        greater Mefistofele on Friday. Signor Battani was unusually delightful, and
                        we really cannot single out any one part of his performance, where all was
                        so excellent Signa. Lery we cannot praise or excuse. The part of Marguerite
                        is surely well enough known to be well sung; and Signa. Lery has a fine
                        voice. Why, then, must she spoil the whole part from beginning to end with
                        an intolerable vibrato! It sounds abomin¬able at any time, and always
                        suggests that the singer cannot quite, or will not quite, hit the note,
                        relying on a vibrato above and below it A high note, fortissimo, can be
                        covered after a fashion in that manner, but the effect, with a soft note, is
                        disastrous. The Jewel song was passable, as was the “King in Thule;’’ but
                        the rest, especially the final trio,was quite marred by this fault, We
                        should hesitate to speak so severely but that Signa. Lery has a good voice,
                        and can perfectly well dispense with the one thing that spoils it. Valentino
                        (Signa. Pompa) was dull and lacking in tone and power. 8iebel (Signa.
                        Esposito) was very good in her small part; and the rest of the per¬formers
                        were quite adequate, the cackling chorus of the old men being excellent We
                        do fervently hope for tin best on Friday : if only Sig. Vecohioni has shaken
                        off his cold, and Signa. Lery some of her vibrato, the perform¬ance will be
                        good. Mefistofele is a splendid opera, and deserves all that can be given in
                        the way of interpretation</p>

                        <p>FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT). Port Said, Saturday. ' Last week the giant crane
                            brought out by the Canal Company was dispatched to Kabret to assist in
                            raising the South light station, which was wrecked by the S S. Assyrian,
                            of the the Anchor Line, barging into it. </p>
                        <p>Transport Aground.</p>
                        <p>On Thursday the Royal Edward, with over a thousand Russian troops from
                            Vladivostok, grounded in the Canal at four in the morning. Navigation
                            was interrupted until five in the evening.</p>
                        <p>More Russian Troops</p>
                        <p>The Russian Government has signed further contracts for the repatriation
                            of her troops. We shall consequently see another hundred thousand at
                            least pass through our port. The conduct of those who have passed
                            through already, numbering over 100,000, has been excellent. The general
                            fine physique of the men has been much commented on, and their good
                            behavior has won praise on all sides. A pleasing feature is that British
                            ships now seem to preponderate as the hired transports.</p>
                        <p>The Haversham Grange.</p>
                        <p>The S.S. Haversham Grange, which reached Port Said early on Sunday
                            evening with 8,500 Russian troops on board, still bears traces of her
                            collision in the Straits of Malacca. Having received at Singapore
                            temporary repairs she will be thoroughly overhauled on arrival at
                            Odessa. Great credit is due to the officers of the ship and the Russian
                            troops that no serious casualties occurred. Anything like a panic on a
                            Russian transport loaded to her fall capacity with a living freight
                            would be too dreadful to contemplate. </p>

                        <p>The S.S. Roon, of the North German Lloyd Line, well known in our port,
                            was wrecked, during a storm on the 19th of last month, off the coast of
                            Japan. The passengers and crew were safely landed by a relief ship sent
                            by the Japanese Government. There is some prospect of salvage operations
                            being successful.</p>
                        <p>Japanese Line</p>
                        <p>The Japanese Mail Steamship Co.’s Kamachee Maru arrived today. This line
                            has now been in full swing again for some time. The European service of
                            ships which call at Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore, Penang and Colombo
                            is fort¬nightly. Almost the whole of the officers and crew are Japanese.
                            Usually the captain is German or English. Messrs. Worms and Co., of Port
                            Said, are the agents for this line.</p>
                        <p>Naval Movements</p>
                        <p>The second-class cruiser Andromeda left Port Said early on Wednesday
                            morning en route for Malta. Torpedo-boat No. 64, which was left behind
                            here for repairs, sailed with her. The Minerva and Diana left earlier in
                            the week for the same destination.</p>
                        <p>The Sporting Club</p>
                        <p>On Wednesday evening a largely attended meeting of the founders and
                            members of the Sporting Club was held at the Gouvernorat under the
                            presidency of H.K Mohamed Maher Bey, Governor of the Suez Canal. One
                            heard on all sides remarks as to the excellent business¬like way the
                            Governor conducted so successful a meeting. His Excellency is president
                            of the club with Schalk Bey as vice-president. The interest taken in the
                            club by all nationalities augurs well for its future. It is intended to
                            erect a pretty pavilion, plans of which were shown. Cricket, hockey,
                            football, and tennis, will be played on the new ground. In spite of the
                            apparent interest in the club ascribed to ladies, we hear that none were
                            present at the meeting, although no doubt many of them will join the
                            club later on.</p>

                        <p>THE DANGERS OF RAILWAY TRAVELLING. </p>
                        <p>To THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE.” Dear Sir, - Having read your two
                            publications in to-day’s issue concerning railway accidents, due
                            entirely to the non-fastening of the carriage doors, I would like to
                            bring to your notice, what appears to me as being the main reason why
                            this so frequently occurs. , There is apparently a regulation
                            stipulating , that all first class compartments should be locked not
                            only fastened by the latch. This order was issued mainly to prevent the
                            breaking of doors, left open on empty trains, when passing over bridges
                            and other narrow places. In consequence the guards are more or less
                            careful to do so when the compartments are not occupied, but after
                            opening same for passengers to enter they very often do not trouble even
                            to close them again, leaving this for the travelers to do. The above
                            stated arrangement is of the greatest inconvenience and danger to
                            passengers travelling by local trains. One is often kept waiting till
                            the last minute, before being able to enter the train, as the guard is
                            as often as not, at the other end of the platform, and when he arrives,
                            the key either does not fit, or the look is too much worn for it to have
                            the desired effect of opening same. Also if you have to descend from the
                            opposite side of the train, you may run the risk of being carried on to
                            the next station, before the door opened, unless you are sufficiently
                            agile as to climb through the window, as I myself have been obliged to
                            do on more than one occasion.If instead of this, quite unnecessary,
                            locking of the doors, the guards, who generally find time to bother you
                            for your ticket two or three times during a journey, had strict orders
                            to see that the handles of the doors were duly turned, as well as the
                            outside. catch fastened, before leaving any station, whether the
                            compartment was occupied or not, , and the station-master, who is
                            usually to be found on the platform when a train is leaving his station,
                            be held responsible that the guard did his duty, there would be no
                            further need of locking the doors, and this would tend greatly towards
                            the safety of passengers travelling in the trains.I have travelled in a
                            carriage with the door swinging wide open, having naturally expected
                            that the guard who unlooked it would have at least fastened it before
                            leaving, also when travelling between Alexandria and Cairo I have
                            frequently noticed the end door of a corridor carriage wide open,
                            notwith¬standing the presence of a farrash ; which, is most dangerous to
                            any one walking along to the lavatory while the train is in motion. FROM

                            was given. The colored films were greatly appreciated, and showed to

                            by the Bracale orchestra was a great success, especially Rubinstein’s
