                        Price; One Plaatro Tariff. MONDAY, AUGUST 91, 1905. 81LVEB CURRENCY. We need
                        not apologise to our readers for recurring to the all import wt subjeots
                        referred to in Lord Cromer’* Reports, indeed almost every line of
                        thesaReports oould aptly be taken at a text to be enlarged upon profitably.
                        The subjeots treated in these yearly “Gospels" are so many and various, and
                        deserve so much thought, that to dismiss them in a few general articles is
                        to show an inadequate appreciation of their public inteto it and importanoe.
                        By an unwritten law, of whioh we oannot deny the propriety, Bgyptisn
                        Givernment officials are “not encouraged” to write in the pnblio press on
                        those particular subjects ol whioh they have special oognisanoe and, even it
                        it were other- wise, their praise dr criticism, if suoh were necessary,
                        would naturally be *»k«n as “ex parte”. Onr views, therefore, rightly
                        partake of the character of outside criticism and may be modified by any
                        undisclosed facts being brought to 'light The subject of ourranoy is ao-
                        knowlelged to be one of much difficulty. It is full of pitfalls, and has
                        never been reduced to a science, every oouutry —mning to form an exception
                        and requiring to be dealt with differently. In aoountiy like Egypt, arising
                        anew, like a Pfcro iix, from the ashes of a great past, whioh left no guide
                        for its future, the subjeot is one of great importance, and of interest to
                        the outer world, as Egypt is the latest oouutry to establish a new curren.y
                        in aooordanoe with the best modem ideas. In section 31 of the 1904 Report,
                        attention is called to this subjeot by the significant fact of the ooinage
                        of LiR 629,000 in new silver ourrenoy. In order that our readers may realise
                        the retativo importanoe of this large new supply we may mention that the
                        total imputation for the last five years had only amounted to L.E 296,000,
                        of whioh L.K. 100,000 had only reoently arrived when the above large supply
                        was ordered; that the whole amount of silver coined at the Con- stantinople
                        Mint during the year was not half the amount purchased by Egypt; and that
                        the silver ourrenoy withdrawn during 1904 amount- ed to only L.B. 10,780. We
                        are sorry that the oomplete report of Mr. Ronssin oould not have been
                        included in the appendix of Lord Cromer's Report, as so exceptional an
                        addition to the coinage justified, and even called for the fullest
                        consideration and eluoidation, and it leaves ns the neoessity of gathering
                        many data from extraneous sources. It may not be ill-timed to recall the
                        history of Egyptian curreaoy. Ic is nut nacaiiary for this purpose to go
                        forthu book than the year 1886, when as a result of tho Cummisrion of 1884,
                        and under the able guidinoe of Sir Edgar Vinoent, the whole monetary system
                        was placed upon a new and sound basis. To make the new system effective, it
                        was neoess- aiy to withdraw gradually the old ooins, par ary to withdraw
                        gradually the old ooins, par tioulajly miscellaneous foreign pieoes whioh
                        then oompoeed 60 per cent of the ourrenoy, and to import new ooins to the
                        required amount Tbs amount of silver or token cur renoy was limited nnder
                        the decree to' 40 piastres per head of the population.</p>
                    <p>GaAHD Total : LR 1,674,1 qo These ooinages were partly made up of old ooins
                        withdrawn and reooined. Assuming the population of Egypt to be 10,000,000,
                        and allowing still for old ooins still in circulation, fWT the silver to be
                        above 17 piastre* per heed, to whioh may ba added about 9 piastres of This
                        figure compares with 10/-. or 50 piastres, per heed in Bagiand. But the
                        circulation in India wOl prove a better basis for comparison. Owing to the
                        hoarding propensities of Mohammedan populations (so- oording to IMenim’i
                        obbotate oaloulatioo*) two-thirds of the silver provided in India
                        disappeared in 50 yaais. We thirk Out it would be safe to assume that the
                        same tou denoy to hoard will show itself in Egypt, encouraged as it is by a
                        religion whioh dii oonntananoes the putting out of money to usury. After
                        making the deduction* neoeeeiUUd by this disappearance of large sums, the
                        amount per head of silver circulating or in bankers’ hands in India was, by
                        Mr. H »r- rison’s calculation, 6} rupees—say 85 piastres. As Professor
                        Jevons has observed, “no one can tell how muoh ourrenoy a nation requires,
                        and to attempt to regulate its quantity is the last thing a statesman world
                        da" Never- thelere in view of the importanoe of having a supply adequate to
                        the demand, without in- curring any nnnaoeesary lots of interest, it is very
                        desirable to arrive at some rational estimate from year to year. In the case
                        of Egypt it is essential to bear in mind the very exceptional and rapid
                        ohangas that are taking place: i.e., the large addition to the land under
                        cultivation, necessitating inoreesed distribution in small wages, the
                        increase of the imports and exports from LR 90,000,000 to LE. 40,000,000
                        sinoe the new ourrenoy was estab- lished, the inorease of railway passengers
                        from 9,800,000 to 15,000,000, and the prospect of farther increases in all
                        theae directions. As regards imports and exports, it it true that the latter
                        are mainly dealt with by gold in the bulk, but in tha oolleotioc of exports
                        and the distribution of imports, silver most be largely employed; looomotion
                        also involves large amounts ot small silver ourrenoy. Under these
                        (riroumstanoes, it is not surprising that tiie imports of silver up to 1908
                        proved quite inadequate and that silver money rose to a substantial premium
                        in that year. It is rather surprising that the shortage was not foreseen and
                        provided for. The sale of some of the ooins, converted into ingots in 1890,
                        showed a still greater want of appreciation of the posi- tion. The issue of
                        notes by the National Bank in 1898 for LR 1, and upwards, might be thought
                        to reduce the requirements of silver to a certain extent, hat while rodeoing
                        the demand for the latter metal it is doubtful if this (notwithstanding the
                        inorease of the oiroolation of theae notes from LR 53,000 in 1900 to LR
                        454,000 in 1904) has done much, if anything, to displaoe silver, nor will it
                        do so until the native population generally have made suoh a stride forward
                        as oan not be anticipated for many yean, possibly genera- tions. The same
                        mej be said as regards the extension of broking facilities generally, in its
                        displacement of silver. We are inclined there- fore to entirely approve of
                        the recent addi- tions to the silver ourrenoy bringing up the small supply
                        to nearly 30 piastres par head. It passes the wit of man to lay down any
                        fixed guiding role for the futon, and we think Mr. Ronssin would have been
                        well advised to admit this to Ahe full rather than lay down as a basis for
                        future guidanoe that “the amount ordered should represent the difference by
                        whioh the Government stock in Jane foils short of LR 400,000 as a minimum,"
                        thj« gam being the mirimnw) required for moving the cotton crop. We oonfots
                        we oannot follow this reasoning or see why the ootton orop or the Government
                        bedding should be tht) sob) guide. In our opinion the matter must be looked
                        upon in a much larger and broader manner. The pants whioh require
                        oonsideration seem to be: 1. That Egypt is still progressing and gives
                        promise of farther program at a very excep- tional rate, added to whioh the
                        future re- quirements of the Sudan are an unknown quantity. 8. That the
                        population generally are gaining money in exqem of their absolute
                        requirements and that the tendency is likely to be towards hoarding their
                        small gains, rather than provid- ing themselves with further oomfbrts or
                        luxu- ries other than silver and gold ornaments, and that owing to the
                        Egyptian custom of investing when possible in land, large amounts of omn are
                        likely to be laid by for that eventual purpose, of whioh a considerable
                        quantity will be in silver. 3. That the proportion per head of the
                        population of 90 piastres as against 6} rupees in India is' stiR lo». 4. The
                        point-made by Mr. Ronssin, via, "the moet important inferonoe to be drawn
                        from more reoent events is that the fear of over issue, whioh underlies so
                        muoh of the restrictions imposed by the Royal Commis- sion, has no longer
                        any "raison d’etre f and we add this further consideration, that the
                        Commission itself, notwithstanding its fears, authorised an fosoe of 40 and
                        not 90 piastres par bead. 5. That the forcing of silver to a premium by an
                        inadequate supply is thoroughly unsound and oakulated to do great harm by
                        enooung- ing the holding of silver lor speculation, thus intensifying the
                        soareity, and should be avoid- ed at all ooeta. We oannot but think that on
                        there points our readers will agree with us that the Government should in
                        future aim at a fully adequate provision of sz$all currency and while we
                        oannot approve Mr. Ronssin's method of oaloulating for the future, the
                        oountry is to be congratulated upon-having at the head of this department a
                        man who is not likely to advooate the mistakes of the past. To keep in close
                        touch with the banks and markets is the moet important thing; indica- tions
                        gathered from then trill be a better guide than any fixed method of
                        oaloulation.</p>

                            some way connected with the recent dispute between Lord Kitchener and
                            the Viceroy. It was generally stated and believed that the dispute had
                            terminated in a satisfactory com- promise, but from the latest acoounts
                            it seems only too probable that after experience of the actual working
                            of the compromise, Lord Cur- ton found it less satisfactory than it had
                            ap- peared on paper. On the other hand Lord Curzon has now been seven
                            years in India, hav- ing been reappointed Viceroy in 1904, and is known
                            to be feeling the effects of the climate and the hard work which his
                            position involves. Here, we hope, will be found the true cause of his
                            resignation, for the fact that a Viceroy had retired in consequence of a
                            dispute with the Commander-in-Chief in India would be painful to all who
                            have the true interests of the Empire at heart.</p>

                            all probably not have been felt or, at all events would have been
                            minimised. The work will take three years at least, the same time as the
                            Assiout one took, as it can only be done in the spring and summer when
                            the river is at its lowest.</p>

                        <p>In our issue of 80th Jane last we mentioned that the Tramway Company were
                            making considerable alteration on their old Cairo line between
                            Kaar-el-Nil square and Poum-el- Khalig. These alterations comprise the
                            doub- ling of the line for a distance of abont two kilo- metres, and the
                            removal of the present single line from the carriage way, in order to
                            allow that part of the road to remain entirely free for vehicular
                            traffic. The new double line is being laid on one side, and a pavement
                            is being made between for pedestrians. These improve- ments, which were
                            necessitated by the con- stantly increasing traffic, will avoid the
                            delays occasioned by there being only one line; besides improving the
                            carriage-way, which, in future, will be ten metres wide. The work is
                            expected to be completed by the beginning of next month, when the new
                            service will com- mence. Mr. Dessales, the General Manager of the
                            Company in Cairo, is returning from Italy sooner than was expected in
                            consequence of several matters that require his attention in connection
                            with the many extensions and new lines about to be begun, and will
                            arrive by the Rubattino steamer due on Sunday.</p>

                        <p>Baruc Youzsef, and Ibrahim Isaao Levi, the Israelites who opposed such a
                            vigorous resist- ance to the police who had entered a suspect- ed
                            hashish establishment, have been questioned by the Parquet and deny the
                            truth of the charge brought against them. They assert that they were
                            passing by the house into which the police had forced an entrance, when
                            the sister of one of them called to them from the window, appealing for
                            assistance against burglars who had got into the house. As they tried to
                            enter, a man in civil dress stopped them at the door, and threatened
                            them with his sword-stick. Thinking that the man was in league with a
                            gang of thieves they threw him on the ground, and snatched away his
                            stiok. This attracted a large crowd and everyone thought that it was a
                            fight with thieves, the police agents being in plain cloathes. The
                            Sheikh el hara declared that he heard that thieves were attacking a
                            house and on going to find out what was happening, and received a shot
                            in the abdomen. In spite of all inquiries made up to the present, it has
                            not, as yet, been discovered by whom the police agent was wounded. An
                            Armenian, amongst whom some of those who were involved in the trouble
                            took refuge, has been questioned by the Parquet, but with no definite
                            result. In the meanwhile, the two Israelites have been handed over to
                            the care of the French Consulate to await developments.</p>

                        Austrian residents, “en fete.” A high mass was held at the Church of St.
                        Kugenie attended by the Austrian Consul and staff. This was followed by a
                        reception which in its turn gave place to a dinner held in the garden of the

                        case of plague on board, was there granted “free pratique." but on arrival
                        at Port Said yesterday the case for some time engaged the attention of the
                        quarantine officials, who declared it bona fide plague and removed the
                        patient to the segregation depot. No communioation with the shore was
                        allowed, and the vessel left in strict quarantine in the course of the after
                        noon for Malta.</p>
                    <p>CONGRATULATIONS.</p>
                    <p>It is with much pleasure that I announce the receipt here of news from
                        England of the birth of a son to Mr. and Mrs. Tarrel Mr. Tarrel is the
                        director of Customs in Port Said, and is well known to the inhabitants of

                    <head>LARGE PROPERTY SALE IN CAIRO.</head>
                    <p>The large fine block of buildings situated opposite the new Museum of
                        Antiquities in the Sharia Abbas, which belongs to the Mis- sion Afrioaine,
                        has been sold to Madame Fink, the former proprietor of the Pension Fink,
                        which is now being demolished, for £17,000,including the value of the site
                        of nearly 1,000 square metres. The building, which is four storied and was
                        erected about four years ago at a cost of £18,000 approximately, produces
                        now an annual rental of some £900, and in it are the head offices of the
                        Tramway Company. The present owner seems to have made a good bargain, for
                        when the new boulevard Abbas is completed, and the leases of the present
                        tenants expire in abont 1 1/2 years the rents of the several apartments are
                        likely to be increased. The Mission Africaine have a plot of vacant building
                        land in the vicinity, of 3,800 square metres, for which an offer of purchase
                        at £7 to £8 per square metre has just been refused, as it is expected that
                        the contemplated improve- ments, and the making of the boulevard, will be
                        certain to cause an increase in the value of land in this district.</p>
                    <p>THE SARKIS AFFAIR</p>
                    <p>Now that the unnatural mother, who was recently found guilty of employing her
                        own children for immoral purposes, and profiting by their gains, has been
                        punished, we should like to know if any measures have been taken to protect
                        these minors, who must need the most careful education, and the strictest
                        guard, after their demoralising experience. The sen- tence on the mother was
                        well deserved, but, what has been done, now that the children are left
                        fatherless, and temporarily motherless, without relations or friends, to
                        protect them from similar dangers in the future. There seems to have been a
                        certain want of enterprise in the court which condemned the woman Sarkis,
                        but, to judge from its silence on the matter, made no attempt to find out
                        who were the persons who had committed the offences of which the court had
                        ample evidence. Morally they are as guilty as the victims of the law, and it
                        is most unfortunate, in our opinion, that no attempt has been made to take
                        proceedings against them. Are they all protected by the Capitulations.</p>

                            <p>The export of cattle to Egypt continues. Attention has bean drawn
                                from time to time in the "Egyptian Gazette” to the vary lax methods
                                practised in the shipment to end disembarcation at Port Said of
                                cattle from Levantine ports, and some interesting com- munications
                                on the subject between certain Egyptian authorities were lately
                                published in the columns of your journal, which strikingly revealed
                                the need of improvement in this matter. I am assured that a shipment
                                of cattle from Cyprus to Egypt rarely takes place without deaths
                                ooourring from over- crowding, or other ill-treatment The animals
                                are little, if at all, fed or watered while on the journey, and if
                                report be true, they often stand in several inches of powdered
                                gypsum, the particles of which fill the air of the hold, and tend to
                                make Hie all hot insupportable to the wretched beasts. Tbs often
                                expressed opinion that this state of things oosts thousands of
                                pounds to Cypriot exporters is probably no exaggeration. There are
                                both in Egypt and Cyprus societies for the prevention of cruelty to
                                animals Could not they go into the subject jointly, and draw np a
                                report oontaining practical suggestions for the consideration of the
                                authorities responsible for the shipping regulations t The existing
                                regulations, it would seem, are either not enforced, or stand in
                                need of drastio revision, both in respeot of the spaoe allowed per
                                beast, the feeding, and the water- ing. Whatever the standing
                                regulations may be, it would appear to be necessary that an
                                authorised official should accompany each ship- ment to see that
                                they are duly earned out The present needless waste and depreciation
                                of animal life is deplorable, and exporters would be wise if they
                                agreed to pay a slightly higher rata of freight in order to insure
                                their cattle arriving in sound and healthy con- dition.</p>

                            <p>At this time of year whole villages are deserted in some parts of the
                                Island, the occupants having taken up their summer quarters in the
                                fields in order to protect their ripening crops, e.g. figs, melons,
                                olives, colo- cynths, etc. This is by no means an unneces- sary
                                precaution, as many small thefts are reported to the polive. The
                                villagers erevt little shanties of reeds, brushwood,etc., and the
                                owners of fig trees, especially, often find ex- cellent shade
                                beneath their wide-sprrading branches. Sumach is now being collected
                                from the vineyards, the leaves of which are dried and ground, and
                                exported to Syria and else- where for use in tanneries. Remunerative

                            <p>Now that the railway is open to traffic on the Nicosia-Famagusta
                                track, the question of appointing officials is to the fore. There is
                                a laudable desire to give posts, as far as possible, to Cypriots,
                                but there must be considerable difficulty in selecting the
                                applicants—of whom there are a great number—very few of whom have
                                ever seen a train. We hear of chemists’ oompounders, domestic
                                servants, etc. becoming stationmastors, train guards, and so forth,
                                and whether this is so or not, there must neces- sarily be many suoh
                                anomalies in the oase of the first introduction of a railway into
                                any country. The native press would wish to see all the appointments
                                filled by natives and at high rates of pay, but a little reflection
                                on their part should oonvinoe them that at least the more
                                responsible officials should be trained and experienced men, and
                                these are not to be be found at present among the Cypriots. The
                                minor, unskilled officials oould hardly expeot wages at the same
                                rate of pay as the higher olass men, though in time, no doubt, they
                                will beoome competent to fill the better paid posts.</p>

                        <p>Paris, August 90. The painter Bouguereau has died. (Havas) Adolphe
                            William Bouguereau, a French painter, and Member of the Institute, was
                            born at La Rochelle, Nov. 80, 1835. He began life in a business house at
                            Bordeaux, but obtained permission to attend the drawing school of M.
                            Alaux for two hours a day. His fellow-pupils treated him with contempt
                            on account of his business connections, and when, at tho end of the
                            year, he gained the first prize, the excite- ment was so great that a
                            riot ensued, and a formal protest was made by the pupils against his
                            receiving it, but without effect. He then turned all his attention to
                            painting, and enter- ed the studio of Pieot, in Paris, and later entered
                            the Boole des Beaux Arts, where his progress was rapid. In 1850 he went
                            to Rome, and in 1854 exhibited “The Body of St Cecilia borne to the
                            Catacombs,” since which time he has occupied a leading portion among the
                            artists of the Modern French School. His next great work was “Philomela
                            and Proone” 1861. Both these pictures are now in the Luxem- bourg.
                            “Mater Afflictorum,” or “Vierge Con- solatrice,” 1876, was purchased by
                            the French Government for 19,000 franca. Among his pictures exhibited at
                            the Salon may bd men- tioned "The Bather,” 1870; "Harvest Timd” 1879;
                            "The Little Marauders,” 1878; “Homer and his Guide,” 1874 ; Flora end
                            Zephyna,” 1875; "Pieta,” 1878; "Youth and Love," 1877; "The Scourging of
                            Our Lord," 1880; “Lie Virgin with Angela,” 1881; “Slave Carrying a Fan,”
                            1882; "The Youth of Bacchus,” and "Byblis," 1885; “Love Disarmed,” 1888;
                            Love Victorious,” 1887; "Baigneuaoa,” 1888; “Psyche and Lore,” 1889 ;
                            “L’Amour MouilM,” 1901. M. Bouguereau executed the mural paintings in
                            the St Louis Chapel of the Church of St C.otilde, and in the Church of
                            St Augustine. Many of his pictures have been engraved by Francois</p>
                        <p>SIR WILLIAM CLOWES.</p>
                        <p>Sir William Laird Clowes, the well-known naval critic and writer, passed
                            away at St Leonards last Monday; at the early age of forty-nine years,
                            having been born in 1856 at Hampstead. Deceased, who was knighted in
                            1902, was the eldest son of William Clowes some time one of the
                            Registrars in Chancery. Educated successively at Aldenham, King’s
                            College, London, and Linobln’e Inn, he at the last moment abandoned the
                            Bar for journalism, and wrote on technical subjects, chiefly naval,
                            subsaquently devoting himself to research in naval history. Some of his
                            papers on the condition of the Navy have been translated into many
                            languages, and have probably, for good or evil, had an enormous
                            influence upon naval as well as public opinion. He served on the Arts
                            and General Committees of the Royal Naval Exhibition of 1891, gained the
                            Gold Medal of the United States Naval Institute in the following year,
                            was elected a Fellow of King’s College, London in 1896, and was chosen
                            an hon. member of the Royal United Service Institution, before which he
                            had more than once lectured, in 1896. He was the author of numerous
                            books, indnding “The Naval Pocket-book,” "The captain of the Mary Rose,”
                            “Blood is Thicker than Water;” and others. Little more than two years
                            ago, in the preface to his "History of the Royal Navy,”he wrote," "Begun
                            at a time when I was in my usual good health. Volume I. was still in the
                            rough when I was attacked by a malady which, though its action is
                            sometimes slow, seldom spares the life of its victims ; and in
                            consequence I was suddenly ordered away from England, where alone I
                            could have prosecuted the work under conditions entirely favorable.
                            Except during intervals, I had to remain abroad or in the Channel
                            Islands until the autumn of 1909.” Sir William married in 1882 Ethel,
                            second daughter of the late L.F. Edwards, of Mitcham.</p>
                        <p>CAPTAIN R CECCONI.</p>
                        <p>Our Suez correspondent writes :— It is with the deepest regret that I
                            have to announce the sad death at Bert of Captain R Ceoooni (Capitaine
                            d’armement) of the Suez Canal Company. Captain Cecconi died yesterday
                            afternoon at 4 o’clock at his residence at Port Tewfik after a short
                            illness. His funeral took place at 4 p.m. to-day, and was attended by
                            the whole Euro- pean communities of Suez and Port Tewfik. Numerous
                            wreaths were sent by his friends. Several officials of the Suez Canal
                            Company specially came to Suez from Ismailia and Port Said, and were
                            present at the funeraL The deoeased had served the Canal Company for 30
                            years, and his death is greatly regretted by all who knew him. All
                            steamers in port and the shipping agencies have their flags at half-
                            mast.</p>

                        <head>AUGUST SKYE MEETING.</head>
                        <p>Saturday's Skye Meeting was decidedly abavev the average, as Skye
                            Meetings go; some good 'finishes, and rather unexpected ones too,
                            affording plenty of excitement to the audience, which if .not large -
                            that oould not be expected at this p'oriod of the summer—was representa-
                            tive. The Pari Mutnel paid well as a rule and the good fields tor the
                            third, fourth, and fifth races made speculation interesting, if not
                            always profitable. • T6 turn to the actual racing, the second event was,
                            of oouree, at easy and certain victory for Ishak Bey Hussein’s El
                            Tahawi.but in the third Suleik had to fight very hard for victory
                            against the same owner’s. Fadgham. Eoheme won an unexpected victory over
                            Prince Soled in the fourth race, but ini he fifth Mr. Sorsock’s, Sans
                            Pareil won a very easy victory. In the last race Moofid was, if
                            anything, the favorite, Mikado and Mirzaud having also s good many
                            supporters but, nobody, in spite of the 10 lb*, difference in weight
                            carried, auticipated that Moharrem l’asha Chehim's Barb would literally
                            run away from Ishak Bey Hussein's horse. The following is a description
                            of the various events :— SAN STEFANO PLATE of P.T. 2,500 to winner and

                            delay in the start owing to the breaking of a wire in the new maohine;
                            this, however, cast no reflection on its design, which has proved most
                            satisfactory, but merely showed a weakness in material whioh has to be
                            remedied. The horses went off at last at the dropping of the flag and
                            Ibrahim Bey Cherifs pair took the lead, Sanspareil and Lonlou well op.
                            Hadban was among the leaders half way with Mahroosse just behind, but
                            neither could stay, and when the horses came out into the straight
                            Sanspareil waa a certain winner. Up the straight he increased his lead,
                            leaving Lonlon second ; while Hadban, Cnpid, Mah- ronsse and Nessim

                        lease, unless a different form of lease is authorised by the Governor
                        General (ii.) Forms of leases and of oonveyanoes on sale are contained in
                        the third sohednle. 6. —The sale of agricultural lands will, as a rale, be
                        oondacted by private oontract. 7. (i) Where large blocks of agricultural
                        lands are sold for basin irrigation the oontract will generally follow the
                        lines recommended in the report ot the Cairo Committee dated June 1904.
                        (ii.) The amount of land which the Government is able to permit to be
                        perennially irrigated by pomps is Btriotly limited and has practically been
                        all granted. Irrigation by parnps during the period of High Nile (».«.,
                        between tho 15th day of July and the 81st day of January) will be permitted
                        in suitable cases, but on the distinct condition that the period of pumping
                        cannot be extended. Contraots for the sale of land which it is proposed to
                        irrigate by parnps daring the said period of High Nile will be a matter for
                        private negotiation. The following are the oonditions for purchase or lease
                        of own lands belong to the Govern- ment :— (а) Upon reoeipt of the
                        application, the Government will oonsider whether or not they will pat the

                        applicant to take the land on the terms of the application unless a higher
                        prioe (or rent) is offered for the land at the auotion. (c) The applicant
                        will deposit with the Go- vernor of the Provinoe, or the Direotor of Agri-

                        twentieth qf the prioe offered (or to'six months' rent at the rate ofierod).
                        This BQm will be refunded if the Government de- clines to sell (or lease)
                        the land to this appli- cant ( In case of a sale, the applicant may be
                        called upon to pay the balance of prioe as noon as this application shall

                    <head>COTTON IN KOREA.</head>
                    <p>A despatch has been received at the Foreign Offioe from H.M. Minister at
                        Seoul (Sir J. N. Jordan, K.O.M.G.), transmitting the following memorandum,
                        drawn up by a m^nber of the legation, containing the suhstance of a report
                        by Mr. Kato, a professor in the'Derartment of Commerce and Agrioultnre in
                        Tokio, who has reoently visited Korea in order -to make investigations into
                        the suitability of the oountry for the cultivation of cotton :— The
                        principal districts where ootton is at present produoed in Korea are the
                        provinoes of Pyeng An, Chiil La, Chong Cheng, Kyeng Sang, Kenng Keui, and
                        Whang Hai. The soil in these districts consists for the most part of
                        disintegrated granite sand, and Liable earth, woll suited for the
                        cultivation of ootton ; but the fanning methods of the Koreans are primitive
                        and inefficient, and the area of ootton underocltivation might, with
                        improvedmethods, and the use of proper manures, be greatly ex- tended, The
                        temperature does not differ greatly from that of the districts in the
                        neighbourhood of Oraka and Hisosbima, the principal oentres of cotton
                        growing in Japan, the whole of Korea, with the exception of the moat
                        northerly parts of the country, lying south of the 41st parallel of north
                        latitade. Again, the ootton plant thrives beat with good circulation of air
                        end a plentiful supply of water, and more especially with bnt little rain
                        daring the flowering period, Low the end of August to Ootober. The climate
                        of Korea, therefore, Bhould be most favorable to its successful cultivation.
                        Although it is not possible to specify o'early the different speoies of
                        ootton grown in Korea, those kinds of cotton known in Japan as Korean ootton
                        are (a) red-stalk; (b) green-stalk; (c); large Korean : and (d) small Korean
                        ootton.' The green-stalk, whioh is distinguished by its number of stalks and
                        its somewhat short fibre, also by its being the earliest variety by seme six
                        or ieven days, is the only distinct speoies. all the others being muoh alike
                        as regards the quality of the ootton, and only differing in appearance. The
                        fibre is fine and long ; compared with Japanese ootton about one-tent^ to
                        cine-seventh of an inch longer, and consequently somewhat longer than
                        Cbiqpse ootton and equal to Indian. In fqtqre, with carefol cultivation, it
                        should rival Indian ootton. Its lustre is about the same as that of Indian
                        or Chinese ootton, bat not qnito so good as the Japanese. As has been said
                        above, Korea is well suited to the oultnrg, of ootton. The cultivation of of
                        American np-land ootton hag not made much progress in Japan, owing to the
                        exces- sive rain foil. As the rainfall in Korea, however, is oonsidgrikbly
                        less, and as the kinds now grqwn do well in the oonntry, the conditions
                        should be well suited to the cultivation of American npland cotton.
                        Moreover, as the American variety is able to stand the beat of the morning
                        sun, the plains and projected seashore reclamations in Korea would be ex
                        oellantly suited for its culture, and the introduc- tion of the American
                        plant should be attended with considerable snocess. Seeing that the
                        oonditions in Korea would appear favorable to the cultivation of American
                        ootton, while the oost of importation into Japep from Amerioa renders this
                        deception very expen- sive, the motivation of ootton, and especially of the
                        American variety, in Korea should tend to lend a great impetus to the ootton
                        industry in Japan. An association for the cultivation of oqtton in Korea has
                        already been formed, and proposes to oommenoe operation* this year in the
                        neigh- bqcthpod of Mokpo. The rowing time being now (deepatoh dated May
                        16th) at hand, an expert and labourers are being sent from Japan. The
                        selection of these and the oondaot of the experimental efforts are to he
                        under the direc- tion of the Department of Agriculture. The authorities in
                        Japan have promised their fall icflort to the rental.</p>
