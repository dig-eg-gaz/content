                    We need not apologise to our readers for
                    recurring to the all import wt subjeots referred
                    to in Lord Cromer’* Reports, indeed almost
                    every line of thesaReports oould aptly be taken
                    at a text to be enlarged upon profitably. The
                    subjeots treated in these yearly “Gospels" are
                    so many and various, and deserve so much
                    thought, that to dismiss them in a few general
                    articles is to show an inadequate appreciation
                    of their public inteto it and importanoe. By an
                    unwritten law, of whioh we oannot deny the
                    propriety, Bgyptisn Givernment officials are
                    “not encouraged” to write in the pnblio press
                    on those particular subjects ol whioh they have
                    special oognisanoe and, even it it were other-
                    wise, their praise dr criticism, if suoh were
                    necessary, would naturally be *»k«n as “ex
                    parte”. Onr views, therefore, rightly partake of
                    the character of outside criticism and may be
                    modified by any undisclosed facts being brought
                    to 'light The subject of ourranoy is ao-
                    knowlelged to be one of much difficulty.
                    It is full of pitfalls, and has never been
                    reduced to a science, every oouutry —mning
                    to form an exception and requiring to be
                    dealt with differently. In aoountiy like Egypt,
                    arising anew, like a Pfcro iix, from the ashes of
                    a great past, whioh left no guide for its future,
                    the subjeot is one of great importance,
                    and of interest to the outer world, as
                    Egypt is the latest oouutry to establish a
                    new curren.y in aooordanoe with the best
                    modem ideas. In section 31 of the 1904
                    Report, attention is called to this subjeot
                    by the significant fact of the ooinage of LiR
                    629,000 in new silver ourrenoy. In order that
                    our readers may realise the retativo importanoe
                    of this large new supply we may mention that
                    the total imputation for the last five years
                    had only amounted to L.E 296,000, of whioh
                    L.K. 100,000 had only reoently arrived when
                    the above large supply was ordered; that the
                    whole amount of silver coined at the Con-
                    stantinople Mint during the year was not half
                    the amount purchased by Egypt; and that the
                    silver ourrenoy withdrawn during 1904 amount-
                    ed to only L.B. 10,780. We are sorry that the
                    oomplete report of Mr. Ronssin oould not have
                    been included in the appendix of Lord Cromer's
                    Report, as so exceptional an addition to the
                    coinage justified, and even called for the fullest
                    consideration and eluoidation, and it leaves ns
                    the neoessity of gathering many data from
                    extraneous sources.
                    It may not be ill-timed to recall the history
                    of Egyptian curreaoy. Ic is nut nacaiiary for
                    this purpose to go forthu book than the year

                    1884, and under the able guidinoe of Sir
                    Edgar Vinoent, the whole monetary system
                    was placed upon a new and sound basis. To
                    make the new system effective, it was neoess-

                        These ooinages were partly made up of old
                        ooins withdrawn and reooined. Assuming the
                        population of Egypt to be 10,000,000, and
                        allowing still for old ooins still in circulation,

                        10/-. or 50 piastres, per heed in Bagiand. But
                        the circulation in India wOl prove a better
                        basis for comparison. Owing to the hoarding
                        propensities of Mohammedan populations (so-
                        oording to IMenim’i obbotate oaloulatioo*)
                        two-thirds of the silver provided in India
                        disappeared in 50 yaais. We thirk Out it
                        would be safe to assume that the same tou
                        denoy to hoard will show itself in Egypt,
                        encouraged as it is by a religion whioh dii
                        oonntananoes the putting out of money to
                        usury. After making the deduction* neoeeeiUUd
                        by this disappearance of large sums, the
                        amount per head of silver circulating or
                        in bankers’ hands in India was, by Mr. H »r-
                        rison’s calculation, 6} rupees—say 85 piastres.
                        As Professor Jevons has observed, “no one
                        can tell how muoh ourrenoy a nation requires,
                        and to attempt to regulate its quantity is
                        the last thing a statesman world da" Never-
                        thelere in view of the importanoe of having a
                        supply adequate to the demand, without in-
                        curring any nnnaoeesary lots of interest, it is
                        very desirable to arrive at some rational
                        estimate from year to year. In the case of
                        Egypt it is essential to bear in mind the very
                        exceptional and rapid ohangas that are taking
                        place: i.e., the large addition to the land under
                        cultivation, necessitating inoreesed distribution
                        in small wages, the increase of the imports
                        and exports from LR 90,000,000 to LE.
                        40,000,000 sinoe the new ourrenoy was estab-
                        lished, the inorease of railway passengers from
                        9,800,000 to 15,000,000, and the prospect of
                        farther increases in all theae directions. As
                        regards imports and exports, it it true that
                        the latter are mainly dealt with by gold in
                        the bulk, but in tha oolleotioc of exports and
                        the distribution of imports, silver most be
                        largely employed; looomotion also involves
                        large amounts ot small silver ourrenoy. Under
                        these (riroumstanoes, it is not surprising that
                        tiie imports of silver up to 1908 proved quite
                        inadequate and that silver money rose to a
                        substantial premium in that year. It is rather
                        surprising that the shortage was not foreseen
                        and provided for. The sale of some of the
                        ooins, converted into ingots in 1890, showed a
                        still greater want of appreciation of the posi-
                        tion. The issue of notes by the National Bank
                        in 1898 for LR 1, and upwards, might be
                        thought to reduce the requirements of silver
                        to a certain extent, hat while rodeoing the
                        demand for the latter metal it is doubtful if
                        this (notwithstanding the inorease of the
                        oiroolation of theae notes from LR 53,000 in
                        1900 to LR 454,000 in 1904) has done much,
                        if anything, to displaoe silver, nor will it do
                        so until the native population generally have
                        made suoh a stride forward as oan not be
                        anticipated for many yean, possibly genera-
                        tions. The same mej be said as regards the
                        extension of broking facilities generally, in its
                        displacement of silver. We are inclined there-
                        fore to entirely approve of the recent addi-
                        tions to the silver ourrenoy bringing up the
                        small supply to nearly 30 piastres par head.
                        It passes the wit of man to lay down
                        any fixed guiding role for the futon, and
                        we think Mr. Ronssin would have been well
                        advised to admit this to Ahe full rather
                        than lay down as a basis for future guidanoe
                        that “the amount ordered should represent
                        the difference by whioh the Government stock
                        in Jane foils short of LR 400,000 as a
                        minimum," thj« gam being the mirimnw)
                        required for moving the cotton crop. We
                        oonfots we oannot follow this reasoning or
                        see why the ootton orop or the Government
                        bedding should be tht) sob) guide. In our
                        opinion the matter must be looked upon in
                        a much larger and broader manner. The
                        pants whioh require oonsideration seem to be:
                        1. That Egypt is still progressing and gives
                        promise of farther program at a very excep-
                        tional rate, added to whioh the future re-
                        quirements of the Sudan are an unknown
                        quantity.
                        8. That the population generally are gaining
                        money in exqem of their absolute requirements
                        and that the tendency is likely to be towards
                        hoarding their small gains, rather than provid-
                        ing themselves with further oomfbrts or luxu-
                        ries other than silver and gold ornaments,
                        and that owing to the Egyptian custom of
                        investing when possible in land, large amounts
                        of omn are likely to be laid by for that
                        eventual purpose, of whioh a considerable
                        quantity will be in silver.
                        3.	That the proportion per head of the
                        population of 90 piastres as against 6} rupees
                        in India is' stiR lo».
                        4.	The point-made by Mr. Ronssin, via,
                        "the moet important inferonoe to be drawn
                        from more reoent events is that the fear of
                        over issue, whioh underlies so muoh of the
                        restrictions imposed by the Royal Commis-
                        sion, has no longer any "raison d’etre f and
                        we add this further consideration, that the
                        Commission itself, notwithstanding its fears,
                        authorised an fosoe of 40 and not 90 piastres
                        par bead.
                        5.	That the forcing of silver to a premium
                        by an inadequate supply is thoroughly unsound
                        and oakulated to do great harm by enooung-
                        ing the holding of silver lor speculation, thus
                        intensifying the soareity, and should be avoid-
                        ed at all ooeta.
                        We oannot but think that on there points
                        our readers will agree with us that the
                        Government should in future aim at a
                        fully adequate provision of sz$all currency
                        and while we oannot approve Mr. Ronssin's
                        method of oaloulating for the future, the
                        oountry is to be congratulated upon-having at
                        the head of this department a man who is not
                        likely to advooate the mistakes of the past.
                        To keep in olose touch with the banks and
                        markets is the moet important thing; indica-
                        tions gathered from then trill be a better
                        guide than any fixed method of oaloulation.</p>

                        <p>The Conference has adjourned until Tues
                            day afternoon when the protocol will be signed.
                            Meanwhile the plenipotentiaries will consult
                            their respective Governments. The final deci-
                            sion rests with Tokio and St Petersburg. It is
                            noteworthy that the Japanese representatives
                            are confident of peace which is in contrast with
                            the Russian talk of failure.
                            The Conference disagreed on Article XI. but
                            agreed to Article XII: granting to the Japanese
                            fishing rights on the Siberian coast.	(R.)</p>

                            entertain Article XI., but has intimated that

                        <p>London, August 20.</p>
                        <p>It is officially stated that Viscount Curzon,
                            Viceroy and Governor-General of India, has
                            resigned. Mr. Balfour has communicated the
                            resignation to the King.	{Ranter)</p>
                        <p>Though Reuter’s brief telegram gives no
                            reason for Lord Corzon’s resignation, it is im-
                            possible to avoid the inference that it is in
                            some way connected with the recent dispute
                            between Lord Kitchener and the Viceroy. It
                            was generally stated and believed that the
                            dispute had terminated in a satisfactory com-
                            promise, but from the latest acoounts it seems
                            only too probable that after experience of the
                            actual working of the compromise, Lord Cur-
                            ton found it less satisfactory than it had ap-
                            peared on paper. On the other hand Lord
                            Curzon has now been seven years in India, hav-
                            ing been reappointed Viceroy in 1904, and is
                            known to be feeling the effects of the climate
                            and the hard work which his position involves.
                            Here, we hope, will be found the true cause of
                            his resignation, for the fact that a Viceroy had
                            retired in consequence of a dispute with the
                            Commander-in-Chief in India would be painful
                            to all who have the true interests of the Empire
                            at heart.</p>

                    can reoover. The girls gives as tflb reason for

                    thwarted in love, but refuses to give any details.</p>
                    
                    <p>Killed by a Mule. — On Saturday Aid
                    Ramadan, an arbagi, took a mule to water at
                    El Azarito, Mohsrrem Bey. He appears to
                    have tied the end of the rope by which he led
                    the animal round his waist. Being suddenly
                    alarmed, the male dashed off at full gallop,
                    and the unfortunate man fell and was dragged
                    along for some distance. His injuries were so
                    serious that he expired before he could be

                    number of deaths during the corresponding
                    period last year was 409. Since the commen-

                    collided on Saturday evening with a passenger
                    car which had stopped at Carlton station. The
                    driver of the goods tram appears to have been
                    suddenly attacked by a fit of giddiness, and to
                    have fallen down a few seoonds before coming
                    in sight of the passenger tram. Deprived of
                    guidance his tram ran straight into the car,
                    which had halted at tbe station. Both
                    trams were derailed by the shock, but happily
                    no passengers sustained injuries. The driver
                    of the passenger car received a wound in the
                    left band, which will require four days’ treat-
                    ment. The driver of the other tram car will be
                    under medical care for five days.</p>
                    
                    <p>Bubonic Plague. — The plague bulletin
                    issued by the Sanitary Department for the
                    week ending last Saturday shows a welcome
                    reduction in the number of cases which were
                    notified, and the number of localities in which
                    the cases ocurred is reduced to one, namely
                    Alexandria. The number occurring was seven,
                    three of which are Europeans. Three recoveries
                    and three deaths are reported, and there now
                    remain thirteen cases under treatment, twelve
                    of which are at Alexandria, and one at
                    Dekerness. The total numbers of cases since
                    January amounts to 228, Compared to 775
                    during the corresponding period last year.
                    Yesteday’s bulletin reports one death and one
                    recovery at Alexandria. The fatal case was
                    that of a native woman, who was found dead
                    at her house in the Mobattea Bay quarter.</p>

                            being between eight and nine kilometres. The
                            speed allowed on this electric railway will be
                            seventy kilometres an hour, whilst the tramways

                            or so, including stoppages on the way.
                            A tramway line will also be laid from their

                            <p>We mentioned recently in these columns
                                that the Government proposed to construct
                                a new barrage at Esneh, and that the Mini-
                                stry of Public Works had prepared the specifi-
                                cations for the works.
                                This new barrage is intended to hold up
                                the Nile flood for the irrigation of such lands
                                in Upper Egypt as are now deprived of water

                                effect of the existing low flood would in all

                                would have been minimised. The work will
                                take three years at least, the same time as
                                the Assiout one took, as it can only be done

                        <p>In our issue of 80th Jane last we mentioned
                            that the Tramway Company were making
                            considerable alteration on their old Cairo line
                            between Kaar-el-Nil square and Poum-el-
                            Khalig. These alterations comprise the doub-
                            ling of the line for a distance of abont two kilo-
                            metres, and the removal of the present single
                            line from the carriage way, in order to allow
                            that part of the road to remain entirely free for
                            vehicular traffic. The new double line is being
                            laid on one side, and a pavement is being
                            made between for pedestrians. These improve-
                            ments, which were necessitated by the con-
                            stantly increasing traffic, will avoid the delays
                            occasioned by there being only one line;
                            besides improving the carriage-way, which, in
                            future, will be ten metres wide. The work is
                            expected to be completed by the beginning of
                            next month, when the new service will com-

                            by the Parquet and deny the truth of the
                            charge brought against them. They assert
                            that they were passing by the house into which
                            the police had forced an entrance, when the
                            sister of one of them called to them from the
                            window, appealing for assistance against
                            burglars who had got into the house. As
                            they tried to enter, a man in civil dress
                            stopped them at the door, and threatened
                            them with his sword-stick. Thinking that the
                            man was in league with a gang of thieves they
                            threw him on the ground, and snatched away
                            his stiok. This attracted a large crowd and
                            everyone thought that it was a fight with
                            thieves, the police agents being in plain
                            cloathes. The Sheikh el hara declared that he
                            heard that thieves were attacking a house and

                            received a shot in the abdomen.

                            present, it has not, as yet, been discovered by
                            whom the police agent was wounded. An
                            Armenian, amongst whom some of those who
                            were involved in the trouble took refuge, has
                            been questioned by the Parquet, but with no
                            definite result. In the meanwhile, the two
                            Israelites have been handed over to the care of
                            the French Consulate to await developments.</p>

                            yesterday by the Austrian residents, “en fete.”
                            A high mass was held at the Church of St.

                            in its turn gave place to a dinner held in

                        <p>Now that the unnatural mother, who was
                            recently found guilty of employing her own
                            children for immoral purposes, and profiting
                            by their gains, has been punished, we should
                            like to know if any measures have been taken
                            to protect these minors, who must need the
                            most careful education, and the strictest guard,
                            after their demoralising experience. The sen-
                            tence on the mother was well deserved, but,
                            what has been done, now that the children
                            are left fatherless, and temporarily motherless,
                            without relations or friends, to protect them
                            from similar dangers in the future.
                            There seems to have been a certain want of
                            enterprise in the court which condemned the
                            woman Sarkis, but, to judge from its silence
                            on the matter, made no attempt to find out
                            who were the persons who had committed
                            the offences of which the court had ample
                            evidence. Morally they are as guilty as the
                            victims of the law, and it is most unfortunate,
                            in our opinion, that no attempt has been made
                            to take proceedings against them. Are they
                            all protected by the Capitulations.</p>

                        <p>(From our Correspondent.)
                            Nicosia, August 17.
                            The export of cattle to Egypt continues.
                            Attention has bean drawn from time to time
                            in the "Egyptian Gazette” to the vary lax
                            methods practised in the shipment to end
                            disembarcation at Port Said of cattle from
                            Levantine ports, and some interesting com-
                            munications on the subject between certain
                            Egyptian authorities were lately published in
                            the columns of your journal, which strikingly
                            revealed the need of improvement in this
                            matter. I am assured that a shipment of
                            cattle from Cyprus to Egypt rarely takes
                            place without deaths ooourring from over-
                            crowding, or other ill-treatment The animals
                            are little, if at all, fed or watered while on the
                            journey, and if report be true, they often stand
                            in several inches of powdered gypsum, the
                            particles of which fill the air of the hold, and
                            tend to make Hie all hot insupportable to tbe
                            wretched beasts. Tbs often expressed opinion
                            that this state of things oosts thousands of
                            pounds to Cypriot exporters is probably no
                            exaggeration. There are both in Egypt and
                            Cyprus societies for the prevention of cruelty
                            to animals Could not they go into the subject
                            jointly, and draw np a report oontaining
                            practical suggestions for the consideration of
                            the authorities responsible for the shipping
                            regulations t The existing regulations, it would
                            seem, are either not enforced, or stand in need
                            of drastio revision, both in respeot of the spaoe
                            allowed per beast, the feeding, and the water-
                            ing. Whatever the standing regulations may
                            be, it would appear to be necessary that an
                            authorised official should accompany each ship-
                            ment to see that they are duly earned out
                            The present needless waste and depreciation
                            of animal life is deplorable, and exporters
                            would be wise if they agreed to pay a slightly
                            higher rata of freight in order to insure their
                            cattle arriving in sound and healthy con-
                            dition.</p>
                        <p>AGRICULTURAL NEWS.</p>
                        <p>At this time of year whole villages are
                            deserted in some parts of the Island, the
                            occupants having taken up their summer
                            quarters in the fields in order to protect their
                            ripening crops, e.g. figs, melons, olives, colo-
                            cynths, etc. This is by no means an unneces-
                            sary precaution, as many small thefts are
                            reported to the polive. The villagers erevt
                            little shanties of reeds, brushwood,etc., and the
                            owners of fig trees, especially, often find ex-
                            cellent shade beneath their wide-sprrading
                            branches. Sumach is now being collected from
                            the vineyards, the leaves of which are dried
                            and ground, and exported to Syria and else-
                            where for use in tanneries. Remunerative
                            prioee are obtained. Some promising fields of
                            ootton, of tha “Peteririn" variety, are to be
                            seen near Morphou. They are flowering well.</p>
                        <p>NICOSIA-FAMAGUSTA RAILWAY.</p>
                        <p>Now that the railway is open to traffic on
                            the Nicosia-Famagusta track, the question of
                            appointing officials is to the fore. There is a
                            laudable desire to give posts, as far as possible,
                            to Cypriots, but there must be considerable
                            difficulty in selecting the applicants—of whom
                            there are a great number—very few of whom
                            have ever seen a train. We hear of chemists’
                            oompounders, domestic servants, etc. becoming
                            stationmastors, train guards, and so forth, and
                            whether this is so or not, there must neces-
                            sarily be many suoh anomalies in the oase of
                            the first introduction of a railway into any
                            country. The native press would wish to see
                            all the appointments filled by natives and at
                            high rates of pay, but a little reflection on
                            their part should oonvinoe them that at least
                            the more responsible officials should be trained
                            and experienced men, and these are not to be
                            be found at present among the Cypriots. The
                            minor, unskilled officials oould hardly expeot
                            wages at the same rate of pay as the higher
                            olass men, though in time, no doubt, they will
                            beoome competent to fill the better paid posts.</p>

                        <p>Paris, August 90.
                            The painter Bouguereau has died. (Havas)
                            Adolphe William Bouguereau, a French
                            painter, and Member of the Institute, was born
                            at La Rochelle, Nov. 80, 1835. He began life
                            in a business house at Bordeaux, but obtained
                            permission to attend the drawing school of M.
                            Alaux for two hours a day. His fellow-pupils
                            treated him with contempt on account of his
                            business connections, and when, at tho end of
                            the year, he gained the first prize, the excite-
                            ment was so great that a riot ensued, and a
                            formal protest was made by the pupils against
                            his receiving it, but without effect. He then
                            turned all his attention to painting, and enter-
                            ed the studio of Pieot, in Paris, and later
                            entered the Boole des Beaux Arts, where his
                            progress was rapid. In 1850 he went to Rome,
                            and in 1854 exhibited “The Body of St Cecilia
                            borne to the Catacombs,” since which time he
                            has occupied a leading portion among the
                            artists of the Modern French School. His next
                            great work was “Philomela and Proone” 1861.
                            Both these pictures are now in the Luxem-
                            bourg. “Mater Afflictorum,” or “Vierge Con-
                            solatrice,” 1876, was purchased by the French
                            Government for 19,000 franca. Among his
                            pictures exhibited at the Salon may bd men-

                            M. Bouguereau executed the mural paintings

                            forty-nine years, having been born in 1856 at
                            Hampstead. Deceased, who was knighted in
                            1902, was the eldest son of William Clowes
                            some time one of the Registrars in Chancery.
                            Educated successively at Aldenham, King’s
                            College, London, and Linobln’e Inn, he at the
                            last moment abandoned the Bar for journalism,
                            and wrote on technical subjects, chiefly naval,
                            subsaquently devoting himself to research
                            in naval history. Some of his papers on the
                            condition of the Navy have been translated
                            into many languages, and have probably, for
                            good or evil, had an enormous influence upon
                            naval as well as public opinion. He served on
                            the Arts and General Committees of the Royal
                            Naval Exhibition of 1891, gained the Gold
                            Medal of the United States Naval Institute in
                            the following year, was elected a Fellow of
                            King’s College, London in 1896, and was
                            chosen an hon. member of the Royal United
                            Service Institution, before which he had more
                            than once lectured, in 1896. He was the author
                            of numerous books, indnding “The Naval
                            Pocket-book,” "The captain of the Mary Rose,”
                            “Blood is Thicker than Water;” and others.
                            Little more than two years ago, in the preface
                            to his "History of the Royal Navy,”he wrote,"
                            "Begun at a time when I was in my usual good
                            health. Volume I. was still in the rough when
                            I was attacked by a malady which, though its
                            action is sometimes slow, seldom spares the
                            life of its victims ; and in consequence I was
                            suddenly ordered away from England, where
                            alone I could have prosecuted the work under
                            conditions entirely favorable. Except during
                            intervals, I had to remain abroad or in the
                            Channel Islands until the autumn of 1909.”
                            Sir William married in 1882 Ethel, second
                            daughter of the late L.F. Edwards, of Mitcham.</p>

                        <p>Our Suez correspondent writes :—
                            It is with the deepest regret that I have to
                            announce the sad death at Bert of Captain R
                            Ceoooni (Capitaine d’armement) of the Suez
                            Canal Company.
                            Captain Cecconi died yesterday afternoon at
                            4 o’clock at his residence at Port Tewfik after a
                            short illness. His funeral took place at 4 p.m.
                            to-day, and was attended by the whole Euro-
                            pean communities of Suez and Port Tewfik.
                            Numerous wreaths were sent by his friends.
                            Several officials of the Suez Canal Company
                            specially came to Suez from Ismailia and Port
                            Said, and were present at the funeraL
                            The deoeased had served the Canal Company
                            for 30 years, and his death is greatly regretted
                            by all who knew him. All steamers in port and
                            the shipping agencies have their flags at half-

                    <p>AUGU8T SKYE MEETING.
                    Saturday's Skye Meeting was decidedly
                    abavev the average, as Skye Meetings go; some
                    good 'finishes, and rather unexpected ones too,
                    affording plenty of excitement to the audience,
                    which if .not large - that oould not be expected
                    at this p'oriod of the summer—was representa-
                    tive. The Pari Mutnel paid well as a rule and
                    the good fields tor the third, fourth, and fifth
                    races made speculation interesting, if not
                    always profitable. •
                    T6 turn to the actual racing, the second
                    event was, of oouree, at easy and certain
                    victory for Ishak Bey Hussein’s El Tahawi.but
                    in the third Suleik had to fight very hard for
                    victory against the same owner’s. Fadgham.
                    Eoheme won an unexpected victory over Prince
                    Soled in the fourth race, but ini he fifth Mr.
                    Sorsock’s, Sans Pareil won a very easy victory.
                    In the last race Moofid was, if anything, the
                    favorite, Mikado and Mirzaud having also
                    s good many supporters but, nobody, in spite
                    of the 10 lb*, difference in weight carried,
                    auticipated that Moharrem l’asha Chehim's
                    Barb would literally run away from Ishak Bey
                    Hussein's horse.

                    There was some delay in the start owing
                    to the breaking of a wire in the new maohine;
                    this, however, cast no reflection on its design,
                    which has proved most satisfactory, but merely
                    showed a weakness in material whioh has to be
                    remedied.
                    The horses went off at last at the dropping
                    of the flag and Ibrahim Bey Cherifs pair took

                    Mahroosse just behind, but neither could stay,
                    and when the horses came out into the
                    straight Sanspareil waa a certain winner. Up
                    the straight he increased his lead, leaving

                    <head>COTTON IN KOREA.</head>
                    <p>A despatch has been received at the Foreign
                    Offioe from H.M. Minister at Seoul (Sir J. N.
                    Jordan, K.O.M.G.), transmitting the following
                    memorandum, drawn up by a m^nber of the
                    legation, containing the suhstance of a report
                    by Mr. Kato, a professor in the'Derartment
                    of Commerce and Agrioultnre in Tokio, who
                    has reoently visited Korea in order -to make
                    investigations into the suitability of the oountry
                    for the cultivation of cotton :—
                    The principal districts where ootton is at
                    present produoed in Korea are the provinoes
                    of Pyeng An, Chiil La, Chong Cheng, Kyeng
                    Sang, Kenng Keui, and Whang Hai. The soil
                    in these districts consists for the most part
                    of disintegrated granite sand, and Liable
                    earth, woll suited for the cultivation of ootton ;
                    but the fanning methods of the Koreans are
                    primitive and inefficient, and the area of ootton
                    underocltivation might, with improvedmethods,
                    and the use of proper manures, be greatly ex-
                    tended,
                    The temperature does not differ greatly
                    from that of the districts in the neighbourhood
                    of Oraka and Hisosbima, the principal oentres
                    of cotton growing in Japan, the whole of Korea,
                    with the exception of the moat northerly parts
                    of the country, lying south of the 41st parallel
                    of north latitade. Again, the ootton plant
                    thrives beat with good circulation of air end a
                    plentiful supply of water, and more especially
                    with bnt little rain daring the flowering period,
                    Low the end of August to Ootober. The
                    climate of Korea, therefore, Bhould be most
                    favorable to its successful cultivation.
                    Although it is not possible to specify o'early
                    the different speoies of ootton grown in Korea,
                    those kinds of cotton known in Japan as Korean
                    ootton are (a) red-stalk; (b) green-stalk; (c);
                    large Korean : and (d) small Korean ootton.'
                    The green-stalk, whioh is distinguished by its
                    number of stalks and its somewhat short fibre,
                    also by its being the earliest variety by seme
                    six or ieven days, is the only distinct speoies.
                    all the others being muoh alike as regards
                    the quality of the ootton, and only differing in
                    appearance.
                    The fibre is fine and long ; compared with
                    Japanese ootton about one-tent^ to cine-seventh
                    of an inch longer, and consequently somewhat
                    longer than Cbiqpse ootton and equal to
                    Indian. In fqtqre, with carefol cultivation, it
                    should rival Indian ootton. Its lustre is about
                    the same as that of Indian or Chinese ootton,
                    bat not qnito so good as the Japanese.
                    As has been said above, Korea is well suited
                    to the oultnrg, of ootton. The cultivation of
                    of American np-land ootton hag not made
                    much progress in Japan, owing to the exces-
                    sive rain foil. As the rainfall in Korea, however,
                    is oonsidgrikbly less, and as the kinds now
                    grqwn do well in the oonntry, the conditions
                    should be well suited to the cultivation of
                    American npland cotton. Moreover, as the
                    American variety is able to stand the beat of
                    the morning sun, the plains and projected
                    seashore reclamations in Korea would be ex
                    oellantly suited for its culture, and the introduc-
                    tion of the American plant should be attended
                    with considerable snocess. Seeing that the
                    oonditions in Korea would appear favorable
                    to the cultivation of American ootton, while
                    the oost of importation into Japep from
                    Amerioa renders this deception very expen-
                    sive, the motivation of ootton, and especially
                    of the American variety, in Korea should tend
                    to lend a great impetus to the ootton industry
                    in Japan.
                    An association for the cultivation of oqtton
                    in Korea has already been formed, and proposes
                    to oommenoe operation* this year in the neigh-
                    bqcthpod of Mokpo. The rowing time being
                    now (deepatoh dated May 16th) at hand, an
                    expert and labourers are being sent from Japan.
                    The selection of these and the oondaot of the
                    experimental efforts are to he under the direc-
                    tion of the Department of Agriculture. The
                    authorities in Japan have promised their fall
                    icflort to the rental.</p>
