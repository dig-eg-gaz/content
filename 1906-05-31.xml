                    <head>TURKEY IN ARABIA.</head>
                    <p>The recent news from Arabia is of r.markable interest in view of the
                        rumours, thus far unco firmed, of the reoccupation of Sanaa by the rebels of
                        the Yemen, and the reappearance in the British and German Press of the con-
                        troversy anent the Bagdad railway, ah oh, rather like the sea serpent that
                        is spoken of by the public as though it existed, is, as a matter of fact, as
                        hypothetical aa the marine monster. The struggles of the tribes of Central
                        Arabia would be aa unimportant and as uninteresting to the world as the
                        battles of the kites and crows were it not for the strategical importance of
                        the Red Sea and the Persian Golf and tbs politico-religious importance of
                        Medina and Mecca. The Sultan of Turkey, whose interests are mort affected by
                        any change in Arabia, loses no opportunity of acting on the maxim "divide et
                        imperà," and the recent history of the Central Arabian oasis is one of clan
                        leads complicated by Turkish interference. In the list few years of the
                        eighteenth century the Wahabi movement was first felt in Centra! Arabia.
                        Sa'ûd I., an able prince or Emir of Riadh, the southern oasis of the Nejd,
                        realised its political importance and put himself at its head. His conquests
                        were followed up by his cruel and energetic successor, Sa'ûd II. All Arabia,
                        from Petra to Oman, fell to this savage chief, whose armies sacked Kerbela
                        and Mesched Ali, threatened Damascus and Bagdad, took Mecca and Medina, and
                        might have brought back the Caliphate to an Arab when Ibrahim Pacha with a
                        well-equipped and gallant force set oat from Egypt, re-took the Holy Places,
                        routed the Wahabis in a pitched battle fought in the very centre of Arabia,
                        and after captor- ing their capital sent their ruler a prisoner to Sultan
                        Mahmoud, who very properly executed this scourge—not of unbelievers but of
                        his fellow-Muslems. </p>
                    <p>But the Oases of Riadh and Hail, Kassim, Meteyr, and Jebel Shammar regained
                        their independence. A new Wahabi kingdom was established at Riadh and might
                        have revived the greatness of the Sa'ûis, were it not for the rise of Hail.
                        Telal in the 'fifties, though a vassal of Riadh, had no love for the Wahabi
                        zealot. His Bedouin blood and traditions were imparted to his nephew Mohamed
                        ibn Rashid, who after disposing of his rivals and relatives, at last broke
                        away from Riadh, rooted his quondam masters, and re laced them to vassal-
                        age. In the 'nineties Mohamed died fall of years and glory and Abd-el-Az'z,
                        his nephew, took his place. But fortune had now veered round. Abd-el-Aziz
                        ibo Feysul, of the House of Sa'ùi, aided at first with Turkish support, made
                        war upon Hail. But Hail and its ruler called on the Porte and the Sultan
                        made ready to aid his suppliant, when he had been well beaten. The Sa'ûd
                        râler and Mubarek of Koweit at last overthrew the Hail chief after years of
                        raid and counter-raid, they marched upon Hail, when a new factor
                        appeared—Ach- met Pacha Faizi and an Osmanli army, before whom the Wahabis
                        melted away. The veteran General marched on to Medina and the Yemen. British
                        vessels saved Mubarek from chastise- ment Once again the war filmed out and
                        this time Abd-el-Aziz ibn Rashid fell in battle His nephew, Mut'ib,
                        maintains the fight against Koweit and the Sa'uds and now it is to be seen
                        whether the Turks will once again save the House of Rashid or whether they
                        will shift their support to the Wahabis. Whatever hap- pens we may be sure
                        that Yildiz does not wish this straggle—the offspring of clan feuds half a
                        century old—to end too rapidly.</p>

                    <head>EGYPTIAN COTTON SEED IN AMERICA.</head>
                    <p>The Bureau of Plant Industry of the Depart- ment of Agriculture at Washington
                        has, it is reported, abandoned its experiments with Egyptian cotton seed in
                        South Carolina and has transferred them to Georgia. The lack of success in
                        South Carolina was due to the shortness of the season, which prevented the
                        fibre from attaining its proper maturity. The experiments in that State
                        extended over a period of five years, and in favourable seasons a fibre was
                        produced fully equal to the Egyptian-grown staple in length, strength, and
                        quality. In favourable seasons yields nearly as large as the yields of
                        upland were obtained, and served to encourage the hope of ultimate success.
                        The general impression produced by tpe continued ex peri men ting, however,
                        was that a more southerly climate and a longer season were necessary in
                        order to secure entire success. And therefore a fresh trial has been begun
                        in the neighborhood of Hogansville, Georgia. Experiments made in New Mexico
                        and Arizona have also promised well, and, it is believed, will demonstrate
                        eventually that Egyptian cotton can be grown with profit in these
                        territories.</p>

                    <p>THE CASE OF SERGT. MAJOR HOYNE</p>
                    <p>The case of Sergeant-Major Hoyne has excited)considerable interest in England
                        owing to his having been sent to the workhouse by the military authorities
                        of Netley Hospital when he bad a substantial balance at an Egyptian bank and
                        was in receipt of a pension. Sergeant-Major Hoyne was well- known in Cairo
                        and served a long and most creditable term of service in the Egyptian Army. </p>
                    <p>Being an Irishman, his fellow-patriots at Cairo are bestirring themselves to
                        bring this undeserved insult to Irish members of the Army of the King to the
                        notice of the responsible authorities with a view to prevent- ing such an
                        undeserved slur occurring again to Irishmen who are loyally serving their
                        King and country. There was not the slightest reason for the military
                        authorities to have despatched Hoyne to the South Stoneham workhouse as he
                        is not in indigent circum- stances. </p>
                    <p>Great indignation has been aroused both in Ireland and Cairo at this
                        gratuitous insult to the alternation. Sergeant-Major Hoyne only left Egypt
                        recently. He was on the headquarters staff of the Egyptian Army and was much
                        respected.</p>

                        the surface. </p>
                    <p>A great feature of the external part of the hotel will be a magnificent
                        terrace over- looking the Nile and the Theban hills. It will be semi
                        circular in shape, with two arms extending along the whole frontage of the
                        hotel, 125 meters in length. The building will consist of a ground fl or and
                        three stories and will be able to accommodate two hundred guests. There will
                        be a large number of public rooms, billiard-rooms, smoking-rooms,
                        music-rooms, card rooms, etc. A large number of private suites fitted with
                        all the latest conveniences in the shape of oath-rooms and so on will be
                        constructed. Many of the private bed-rooms will also have bath-rooms
                        attached. There will bean an electric lift and luxuriouslyappointed bar
                        with two English and one French billiard tables in it The garden will be
                        also one of the features of the hotel, but it will of course take some time
                        before the shrubs and trees can develop. </p>

                    <p>Keneh, Tuesday. </p>
                    <p>Mr Jefferson, inspector of the Khedivial Agricultural Society, accompanied by
                        Abdul Hamid Bey Abaza, secretary of the society, arrived at Keneh to-day.
                        Awaiting their arrival in the Moudirieh were all the mamours of mar- kases
                        and a large number of omdehs, notables, and agriculturists from different
                        villages of the locality. Abdul Hamid Bey delivered a speech explaining to
                        the gathering the object for which the society was organized. He drew their
                        attention to the many benefits to be derived by devoting more care to the
                        cultiva- tion of their land. He also pointed out the great benefits The
                        Lower Egyptian fellah obtain- ed by the use of manure. His speech created a
                        favourable impression and afterwards 150 enrolled themselves as subscribers
                        to the society—an occurrence which was never dream- ed of in an Upper Egypt
                        mondirieh like Keneh. In order to er courage agriculturists in this locality
                        the inspector distributed to them some free samples of chemical manures so
                        as to give them an opportunity of judging of their utility. </p>
                    <p>Various suggestions were offered by some of those present, among others by
                        Mr. Yessa Andrawis, Russian consular agent at Luxor, and Hassan Bey Bakry,
                        contractor, all bearing on the beat means to be taken for the improve- ment
                        of irrigation, the utilization of land, etc. The representatives of the
                        society agreed to their demands and promised to see to them in the near
                        future. </p>
                    <p>The inspector and the secretary loft to-day for Armant to enquire into the
                        cotton worm, which has made its appearance there. Thence they will leave for
                        Korn Ombo, where some agricultural experiments will ho undertaken on the
                        newly-cultivated region of the southern desert.</p>

                        communication sent to me by hie Excellency Saba Pasha, Postmaster General of
                        Egypt, it is necessary to explain that the agreement signed with the Italian
                        Post Office provides that, on and after July 1, 1906, letters between Italy
                        and Egypt will be charged their respective inland rates, so that from Egypt
                        to Italy the postage will be Id. per letter of 15 grammes, and from Italy
                        the domestic rate prevailing there, which is 15 centimes. A similar
                        agreement is in existence between Australia and England, but both Italy and
                        Australia are expected to reduce their inland postage rates to one penny

                        because nobody at Constantinople, "well knowing the Sultan's fear of

                    <head>THE JEWS AND PALESTINE.</head>
                    <p>The "Shekel Day" demonstration of the English Zionist Federation took place
                        at the Great Assembly-hall, Mile-enH, London, on Monday week. The chair was
                        occupied by Mr. B. S. Straus, M.P., and the principal object of the
                        gathering was to assist the movement finan- cially. In opening the
                        proceedings the chair- man said every Jew wished for a permanent home in
                        Palestine, and although they would be glad to secure a publicly recognized
                        fixed tenure elsewhere, yet, without appealing alto- gether to sentiment,
                        Palestine was the aim of their endeavours, as it was the home of their fore
                        fathers. Sir Frauds Montefiore moved a resolution that those present place
                        on record their conviction that only by the establish- ment of a legally
                        secured home in Palestine could any permanent help be rendered to the Jewish
                        people. They believed that only failure and disappointment could result from
                        attempt- ing to establish a Jewish State elsewhere, and they urged all to
                        support the Zionist movement. The.resolution was adopted, and copies were
                        ordered to be sent to the Prime Minister, tho Secretary for Foreign Affairs,
                        and the Colonial Secretary.</p>

                    <p>COPE WHITEHOUSE'S PETITION.</p>
                    <p>We have received a copy of the petition of Mr. Cope Whitehouse to the United
                        States Senate on the subject of his pretended claims against the Egyptian
                        Government on tho Wady Rayan question. It is far too lengthy a document to
                        reproduce in our columns, but as a sample of its contents, we will quote
                        Clauses 8 and 11, which run as follows :— Eighth : In the opinion of an
                        American offi- cer who had been in the Egyptian service, Maj. Gen. Loring
                        Pacha, printed in 1884, it was, at that time, the deliberate intention of
                        England to depopulate the Sudan ; dissipate the accumulated wealth cf Egypt
                        ; increase its debt* j destroy its means of defence, and cripple its
                        recuperative powers. He correctly describes, by anticipation, the present
                        condition of the country. </p>
                    <p>Eleventh : And your petitioner respectfully shows that these papers prove,
                        that since August 1882 ; (a), there has been an uninter- rupted series of
                        acts, for which the Government of His Britannic Majesty is responsible,
                        intend- ed to obstruct American enterprise and to exclude American influence
                        from Egypt, which has met with entire success; and, that, the immediate
                        removal of the officials implicated is necessary for the re establishment of
                        the respect due to the Government of the United States ; (b), that your
                        petitioner has been deprived of the use and enjoyment of property, whose
                        rea- sonable income and profit, for the last ten years, would have been not
                        less than $10.000,000 year- ly. and has, also, been compelled, especially
                        since 1887, to incur large and entirely unneces- sary expenditure of time,
                        labor, and money, in advocating this scheme of great public utility against
                        the factious opposition of the Diplomatic Agent and Consul General of Great
                        Britain ; and in defending the accuracy of his statements against the
                        reckless and wanton aspersions cast upon them by the Diplomatic
                        Representative of Great Britain, or persons employed by him, to delay the
                        execution of the Raiyan Isthmian Canal, against the will of the inhabitants
                        of Egypt. For which your petitioner considers that he is fairly entitled to
                        receive as compensation from the Government of Great Britain, not less than
                        $5,000,000.</p>
                    <p>The American Press is rather facetious over this document. For example, the
                        New York "City News" remarks:- </p>
                    <p>Usually the eminently respectable, though somewhat sombre Congressional
                        Record is not very popular among its literary contemporaries,
                        notwithstanding that grave Senators of the United States are more or less
                        regular contri- butors to its pages. Therefore it is all the more refreshing
                        to find in a literary review the solemn analysis of a Senate contribution to
                        the great government gazette which here follows under the title of "Senate
                        Document No. 104" : "Senate Document No.-104" contains all the papers placed
                        before the Senate Committee considering Mr. Cope Whitehouse's long- standing
                        claims against the Egyptian Govern- ment. In them there is much that is
                        interesting in relation to the changes that have taken place in the
                        cartography of Middle Egypt since 1882, and the importance of the Fayoum in
                        history. It may now be considered as accepted by the most competent
                        authorities that the Auaris of Manetho is the Hawara, which was the key of
                        the canal of Joseph, defended by the palace fortress, whose dimensions
                        evoked the epithet portentosissimum, from the elder Pliny. It is depicted
                        upon the papyrus, trans- lated by Dr. Pleyte, and published by the Dutch
                        Academy of Sciences. The Ministry of Public Works in Cairo has published a
                        number of works, both engineering and geological. In Beadnell's treatise
                        there are photographs of extreme interest, showing the basin of the Wadi
                        Rayan, which occupies the site of the Lacus Meridis of the Ptolemaic maps.
                        The body of water, if it ever became one, and passed beyond the stage of a

                    <p>Now anyone who can have the heart to say that this isn't real nice and
                        friendly reviewing mapt be a trifle jaundiced and dyspeptic. But what will
                        most gladden the hearts of the humble gazers at the great will be this
                        joyful indication of the growing popularity of the ponderous and
                        plutocratioc United States Senate in the literary world. It raises high
                        hopes that we may yet have a real rollicking play from that grand
                        aggregation which will astonish the natives.</p>

                    <p>On Tuesday last the remains of Mr. Henry Sherrard were interred in the
                        Protestant Ceme- tery at Old Cairo. Mr. Sherrard died in the Anglo-American
                        Hospital of typhoid fever supervening on pneumonia. He was the son of the
                        Rev. Hugh Sherrard, Vicar of St Thomas, Stourbridge, Worcestershire, and had
                        been I for several years master in the Coptic Patriarchal school, where he
                        did excellent work. He was an M.A. of the University of London and was a
                        good scholar. But his chief distinction was as a chess-player. He was
                        certainly the second English chess player and only just missed the
                        championship.</p>

                        by being knocked down by a motor-bicycle in Barwick. Mrs. Jaffrey was the

                    <p>Prenant des informations, hier, sur les motifs qui ont amené Faure an
                        suicide, on none ré- pondit que, pen de jours auparavant, la muni palité lui
                        avait refusé l'antorisation de vendre. de la glace dans les rues, comme il
                        l'avait fait l'an dernier et que ce refus pourrait bien etre la cause de son
                        acte de désespoir. La munici- palité, nous dit-on, n'aurait tenu compte en
                        cette circonstance ni de ses antécédents, ni de; recommandations qui loi
                        furent présentées. Comme de juste cela nous parut étrange el laissait à
                        penser que Faure pouvait bien ne pa etre aussi recommandable qu'on le
                        disait, mai- une visite an consulat de France nous apprit que non seulement
                        la demande de Faure niait an grand nombre d'autres présentées par des gens
                        très honnêtes avaient obtenu le même résultat. </p>
                    <p>Qu'est-ce à dire ? On nous laissera harceler sans trêve et sans merci par
                        tontes sortes de camelote jusque dans l'intérieur des établis- semants ; on
                        laisse ciruler librement les joueurs d'orgues de barbarie et autres soi-
                        disant musiciens, gens la plupart du temps de moeurs absolument inavouables
                        qui seraient bien embarassés de définir leurs moyens d'existsnce, et, quand
                        un brave homme, un travailleur, "viendra leur demander l'autori- sation de
                        gagner honnêtement sa vie, elle lui sera impitoyablement refusée. </p>
                    <p>La Municipalité doit certainement svoir quelque raison pour employer des
                        mesares aussi rigoureuses envers des gens qui ne let méritent pas, nous
                        serions bien aises de con- naître, le motif qui la porte a agir ainsi.</p>

                        semble attendre la fin de h liquidation ici et à Alexandrie pour s'orienter
                        Pour l'instant, les indices locaux ne sont n inquiétants, ni même mauvais.
                        L'argent es abondant, et la position au Caire est relative ment bonne ;
                        celle d'Alexandrie n'inspire pas d'antre part, des appréhensions sérieuses,

                    <p>Tile amount of business in Egyptian Cotton this weak has been very small,
                        scarcely suffi- cient to test prices. The circular quotations are unchanged.
                        In Futures only a moderate business has been done, and the latest quota-
                        tions are, delivery :—</p>

                    <p>American Futures. The market this week has' been dull and inanimate ; and
                        prices (owing chiefly to the absence of business) have deolined 11 points
                        for the old, and 7 @ 8 points for the new crop positions, from those of last
                        Thursday. There is absolutely no feature. The reports of the growing crop 1
                        are generally considered to have slightly im- proved, but the unofficial
                        estimates of the acreage are, es a rule, very little larger than those of
                        last season. We are now however looking forward to the Bureau figures, which
                        are expected on the 4th or 5th proximo, with something more than the usual
                        interest. The following are the latest quotations :—</p>

                        correspondents, but we wish, in a spirit of fair play to all, to

                    <p>PAN-ISLAMISM.</p>
                    <p>To The Editor of the "Egyptian Gazette." Sir,—A few days ago there appeared
                        in the "Egyptian Gazette" an open letter to Mustapha Pacha Kamel, wherein
                        the writer en devoured to "draw" the Editor of "Al Lewa" on the subject of
                        Pan-Islamism. The arguments your correspondent employed against this in-
                        teresting Islamic movement were, firstly, the principle of Pan-Islamism as a
                        union of the Moslem world under the Sultan was practically impossible
                        under present circumstances; secondly, that even were it possible it would
                        be undesirable from a Moslem point of view because of the misrule prevailing
                        throughout the Ottoman administration ;and, lastly, that in the interest of
                        the world's progress the move- ment is mischievous, as it implies a Jehad.
                        In spite cf the plausible manner in which "Julius' presents his case, I fail
                        to see that any one of his arguments rests on any solid basis. First and
                        foremost, Pan-Islamism can only exist as a religious-political oread on the
                        basis of or reunion of Islam under the Sultan. "Julius" asks : "Will the
                        Mos'ems of India cast off infidel rule and depend on the Sultan of Roum to
                        defend them against the Sikh and the Ghoorka, the Mahratta and the Rajput ?
                        Will Shiah combine with Sunni ? Will the warriors of Yemen and Nejd accept
                        the rule of the Turk ? Will European nations permit the disciples of Aboul
                        Hoda and Izzet Pacha to drive them from their possessions ?" I cannot see
                        why any of these contingencies, which are presumed to be the mere idle
                        dreams of a fanatic, cannot come to pass. Anything is possible in history
                        and an ambi- tious and statesmanlike Caliph would not find the reunion of
                        Islam an impossible task. The renaissance of Turkey would take years of long
                        and patient toil, but is it more incredible than the transformation within a
                        generation of the corrupt and feeble France of Louis XV. to the Franca of
                        the Napoleonic Eooch or of the sudden rise of Japan from the antiquated
                        feudalism of the Samurai to a recognised position among the strongest Powers
                        in the world t Secular fends and hatreds may be, as "Julius" says, serious
                        obstacles in the path of Pan-Islamism, but they will easily be swept in the
                        onrush of the mighty movement. That such a movement is possible few will
                        gainsay, Tor Islam is as vital a force now as ever it was in the past, and
                        as its followers see that every year they become more insignificant
                        politically, their enthusiasm for their religion becomes the more keen, for
                        they perforce have to acknow- ledge-that their religion alone prevents them
                        from practical annihilation. It may be argued that there is little
                        likelihood of a succession of strong fillers, who will carry on the Pan-
                        Islamic Propaganda of Abdul Hamid. But when the time is at hand a leader
                        will inevitably be forthcoming. </p>
                    <p>It is thought that the Turkish Empire is in a hopelessly decayed state, and
                        for some genera- tions past it has been the fashion to anticipate its
                        break-np. But to-day it is as strong as It ever was in the last century, and
                        the corrup- tion of its Government has in no wise effected the character of
                        its people, whose loyalty, piety, and sense of honour always excite the
                        admira- tion of those Europeans who know them. Ethically the Turk is far
                        superior to the Syrian, Armenian, and other Christian races in the Near
                        East, and his political regeneration is not without the bounds of
                        probability. Lord Pal- merston, who had a good deal to do with Turkey,
                        remarked in 1839 :- </p>
                    <p>"As to the Turkish Empire, if we can procure for it ten years of peace under
                        the joint protec- tion of the five Powers, and if those years are profitably
                        employed in reorganizing the internal system of the empire, there is no
                        reason what- ever why it should not become again a respectable power. Half
                        the wrong conclusions at which mankind arrive are reached by the abase of
                        metaphors, and by mistaking general resem- blance or imaginary similarity
                        for real identity. Thus people compare an ancient monarchy with an old
                        building, an old tree, or an old man because the building, tree or man must
                        from the nature of things crumble, or decay, or die, they imagine that the
                        same thing holds good with a community, and that the same laws which govern
                        inanimate matter or vegetable and animal life, govern also nations and
                        states. Than which there cannot be a greater or more utterly unphilosophical
                        mistake. For besides all other points of difference, it is to ba remembered
                        that the component parts of the building, tree, or man remain the same, and
                        are either decomposed by external causes, or are altere 1 in their internal
                        structure by the process of life, so as ultimately to be unfit for their
                        original functions ; while on the contrary, the component parts of a
                        community are under- going daily the process of physical renovation and of
                        moral improvement. Therefore all tint we hear every day of the week about
                        the decay of the Turkish Empire, and its being a dead body or sapless trunk,
                        and so forth, is pore and unadulterated nonsense." </p>
                    <p>"Julius" evidently labours under a misap- prehension of human, and especially
                        Oriental, nature. The passage to which I refer is so curious in its
                        underlying misconceptions that I will quote it in fall. He asks :— </p>
                    <p>"If you accept the Grand Turk as your master, I would ask you whether you see
                        much to admire in his rule. Do you approve of its accompaniments the
                        grinding taxation that is depopulating Syria, the delation that makes every
                        Moslem afraid to express his inmost thoughts, the corruption that poisons
                        justice, the strange combination of niggardliness and prefasion that robs
                        the Empire of its wealth and is misnamed finance? Do you—who claim to be
                        impelled by progressive and liberal ideas <cb n="3"/>—admire the
                        obscurantism that discourages science, that opposes invention ? Have yon
                        lived in any Ottoman province far from the Capital that has bewitched yon aa
                        fallen Rome bewitched all the World and seen the con- scripts dragged away
                        shoeless, half-clothed, without doctors, without transport, to die in the
                        Yemen or serve without pay year in, year oat, in Macedonia or Kurdistan ?
                        There is a reverse side, remember, to the Ottoman medal." This passage rests
                        on a' most perverse read- ing of human nature. Is not "Julius" well aware
                        that, although the Egyptian was never more prosperous than he is to day, he
                        is be- coming more and more ill disposed towards us, as witness the recent
                        school strikes and the attitude of the entire native Moslem Press during the
                        Akaba incident ? Have con- siderations of comfort or discomfort ever
                        influenced mankind whenever it is a question of fighting for an idea ? All
                        through history we see human beings sacrificing everything to this. It is so
                        obvious that we fail to grasp it. A few weeks ago a well known member of the
                        staff of the "Timer," who his been contri- buting some important articles on
                        India to his paper, noticed with some astonishment that "Nationalism," as
                        exhibited in the National Congress, was growing in power in India :— "The
                        National Congress party, in its best and worst aspects, is essentially a
                        product of oar own making. We have been engaged for nearly a century in
                        expanding the area of English education in India, and in every succeesive
                        generation an increasing number of young Indians have beea initiated through
                        our language and our literature into a new world of thought Yet, so far, the
                        main result has been to breed in them a spirit of revolt against the
                        political ascendency of the race to whose superiority in the realm of
                        knowledge their eagerness to share in the benefite of the educa- tion which
                        it imparts is an abiding tribute." Here is a testimony to the existence of a
                        spirit of "Nationalism" prevailing in India identical with that which has
                        come into existence of recent years in Egypt. How is it that while both
                        countries have benefited immensely by out rule, the people dislike us more
                        and more, and in the case of Egypt are so perverse as to prefer the
                        maladministration of the Ottoman to the guidance of Lord Cromer ? No; the
                        argument of "Julius" on this point it futile, for it runs counter to the
                        noblest tendencies of mankind. The Republican Opposition in the Roman Empire
                        were as foolish in their prefer- ence for a corrupt aristocracy to a wise
                        auto- cracy as was the Jacobite gentleman who sacrificed himself and his
                        house for the sake of the Stuarts. Yet somehow or other the world persists
                        in casting a halo about these heroes of lost causes, and even be 1 cannot
                        but respect the Egyptian, who would sacrifice his own and his country's
                        welfare for the sake of the Pan- Islamic idea. When the time comes all
                        thoughts of the material advantages, which the English Occupation^ has
                        conferred, will be cast to the winds before the impulse of the overmastering
                        idea. </p>
                    <p>The last argument of 'Julius" is that Pan-. Islamism will lead to a new
                        Jehad, which will provoke a new crusade and thereby lead to the political
                        overthrow of Islam. The same line of argument is used against Imperialism,
                        which the Little Englander declares provoked the Boer War, or against
                        Pan-Germanism which, so we are told, will lead to a European con- flagration
                        on the death of the Austrian Empe- ror. The Pan-Islamist can retort that the
                        game is well worth the candle and that it is at any rate an object that
                        deserves working for, if Islam is to justify its continued exist- ence. He
                        may also point oat that Europe will not combine in a new Crusade if Islam is
                        strong enough to take the control of its political destinies in its own
                        hands any more than Europe would venture to combine against Japan or a
                        resuscitated China. Of course, Pan Islamism cannot be regard ed with
                        sympathy by the British Govern- ment, any more than can Pan Germanism, for
                        it mast be mainly directed against us as the greatest Moslem Power in the
                        world. But we ought not therefore to shut our eyes to the great significance
                        of the movement or believe that it is a mere idle fad of Egyptian Anglo-
                        phobes, because it is preached so vehemently by self-advertising native
                        journalists. Pan- Islamism goes a good deal deeper than mere discontent with
                        England's position in Egypt, and an Egyptian Moslem is as logically entitled
                        to hold to it as a political religions creed, as is an Irish Celt to Home
                        Rule and hatred of the Saxon.—Yours truly, </p>

                    <p>The Money Market. </p>
                    <p>The paucity of credits is still most marked in this market, and although
                        borrowers have not actually been driven to the Bank 'of Bnglacd recently in
                        order to meet their re- quirements, there appear to have been only jest
                        enough loanable funds to go round. The spam which so disturbed the market
                        about three weeks ago may fairly be said to have passed away, leaving a
                        legacy of a little more wisdom, as evidenced by the manner in which discount
                        rates have been sustained at a reasonable level. Another beneficial re- sult
                        has been the attention which has been drawn to the question of our gold
                        reserve, resulting in the welcome announcement of the Chancellor of the
                        Exphequer that the subject is engaging his "most serions atten- tion." </p>
                    <p>Of course, the timely warning which the Bank passed round to the bill brokers
                        against letting rates slip away too readily has not been lost sight of, and
                        is still operating as a steadying factor, but it seems quite probable that
                        the scarcity of loanable funds would in any case have bad that effect, the
                        more so shoe the exchanges, although not actually threatening, evince an
                        uncertain attitude. </p>
                    <p>America's needs are still a doubtful quan- tity. San Francisco's requirements
                        are probably not all met yet, and the new issues on that side of the
                        Atlantic may at any moment call for a farther booking of the precious metal.
                        Should this be so, it is doubtful on whom the drain would fall, and although
                        it is hoped that France would bear the brunt, the exchange on London in New
                        York is not at all a safe figure, and shows a weak tendency. For a week, at
                        any rate, we cannot look forward to mach ease, and loans for that period
                        command 3 1/4 %, whilst discounts are quoted to day at 3 1/2 % for fall
                        three months, and 3 9/16 for 60-day paper. </p>
                    <p>The Stock Markets. </p>
                    <p>Whilst the Morocco Conference was in pro- gress, and the result uncertain,
                        members of the Stock Exchange had sufficient explanation to account for the
                        doll state of business, and they comforted themselves with the confident
                        pro- phecies that were made that, once this dis- turbing feature was out of
                        the way, we should see a revival of activity. When the matters in dispute
                        were amicably settled at Algeciras, the trouble with the Sultan cropped np,
                        end this was saddled with the Responsibility for the continuance of
                        idleness. Now, however, the coast is clear. Trade was never brisker, and
                        although our relations with the other Powers are of the happiest, yet this
                        week has been one of the most unfruitful on the Stock Exchange ever
                        experienced at this period of the year. Business in all sections has been at
                        a minimum, That, there is some other cause outside those usually quoted for
                        this state of things iB now quite evident. What the cause is one can only
                        surmise. The investing public seem to have lost all heart, and will not come
                        in to assist, A striking evidence of their disinclina- tion to deal in
                        first-class securities is seen in their neglect of Consols. Never since the
                        war have these securities had such a bright pro- rit before them, yet the
                        buying in this ket is of the most desultory kind, and the price is a full
                        point lower than during the Morocco Conference. For this state of nerv-
                        ousness the reactionary attitude of the Government is in no small degree
                        responsible. The lack of stability which has characterised their decisions
                        on several Important occasions has created amongst prospective investors a
                        feeling that they are not to be trusted. Yesterday the International bourses
                        were closed in recognition of Ascension Day, and this caused the markets
                        here to be even more depressed. At the time of writing the same condition of
                        affairs prevails. </p>
                    <p>The only feature of interact has been the new issue of Great Western Railway
                        Ordinary stock. This issue, amounting to £2,000,000, is offered to existing
                        proprietors at 125, payable in instalments extending until January 1st,
                        1907, from which date it is to carry dividend. The issue was largely
                        dicounted before its appearance. The quotation for the script was 1 1/2
                        premium. </p>
                    <p>Console. </p>
                    <p>The gilt-edged market has been quiet, and Consols have kept steady at last
                        week's levels. The announcement on Wednesday that £100,000 in bar gold had
                        been bought, and that the Indian Government had released £500,000 of gold
                        marked for the Currency caused some increased buying, but the im- provement
                        was not sufficient to affect the price materially. They close to night at 89

                    <p>The unsatisfatory relations existing between the Tsar and his somewhat
                        revolutionary Duma have kept Russian bonds weak since our last, and the prim
                        yesterday for the Fours was as low as 81 3/4.They leave off to night at this
                        figure. <cb n="5"/> Japanese have been quiet, but yesterday they again
                        received attention, aBd advances of 1/8 were recorded in several of the

                    <p>In anticipation of the new issne, the bears were actively at work early tin
                        the week in getting rid of Great Western stock and ft one time the prim was
                        forced down to 130 3/4. The issue was not cordially received.The old stock
                        however came in for support again, the prim going up to 131}. With the
                        exception of slight buying of the shares of two or three of the heavies, the
                        other sections of the home railway market have remained dull throughout. </p>

                    <p>The American railway market has opened well each day, but the afternoon
                        advices from Wall Street seem to have had a repeatedly damping effect. The
                        result of this irregularity has been the transaction of but a moderate
                        amount of business. Prices are in most oases slightly above last week's
                        levels. </p>
                    <p>Egyptians. </p>
                    <p>Prices in the Egyptian market have again been sagging away, with absolutely
                        no business doing. National Bank of Egypt have dropped back to 28, and

                        Daira Sugar are 4 1/4, and Union Foncière at 6 1/2 are quite un- changed.
                        Bank of Abyssinia have bean doll, and close 1/8 discount to 1/8 premium.
                        Egyptian Estates are also a weak market round about 1 5/8-3/4, with the
                        Deferred 10 11. Corporation of Western Egypt are steady at 13/16 premium.

                        1/8, and there is not a bargain passing in either. Egyptian Markets were in
                        request at one time, and close 1 1/4-3/8. Salt and Soda are a nominal market
                        at 1 1/8-1/4. Bank of Rumania are rather offered at 10 1/4. </p>

                    <p>Of the South African market there is no- thing new to be said. The gloom that
                        is over it seems to grow in intensity, and is general Rand Mines are no
                        better than 6 1/4 and East Rands 4 15/16. Goldfields are 1/8 lower on the
