                    <head>CABLES AT A PENNY A WORD.</head>
                    <p>Mr. Henniker Heaton pursue his crusade against the cable companies in the
                        "Arena." He sets forth in detail their extortionate charges, and denonnees
                        in vigorous language the monopoly of the cable kings. Individually. he says,
                        some of them are, no doubt, kindhearted, charitable men. Collectively,
                        however, "they are impervious to sentiment-philanthropic, patriotie or moral
                        considerations---</p>
                    <p>leech, a vampire, or a Bengal tiger" :-"The present state of affairs not only
                        constitutes &amp; barrier to commerce, but is also a rank injustice to the
                        poor, the fragal masses of our countrymen and country women, who stook our
                        distant polonies with their children to the number of a quarter of a million
                        per annum. At one time the cable rate of one word ranged from one Hays'
                        wages of a farm labourer. To-day matters are not much improved. If, for
                        instance, labourer in England wished to learn whether this son in South
                        Africa had perished in some terrible mining disaster, he and his family
                        pould only purchase the sad information by sacrificing his wages for a
                        fortnight or three</p>
                    <p>weeks."</p>
                    <p>So far as Amerios cables are concerned pommerce is practically throttled. Mr.
                        Heaton proposes that the British and American Gowernments should buy up the
                        cable companies at a fair valuation :-"It is feasible and poswible. In the
                        interests of the millions in both mountries it is an absoluto necessity. The
                        Darrying capacity of the cables to America amounts to three hundred million
                        words, and only twenty-five million words are sent at Is.</p>
                    <p>word. If the cables were owned as common State property the full carrying
                        capacity could</p>
                    <p>be used, and it would be possible to send messages and establish a tariff of
                        1d. per word. The result would be enormous development of Erade and an
                        immense increase in the happiness of the masses on both sides of the
                        Atlantic."</p>
                    <p>Pending this purchase of the cable companies t would, says Mr. Heaton, be
                        perfectly easy to stablish an alternative land service to com pete with
                        them. He would first of all establish</p>
                    <p>uniform rate of a penny &amp; word on all the and lines of Europe. This, he
                        contends would De perfectly possible, and, indeed, profitable to all
                        concerned. Short cables in the Persian Gulf, between Singapore, Java and
                        Australia, would monnect the land lines of Barope, Asis and Australia. It
                        would then be possible to levy</p>
                    <p>he following initial rates :-"To any part of Barope 1d. per word. To Egypt
                        and Canada</p>
                    <p>d. per word. To any part of Asia 6d. per word. To Australia 1s. per
                        word."</p>
                    <p>If France and England would arrange a opumention to exchange telegrams at one
                        penny a world its benefits to commerce would be so great as to induce other
                        Baropean Governments o join the "Telegraph Union." The cable cings, Mr.
                        Heaton points out, are at the preent moment imposing a crashing tax of two
                        millions sterling per annum on British foreign rade. If only the Powers were
                        to buy up the hares of the existing companies the cable tariff night easily
                        become one of the greatest blesrings to mankind everywhere, instead of being
                        un intolerable burden.</p>

                            Scribe's masterpiece was a fine example of acting. In the second act she
                            was specially good, but the death scene suggested somewhat unfavourable
                            comparisons with other great actresses, who have assumed this role. She

                        <head>Rain in Cairo.</head>
                        <p>Heavy rains fell in Cairo last night and continued until well after nine
                            o'clock thi morning, with the result that on either side of the streets
                            ran rivers of muddy water, while the pavements were of course for the
                            most part impossible to walk on, pedestrians being forced to mix with
                            the traffic of the streets in order to obtain a moderately secure
                            footing. But it is an ill rain which falls for no good, and one
                            enterprising cabby, realising this, drove his horses slap across the
                            pavement at one point to where a tub stood invitingly full of water, it
                            evidently having been left behind by the men who had recently been at
                            work on an adjacent building.</p>

                    <p>The Earl of Cromer's work on Egypt, which will be ready for publication in
                        the early spring, is the subject of interested conversation in the political
                        clubs in London. It is expected to be the most important political treatise
                        of next year, and will be published in two volumes. A prospectus outlining
                        the various features will shortly be issued. The work will contain a most
                        important statement on the present position of affairs in Egypt, and the
                        future prospects of the country, and now that Lord Cromer is no longer
                        restricted, by the ties of office, he may be expected to give his opinions
                        on the subject with greater freedom than be has been able to do hitherto.
                        From the literary standpoint the book will also be of value. Lord Cromer's
                        annual reports were always entertaining reading, and were written with an
                        ability not often seen in official documents.</p>

                        the ceremony taking place at half past three this afternoon. This church is

                    <head>SUDAN RAILWAYS,</head>
                    <p>PROGRESS AND DEVELOPMENT.</p>
                    <p>According to the general testimony of the commercial community of the Sudan
                        the railways are the most efficient administration. Even with the great
                        difficulties they have to encounter they pay four per cent on the capital
                        outlay. The freights are moderate considering the cost of running railways
                        in such a country, passengers are increasing and the number of natives who
                        make use of this means of locomotion grows larger ever year. They travel
                        fourth class at the low rate of one millieme per mile. The following details
                        of the latest progress made and of future developments should be of interest
                        :--</p>
                    <p>NILE-RED SEA LINE. </p>
                    <p>During this year the Nile Red Sea branch of the Sudan Government Railways had
                        a umpletely new outfit of rolling stock. This includes three trains with
                        dining and sleeping cars and first, second, and third class carriages hich
                        have been supplied by the Brush Company. A travelling post office is
                        attached to each mail train. The journey to Khartoum takes 22 hours. The
                        most difficult problem to contend with on this line is the washouts. One
                        section 130 kilometres in length, has been protected. This is between Khor
                        Mog to Summit, which is at the top of the pass over the mountains running
                        along the coast. Owing these defensive works washouts have been
                        satisfactorily withstood. </p>
                    <p>The railway workshops and offices, together th the condensers, will be moved
                        from Suakim to Port Sudan before next summer Two stations will remain at
                        Suakim. A new town station will be built and the goods station will be left
                        for native trade.</p>
                    <p>KHARTOUM. </p>
                    <p>The first consignment of material for the new railway bridge over the Blue
                        Nile at Khartoum arrived recently at Port Sudan by thee S.S. "Ras Issa." It
                        is to be built by the Cleveland Bridge and Engineering Company, who
                        constructed the Zambezi Bridge and other important works. The bridge, which
                        is also to have a road and footway across it, is to be built in two
                        years.</p>
                    <p>The terminus at Khartoum is to be removed to a site at the back of the
                        Palace. Helfieh will remain as a goods station.</p>
                    <p>EXTENSION CONTEMPLATED. </p>
                    <p>The extensions of the Sudan railway system are.</p>
                    <p>(1) By way of the Blue Nile and Wad Medani to Singa.</p>
                    <p>(2) The Kassala branch of the Nile-Red Sea line.</p>
                    <p>(3) The El Obeid branch.</p>
                    <p> All these projects are still in a very indefinite stage and it is as yet
                        undecided when they will be taken in hand. They have been generally
                        surveyed, but detailed surveys and estimates have not been made out for all
                        of them. The line to Singa would tap the Ghezireh. This line would form the
                        base of a triangle crossing the White Nile at Goz Abou Goma and thence to El
                        Obeid. The project of a line from Khartoum to El Obeid direct will probably
                        be abanoned in favour of this route, as between Khartoum and El Obeid only
                        desert would be crossed, whereas the route via Singa would traverse fertile
                        country.</p>
                    <p>THE ATBARA HEADQUARTERS.</p>
                    <p> The development at the headquarters of the Sudan Government Railways at
                        Atbara has during the present year been enormous. There now from five to six
                        hundred Europeans there,  all of whom are more or less connected with the
                        railways. Two years ago there was not even a scratch on the ground. Now it
                        is the Crewe of the Sudan. The station has an excellent bathing
                        establishment for passengers and a bar is to be erected shortly and the
                        services of a boy for the sale of newspapers are to be secured. The
                        construction of a new hospital for Europeans and natives has recently begun.
                        Another feature of this centre of the Sudanese railway system is the signal
                        box, which is fitted with forty two levers and would not disgrace any
                        railway station in England. All the railway stores are here and there are
                        iron and brass foundries, generating stations, ice machines, etc. The iron
                        foundry is a very complete installation and can turn out ten ton
                        castings.</p>
                    <p>KHARTOUM NORTH. </p>
                    <p>The railway line will be extended in Khartoum North as far as the river front
                        near the Bank Shoonahs, which will enable the merchants concerned to unload
                        their goods from the boats directly to the railway cars.</p>
                    <p>DAMAGE TO GOODS. </p>
                    <p>In case of any damage being done to goods shipped by railway, whether from
                        breakage or leakage of oils or other liquids shipped in the same car, the
                        Director of Railways will be glad to receive representations on the subject
                        from the parties concerned ; and if the railway is responsible for the
                        damage, proper compensation will be given.</p>
                    <p>PASSENGER RATE</p>
                    <p> It is impossible at present to consider the reduction of passenger rates on
                        the Railways. Any comparison of the rates charged by the Sudan Railways with
                        those of Egypt or Europe would be unfair, considering the greater expenses
                        incurred in the Sudan, for construction, ,materials, workmen, employees,
                        ete., and the small patronage that it has, for which there is no immediate
                        prospect of increase. The suggestions made that the line should be made more
                        solid and permanent so that it can stand against the floods, coincide with
                        the aims of the Railway authorities, the only thing acking is sufficient
                        funds.</p>

                    <p>The complaints made about delays and shortages of goods at the Custom House
                        Port Sudan. are, says the "Sudan Times," attributable mostly to the
                        incompetency of agents at Port Sudan. If the merchants took pains to choose
                        as their representatives there persons who have experience in Custom House
                        transactions, many of their complaints would be removed. It is not denied,
                        however, that the difficulty of landing goods from steamers into lighters
                        has much to do with the present disorder, but this will be removed as soon
                        as the new quays are completed, when freight will be unloaded directly from
                        steamers to cars.</p>

                        meeting of the British Association, but was prevented from being present on
                        account of his illness. Dr. Pirrie brought back a valuable collection of
                        objects of anthropological and other scientific interest, and at intervals
                        during his illness he was engaged on his report to the Carnegie Institute
                        and the Wellcome Research Laboratories, Khartoum, for which institutions he
                        acted jointly in the work he carried out in the Sudan.</p>

                    <p>(De notre reporter spécial)</p>
                    <p>La Commission Municipale s'est réunie hier à 4h.p.m., souns la présidence de
                        Schiess Pacha. Etaient présents MM. Kingham, Foster, Stross, Fenderl, Padoa

                    <p>VALIDITE DE LA DERNIERE SÉANCE.</p>
                    <p>Yehia Pacha a profité de la commonication des procès-verbaux de la Commission
                        du 3 avril au 14 aoút pour contester la validité de la dernière séance
                        municipale. A cette date il y avait 15 membres absents, c'est-à-dire la
                        majorité; 7 ont assisté à la séance et 6 se sont fait excuser. Il semble à
                        Yehia Pacha que la clause d'après laquelle une seconde séance est valable,
                        quel que soit le nombre des membres présents, implique évidemment que le
                        quorum doit être possible à la première convocation, sinon celle-ci serait
                        illégale. Or, comme on vient de le voir, le quorum était impossible an 14
                        aout dès la première séance. Dans ces conditions, le leader indigène estime
                        qu'il faut renvoyer la question an Comité du Contentieux pour rapport. Padoa
                        Bey, bien qu'il ne puisse formuler ex abrupto une opinion définitive, croit
                        que le noeud de la question repose sur l'urgence des décisions à prendre :
                        si les delibérations ne présentent aucun caractère d'urgence, il faudrait
                        attendre un quorum; mais, dans le cas contraire, quoi qu'on puisse alléguer
                        en droit, en fait il n'y a pas lieu de critiquer la convocation.</p>
                    <p>Dans quelques semaines le comité du Contentieux se prononcers sur ce point
                        délicat.</p>
                    <p>AVANT ET APRES LA CRISE </p>
                    <p>La communication des procès-verbaux de la Délégation du 22 Aoút au 12
                        Novembre a ègalement donné lieu à une discussion fort intèressante. Il
                        s'agit de savoir si la Municipalité doit s'en tenir vis-à-vis des
                        propriétaires à emprendre et à exproprier aux pourparlers en cours avant la
                        crise, au moment oh la hausse des terrains avait atteint son apogée. Une
                        discussion s'engage à ce sujet entre MM. Stross et A. de Menasce: M. Stross
                        soutient qu'en l'espèce, au Midan, les terrains du centre n'ont as baissé et
                        qu'il faut conserver les bases des cords en suspens. M. de Menasce sans se
                        rononcer ouvertement en sens contraire, de mande que la Commission fixe au
                        Comité "évaluation dont il fait partie une ligne de ondaite pour l'avenir.
                        Me Padoa Bey, se basant sur l'égalité qui doit exister entre deux
                        contractants, la Municipalité et les propriétaires, suppose, et il n'a pas
                        tort, que dans le casoú les propriétaires auront avantage à refuser
                        l'accordils n'y manqueront pas, si la Municipalité n'a pas d'écrit formel à
                        leur opposer; la Municipalité qui est l'autre partie contractante doit avoir
                        de son côté les mêmes droits. Me Padoa Bey conelut donc que sans convention
                        formelle ntre les deux parties, la Municipalité n'est nullement engagée
                        Là-dessus on passe à ordre du jour. </p>
                    <p>Nous ne pouvons clore ce chapitre sans nous étonner de l'attitude de M.
                        Stross, qui, d'un côté penche pour la confirmation de pourparlers
                        désavantageux pour la Municipalité, et de l'autre a fait à ses collègues une
                        longue tirade sur les crédits innombrables qu'on vote les yeux fermés.</p>

                    <p>Bien que tous ces crédits aient été votés à l'unanimité et sans opposition
                        sérieuse, quelques-uns cependant ont donné lieu à de précieuses observations
                        que nous allons reprodaipe.</p>
                    <p>QUAIS ET BRISE-LAMES </p>
                    <p>M. Rieti tient d'un ingénieur dont la compétence ne peut être mise en doute
                        que les réparations des quais déjà faites ou en voie d'exécution sont mal
                        comprises et ne présentent aucune utilité. Il estime que le seul moyen de
                        prévenir de nouveaux dégâts consiste dans la construction de brise-lames.
                        Schiess Pacha répond que les d tériorations étaient prévues et que chaque
                        ahuée de nouveaux replâtrages seront nécessaires. Il faudra peutêtre 1000
                        livres et plus pour l'année prochaine. En attendant le crédit de 760 livres
                        est voté.</p>
                    <p>ENCORE 2000 L.E. POUR LE NOUZHA</p>
                    <p> Ceci attire une critique de M. Stross qui insiste pour avoir une liste de
                        tous les er dits pour toute l'année. M. Stross se désiste d'ail. leurs dès
                        qu'on lui fait savoir qu'il s'agit de l'acquisition d'une machine pour
                        l'irrigation du jardin. Me Padoa termine agréablement la discussion en
                        conseillant à ses collègues d'aller admirer le Nouzha. Comme dit la
                        chanson,</p>
                    <p>"Il faut le voir</p>
                    <p>pour le croire. ... </p>
                    <p>EN FAVEUR DES PROPRIETAIRES</p>
                    <p> Tous les propriétaires de la Rue Rosette sont évidemment intéressés à ce
                        qu'on remplace le pavage disgracieux de leur rue par l'asphaltage. Dans ce
                        but les riverains de la Rue Chérif ont consenti à payer la moitié des frais
                        et ceux de la Rue Rosette ne refuseraient certainement pas d'en faire
                        autant. Mais nos conseillers qui ont une conception fort original des
                        intérêts de la ville s'y sont opposés. C'est la ville qui supporters tous
                        les frais et nos édiles ne se sont pas contentés de voter le crédit proposé,
                        ils ont de plus décidé que pendant qu'on y était il fallait procéder avec
                        magnificence et aller jusqu'au bout. Cette dernière proposition est de M.
                        Fenderl. On prendra le solde, environ 8000 livres, sur la réserve !</p>
                    <p>CONTRE LES LOCATAIRES </p>
                    <p>La question relative aux maisons à bon marché a eu le sort qu'en attendaient
                        les gena bien informés. Elle a été renvoyée aux calendes grecques. M.
                        Fenderl regrette qu'en raison de la crise actuelle la société n'ait pu se
                        former faute de capitaux ; il faut done prier le gouvernement de renvoyer
                        l'affaire à une date ultérieure Eo prenant soin, ajoute M. Rieti, de
                        répondre au Ministère de manière à ce qu'il ne retire pas ce qu'il a déjà
                        noordé. Qu'on attende 3 og 6 mois pour laisser à la société le temps de
                        trouver les 95000-£ dont elle a besoin, si elle les trouve jamais. On se
                        rallie à la proposition de Pados Bey de faire une réponse vague...
                        attendre......en vue d'élaboration définitive...</p>
                    <p>QUESTIONS DIVERSES</p>
                    <p> L'amende due par divers fornisseurs pour retard dans la fourniture de
                        pierres est levée par la Commission. En ce qui concerne la con struction de
                        nouveaix ponts sur le Canal Mahmoudieh, l'engagement de dépenses supplé.
                        mentaires dans ce but est approuvée. L'élargis. sement d'une partie de la
                        route d'Aboukir et la voie d'accès au Nouzha sont renvoyés aux services pour
                        rapport. La question relative aux baux à long terme, dont Me Padoa Bey,
                        s'est occupé à Paris, fera l'objet d'un rapport dans un mois environ. Les
                        décisions suivantes sont accept/es sans aucune discussion: Excédents et
                        emprises. Etat inclus au procès-verbal de la Del.du 29 août Expropriation

                    <p>Le Caire, Mercredi 20 Novembre.</p>
                    <p>Le taux de l'escompte libre à Londres est renseigné invarié à 6 7/8 pour
                        cent.</p>
                    <p>Au Stock Exchange, le Consolidé anglais a baissé hier de 1/4 á 82 1/8.
                        L'Unifiée est restée inchangée à 99. La National Bank a avance de 1/8 à 20
                        et la Daira de 1/4 à 12 1/2. La Delta Light et l'Agricole ont été soutentes
                        à 97/8 et 7 7/8 respectivement.</p>
                    <p>A Paris, le Crédit Foncier Egyptien a gagné 2 franes à 679. La Banque
                        d'Athènes est rer</p>
                    <p>tée sans changement à 108 et les Lots Tures 1 à 163.</p>
                    <p>Ici, les dépêches nous ayant précisé l'amélioration des centres financiers
                        européens et <cb n="2"/> américains signalée hier déjà, notre marché en a
                        reçu une favorable impulsion. Si nous n'a vons anjourd'hui pas de hausse à
                        enregistrer, c'est du moins la fermeté et même la reprise pour quelques
                        valeurs d'avant-garde, de tous temps favorisées par les spéculateurs
                        égyptiens.</p>
                    <p>Les transactions sont bien restées un peu languissantes, mais il faut savoir
                        se contenter de peu, tout en souhaitant que l'Europe nous cable encore
                        quelques bonnes nouvelles, de nature à abaisser un peu le ton pessimiste de
                        certains.</p>
                    <p>Dans le compartiment des Banques, la National Bank se relève à 20 et
                        l'Agricole à 7 7/8. La Banque d'Abyssinie en renouveau inat tendu gagne 3/16
                        à 4 8/16. La Cassa di Sconto revient à 44, tandis que le Comptoir Financier
                        poursuit son amélioration à 2 7/16-1/2.</p>
                    <p>La Delta Light mollit à 9 5/8-11/16. Les Jouissances Eaux du Caire accentuent
                        leur dépréciation à 157. Le Crédit Foncier Egyptien, sous l'influence de
                        Paris, remonte à 678; son obligation ancienne recule à 286-287. La Daira
                        Sanieh est en meilleure tendance à 12 1/2, ainsi qùe l'Allotment à 1 15/16-2
                        L'AmericanNile s'affaisse à 2 2 1 16. Les Omnibus-Automobiles se consolident
                        à 2 1/4 et la Brasserie d'Alexandrie rétrograde à 130.</p>
                    <p>Le groupe des Hotels est sans affaires, sauf les Baehler en reprise à 4
                        13/16.</p>
                    <p>Parmi les petites valeurs, beaucoup de fermeté. La New Egyptian se ressaisit
                        &amp; 9/3-9/6 de même que l'Ordinary Khedivial Mail à 20/6. Les fondateurs
                        Estates s'alourdissent encore à 2 3/4, les Markets a 25/- et la Salt and
                        Soda à 14/9.</p>
                    <p>La crise américaine et l'Europe.</p>
                    <p>On évalue à 750 millions de francs (120 mil lions de dollars) les quantités
                        de monnaie de toute sorte, qui ont disparu pour être thésaurisées. Lear
                        retour dans la circulation détendrait la situation. Si une panique prive les
                        banques de ressources liquides, sous forme d'instruments de payements,
                        autres que les chèques, on voit toutes les difficultés à surmoriter. Il faut
                        rétablir la confiance, mais comment ! Les exportations d'or d'Europe ont été
                        considérables ; elles ont provoqué un relèvement universel de l'escompte à
                        des taux qui imposent des sacrifices extraordinairement lourds au commerce
                        et à l'industrie, sauf en - France ou l'on a pu rester à 4%.</p>
                    <p>L'industrie américaine n'est pas seulement embarrassée pour trouver de la
                        monnaie les jours de payements des salaires ; elle a de la peine à
                        renouveler ses effets à l'échéance ; de toute part, on réduit les crédits.
                        Les établissements financièrement faibles sont obligés de demander le
                        concours de syndics, malgré leur solvabilité. Le chômage est da à des causes
                        financières, alors même que l'on a des commandes.</p>
                    <p>Tout dépend, pour l'Europe, de la tournure que prendront les affaires aux
                        Etats-Unis, o l'on examine toujours les mesures propres à dénouer la crise,
                        y compris une émission de billets ayant cours forcé.</p>
                    <p>Les taux surélevés d'escompte constituent une charge très lourde en Europe ;
                        ils amènent une restriction des crédits et, par suite, un ra lentissement de
                        l'activité économique tout en tière ; dans ces conditions, il est à
                        souhaiter que l'on conserve tout son sang-froid et que l'on s'abstienne, en
                        Allemagne et en Angleterre, de restrictions de crédit précipitées qui ne
                        peuvent que rendre les difficultés plus aignes.</p>

                    <p>At very little expense Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People has greatly
                        improved the health of Marie Penin, whose portrait appears herewith. Marie
                        Penin is a domestic. As she states in the letter now under notice, she was
                        so weakened by anaemia that her work became very tedious, and sometimes
                        impossible.</p>
                    <p>"Although at my mistress's house," she writes, "the work was not above the
                        ordinary capacity of a woman, I was obliged to take frequent intervals of
                        rest. I had continual headaches, and when I bent down or made any other
                        effort, the pains became intolerable. It was in vain that I attempted to do
                        my work. I was always cold, my hands feet being like ice ; and it seemed to
                        me that there was no blood in my viens. I could not sleep well at night, and
                        in the morning rose as tired as I had been on the previous evening. I had a
                        very poor complexion, while I also lacked an appetite. I watched with
                        chagrin the arrival of the time when I should be compelled to give up my
                        employment, forall the treatments I had resorted to were inefficacious
                        Someone who had been anaemie and had found a remedy in Dr. Williams Pink
                        Pills for Pale People then advised me to take them, and, convinced that they
                        could only do me good, she brought me a box. I at once applied myself to the
                        treatment, and at the end of the week I felt so much better that I could
                        foresee an early cure. I felt much stronger, and all my ailments became less
                        acute. I am now quite well, and have recovered my former good health, and I
                        work merrily and without fatigue."</p>
                    <p>All workers who find their tasks above their strength should bear in mind
                        that Dr. Williams' Pink Pills are source of energy, a regeneration of the
                        blood and a nerve tonie of the very first order, Dr. Williams' Pink Pills
                        for Pale People give blood and enrich it with every dose, and in big cities
                        the blood of the worker is apt to become impoverished.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Williams' Pink Pills, thanks to the powerful action on the blood and the
                        nervous system, are always taken with success in cases of anaemia,
                        chlorosis, neurasthenia, general weakness, stomach troubles, sick headaches,
                        neauralgia, sciatica, and rheumatism.</p>
                    <p>Sold by all chemists and druggists at P.T. 18 the box and P.T. 70 for six
                        boxes."</p>

                    <p>The Money Markot.</p>
                    <p>Thanks to the assistance rendered by the Bank of France, the Bank of England
                        statewent yesterday showed a comparatively strong</p>
                    <p>osition, the reserve being higher by about three and-ahalf millions on the
                        week at 21,118,000. Unfortunately, however, there is ttle prospect of
                        retaining anything like that gare. As a matter of fact, about £700,000 was
                        rithdrawn for America yesterday, and it is enerally believed that nearly two
                        millions will be taken out for shipment to the same uarter to-morrow. The
                        outlook is not very mcouraging. It was thought that a seven per ent. Bank
                        rate would have checked gold withrawals, but so far this rate has proved
                        inefmetive as regards Amerion, and although the lank directors decided to
                        make no alteration</p>
                    <p>the minimum yesterday, it is feared they will be compelled to resort to
                        higher figure vefore long. It is well known that America bas een negotiating
                        with the Bank of France with he view of obtaining direct shipments of
                        gold</p>
                    <p>New York, but so far the efforts in this irection do not appear to have met
                        with much access. The Bank of France prefers to lend old against bills on
                        London, for, however good he guarantees may have been the tact remains hat
                        there is no State Bank in the United</p>
                    <p>tates, and it is consequently very different to ading money to institutions
                        like the Bank</p>
                    <p>England. The fact that the Egyptian gold demands To later this year, owing to
                        the cotton crop not being so forward as usual, is a fortuitous ircumstance,
                        and it is confidently hoped that y the time further shipments to
                        Alexandria</p>
                    <p>come necessary the situation in the States Fill be more normal, and that our
                        Bank rate</p>
                    <p>ill have proved effective in attracting gold in arge quantities to our
                        shores.</p>
                    <p>The one satisfactory feature in America is he return of confidence on the
                        part of depo</p>
                    <p>tors evidenced by their willingness to free heir boarded funds. Wall Street
                        during the ast few days has been bidding for money at empting rates, against
                        which the hoarders ave not been proof, and as things become more settled,
                        more and more gold should in this way return into circulation.</p>

                    <p>The silver market bas developed further reakness, and business between this
                        market nd the Indian Bazaars is practically at a tandstill. Yesterday the
                        quotation for immediate delivery was down to 26, H per ounce The Stook

                    <p>The money position naturally continues to ominate the Stock Exchange to the
                        ex. lusion of all other influences, and markets ave fluctuated according to
                        the tendeney of the various reports which have been circulated. n Tuesday it
                        seemed as if a revival had set , active business being recorded in most
                        actions. The advance was only short-lived, however, and profit-taking the
                        following more mg sent prices down again.</p>
                    <p>The Bank rate decision was awaited with ome anxiety, and tended to restrict
                        operations intil noon yesterday, but the announcement that no change had
                        been made gave a more otive appearance all-round.</p>
                    <p>This morning the tone was depressed owing o the report that a large amount of
                        gold will be withdrawn from the Bank tomorrow. It is obvious that until the
                        money stringeney is relieved, investment business must continue at a low
                        ebb, but it is nevertheless very satisfactory to notice that in spite of the
                        depressing conditions prevailing, the markets retain a good undertone, and
                        that there is a air amount of investment buying, particularly of the shares
                        of the leading home railways.</p>
                    <p>The settlement is causing some little aneasiness. Two or three firms are said
                        to be in difficulties, but it is hoped that in most cases they will come on
                        all right. Console.</p>
                    <p>The market for gilt-edged securities is Hepressed owing to the dearness of
                        money, and Donsols were last night quoted down to 82, to for cash and 82 A

                    <p>In the early part of the week the firmness of Russian bonds was a feature,
                        and on Tuesday the Pours advanced it and the last issue 1. Yesterday there

                    <p>The market for home railway shares has reeived a good deal of attention. Now
                        that the fears of a strike have been removed, shrewd dealers are beginning
                        to realise that at their present low values these shares are excellent
                        look-up investments, and consequently steady <cb n="5"/> buying has been
                        proceeding throughout the week. The curry over on Tgesday veleda very
                        clisfactory state of affairs, and as a result the market developed quite a
                        buoyant tone. North Western advanced 3, Great Central Preference and North
                        Staff. Ordinary 2, and Great Eastern and Caledonian Pref. 13. Yesterday the
                        shares were again very active after the announcement of the Bank rate
                        decision, and further gains of a full point were marked, Great Eastern being
                        14 higher and Great Central Pref. and South Western Ord.</p>
                    <p>To-day home railways have been sold, and the heavies especially have been

                    <p>There was some further liquidation of Americans in the early part of the

                        been restricted.</p>
                    <p>The report that Mr. J. P. Morgan had failed ito induce the Bank of France to
                        export gold direct to America caused some weakness yes terday, the Morgan
