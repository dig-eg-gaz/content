                    <p>Made in 70 Colors</p>
                    <p>An artistic wall covering.</p>
                    <p>This celebrated water paint is made in two qualities for Inside and Outside
                        work</p>
                    <p>HALL’S SANITARY WASHABLE DISTEMPER is rapidly superseding wall papers in all
                        tastefully furnished homes. It is made in 70 artistic tints, and only
                        requires the addition of water to make it ready for use. It is quickly and
                        easily applied with a whitewash brush, with half the labour and at one third
                        the cost of paint. HALL’S DISTEMPER ensures cleanliness, and is pleasing to
                        the eye. It appeals alike to artistic and practical house decoration. HALL’S
                        DISTEMPER is of special value in hot climates. Owing to its cool, pleasing
                        colours, great weather-resisting and germ-destroying properties, it lends
                        itself to every kind of wall, wood, brick or stone coating, possessing all
                        the advantages of paint, colour- wash, and disinfectant at one third the
                        cost of oil paint. It never blisters in the hottest sun, and the fact that
                        it can be washed adds greatly to its sanitary advantages.</p>

                            <p>The Tsar’s manifesto declares that the prevalent troubles have filled
                                his heart with great sorrow. These troubles may become a menace to
                                the integrity of the Empire, and it is therefore his duty to efface
                                himself, and to hasten their cessation. For this reason he
                                recognises that the co-ordination of the powers of government is
                                indispensable. Finally he directs the government to fulfil his will
                                as follows : (a) To grant real inviolability of person and freedom
                                of conscience, speech, union, and association. (b) Without deferring
                                the elections for the National Assembly, to enable, as far as is
                                possible on account of the shortness of the time, the classes at
                                present deprived of electoral rights to participate in the
                                elections, leaving the ultimate settlement of the franchise to the
                                new legislative regime. (c) To establish as an unchangeable rule
                                that no law shall come into force without the approval of the
                                National Assembly, which is also to exercise real supervision of the
                                legality of the acts of the authorities. A general strike begins in
                                    <placeName>Finland</placeName> to-day, which will include the
                                railways which have hitherto been unaffected. (Reuter )</p>

                            <p>The manifesto of the Tsar has been placarded throughout the City, and
                                telegraphed to wherever the lines are working. It is believed here
                                that the effect will be instantaneous. It created great popular
                                rejoicing yesterday evening. The crowds in the streets cheered for
                                liberty and the Tsar, singing the National Anthem instead of the
                                ‘'Marseillaise," as lately. The people surrounded the bewildered
                                    <placeName>Cossacks</placeName>, patting the horses and telling
                                the men to go home as they were no more needed, since they had
                                received their liberties. The strike is at an end on the
                                    <placeName>Moscow</placeName> and St. Petersburg, Moscow-Kazan,
                                and Moscow-Archangel railways. The jubilation caused by the first
                                announcement that the Tsar had granted a constitution was succeeded
                                to-day by demonstration in honor of the victory of the proletariat.
                                A huge procession waving red flags and singing revolutionary songs
                                paraded Nevsky Prospect. Hymns for the dead were sang at various
                                points in memory of the victims of the 22nd January. The
                                processionists halted at the University, where workers and students
                                joined in making speeches declaring that the manifesto showed the
                                powerlessness of the autocracy. The victory of the people has, been
                                enthusiastically celebrated in the provincial centres by processions
                                and thanksgiving services. The Governor of Odessa appeared amidst
                                the crowd in front of the palace, and congratulated them on their
                                victory. The crowd demanded the release of political prisoners and
                                the removal of the Cossacks. The Governor promised to comply.

                            accompany well. He adapts himself to the mood of the singer, to whom he

                        farms on the Island, as well as large plantations. The forests are being
                        exploited by a German-Jewish company. This German company wants to exploit
                        all the mines on the Island, and their application is under consideration.
                        The report that the Germans have been allowed to have a coal depot on the
                        Island and to use it as a naval station is inexact. The Germans have not got
                        so far, but the Sultan is getting more under the thumb of Germany every day,
                        and the influence of the Germans is increasing in Constantinople enormously
                        owing to the ellipse of prestige. The Sultan will soon be a mere tool in the
                        hands of the Kaiser, whose clever policy in <placeName>Turkey</placeName>
                        has done so much for the development of German trade and influence. </p>

                    <p>The Khedive is considering a scheme for parcelling out his tefeiche at
                            <placeName>Koubbeh</placeName> with a view to disposing of it for

                    <p>The Khedivial yacht Mahroussa is now in the Govan dry-dock, where
                            <persName>Messrs. Inglis</persName> are altering the stern for the
                        turbine propellers. The turbine machinery and boilers are on board, the
                        funnel is set up, and the mainmast in position. Workmen are busy laying the
                        shade deck and erecting the other deck structures. When our representative
                        paid a visit to the vessel recently in Messrs. Inglis's yard, he found from
                        500 to 600 men busily employed on the yacht, with <persName>Mustapha Pasha
                            Ibady</persName> and <persName>Mr. Taylor</persName>, the chief
                        engineer, engaged in superintending the details of the work. The vessel,
                        although not by any means nearly finished, had been completely changed, and
                        was quite unrecognisable. There was, of course, no trace of the old paddles,
                        and the old wooden bow had been replaced by a steel one. The new machinery
                        takes up half the room previously unoccupied, and the space thus economised
                        is being utilised for the erection of rooms for the Khedive’s suite. New
                        deck houses are being erected, including a spacious dining saloon, captain’s
                        room, and smoking room, while on the new boat deck there will be a room for
                        his Highness and the chart room. It is expected that the Mahroussa will not
                        leave the shipbuilders’ hands until the month of April or May next, as a
                        good deal remains to be done in the way of fittings, etc. When put to sea
                        again she will be capable of a speed of 17 knots.</p>

                    <p>The current number of the “Spectator" concludes an interesting article on the
                        criminal rat with the following remarks on the Alexandrian variety:— It is
                        one of the curiosities of animal temperament that while the brown rat is so
                        universally detested, the closely related Alexandrian rat—the white or
                        piebald varieties are well known in this country—is almost a favourite. It
                        is a very quiet, docile little animal, almost affectionate in its relations
                        with man, and constantly kept as a pet by children. It is clean and very
                        gentle, never by any chance offering to bite, and is as intent on storing up
                        food, as if it had never forgotten the experience of its ancestors in the
                        "lean years” when <persName>Joseph</persName> ruled under
                            <persName>Pharaoh</persName>. It is the humblest of all domestic pets
                        but often quite interesting in its ways, the only drawback to its company
                        being the close resemblance in appearance to the criminal brown rat.</p>

                        <head>EGYPT IN PARLIAMENT. NATIVE PRESS OPINION.</head>
                        <p>“Al Moayad" recently published an article of which the following is a
                            summary. “In his speech of last June Lord Cromer stated that Egyptian
                            questions should always be kept distinct from the varying policies of
                            the British political parties. Yet we have seen in the parliamentary
                            reports of last August some comments on Lord Cromer's statement.
                                <persName>Mr. H. Weston</persName>, M.P., asked the Under Secretary
                            of State for Foreign Affairs, on the 8th August last, whether the
                            administration of Egypt by Lord Cromer would be taken under the control
                            and responsibility of the British Minister for Foreign Affairs, to which
                                <persName>Lord Percy</persName> replied that the administration of
                            Egypt was entrusted to the Khedive and his Ministers, acting with the
                            guidance and aid of Lord Cromer as the responsible Diplomatic Agent of
                            H. M.’s Government In reply to another question Lord Percy said that the
                            Egyptian Government most pay attention to Lord Cromer’s advice. "The
                            placing Egypt under the direct supervision of the British Parliament
                            will have, as far as we see, to be freshly considered. As for ourselves,
                            we should like our Government to be under parliamentary
                            superintendence,provided, the latter is efficacious and unchangeable.
                            The officials of the Occupation in that case would become very careful
                            in their acts, and be obliged to give an account of them to their
                            superiors. But it will be necessary for Parliament to obtain reports
                            about Egypt from an Egyptian source, because the British reports will
                            contain nothing against the Occupation, as is the case with Lord
                            Cromer’s annual report. "The Egyptians most understand their real
                            position after 28 years of occupation, and after the occupying Power has
                            come into close partnership with Egypt in possessing the
                                <placeName>Sudan</placeName>, where <placeName>England</placeName>
                            cares very little for her partner, and also after the Anglo-French
                            Agreement Let us put aside the useless words “ocoupation" and
                            “withdrawal" as all efforts in this direction of imagination and fancy
                            will be in vain. Let us look at our present state and do our best to
                            keep something of our station and strive for our possible advantage. We
                            had better deal with the British authorities in our social questions and
                            come with them to a useful understanding. If one requirements in some
                            way could not be answered, we should do our best to bring the unsolved
                            matters before Parliament. Now is the proper time for the communication.
                            A member of Parliament itself opens a door for us to enter, and we must
                            seize the opportunity in seeking a Parliamentary supervision over Egypt.
                            Let us turn the demand into notion in good time, while we have such a
                            straightforward representative as Lord Cromer, who possesses the
                            necessary requirements and acts even if it is against himself. We had
                            better do this before some other people put difficulties in our way."
                            This article having given rise to some misunderstanding,
                                <persName>Sheikh Aly Youssef</persName>, proprietor of “Al Moayad,"
                            has informed “Al Mokattam" that it was not meant that Egypt should have
                            any official relation with the British Parliament “Al Moayad" only
                            wishes the Egyptians (says “Al Mokattam") to put before some M.P., who
                            is or might be known to them, all the questions which they wish to come

                                        Barn's</persName> from a difficult angle. More goals were
                                    scored, and at half-time the soon stood at 3-0 in Boulac's
                                    favor. On the resumption of play the A. S. Corps started with
                                    great-dash and determination, and their forwards’ efforts were
                                    crowned with a goal, neatly shot by
                                        <persName>Williams</persName>. Gradually the home forwards
                                    began to regain their, for a short while, lost combination,
                                    which enabled them to register an additional 3 goals before the
                                    game concluded, and thus left Boulac victorious by 6-1 goals.
