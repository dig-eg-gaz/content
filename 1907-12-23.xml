                <p>Trains run alongside the steamers on the quay, and passengers can be conveyed to
                    Famagusta, Nicosia, Morphou and intermediate stations. Good hotel accommodation
                    for tourists is provided at Famagusta, at the Savoy Hotel (Mr. Najem Houry
                    proprietor). Olympus Hotel, Mount Troodos, 6000 ft. above the sea. Magnificent
                    Scenery. Perfect climate. Season May to end of October. For information apply to
                    Mr. Najem Houry, Managing Director of Cyprus Hotel Co., Army Contractor,
                    Limassol, Cyprus. There is a good carriage road from Kopia (on Railway) to
                    Troodos. At Famagusta may be seen the fine old Latin Cathedral (now a mosque)
                    begun in 1300 and finished in 1312, together with other ancient ruins and the
                    Venetian fortifications, the finest in the world. Also the tower or palace, the
                    scene of “Othello'' and of Ford's “Lover's Melancholy.'' The climate of Cyprus
                    in the winter months is delightful and the Island will well repay a visit.</p>

                        <p>Some inconvenience has of late been caused to the residents in the new
                            Ghezireh Government houses (known colloquially in Cairo as the
                            ‘‘Almshouses’) owing to the stoppage of a drain. A native, who was among
                            the workmen charged with the task of discovering the reason for the
                            blocking of the drain, on cleaning it out discovered that a purse had
                            penetrated into the orifice and had effectually stopped the passage of
                            the drainage. As there is no name on the purse and it contains nothing
                            inside sufficient to identify its original owner it is still awaiting a

                    <p>The final ceremonies connected with the departure of the holy Kiswet were
                        observed with all due pomp on Satorday morning, a vast number of spectators
                        witnessing the imposing spectacle. The best view was obtained from the
                        stand, erected on the further side of the parade ground and exactly opposite
                        the Mastaba, to which access was reserved for those who travelled to the
                        Citadel by the trains of the Egyptian Light Railway, From thence all the
                        preliminaries and actual ceremonies were seen with full effect against the
                        impressive background of the Citadel, with its high walls and rampants
                        outlined by fringes of native onlodkers, and its domed mosque and slender
                        minarets breaking the blue skyline beyond. Long regular Jines of stalwart
                        soldiers bordered the parade ground, while one's eyes were constantly
                        attracted to the Mastaba opposite which was constantly receiving fresh
                        additions to its group of gorgeously attired officials, many of whose gold
                        laced uniforms were crossed with resplendent orders. The entourage of H.H.
                        the Khedive was seen approaching Lancers gay with fluttering pennons of
                        green and scarlet dashed up the sanded roadway below the Citadel, followed
                        by the high swinging carriage with its four horses and scarlet liveried
                        attendants, wherein sat in state H.H. Abbas Helmi II escorted by his chief
                        officials. Soldiers came to attention, spectators rose to their feet, as the
                        massed band struck up the Khedivial march, and the salute rent the air, as
                        Egypt's ruler left his carriage and took his place on the canopied seat in
                        the Mastaba. Then the Mahmal, between two lines of police, and followed by
                        native musicians mounted on their camels moved into position and slowly
                        circled round and round, the glittering top heavy erection swaggering and
                        courtseying at every movement of the slowly pacing camel. Finally it was led
                        up to the steps of the Mastaba where it received the formal benediction of
                        the Khedive before proceeding on its way, still followed by the musicians
                        playing plaintive melodies on their uncouth instruments. More salutes
                        followed its departure the shouts of the menand the shrill cries of the
                        women being heard in the interludes. Then came the march past of the troops
                        of the Egyptian Army, Lancers, Infantry, Mule Batteries and Artillery
                        passing in quick succession to the inspiriting strains of the band, which
                        followed down the road behind them. A few moments after and the Khedive took
                        his place in the carriage and drove across the ground attended by his
                        escort, followed by the Princes and high officials, the closed carriages of
                        the ladies of high rank, the European notables and finally by the long line
                        of heterogeneous vehicles which had been cooped up in the various

                    <dateline>EXTRAORDINARY GENERAL MEETING</dateline>
                    <p>The extraordinary General Meeting of the Egyptian Constructions Limited,
                        which was held at the Continental Hotel on Saturday afternoon, terminated to
                        the complete satisfaction of the Directors, the proposed resolutions being
                        carried without serious dissent. The Chairman in his introductory remarks
                        pointed out that the position of the company demanded immediate attention in
                        view of the present serious financial situation, the want of cash being
                        acutely felt, and forcing the company to refuse much good work on account of
                        lack of funds. The only thing required, in the opinion of the directors, to
                        ensure the success of the company, was the raising of additional working
                        capital, and it was with a view to obtaining, this that the following
                        resolutions would be put to the meeting 1. That the capital of the company
                        consist Ing of £200,000 divided into 200,000 shares of £1 each be reduced to
                        £132,750 divided into 265,500 shares of 10 - each AS follows. (a) By
                        cancelling 12,500 shares numbered 5001-7500 and 100001-110000 each fully
                        paid. (b) By reducing each of the 109,500 shares numbered 1-5000,
                        7501-100000 and 110001- 122000 each fully paid from £1 to 10/. 2. That each
                        of the 78,000 shares of £1 each remaining unissued shall be divided into two
                        shares of 10 each. Should the above resolutions be duly passed by the
                        requisite majority the same will be duly submitted for confirmation as
                        special resolutions at a subsequent general meeting of the company which
                        will be held at the same time and place on Wednesday the 8th day of January
                        1908, when a resolution authorizing the directors to sell or otherwise
                        dispose of certain portions of the businesses acquired by the company will
                        also as submitted. With regard to these proposed sales, we were unable to
                        obtain a copy of the statement read to the meeting in time for press to-day,
                        but this will appear in a future issue, but the main features of the
                        proposals are that the company intends to resell to their former owners the
                        businesses purchased respectively from Grant, Bondi and Chinn, Mark T. Boyes
                        and the McClure branch of the business of McClure and Dorling The sale of
                        the former to carry with it an opinion whereby the company would be enabled
                        to repurchase the business within a period of 2 years, on the same terms as
                        those of the original purchase, Mr. Bondi to remain managing director of the
                        company It is proposed to resell the business purchased from Mark T. Boyes
                        for the sum of £4,000, the Company to retain land subject to mortage of the
                        on sale being £8,300. The McClure branch, for which the company paid
                        £18,000, to be sold back to McClure and Dorling for 2,500 shares ; Mr.
                        Dorling relinquishes all rights of directorship, and takes over stock, on
                        the company lost considersably Bad and doubtful debts, estimated at 10
                        written off out-standing debta are approximately £7,045, the heaviest
                        liability of the Company being the Bank overdraft of £20,000 At the
                        conclusion of the statements of the Chairman, M. Wenger requested that some
                        explanation should be given as to the loss on the San Stefano estate, the
                        answer given being that a loss had occurred Sir Horace Pinching remarked
                        that he should like to know the reasons of the general losses sustained. The
                        company were now proposing to reduce their capital and dispose of a large
                        portion of their business and if this continued, as far as he could see it
                        seemed that at the end of 1908, the company would be in much the same
                        position, and would probably wish to dispose of what was left. The Chairman
                        in reply said that the reasons for the proposed reductionus Was that the
                        company was badly in need of capital. The shares cannot be sold at the
                        present rate, and the new issue would make the disposal of shares much
                        easier. Sir Horace Pinching then touched upon the question of dividend of 7
                        which was declared, and which the shareholders had not yet received. The
                        chairman replied that want of funds had prevented the payment of this
                        dividend hitherto, but that it would be paid out of the sums which it was
                        now proposed to raise. He admitted that the company had made a mistake in
                        purchasing first and trusting to raising capital later, a course which the
                        state of financial depression had prevented from realization, to which Sir
                        Horace replied that the company had been started long before the adverse
                        financial position had prevented the raising of any money which was
                        required. After various other questions by M. Biddulph and others had been
                        dealt with Mr. Montagu Summers rose and said that in his opinion the
                        directors were to be thanked for the frank manner in which they had laid the
                        position of the company before the shareholders, and speaking as a large
                        shareholder himself he thought that the proposals which they had just heard
                        were in every way the best that could be made for the benefit of the
                        company. At the present moment the shares were practically unsaleable and if
                        this state of things continued the company would have no other course left
                        it but to go into liquidation, the lack of capital leaving the company
                        almost entirely in the hands of the people from whom the businesses had been
                        bought, but that if the proposed resolutions were carried be did not doubt
                        but what the 10 - shares would very shortly rise to 15/- or even £1. Mr.
                        Hill asked that if the resolutions were carried, what would</p>
                </div>
                <cb n="3"/>
                <div type="item">
                    <p> be left to the company, and also asked how Mr. Bondi could remain in this
                        company as director while competing with it in his own business. The
                        Chairman replied that Mr. Bondi had been good enough to remain in the
                        company and there would be no competition, and that there still remained the
                        head office and the land at Rod el Parag. The Chairman then put the
                        resolutions to the meeting and they were declared carried by a requisite
                        majority on show of hands. Before the meeting broke up the chairman said
                        that he wished it to be understood that the Company had nothing to hide and
                        that any one who wished to investigate its position would be given every
                        information at the offices of the company, and he gave instructions to the
                        secretary to that effect. The following was the Balance Sheet of the Company

                        On examining the Accounts however we found that the Good. will included in

                        Alexandria, in "Loreley,” which will be played again tonight. The impression
                        left upon the audience of this company was most favourable, and by Saturday
                        night's performance we were led to hope for a season of quite good opera.
                        There were certainly defects in the representation, but these may easily be
                        remedied by practice. The most notable fault was a certain raggedness in the
                        choral parts, and the orchestra seemed to us to be at times distinctively
                        too heavy, though we had the misfortune to be almost sitting on the top of
                        the big drum, so to speak. The ballet was clumsy, and the first dance was
                        quite devoid of art — indeed it would have been far better to omit it
                        altogether. Of the principals two shone, and they must have been greatly
                        pleased with the uproarious applause of a most enthusiastic audience.
                        Signora Crusceniski was really good as Loréley ; her voice is clear, pure,
                        and true, and though she is not a great actress she carried out her part of
                        Siren, well. Signor Rusconi too, was good as Rudolfo, but Signor Cristalli,
                        as Walter was rather disappointing ; his voice being rather cold and
                        sometimes even harsh, while his actions were unconvincing. As the fiancée
                        and bride Signora Finzi did not seem quite up to the mark, but she has a
                        powerful and well-trained voice, which she appeared to somewhat overstrain.
                        After tonight’s performance, however, of the same opera we shall be able to
                        judge the company better, for on Saturday, first night awkardness was
                        apparent, especially in the chorus. We would impress upon the management,
                        however, the necessity for curtailing the intervals, which were most unduly
                        prolonged and very, very tedious. To-morrow night we are to hear the ever
                        popular “Faust,” with Signor Narciso Del Ry as Mephistofele, from whom great
                        things are expected as a singer of much promise.</p>

                    <byline>(From Our Own Correspondent)</byline>
                    <dateline>Port Sudan, 19th December.</dateline>
                    <p> On Friday the 13th the S.S. “El Kahira” took the blue ribbon of this run
                        away from the S.S. “Prince Abbas,” by arriving at 7.30 p.m. just under 50
                        hours steaming from Suez; many thanks came from the passengers to Mr.
                        Wayman, the chief engineer, who worked hard the whole time. Among the
                        passengers arriving was the British Consul of Jeddah who went down to Suakim
                        in the vessel and joined the S.S. “Mahallah” for his return to Jeddah, also
                        Mr. Little who left later for Khartoum. On the 14th inst., the S.S.
                        “Nidderdale” arrived with a large quantity of cargo which will take some
                        days to discharge. Port Sudan is not sorry, as amongst the many passengers
                        there are some good fellows who are fond of sport. We must not forget to
                        mention the Captain who is certainly No. 1 at all games. The Port Sudan
                        Sports Club have got up many matches of both football and cricket for their
                        benefit but I am pleased to say that they have not given us a beating yet,
                        “Well done Port Suddenites.” Quite a number of accidents have occurred here
                        lately. One was most serious in which Mr. Cochilani of the firm of Messrs.
                        Bencini and Quistas, the quay contractors, was the victim. It appears that
                        they were blasting the coral reef and this gentleman was standing quite 80
                        yards away from the scene, when a sharp piece of coral fell on his head,
                        cutting it open. He was carried to his house near by, and the doctors were
                        called in; meanwhile everything was done to keep him conscious. It will be
                        sometime before he is quite well again. Another exciting accident occurred
                        in the shape of a runaway train on a siding where the railways are building
                        the new line to meet the bridge. All the soldiers employed on the work
                        endeavoured to stop it but to no effect, and the soldiers who were near the
                        stop block received not only the contents but the trucks as well on top of
                        them. It was surprising that so few were injured, one only being taken to
                        the hospital. Great alarm has been caused amongst the natives by a motor
                        car, which has just arrived in the “Nidderdale" for the Sirdar who will be
                        shortly visiting the Port. This car is undoubtedly the best that ever put
                        wheels on Port Sudan soil. The makers, Messrs. Arrol and Johnson, are to be
                        congratulated upon turning out such a splendid car, which has been specially
                        made with paddle wheels for gripping the sand. A trial run has been made on
                        another car of the road to Khor-ah-Bat where they intend obtaining the water
                        supply for this town, and which the Sirdar is going out to inspect.</p>

                    <p>This morning's telegrams report that out of 10 cases of cholera at Mecca 5
                        have proved fatal, while from Sinope the news is still more serious. There
                        72 cases from the Russian pilgrim steamer “Gregory Merek” were landed in
                        quarantine the other day, and of this number 57 have died. The “Gregory
                        Merek” was allowed to proceed to Port Said, where she is now in quarantine,
                        and she will be sent through the canal under the strictest guard to prevent
                        any possibility of communication with the shore. Cholera has also broken out
                        aboard the Khedivial Mail S.S ‘“Dahabeah” among pilgrims taken from Yambo,
                        and the sanitary authorities have ordered the “Dahabeah” to proceed to

                    <byline>From our own Correspondent</byline>
                    <dateline>Port Said, Saturday</dateline>
                    <p>The coal discharging Arabs have come out on strike in sympathy with the
                        bunkering men who left work without notice on Thursday night. Last Tuesday
                        was really the beginning, as that night a gang of bunkering Arabs on their
                        way to the harbour were stopped by other Arabs who tried to persuade them to
                        turn back. There was a sharp scuffle, but fortunately the police arrived
                        promptly and one of the ringleaders was arrested. The masters of the gang
                        who endeavoured to start the strike requested their sheikh to dismiss three
                        other men who were ringleaders in the scuffle of Tuesday night. Things went
                        on as usual till Thursday evening when a gang was called down to bunker the
                        S.S. “Tydeus.” When the gang arrived they were accompanied by the three men
                        who had been dismissed, and then the trouble began. The three discharged men
                        refused to leave the coal lighters and started making a disturbance with the
                        result that the police were sent for and they were arrested. Immediately the
                        men were arrested the whole gang returned to their village and refused to
                        work. The coal agents for the S.S. “Tydeus” applied to the neighbours for
                        assistance but all gangs refused to work till the arrested men had been
                        released and allowed to rejoin their gang. The mounted and foot police from
                        Cairo are encamped in the streets dividing the Arab village from the
                        European quarter and no doubt the sight of so many police will have a good
                        effect on the strikers.</p>

                    <head>SAVOY DANCE</head>
                    <p>Whatever pessimists may find to say regarding the present season, there need
                        be no fear of a slump in the popularity of the Savoy dances, if that of last
                        Saturday may be taken as a sample. It was the cheeriest evening we have seen
                        this season, and was attended by seemingly the entire military contingent,
                        and by the greater part of the residential and visiting population of the
                        place. Varions improvements have been made in the hotel since last year, and
                        the extra door from the ball room, and the increased sitting-out
                        accomodation were highly appreciated by the guests. The new restaurant, too,
                        is a great addition, and its delightful scheme of decoration is bound to add
                        to its popularity; many people took this opportunity of dining and among
                        them being a large party of old Rugbeans who were up holding the honour of
                        their old school. There were as usual a number of handsome toilettes to be
                        noticed in the ball room: the new comers proving themselves every whit as
                        well dressed as those of the past and record season. Mrs. Darrell was a very
                        noticeable figure in a beautiful and most original frock of deep purple
                        chiffon moanted over scarlet satin. Mrs. Appleton, who, has already
                        established a reptitation for always being beautifully gowned, was wearing
                        on this occasion a filmy dress of dark blue with masses of blue sequins upon
                        the decolletage. Miss Schulyer Ross, who is staying at the Savoy with Mrs.
                        Ross, was much admired in a beautifully fitting white satin gown, with a
                        deep lace berthe, and a black ornament in her exquisitely fair hair. Colonel
                        and Mrs. Davidson who have only just arrived in Cairo were present with Miss
                        Davidson, who looked charming in cream net trimmed with bands of satin. Mrs.
                        Hornblower brought her niece Miss Smith also in white, and with Mrs. Royle’s
                        party was Miss Barnes Lawrence in a filmy white frock lightly diamantic and
                        inset with heavy motifs of guipure d'Irelande. Princess Irene Duleep Singh,
                        who was in deep rose colour with lace guimpe, was with Mrs. and Miss Carey,
                        the latter looking very handsome in pale pink satin. The Misses Coles were
                        in fresh and dainty pale blue frocks of empire make, the lappels of their
                        bodies outlined by silken ball fringes. Their cousin was in a very handsome
                        frock of white silk, inset with many entredeux and applications of lace.
                        Miss Morss, who is staying with her mother at Shepheards, was quite one of
                        the most popular belles present, and looked very well in a dress of fine
                        muslin much tucked and inset with lace, and with a blue bow in her hair.
                        Mrs. Carver made a very welcome return to the scene of her old triumphs, and
                        looked very well in a pretty frock of soft striped blue material. Mrs.
                        Knight's white chiffon frock guaged round the waist, was weighted by the
                        classical keypattern in gold ; and Mrs. Duffus was wearing a charming gown
                        of grey and white striped silk, over an underdress of soft white muslin and
                        lace. The Misses Hyde Page were wearing handsome satin dresses, one in pink
                        and one in cream, with diamentee lace about the corsages, and Mrs. Parsons
                        was also in cream satin with a soft white feather in her hair. Mrs. de
                        Cossen had a big yellow paradis in her hair which toned with her pretty
                        sparkling drees. Mrs. Nolan was in an empire frock of deep rose coloured and
                        striped material with velvet of the same shade Mrs. Sillards pretty fresh
                        frock was of painted muslin relieved with green and set into a lace yoke at
                        the waist. Mra. Fraser was in brocade of various shades of brown, brown
                        chiflon dividing the panels and draping the bodice. We noticed many dresses
                        in various shades of red and wine colour, one notable one being in velvet ;
                        and among those who wore black with good effect were Mrs. Royle, Mrs,
                        Maclean, Mrs. Schreiber and Mrs, Bailey.</p>

                    <head>DEATH OF A MOSS LINE SUPERINTENDENT.</head>
                    <p>The death occurred recently, at his residence, 33, Great George-road,
                        Waterloo, of Captain William Owen, marine superintendent of the Moss Line of
                        steamers. Deceased, who was sixty-seven years of age, was highly esteemed in
                        shipping circles. He joined the Moss Line Company in 1866 as junior officer,
                        and rapidly rose to a captaincy. In turn he commanded nearly all the
                        steamers of the line. In 1891 he was appointed marine superintendent of the
                        line, a position he held with credit and distiction up to the time of his
                        demise. His death was not expected, as he was at business a few days before
                        his death. Messrs. R.J. Moss and Co, inform us that he was buried on
                        Saturday, 14th, inst., at Anfield. The House Flags were hoisted half-mast by
                        the Moss, Ellerman and Papayanni Liners in port from the 11th to the 14th in
                        token of respect for the deceased, who was well known here. By his death the
                        Moss S.S. Co., Ltd., lose one of their most trusted and valuable friends and
                        officials.</p>

                <p>La séance de ce matin a été une réédition des précédentes, 4 cette différence
                    prée que les affaires se sont encore raréfides, si possible, et que la corbeille
                    a été videou a peu prés pen- dant la plus grande partie de la matinée. Les
                    offres ont oocasionné une nouvelle dépréciation dela cote. Celan’a d’ailleurs
                    rien d’étonnant avec une situation générale aussi peu encoo- rageante,
                    |’élévation du taux privé d’escompte de 5 7/8 a 6% et l'approche des fétes de
                    Noél et du Nouvel An. A cette occasion le marché des valeurs sera fermé les
                    mercredi et jeudi 25 et 26 courant, ainsi que ler et 2 janvier prochain.</p>
                <p>Il y a eu ce matin une exécution comprenant 100 Delta Land, 100 Egyptian Land
                    Invest. ment and Building(Fanous) et 100 Ritz Hotels. Ces titres ont trouvé
                    preneurs aux cours res pectifs de 1 3/32, 9/64 et 1/4-17/64.</p>
                <p>Parmi lea valeurs dirigeantes l'Agricole fléchit de 7 25/82 47 8/4, la National

                    les obligations anciennes Crédit Foncier qui tombent pour ce motif de 279 1/2
                    &amp; 276 1/2; c'est le plus bas prix constaté non seulement ao coors de la
                    crise actuelle mais depuis plusieurs années. La seule explication plausible
                    qu'on donne de ce fait anormal c’est que la plupart des autres titres sont en ce
                    moment difficiles pour ne pas dire impossibles 4 négocier. Seule de cette ca-

                    1/4.</p>
                <p>Nous constatons le méme mouvement de recul parmi les titres d’ordre secondaire. A
                    part la Port Said Salt qui se reléve un peu de 11/9 &amp;amp; 11/10 1/2, toutes
                    les autres varia. tions indiquent un nouveau fiéchissement.</p>
                <p>C’est ainsi que de 13/- la Salt and Soda ré encore a 12 9, l'Ordinary Khedivial

                <p>Limassol, December 12.</p>
                <p>Mr. H.J. Gibson, Deputy Auditor-General in London, arrived here last month,
                    together with Mr. Bunbury of the Auditor General's Department, for the purpose
                    of examining into the system of accountancy and audit in the Island. Mr. Gibson
                    is making an extended tour including British possessions in the Mediterranean
                    and in West Africa, and is carrying out a very ample programme of work. He
                    landed at Limassol and with Mr. Banbury proceeded to Nicosia by mole across the
                    lower heights of the Southern mountain range. He was thus enabled to gain an
                    idea of the country parts of the Island They remained only one week in
                    Cyprus.</p>
                <p>The Rainy Season.</p>
                <p>Reports from all districts show that the rainstorms of a fortnight ago were very
                    general. [n many localities the land was under water and damage was done. The
                    Railway line to Morphou suffered from wash-outs, the effect, in one part, being
                    very serious, a large portion of the embankment having been washed away leaving
                    the rails and sleepers unsupported. No accidents to trains oncurred however.</p>
                <p>A railway motor-car has lately been imported for the use of certain railway
                    officials It is intended that it shall travel at a much greater speed than the
                    ordinary train, and will frequently be used in the place of a special train. It
                    shonld prove of considerable utility as well as economy in this respect.</p>
                <p>Government Farm.</p>
                <p>The Government farm at Athalassa, which has lately come under the direction of
                    the Committee for the improvement of native animals, has lately received the
                    following live stock from England : 1 Galloway bull, 2 Devon bulls, 4 large
                    black pigs, and some head of poultry</p>
                <p>Cypriot Poultry.</p>
                <p>There is much room for improvement in the native breeds of poultry and Cyprus is
                    an ideal place for poultry farming. Cyprus eggs compare favourably with the
                    small eggs of inferior quality usually to be seen in Egypt, but new strains of
                    fowls are much needed both for egg production and table purposes. If the use of
                    incubators and foster mothers were to become general, an important and
                    remunerative poultry trade might be done. The price of eggs is at present very
                    high, half a piastre each in the towns, almost the same as in Egypt. Indeed as
                    Egypt comes to be more and more more the market forall kinds of Cyprus produce,
                    the cost price in this Island for such articles will necessarily approximate and
                    be largely influenced by the prices obtainable in Egypt. It may be hoped that
                    when better metbods of rearing poultry prevail here, a more humane system of
                    hawking birds for sale will be adopted. The present custom of tying them by the
                    legs and carrying them about by hand all day is very cruel, particularly in the
                    case of beavy birds. Efforts have been made to introduce baskets and crates, but
                    the existing practise still obtains generally, and will, doubtless, die
                    hard.</p>
                <p>Rough Seas.</p>
                <p>The heavy seas which have lately prevailed around our coasts have made the
                    process of shipments and unloading of goods and the embarkation and
                    disembarkation of passengers very difficult in the roadsteads of Limassol and
                    Larnaca. The charge of £1 per person, which has had to be paid at both the ports
                    for getting from vessel to land is a considerable addition to the travelling
                    expenses, and isa great increase upon the ordinary charge of 2s The entrance to
                    the port of Famagusta, too, is very difficult of access in rough weather, and
