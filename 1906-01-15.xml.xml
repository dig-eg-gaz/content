                        batting and is more inclined to give the other side an innings rather than
                        fight it out on any defiuiteisiue, although Mr. Balfour has been oroshingly
                        defeated. Lanca­shire has undoubtedly again championed the polioy ot free

                                        were really good. Signora Ross (Aida) improved greatly after

                                    <p>Suez, Sunday.</p>
                                    <p>The Mahmal reached Snez yesterday at noon by a special traio,
                                        whioh was sainted from the fort with 21 gnns. The procession
                                        through the principal streets of Suez started at 2.30 p.m.
                                        It was exceptionally well organized this year and was headed
                                        by H E. the Governor of Snez on hot o’»- ck. The prooession
                                        consisted of Cavaby. Infantry, Artillery with field and
                                        Maxim guns, and a military band, all of which presented a
                                        brilliant aspeot.</p>
                                    <p>Iu spite of the good order maintained, a regrettable inoident
                                        occurred while the Mahmal was passing the Italian Consulate
                                        On the verandah of the consulate there was a French lady,
                                        who, seeing the Holy Carpet for the first time, was
                                        endeavouring to take a snapshot of it with her camera. A
                                        oonstable, however, on seeing the lady taking a photo,
                                        oalled out to her to go into the house, and as the lady did
                                        not take any notice of his absurd demands, he began to throw
                                        stones at her, thus drawing the attention &lt; f the
                                        considerable number of natives following the carpet, who
                                        might very possibly have followed his example. Fortunately,
                                        the Italian Consol. Mr. Deperais, happened to be on the
                                        verandah also at the time, and prompt­ly sent his janissary
                                        to take the oonstable’s number, and order him to withdraw,
                                        which he did after insulting the consul by shootiog ont
