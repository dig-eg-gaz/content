                    <p>Berths can be definitely engaged beforehand. Plans can be seen at the Offices
                        of the Company's Agents.</p>
                    <p>The through Steamers for Marseilles, Gibraltar, Plymouth and London are
                        Intended to leave Port Said after the arrival of the 11 a.m. train from
                        Cairo, every Monday. A steam tender will meet the train to convey passengers
                        to the ship.</p>
                    <p>The Brindisi Express Steamer leaves Port Said directly the Indian Mails
                        arrive. Passengers can go on board the evening before.</p>
                    <p>The express steamer usually reaches Brindisi on Wednesday afternoon, the
                        special train starting at 8 p.m. and arriving in London at the very
                        convenient hour of 4.56 p.m. on Friday.</p>
                    <p>The combined Sea and special train fare is £22.9.11 Port Said to London via
                        Brindisi or via Marseilles.</p>
                    <p>Passengers having paid fall fare in one direction are allowed an abatement of
                        25 per cent, on returning within 12 months.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the above regular weekly service there are sailings about
                        twice a fortnight of 5,000 to 7,000 tons steamers to London, calling at
                        Malta or Marseilles.</p>
                    <p>TO THE EAST.</p>
                    <p>The Mail Steamers leave Suez for Aden and Bombay every Wednesday, and for
                        Australia and China every alternate Wednesday. A steamer leaves for
                        Calcutta, fortnightly, and another for Japan. Passengers can embark at Port
                        Said.</p>

                    <head> ARE WR LIVING IN A FOOL'S PARADISE ? </head>
                    <p>It is gratifying to note, says the Earl of Errol in the "Nineteenth Century,"
                        that the speech by Lord Roberts in January last before the members of the
                        Liverpool Chamber of Commerce, in which he stated in plain terms that the
                        country was living in a fool's paradise, as well as bis exposition of the
                        views of the National Service League, have found some sobo in the Press,
                        even if they have produced little effect on the minds of the publio. It
                        presents a curious illustration of the apathy of our countrymen that so
                        serious an indictment, coming from such an authoritative source, should fail
                        to carry conviction to the minds of all thinking men, and seems to justify
                        the contention of the gravedigger in "Hamlet" that all Englishmen are mad.
                        .. The Japane-e say that we think too much of our rights and too little of
                        our duties, and I think this is a truth which wants continually rubbing into
                        the conscience of the country. Not that we are without patriotism of a kind,
                        but it lies very deep below the surface and wants a deal of waking up...
                        What patriotism we have is no longer the patriotism of our fathers. It is
                        ephemeral and emotional, and bursts forth only in times of great excitement.
                        It waver flags and shouts, and repeats that Britons never shall be
                            slaves,<cb n="6"/> but refrains from taking the 'necessary steps to
                        prevent such a contingency... It cannot be too soft or repeated that the War
                        Office was called upon to send 850,000 men to South Africa during the war,
                        and that the country only provided them with the machinery for sending
                        80,000. Public opinion was not at that time sufficiently instructed to
                        insist on a state of preparation adequate to our responsibilities. Is it
                        more so now? ... I hold that public opinion on this point (individual
                        responsibility for the efficiency of the fighting forces of the country)
                        should be formed on the reasoned and thoughtful study of the question, and
                        based on the expert opinion of professional advisors, and that every effort
                        should be made to educate sad instruøt the people with view to their
                        insisting on their rulers taking the necessary steps to achieve the end in
                        view. In no other way on War Minister get the necessary backing to enable
                        him to grapple with the question in an adequate and radical manner. ... It
                        is always an advantage "to see ourselves as others see us," even if it does
                        not conduce to our national vanity. The Japanese are a practical people. We
                        are so no longer. They take the necessary precautions and I make the
                        necessary sacrifices that they may be strong in the hope of trial. We trust
                        to luck to pull us through somehow... What if we are living in fool's
                        paradise and if we wake up some morning to find ourselves attacked by a
                        powerful enemy, and hit one, two, three, below the belt before we are ready,
                        and before we have realised that war is upon us! It was thus that the
                        Russians were surprised at Port Anthor, and it is admitted that the whole
                        nation was staggered by the reddanner of the onslaught. It is recorded how
                        the officers were enjoying themselves on shore, some dancing, some taking
                        their recreation in other ways, when the Japanese guns were heard destroying
                        their fleet in the harbour. The attack was so sudden and unexpected, and the
                        disaster so irreparable in ito moral and its material aspects, that its
                        effort was felt till the last day of the war. What guarantee have we that we
                        shall not be found similarly unprepared if attacked in like circumstances,
                        and whose fault will it be! Shall we be found marrying and giving in
                        marriage, attending race meetings, playing football, or rather watching
                        others playing football, and enjoying our undefended and unprotected
                        increment ? Will this increment survive ? Shall we at the end of a great var
                        be in a similar state of prosperity to that. in which we are now, and will
                        our people enjoy the same liberty and prosperity as at present? These are
                        questions which they most decide for themselves. It will be too late to
                        throw the blame on to the War Office, or to plead as an excuse for their
                        onmutual apathy that they were without warning. Military men of the highest
                        authority have spoken in no uncertain tones, magazine articles, speeches in
                        and out of Parliament, letters of soldier and civilians in the daily Press
                        have for months been rubbing in the inadequacy of the military forces of the
                        country. They have appealed to the patriotism of the artizou, they have
                        appealed to his interest, they have held up the bushido of the Japanese and
                        his self-sacrificing love of country. They have piped, but the proletariat
                        has not danced. The people refuse to be persuaded; they prefer to be
                        dooeived by the propbeoy of smooth things, and to present a dead wall of
                        apathy and indifference to the warnings, of an educated and expert opinion.
                        It is this feeling of prajadica that prevents the individual citizen from
                        accepting his share of the responsibility for the defense of his country and
                        the maintenance of the Empire, and which paralyses all attempts on the part
                        of a War Minister to propound any scheme for the proper development of the
                        military foroes of the nation.... .. . .. We don't want an army on the
                        Continental pattern, but we do want a reserve of the best manhood of the
                        country to fall back upon in case of necessity. The question is, how are we
                        to get it, how are we to utilise to the best advantage the fine material we
                        have at hand? At present the proposals pat forward by the National Service
                        League would seem to offer the best solution of the problem, but to carry
                        them out, the individual citizen must be educated to realise the debt which
                        he owes to his Fatherland, and the dangers to which his want of patriotism
                        exposes it.</p>

                            conduct of one Mohamed Zalpat, omdeh of Taltieh. It appears that this

                            who were sitting in a cafe known as the "Rendezvous des Chasseurs," by
                            the Pyramids tram line. His drunkenness at the time explains but does
                            not excuse such disgraceful conduct. We hope an example will be made of
                            Mohamed Zalpat.</p>

                    <p>WAYS OF THE NATIVE HUSBAND.</p>
                    <p>"Al Abram" publishes the following petition of a number of native women:</p>
                    <p>We, poor and weak women, request you to publish our complaints, as nobody not
                        even the Government - has any pity for us. When any one of us has a
                        difference with our husband over some question he leaves us and compels us
                        to take proceedings against him in the Mehkemeh Sharieh for maintenance.
                        Days and sometimes months may pass before the needy wife can get a judgment.
                        When she does get it she goes to the Gouvernorat in triumph in the hope of
                        obtaining the "nafaka" promptly after handing the document to the official ;
                        but, alas, the Gouvernorat neglects the matter, and when the husband is
                        finally summoned, many days after, he often pretends that be possesses
                        nothing wherewith to support his poor wife and children. He neither offers
                        the indispensable support nor divorces his wife, who will have, according to
                        the law, to remain in suffering and misery. Now we hear that the Ministry of
                        Justice is desirous of revising and amending the Mehkemeh regulations. Will
                        the men of justice remember our grievances in making these improvements ? We
                        pray the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of the Interior, and the Mehkameh
                        Sharieh to have pity on me, poor women ; we beg of them to save as from
                        starvation, and to protect our honour.</p>

                        afternoon at the Mixed Courts. Cairo, under the presidency of Judge Tack.
                        Prof. Sampaolo, acting syodio, was present,</p>
                    <p>Judge Tack opened the proceedings by informing the meeting that the definite
                        appointment of a syndio was necessary. Maitre Carton de Wiart, in the name
                        of the Sugar Corporation and the Hon. A. J. Davey, requested the Court to
                        postpone the definite appointment of a syndio till Monday next, since two co
                        syndio. had to be appointed and the creditors had not yet come to any
                        decision as to who they should be. Jadge Tack replied that according to the
                        Code the definite appointment of a syndio was necessary, afterwards
                        co-syndios could be appointed if the importance of the case justified the
                        measure.</p>
                    <p>It was finally decided to postpone the definite appointment of the syndio
                        till to-morrow and to hold a meeting of creditors at 4 p.m. on Monday to
                        appoint two co-syndios.</p>

                    <p>Some slight alteration has taken place in the future movements of the
                        American squadron at present in Alexandria harbour. While the two cruisers,
                        Galveston and Chattanooga, will proceed to China waters, the Tacoma will
                        remain at the western end of the Mediterranean in order to render what
                        assistance may be required by the drydock Dewey, before she enters the Suez
                        Canal ,</p>
                    <p>Rear-Admiral Sigabee's flagship, the Brooklyn, will remain in port until
                        after the visit to Cairo of the Prince and Princess of Wales, the Admiral
                        and officers taking part in the festivities which will take place in their
                        honour. These include, we believe, the trooping of the colours by the
                        British garrison of Cairo.</p>
                    <p>After leaving Alexandria the Brooklyn will proceed direct to Philadelphia,
                        where it is expected she will go out of commission. Although she is a
                        comparatively new vessel, having been built in 1896, the cruiser is in many
                        respects out of date, and she will be completely overhauled on her return to
                        America.</p>
                    <p>The cruise of the squadron, which has lasted for some months, has been a
                        great success. At every port the ships have called Admiral Bigsbee and his
                        officers and men have been feted with the utmost cordiality. At Alex andria
                        the officers have been attending a round of luncheons and dinners, and it
                        will be something of a relief, we opine, when they go out to the open sea
                        and resume their normal life.</p>
                    <p>Admiral Sigebee was particularly charmed with the reception he received at
                        the hands of H.H. the Khedive, with whom he had a long and interesting
                        conversation. As already announced, the Admiral and a number of the officers
                        of the squadron will have the honour of dining with his Highness to
                        morrow.</p>
                    <p>Yesterday afternoon Captain Nazro, of the Brooklyn, entertained a number of
                        American ladies who are on the point of embarking for Europe, and in the
                        evening Commander Smith gave a large dinner party on the Tacoma.</p>

                    <head> THE BACHELORS' BALL </head>
                    <p>The Cairo bachelors may well congratulate themselves on their latest
                        achievement, for everybody is still talking of the delights of their ball at
                        the Ghezireh Casino on Tuesday night, and of the perfection of all the
                        arrangements. The decorations were superb, the floor</p>
                    <p>was perfect, and the supper all that the heart of a man could desire The only
                        complaint possible was with the weather, which was unaccountably cold for
                        the season. and which it prevented the guests from enjoying to the</p>
                    <p>tall the beauties of the illuminated gardens. Fairyland could not have been
                        more fairylike than those sylvan paths and stretches of award where coloured
                        lights gleamed softly from among the trees and their reflections floated on
                        the still bosom of the tiny lake. The Khedivial Band stationed outside added
                        still further to the attractions. </p>
                    <p>Among the hosts were the following gentlemen :-Lord Edward Cecil, Sir Vincent
                        Corbet, Col.' W. S. Sparkes, Major Palmer, Major Watson, Major Garner, Capt.
                        Gordon, Capt. Grant, Capt. Stockwell, Capt. McMurdo, Capt. Betbell, Capt. F.
                        J. Brakervridge, Mr. H. Greville, Mr. H. W. Haton, Mr. C. Higgins, Mr. J. P.

                        of ceremonies could be found than Major J. K. Watson,</p>
                    <p>who more than ever that night was voted not most popular man in Cairo.</p>
                    <p>It would be impossible to enumerate all those who were enjoying the
                        gentlemen's hospitality on that occasion. All the brightest the and fairest
                        of Cairo's best were there, and the ball owed not a little of its success
                        to</p>
                    <p>the fact that Lord and Lady Cromer were present with Lady Beatrice Thynne and
                        their many other guests. There were of course many beautiful frocks to be
                        seen, and a wonderful display of jewels. The Hon. Mrs. Findlay was wearing
                        diamonds with a beautiful coptome of pale pink satin, and Larly Oppenheimer
                        bad some wonderful pearls with a dress of black. The Hon. Miss Henneage was
                        in a very pretty fresh frook of blue chiffon, and Mrs. Laidlaw looked
                        extremely well in pale pink chiffon with trails of roses, Miss Leverich's
                        dress of white chiflon was quite one of the prettiest to be seen, and Mrs.
                        Maclean was in white satin.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>BOYS MAKE A FINE SHOW.</p>
                    <p>Favoured by capital weather, and held before a large attendance, the
                        Government Schools Athletic Sports yesterday were a thorough success. Among
                        those present on the Ghezireh ground were Lord and Lady Cromer, the Prime
                        Minister, the Sirdar and Lady Wingate, Hossein Pacba Pokbry, Yacoub Paobs
                        Artio, Baron de Villebois, Mme and Mlles de Villebois, Sir William Garstin,
                        Mr. P. Macbell, Coles Pacha Mr. Webb, Mr. and Mrr. Elliott, Mr. and Mrs.
                        Sharmen, Col. Matebett, Crook sbank Pacha, Dean and Mrs. Butober, Capt.
                        Protheroe Smith, Mr. and Mrs. Mackenzie, Mr. Boyd-Carpenter, Mr. Wild, Mr.
                        Amos and Miss Amos, Major and Mrs. Doffos, Dr. and Mrs. Phillips. The
                        grandstand was quite full, and a crowd composed largely of friends and
                        relations of the school-boys swarmed everywhere-but on the track.</p>
                    <p>The arrangements did credit to the committee and the stewards and every event
                        commenced punctually, while no interval was unduly protracted.</p>
                    <p>The performances were all up to, and some well above, the average Ahmed
                        Sbakir did very fair time for a school-boy in the 100 yards race for the
                        pupils of the Secondary Schools, and followed op bis success by getting the
                        quarter-mile by about three and a ball yards. The hordles gave a good race
                        but there was a certain want of style about the performance. None of the
                        competitors seemed to have been trained to hurdle properly : had they
                        understand how to fly their hurdles their time world have been greatly
                        improved.</p>
                    <p>The big jump was divided between T, Mohamed Negati Abazs and Mob. Bi Sawi
                        Mustapha, who succeeded in beating previous records at the school sports by
                        4 inches most creditable performance. The Towfikieh team was much too heavy
                        for its opponents of the Khedivieh in the tug-of-war, and fairly pulled its
                        opponents off their legs in double quick rims.</p>
                    <p>The gymnastics were really good. The teams had been well trained and did
                        their work very thoroughly, especially on the parallel bars. Individually
                        they were perhaps not quite as good as the best of the public school
                        gymnastic representatives one goes at Aldershot every spring, but can any

                    <p>The drill and clob-swinging display given by the boys of the Primary schools
                        was undoubtedly the best, from a spectacular point of view, of the events of
                        the afternoon. The boys went through their physical drill in the most
                        perfect time, their marching was perhaps not quite final to their drill, but
                        their club swinging was extraordinarily good, and their Egyptian instructors
                        and Sergt. Brookway have much to be proud of.</p>
                    <p>The appearance of the boys was thoroughly refreshing : they were healthily
                        built and well set up, and whatever the criticisms that are directed against
                        the Ministry of Public Instruction by a section of the Press, the critics
                        cannot deny that a good proportion of the younger generation of Egyptians of
                        the better classes promises well physically. The corpus sanum after all is
                        the basis of the mens sana.</p>

                        Ihady is shortly to be transferred to Alexandria, has been received with
                        much regret. The Governor is very popular and deservedly so. During his term

                            <p> HOUSE OF COMMONS. --Mr. Winston Churchill said that the Government
                                had not received any application from the Transvaal for the
                                introduction of Indians in the mines. It would be impossible to
                                state beforehand the manner of dealing with such an application.</p>
                            <p>The motion of censure on Lord Milner was rejected without a division.
                                The amendment moved by Mr. Winston Churchill was then adopted by 355
                                to 185. Mr. Chamberlain characterised the motion as vindictive petty
                                persecution of a great public servant. Mr. Winston Churchill replied
                                that while the Government admitted the truth and moderation of the
                                resolution, its adoption would aggravate existing animosities in
                                South Africa.</p>
                            <p>It is understood that the Government would welcome an application for
                                the importation of Indians into the Transvaal on the lines of the
                                Guiana system, as being calculated to ease the present situation,
                                which the Government regards with anxiety.</p>

                    <head>THE MAKING OF EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>SIR A. COLVIN'S NEW BOOK.</p>
                    <p>Sir Auckland Colvin's new book, The Making of Modern Egypt," is the latest
                        publication dealing with this country.</p>
                    <p>Sir Auckland Colvin dates the commencement of the history of "Modern Egypt"
                        from the British occupation in 1882, and he tells the story of the
                        twenty-two years which elapsed between that date and the Anglo-French
                        Agreement in considerable detail and in an interesting manner. Space will
                        only permit here a brief indication of his general conclusion, and this
                        cannot be given better than in his own words :</p>
                    <p>"Looking backward over the past two and twenty years, Great Britain, after
                        all her mistakes and mishaps, has much on which she may congratulate
                        herself. She may congratulate herself on having escaped from the blunder of
                        an early withdrawal of her forces from Egypt, which would have led to fresh
                        international complications; and from the still greater blunder of escorting
                        the Turk back to Cairo. She may congratulate herself on having put an end to
                        the dire tyranny of the Dervish rule in the Egyptian Sudan, and on her share
                        in the work of restoring in those regions a reign of justice and of peace
                        She may congratulate herself on being established, with the connert of all
                        Europe, in Egypt, where she strider, like a modern Colossus, across the
                        narrow entrance which leads from the Western to the Eastern hemisphere, and
                        keeps watch over the approaches to her Indian Empire. Above all, she may
                        congratulate herself on having installed in Cairo, from the hour of her
                        arrival, the one man who by natural aptitude, by experience, and by
                        character, was needed to secure her interests, and to ensure the well-being
                        of the people for whom she had assumed responsibility."</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="bold">Lord Cromor.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>What," Sir Auckland Colvin asks, "has been the secret of Lord Cromer's
                        success?" A mere extract from the answer to this question must suffice
                        here:</p>
                    <p>"That he has shown extraordinary capacity for labour, great financial and
                        economic skill, untiring patience, high moral courage, much insight into
                        native character; that he has gained general confidence by habitually frank
                        outspokenness and candour ; all this, though true, scarcely supplies a
                        sufficient answer to the question. The solution is probably to be found on
                        examining the line of policy which he has adopted. It has been in the
                        non-controversial sense of the word, a distinctly liberal policy. Its aim
                        has been the greatest good of the greatest number, general content based on
                        general well being... He has habitually looked at all questions, not solely
                        from the point of the educationalist, or the administrator, but as much as
                        possible from the point of view of the Egyptian himself."</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="bold">The Khedive Townk.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Justice at last is done to the late Khedive, upon a complete knowledge of the
                        facts, by Sir Auckland Colvin -</p>
                    <p>"When he was called on to decide broad issues or to confront great
                        difficulties, he saw his way rapidly to a right conclusion. He well
                        maintained the dignity of his high position. for example, when, on the eve
                        of the bombardment of Alexandria, he was invited to take refuge on the decks
                        of a British man-of war. He replied to that proposal without hesitation,
                        that 'if he sheltered himself on board a war vessel, whose guns were trained
                        on the forte of his country, he could never again show his face in Egypt! So
                        he retired, guarded only by matinou-soldiers, to Ramleh, in the
                        neighbourhood of Alexandria, whence few of those who bade him farewell
                        expected that he would be permitted to return."</p>
                    <p>As regards the earlier life of the Khedive, before the British occupation,
                        another passage is worth quotation :**"There was in Tewfik Pacha a reserve
                        of reasonableness and sound judgment, and an honourable belief in the good
                        faith of advisers whom he trusted, which are no mean substitute for
                        experience directly acquired by lons handling of public affairs. He had
                        confidence in the English, and he especially felt the value of their support
                        in the presence of French ambition. But as he had no wish to be swallowed up
                        by army power he aimed at being friendly with all."</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="bold">General Gordon</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>As regards the fitness of General Gordon for the tark of withdrawing the
                        garrisons from the Sudan, Sir Auckland remarks :"With all his splendid
                        qualities, General Gordon was the most unfit selection conceivable for a
                        mission of which retreat wa to he the leading feature, and in the course of
                        which the sacrifice of some of those who had remained loyal to him and to
                        Egypt might prove inevitable. To send him not to achieve fresh success but
                        to withdraw from the scenes of former triumphs, and possibly to turn his
                        back on friends who in humbler spheres had shared them, was to impose on him
                        a task for which by character, as by past achievement; be was eminently and
                        absolutely, unfitted."</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="bold">Sudan Evacuation.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>It has always been a debatable question whether Mr. Gladstone's Government
                        were right in refusing to be carried away by the national l'amour for
                        revenge of Gordon and immediate reconquest of the Sudan. The Government had
                        always and in all circumstances declared their intention to evacuate the
                        Sudan, and in this decision Sir Auckland Colvin seems to think they were
                        right:</p>
                    <p>"Troubles were thickening on our Indian frontier, and it seemed very possible
                        that towards the clone of 1885 we should be drawn<cb n="2"/> into a war with
                        Russia. British troops could not be spared ; Egyptian troops unaided were
                        not equal to the task. Egypt herself was in a condition little removed from
                        bankruptcy, and could not devote a piastre to military operations. Her need
                        of rest and recuperation was urgent. In the face of much opposition, and in
                        spite of violent attacks, the Government decided that Egypt should evacuate,
                        though not necessarily abandon, the Sudan. Subsequent events have proved the
                        wisdom of a decision which was received at the time with very considerable
                        disfavour."</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="bold">French and English.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>Sir Auckland draws an amusing contrast between the dispositions of the French
                        and English officials in Egypt:</p>
                    <p>"Keen of wit, incisive of tongue, choleric of disposition, sensitive as
                        children, kindly as women, the Frenchman was the very opposite of the
                        phlegmatic, imperturbable Briton, whom he lagged along with him in his
                        heated course."</p>
                    <p>
                        <hi rend="bold">The Sudan Reconquest.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>There are a great many people even in Egypt who regard the reconquest of the
                        Sudan by Lord Kitchener as at least one brilliant achievement for which the
                        British War Office may take some credit. Sir Auckland Colvin completely

                    <head>KAISER AS PATRON OF ISLAM.</head>
                    <p>In a speech delivered in the German Reichstag last week, Herr Bebel, the
                        leader of the Social Democrats, said that the Emperor aspired to be regarded
                        as the patron of the Mohammedan religion and the guardian of Moslems
                        throughout the world. The Emperor's journey to Constantinople, Jerusalem,
                        and Morocco were undertaken to produce this impression among Moslems.</p>
                    <p>The whole Mohamedan world, declared Herr Bebel, believed that the Emperor
                        bore the banner of Islam. The Clerical Deputy Herr Bisberger, confirming
                        Herr Bebel's assertions, declared that Mohamedanism was the official State
                        religion in German East Africa, where the natives regarded the Emperor as
                        the supreme chief of Islam.</p>

                    <head>EGYPT AND BURTON.</head>
                    <p>There is a very interesting passage bearing on Egypt in Mr. Thomaw Wright's
                        new life of Sir Richard Burton, and in the following anecdote, Mr. Wright
                        tells us that indirectly the present state of Egypt is owing to Burton :</p>
                    <p>On Oct. 28 ( 88 ) the Bortons went down to HarfieId, where there was a large
                        party, but Lord Salisbury devoted himself chiefly to Burton. After they had
                        discussed the Eastern Question, Lord Salisbury said to Burton, "Now go to
                        your room where you will be quiet, and draw up a complete programme for
                        Egypt."</p>
                    <p>Burton retired, but in two or three minutes returned with a paper which he
                        handed to Lord Salisbury.</p>
                    <p>"You've soon done it," said his lordship and on folding the paper he found
                        the single word "annex."</p>
                    <p>"If I were to write for a month," commented Burton, on noticing Lord
                        Salisbury's disappointment, "I could not say more."</p>
                    <p>However, being further pressed, he elaborated his very simple programme. The
                        policy he advocated was a wise and humane one. and had it been instantly
                        adopted, untold trouble for us, and much oppression of the miserable
                        natives, would have been avoided. Since then we have practically followed
                        his recommendations, and the present prosperous state of Egypt is the
                        result.</p>

                    <p>London, March 14.</p>
                    <p>Captain Mannton E. T. Gunthorpe, Alexandra, Princess of Wales's Own Yorkshire
                        Regiment, has been selected for service with the Khedive's Army, and joins
                        at Cairo. Captain Gunthorpe got his first commission in the "Green Howards"
                        in December, 1896, his company in June, 1904. and he was with the 1st
                        Battalion in the most of its fighting and trekking in South Africa. In the
                        first part of he war he was attached to the 2nd Battalion Royal Irish
                        Rifles, including the operations at Stormberg, and subsequently he joined
                        the "Green Howards" at De Aar, and was with them in the advance towards
                        Kimberley, he action of Paardeberg, where he was slightly wounded ; actions
                        of Vet River, Zand River, Johannesburg, Pretoria, Diamond Hill, the
                        operations oust and west of Pretoria ; and the operations in Cape Colony and
                        the Transvaal generally down to the close of the war. In the last year of
                        the campaign he was adjutant and transport officer to the battalion (Queen's
                        medal with five claspe, King's medal with two clasps, mentioned in
                        despatches).</p>
                    <p>Captain E. W. S. Mahon, Royal Engineers, who from duty at Pembroke Dock has
                        been specially attached to the Egyptian Army for survey duty, had
                        considerable experience with the China Field Force during the Boxer campaign
                        of 1900,when he was employed as a special service officer. It is just twelve
                        years since he got his first commission in the gallant sappers.</p>
                    <p>On the 24 h. inst the battleship Illustrious will be commissioned at Chatham
                        by Captain R. H. Johnson Stewart, with a nucleus crew preparatory to service
                        with the Channel Fleet, in which she relieves the battleship Albion. The
                        Illustrious was last employed on the Mediterranean Station and since her
                        return from there the sum of £70,000 was spent in refitting her. It may be
                        remembered that Capt in Johnson Stewart was in command of the Naisd, erg ged
                        in the blockade of the Somali coast in the operation against the Mad Mullah,
                        when his brother, Captain Johnson Stewart, was killed in action.</p>
                    <p>The battleship Queen, which made such good shooting last year, has been
                        ordered home from the Mediterranean next month, and will be re-commissioned
                        at Devonport for another term of service in the same waters.</p>
                    <p>It has been notified that the position of the wagons of the 15-ponder
                        batteries R.F.A., in action, will be on the left of the gun.</p>

                        business at 8. New square, Wigan, is a typical woman of business. But her
                        responsibilities were the cause of a trying crisis, from which only Dr
                        Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People succeeded in reasoning her. "About four
                        years ago said Mrs. Dawber, "long hours of hard work and constant attention
                        to business so undermined my health that without warning I collapsed, and
                        became a nervous wreck, unable to do anything.</p>
                    <p>"I was in a very low state of health, and consulted a medical man, who
                        pronounced my trouble to be general debility and nervous collapse. My face
                        was deathly pale, and I was in a most distressingly bloodless state,
                        exhausted by any exertion. Anemia developed and I lost appetite entirely.
                        All food was bitter to my ralate; even milk caused indigestion. Life was
                        unbearable ; I could not rest night or day. Nothing seemed to afford me any
                        relief, and I was in despair.</p>
                    <p>One day I became interested in a book about cares efforted by Dr. Williams'
                        Pink Pills for Pale People I, bought a box and after taking a few pills,
                        that I was feeling better. My appetite returned: I felt blood tingling in my
                        veins, and I was not easily fatigued.</p>
                    <ab>"In a few weeks Dr. Williams' Pink Pills and built up my strength that I was
                        at business again-strong, healthy, and high-spirited. I never felt better in
                        my life than I do now. Not once since I took Dr. Williams' Pink Pills have I
                        looked back."</ab>
                    <p>For general breakdown of the nervous system Dr. Williams' Pink Pills are
                        invaluable, for they feed the nerves while purifying and adding to the blood

                    <p>Notre marché des valeurs a présenté ce matin les mêmes caractéristiques
                        qu'hier : calme, très peu d'affaires et, conséquence naturelle, léger
                        tassement des cours sur quelques valeurs.</p>

                        On a fait courir le bruit que la Société a vendu ses terrains de Gizeh ;
                        l'information n'est pas exacte, mais elle pourrait bien ne pas tarder à le
                        devenir. Les Ciments ont fléchi à 86; la part de dividende à 32. Les

                        ajoute que plus de la moitié de la somme (an million et quart) est déjà

                    <p>On s'attend à un mouvement sur l'Anglo American Line. Les achats qui se
                        pratiquent discrètement depuis quelques jours doivent, assurément, être
                        attribués au fait que la Société est sur le point de conclure la vente de
                        ses tarrains de Boulic aux conditions les plus brillantes.</p>
                    <p>Oa annonce d'Alexandrie qne le conseil d'administration de la Société des

                        d'omnibus automobiles dans les principales rues de la ville. Ces automobiles
                        contingent et relieront les lignes de tramways.</p>
                    <p>C'est à cette décision que serait dû le mouvement de hausse qui s'est produit
                        récemment sur les Privilégiées et les Dividendes. Ou soppe que ce nouveau
                        service est appelé à augmenter considérablement les recettes de la
                        Compagnie.</p>

                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                        January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so warm as
                        Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm
                        than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in
                        the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest
                        place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                        sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on each of
                        the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="3"/>
                    <p>They are as follows:-</p>
                    <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southhampton,
                        London or Liverpool—occupy about 4 days. The short ones are as follows:—</p>

                    <p>The steamers, of the P.&amp;O. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageriea
                        Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines are
                        also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by travellers to
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made without change
                        in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp;O.
                        Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna
                        express from Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis" to Brindisi. One of these leaves port
                        Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian <cb n="6"
                        />mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                    <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                        attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats" having
                        been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi.
                        If you are going straight through to England you will find the train waiting
                        at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete
                        arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in
                        London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <head>SICILY.</head>
                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMENA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is the
                        station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful,
                        occupying about one hour. In and around the town is much to interest the
                        visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but restored under the Romans.
                        CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of Etna and here also is a fine
                        Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all over
                        the island, are an endless sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting
                        history, having been a Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C.
                        413, and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb
                        is to be seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                        about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                        delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The
                        Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S.
                        Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral,
                        Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also worth a
                        visit.</p>

                    <head>CENTRAL ITALY.</head>
                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                        bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento
                        [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                        City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence itself the churches
                        and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local promenades and
                        excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and
                        fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea
                        level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero,
                        thence by cog-wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks
                        takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; hero there is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                        and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                        house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                        and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                    <head>NORTHERN ITALY</head>
                    <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                        the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and deliciously cool
                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                        SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal springs,
                        change trains at Borgo San Donino and in half-an-hour you are at
                        Salsomaggiore.</p>

                    <head>NORTHERN ITALY (Continued) and The ITALIAN LAKES.</head>
                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea port.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                        lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza :</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo, Cadenabbia,
                        and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio opposite. The walk
                        from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio is most enjoyable. A
                        steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake Lugano in three-quarters
                        of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                    <p>LUGANO is some 20 miles from Como and reached by train in one-and-a-half
                        hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated on
                        the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San

                    <p>LOCARNO, may be reached by rail from Bellinzona in forty minutes. This pretty

                        excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated above the
                        town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings, "Entombment,"
                        by Ciseri, and 'Tho Flight into Egypt," by Bramantion.</p>

                        Pilatus, Burgenstock and Sonnenberg needing a special visit each. Other
                        excursions on the lake can be made by steamer, and the ever-changing scenery
                        on the trip from Lucerne, to Fluelen is a source of delight to the lover of
                        nature.</p>
                    <p>BRUNNEN, charmingly situated on the most beautiful part of the Lake of

                        Railway, with delightful scenery en route. The ascent of Titlis, is made
                        from here, and the panoramic view of the Alps is grand; extending from Monte
                        Rosa to the Black Forest, and from the Santis to the Matterhorn.</p>
