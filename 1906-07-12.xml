                    <head>Ill-Placed Sympathy</head>
                    <p>A Zulu living in Edinburgh has been delighted by a letter from Mr. Keir
                        Hardie. In that etter Mr. Hardie expresses a tender sympathy with the native
                        rebels with whom his country men are engaged in a small but necessary war.
                        He express a hope that the day will speedily come when the Zulus will be
                        able to defend themselves against the barbarities perpetrated on them by
                        hypocritical whites, who regard the black man as having been created in
                        order that they might exploit him for their own advantage." Incidentally he

                    <head>Ill placed sympathy continued</head>
                    <p>remarks : ‘ The terrible event which happened in the Soudan (sic) the other
                        day, with its attendant brutalities, reduces the administration of that
                        country under British rule to the level of that of the Congo Free State,
                        while the wholesale massacre of natives which is now going on in South
                        Africa, under the pretext of suppressing a rebellion which does not exist,
                        fills one with shame and horror.” </p>
                    <p>The Zulu living in Edinburgh, who probably believes in his own nation and
                        retains some sentiment of patriotism, mast have been astonished to read each
                        sentences, says the "Evening Standard and St. James’s Gazette.” He does not
                        know that Mr. Keir Hardie belongs to a clique which invariably ranges itself
                        on the side of the enemies of England, and does all it can to harm the
                        country to which it owes its birth and its bread. We who do know Mr. Keir
                        Hardie and his friends have reached a stage at which we cannot be surprised
                        by their sayings and doings. It is imcpossible to argue with them, or we
                        might point oat a few facts which prevent the administration of England in
                        Egypt being compared with that of King Leopold on the Congo, and might also
                        question Mr. Hardie s implication that the rebellion in South Africa has
                        been only supposed to exist in order that British soldiers may enjoy the
                        slaughter of Zulus. No, we cannot argue with them The utmost we can attempt
                        is the suggestion to Hr. Keir Hardie of a course of action which, with his
                        high-flown humanitarianism, he should be eager to accept It is simplicity
                        itself. There is a Zulu in Edinburgh educating himself, we believe, in
                        accordance with Scottish ideals. Why should not there be a Scotsman in South
                        Africa educating himself in Colonial necessities ? </p>
                    <p>What we propose is that Mr. Keir Har'ie should emigrate to South Africa and
                        settle, if only for a time, within the circle of our present military
                        operations. To make the scheme complete it will be necessary for Mr. Hardie
                        to tike his wife and children with him. Otherwise he would not be able to
                        enter into the feelings of the South African colonist. </p>
                    <p>Imagine Mr. Hardie, blessed by the Pro- Zulus of well-guarded London, far
                        from his comfortable home and the sturdy sons of Labour who retain their
                        faith in his statesmanlike qualities, domiciled on the veldt He goes out in
                        the morning to earn a living by the sweat of his brow, not by declamations
                        against capital and military force. As he set forth knowing that the natives
                        have a knack of descending like wolves on the fold, he discovers that
                        firearms have their uses. He thinks with regret of the policemen in
                        Palace-yard and of the two stalwart Life Guards doing nothing in Whitehall;
                        he wonders whether his home will be as he left it when he returns. His home
                        is liable to be burnt; his children to be slain; his wife to be subjected to
                        outrage. There is no help far or near. The authorities, let us suppose, have
                        taken his advice. They have refrained from killing natives. No more money is
                        being spent on punitive forces. Each Colonist is left to defend himself and
                        his beloved possessions. We should like to hear Mr.Hardie’s observations in
                        such circumstances. Would his humanitarianism uphold him ? Would he remain a
                        lover of his brother Zulu ? Would he continue to believe that the black
                        peril is a myth of the Colonist’s fancy? </p>
                    <p>It is so easy, so pitifully easy, for Mr. Keir Hardie and all Pro-Boers and
                        Pro-Zulus and Pro-any-enemies-of-their country to write fiery letters and
                        deliver fiery speeches, and then go to bed in the blissful knowledge that if
                        some naughty little boy raps their door without cause they will be able to
                        fetch a policeman from round the corner. They are the first people to howl
                        if they are struck, bat so long as their own skins are safe there is no
                        ending to their denomination of the brother Englishman who hits out in
                        self-defense. Illogical, crazy, selfish, small-minded, distorted creatures
                        they are properly considered, the real dregs of the people. If one and all
                        they took op their camps and deposited themselves in some desert place—South
                        Africa or elsewhere—their country would be the purer and better for the
                        riddance, while the spot whereon they settled would soon be no worse : the
                        native inhabitants would see to that. </p>
                    <p>Our indignation is not roused by the few who, honestly believing that
                        such-and-such a war or campaign is unjust, fight against it while it is bat
                        imminent, and when it is certain drop their voices and say no more. Unjust
                        wire there have been—unjust wars there will be so long as fallible man
                        remains on the earth. Let ns try to prevent them to the utmost of our power.
                        Bat, when once they have been undertaken, let us, in the name of humanity as
                        well as national pride and virtue, abstain from encouraging the foe. </p>
                    <p>In this case there is no injustice. If Mr. Keir Hardie sees injustice where
                        none exists, that is the fan It of his intelligence rather than of his
                        heart. But his abuse of England, his encouragement and glorification of
                        criminal Egyptians and Zulus a thirst for blood, are aberrations of
                        character which cat him off from the society of all patriotic, of all right
                        minded Englishmen. </p>

                    <p>The Plague.No farther cases of bobonic plague are reported in any part of the
                        country. A patient at Samalout was yesterday discharged as cared. </p>
                    <p>Public Health Department. Doctor H. Ross has been appointed sanitary
                        inspector at a salary of £E. 50 per month. His pay will be charged to the
                        credit opened for combating the plague. Dr. Ross will have his headquarters
                        in Cairo. </p>
                    <p>Murderer Sentenced. The Native Court of Alexandria has sentenced Sai 1
                        Maragia, a Bedouin of Mariout, to imprisonment with hard labour for life,
                        for murdering another Bedouin of that village on the 19th May last. The
                        murderer, however, is still at large. </p>
                    <p>Ashrafl Syndicate, Ltd. This syndicate was registered on 23rd Jane with a
                        capital of £10,003, in £1 share. Objects : To acquire, deal with, and turn
                        to account any petroleum or oil-bearing lands in Egypt or elsewhere, and to
                        adopt an agreement with W. Barrier. No initial public issue. </p>
                    <p>Hashish Smuggling. The coast guards have confiscated 1,400 kilos of hashish
                        on the Red Sea coast. The Ministry of the Interior has received information
                        to the effect that the coast guards have confiscated 14 camels laden with
                        1,042 kilos of hashish at Ghahat El Youha, near Suez. </p>
                    <p>Cotton In Palestine. The British vice-consul at Jaffa laments that all the
                        efforts made by a Liverpool firm to promote the cultivation of cotton in
                        Palestine have been fruitless, even though labour costs bat a shilling per
                        day and land is one tenth the price of Egyptian land. The chief cause of the
                        failure is said by the consul to be the incapacity and laziness of the
                        natives. </p>

                        destitute Moorish pilgrims who were at that town, left by a sailing craft
                        for Suakin and have arrived there in a pitiable condition. The quarantine
                        agent at Suakin telegraphed the news to the Quarantine Board at Alexandria,
                        which has ordered the pilgrims to be placed under observation for ten days
                        and requested the Egyptian Government to provide them with victuals and with
                        the means for their return home. </p>
                    <p>Cattle Plague. Daring the week ended July 8, fifteen cases of cattle plague
                        were notified in Egypt, nine of which occurred is the province of Minieh and
                        six in Ghirgeh. According to the weekly official bulletin whioh is published
                        by the Public Health Department, one of these cases occurred at Rayayna and
                        two at Sawalem, both if the Tahta district, and one in the town of Tahta, of
                        Ghirgeh province. In Minieh five oases were notified at Fait and four at
                        Eoleab, both in the Pashn district. </p>
                    <p>Automobiles In the Desert The United States Consul-General, Mr. L. M.
                        Iddings, reporting from Cairo, says that the prospect of the use of
                        automobiles are better. Motors can at present be used only in and about
                        Alexandria and Cairo, but the desert offers almost natural roads, and it is
                        estimated that it will cost only from five to ten dollars per mile to make
                        them perfect. The experiment has succeeded so far, and police inspection
                        formerly made on camels, and taking six weeks for each trip, can new he made
                        in two weeks. </p>

                    <head>THE SITUATION IN EGYPT. </head>
                    <head>SIRE.GREY’S IMPORTANT STATEMENT </head>
                    <head>FULL TEXT OF SPEECH. (From our Corresponded.) </head>
                    <p>House of Commons, London, July 6. By old Parliamentary bands yesterday will
                        be remembered as an important day—in fact, one of the most important since
                        the present Government came into office. It is quite possible, however, that
                        those who have only recently joined the ranks at Westminster did not attach
                        a great deal of importance to the calm, temperate, and telling appeal made
                        by Sir Edward Grey, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, but, judging by the
                        articles which have appeared this morning in the daily papers all of which
                        are unanimous in their approval of Sir Edward Grey’s firm attitude in very
                        trying circumstances, it must now be patent to all the world that the
                        present Government have every intention of supporting the authorities in
                        Egypt in their conduct of the unfortunate out break at Denishwai. </p>
                    <p>In the earlier part of the evening the Foreign Minister was by himself on the
                        Treasury Bench, evidently auspicious of the tactics of the Irish
                        irreconcilables and their friends, who were desirous of embarrassing the
                        Government over this episode. Lord Cromer had been for sometime an onlooker
                        from the Peers’ Gallery. Sir Edward Grey, seeing that the right moment had
                        arrived, commenced his statement. The word went round the precincts of the
                        House that the Foreign Minister was “talking,” when there was at once a
                        general entrance of members to hear what he had to say. He spoke with
                        intense gravity, earnestness, and slowness, and said :— </p>
                    <p>I rise now, not because I wish to reply on the Congo debate at present, bat
                        in order to make a short statement and an appeal to the House on a subject
                        which has been touched on by Sir C. Dilke, and which is, if the House will
                        only realise it, the most serious subject yet touched upon this evening—I
                        mean the question of the present position in Egypt. Sir . Dilke spoke of the
                        immense harm done by the first impression given by the report of the way in
                        which those sentences on Egyptian natives were carried oat. I understood the
                        House, when the sentences were first announced, to accept my statement that
                        the tribunal had been the highest possible, and its character Bach as to
                        guarantee that the trial had been fair. But that was followed by an account
                        in the Press of the way in which the sentences were carried out. I am
                        perfectly well aware of the painful impression produced by that account. U
                        gave rise to two impressions, perhaps to three. Oon impression was that in
                        executing the sentences the men who were to be hanged were compelled to look
                        on while the protracted, so that it lasted for a period of | three hours. I
                        am told the third impression was that the population had been compelled to
                        attend and witness the executions. When I read that account in the Press, I
                        made up my mind at once that, with a short account like that, the only fair
                        and sensible thing to do was to say and think nothing until a fall report of
                        the whole circumstances had been ed the sentences being carried out on the
                        others. They were kept apart, in separate tents, and special pains were
                        taken to prevent this. In the next place, the sentences were carried on
                        circumstances of the case. The executions did not hour. In the third place,
                        no one not on duty was compelled in the newspapers. (Cheers.) I wonld ask
                        the Home to believe that when the Court which pronounced these sentences
                        directed that they were to be carried out on the scene of the outrage, there
                        fell to those on whom the duty rested of carrying oat the decree of the
                        Court a serious and most painful duty, which had to be performed under
                        considerable difficulties, and I ask the House to believe, as I believe,
                        from information I have received, that it was carried out hi a way which did
                        not lay anyone concerned open to the charge of being callous or even
                        thoughtless. (Cheers). I have promised fall papers. Short telegraphic
                        reports are all I have received so far, and I would ask the House to
                        remember that in a matter of this importance to embark on a discussion
                        before you have a fall report of the circumstances is certain to lead to
                        things being said which when you get the full facts you will realise have
                        not been fair to those concerned. (Hear, hear.) Already some unfairness has
                        been done by the way in which Captain Macheh’s name has been brought into
                        the matter, which I have done my best to repair in the reply I made to a
                        question this afternoon as to Captain Maohell’s known character. But sorely
                        it has been recognised for some time that of ail the English officials who
                        are employed in the service of the Empire there are none of higher standing
                        than those in Egypt, because of the great capacity shown by Lord Cromer and
                        his great care in selecting men of ability, character, and fairness
                        (Cheers.) Therefore, on the ground of mere fairness, I would ask the House
                        not to embark on a debate </p>

                    <head>continued</head>
                    <p>of this subject until they have more papers. (Hear, hear.) Bat that is not
                        the more serious ground, All this year fanatical feeling in Egypt has been
                        on the increase. It has not been confined to Egypt, bat has spread along the
                        north of Africa. It was for that reason that a little time ago the garrison
                        had to be increased. The attack on the British officers recently is
                        something which would never have occurred only a little time ago, and would
                        not have occurred now bat for the fanatical feeling which has spread in
                        Egypt during this year. Since that attack took place, and even before the
                        trial of those condemned, one or two disagreeable and significant attacks
                        bad been made upon, I think, British subjects, or, at any rate, Europeans,
                        by natives. We may be on the eve of further measures necessary to protect
                        Europeans in Egypt, and for the House of Commons to question the decision of
                        a tribunal composed of the highest English and Egyptian judge is Egypt, is
                        bound to have the effect of weakening the authority of the Egyptian
                        Government. (Cheers.) As things are now, I say deliberately and with a fall
                        sense of responsibility, that if the House of Commons does anything at this
                        moment to weaken or destroy the authority of the Government as it exists in
                        Egypt you will be face to face with a very serious situation, because if the
                        fanatical feeling in Egypt gets the better of the constituted authority of
                        the Egyptian Government yon are then face to face with the necessity for
                        extreme measures. The work done by Lord Cromer has been widely recognised.
                        If you compare Egypt to-day with the Egypt of twenty-five years ago, I doubt
                        whether in any generation yon will find the lot of the common people
                        improved so much as that of the Egyptian people. (Cheers). 1 know very well
                        that the House is not going to allow the work to be swept away by a rush of
                        fanatical passion. (Cheers.) I have promised fall papers, not because I
                        doubt the fairness of the trial, but because when a wrong impression has
                        once got afoot the only chance of removing it is to publish the fullest
                        possible information. I know the House is determined not to allow the work
                        done in Egypt to be undone, bat if we say anything in debate now to weaken
                        the authority of the Egyptian Government, they may find themselves at any
                        moment forced to take other measures—unconstitutional measures, which we are
                        bound to take in an emergency, bat which no one would regret more than the
                        present Government and the present House of Commons, though they might be
                        compelled to do so. (Cheers.) </p>
                    <p>At the end of his statement cheers of approval rose from all parts of the
                        House, save from the few irreconcilable?. The impression created by his
                        remarks was excellent, and when members left at the close of the debate they
                        went away feeling that' the Government was behind the authorities in Egypt,
                        and determined to support them in their intention to suppress any lawless
                        outbreaks in Egypt. </p>
                    <p>Earl Percy expressed satisfaction at the full statement which the Foreign
                        Secretary had made and thought the House might have every confidence in
                        leaving the matter to the judgement and discretion of Lord Cromer. </p>
                    <p>Despite Sir E. Grey's appeal, Mr. Dillon indulged in a violent attack upon
                        the existing regime in <placeName>Egypt</placeName></p>

                    <head>FANATICISM IN EGYPT. IS IT EXISTENT ? AN ARTICLE BY MUSTAPHA KAMEL- </head>
                    <p>Paris July 11</p>
                    <p>The “Figaro” publishes a long article by Mustapha Pasha Kamel attacking the
                        methods of the English and asserting that Mussulman fanaticism does not
                        exist in Egypt. (Havas)</p>
                    <p>A correspondent writes :—I am interested, and indeed amused, by the attempts
                        of the Nationalist Press to disprove all the accusations of fanaticism that
                        have recently been levelled at the Egyptian Moslems. Personally, while not
                        much alarmed by the violent language used by “Al Omma” during the Turkish
                        crisis, or by the exaggerated dread of a Pan-Islamic outbreak, I have kept
                        my eyes and ears open daring the last few months with results that I can
                        only qualify as surprising. The amount of anti-European talk that has been
                        going on in cafes, in the streets, in the Arab dancing halls, wherever, in
                        fact, large numbers of town Moslems congregate, would drive into hysterical
                        terror those good people who forget that the unkind proverb “El Masri yekhaf
                        wa ma yikhtishish,” first uttered by some Cairene Solomon, is in many cases
                        almost literally true.</p>
                    <p>Now the fact that Moslem history is a history of war between Moslem and non-
                        Moslem, and that the teaching of the Koran is essentially military, must be
                        taken into account in considering the present state of affairs. The majority
                        of lower-class Moslems is totally uneducated, except for a more or less
                        imperfect knowledge of the Koran. Non- Moslems, therefore, who are resident
                        in Moslem countries are always inclined, and with reason, to suspect that a
                        feeling of resentment against any European or Lon-Moslem nation may develop
                        into what Sir Edward Grey describes as a wave of fanaticism, directed not
                        against one non-Moslem community but against all. </p>
                    <p>The majority of educated Moslems in India, Turkey, and Egypt are of course
                        averse to religions war. The Indian doctors of religion, in answer to
                        appeals made to them in 1870-71 as to what were the necessary conditions of
                        a religions war, replied that the whole matter hinged upon the question
                        whether India was Dar ul Harb (the land of war) or Darb ul Islam. The great
                        majority of doctors decided that the absence of protection and liberty to
                        Mussulmans is essential in a Jehad, and that the Mussulmans of India, being
                        protected by the State and having fall liberty to practise their religion
                        and to make converts, dwelt in Dar ul Islam, or at least in Dar nl Amam (the
                        land of peace). If these conditions applied to India in 1870 71, how much
                        more do they apply to Egypt in 1906 ? </p>
                    <p>Is it too much, then, to ask the Ulema and religious leaders of Egypt to give
                        their opinion on this matter? By so doing they would cut the ground from
                        under the feet of few malcontents and intriguers who are trying to excite
                        the ignorant against the British Occupation, which, I may say, has followed
                        the British policy of tolerance towards the members of a somewhat intolerant
                        creed. In Egypt there has of coarse been no interference whatever with the
                        predominant creed, and in the Sudan the missionary is forbidden in large
                        areas inhabited by Moslem Arabs and negroes. </p>
                    <p>Islam has moved with the times. The opinions formerly held by members of
                        “heretical” sects, Druses. Babis, etc., are making way among educated
                        Mohamedans in Egypt and to a greater extent in Turkey. I need only instance
                        the movement on behalf of female education and the gradual disappearance of
                        polygamy. Jehad was in former days aggressive—it is now, in theory at least,
                        &amp; defensive measure only to be used as a last resort, against an
                        oppressive non Moslem Government. It is therefore to be hoped that with the
                        advance of education in Egypt the anti-Christian feeling which still shows
                        itself—e. g. in the reference to a dead “infidel” as. “the damned”—will
                        disappear. Meantime nothing is to be gained by ignoring its existence on the
                        one band or by displaying an exaggerated apprehension on the other. In my
                        opinion the present unrest will subside without farther incident, to the
                        great satisfaction of the vast majority of law-abiding Moslems and
                        non-Moslems who compose the Egyptian people. </p>

                    <head>ATTACK ON ENGLISHMAN- TRIAL AT CHIBIN-EL KOM. A LENIENT SENTENCE. </head>
                    <p>(From our Correspondent.) Chibin-el-Kom, Tuesday. To-day, before Hassan Bey
                        Nabih, at the Parquet, Mohamed Masr was accused of committing an assault on
                        Mr. Ashton, Inspector of Irrigation, at Esbet Omar Hashala on the 14th June.
                        The case for the prosecution was conducted by the Parquet. </p>
                    <p>Mr. Ashton’s evidence showed that on Jane 14, the day after the Denishwai
                        ontrage. while inspecting Quesna Canal accompanied by the sheikh el-esbet,
                        he approached three men to arrest them for working their sakiehs out of
                        rotation. The three men defied the inspector, threatening that if he
                        approached they would drown him in the canal. </p>
                    <p>Taking no notice of the threats, Mr. Ashton and the sheikh el-esbet advanced,
                        when Mob. Masr threw a brick which struck Mr. Ashton’s horse. Mr. Ashton
                        dismounted and approached the men. Masr then threw another brick, which
                        truck Mr. Ashton on the month, breaking one tooth and loosening others. </p>
                    <p>The sheikh el-esbet refused to assist Mr. Ashton, and refused to give the
                        name of the assailant, or his own name, or the name of the esbet, so Mr.
                        Ashton mounted his horse and galloped to the next village, where he reported
                        the case.</p>
                    <p>In his evidence given at the preliminary enquiry the sheik-el-esbet said he
                        was present and saw the assault, but to-day, at the trial, he denied seeing
                        anything at all of the assault. </p>
                    <p>Two other native witnesses at the preliminary enquiry said they saw the brick
                        being thrown by Moh. Masr, but at the trial to-day totally denied this. </p>
                    <p>After hearing the counsel for the defence, Hassan Bey Nabih sentenced the
                        prisoner four months’ hard labour. </p>
                    <p>Chibin-el-Kom, Thursday. I understand that the Parquet is dissatisfied with
                        the verdict in the Ashton case, and appealing against the sentence. </p>

                    <head>THEATRE ABBAS, CAIRO. THE GEISHA. </head>
                    <p>Cairo has eagerly awaited the advent of Lombardo’s theatrical company in the
                        hopes that one might at last discover a really enjoyable means of passing
                        these stifling summer evenings in genuine enjoyment. To judge from the doubt
                        of this company at the Theatre Abbas on Tuesday evening, oar hopes are at
                        last realised. To all theatre-going Britishers The Geisha is well known, and
                        is usually very well received when represented by a good company. The
                        English musical comedy of latter days has, unfortunately, most sadly, bat
                        there are a few productions of the last ten years to which one can listen
                        with pleasure and among these The Geisha may be reckoned. Today’s musical
                        comedy has become hut a succession of variety “tarns,1 almost entirely
                        unconnected by any plot, whereas the music to which the various items are
                        set is often only worthy of a barrel-organ. The Geisha, however, can boast
                        of a discernible plot, which, moreover, is well carried out, and its music,
                        though not of the highest order, is, nevertheless, pleasing. </p>
                    <p>Though several faults might be found with the representation of the Italian
                        company now performing in Cairo, it was on the whole excellent. Having
                        spoken of faults, let ns first of all mention them, but at the same time, we
                        must say that they were insufficient to spoil the general effect, to which
                        little exception could be taken, the orchestra was fairly well-balanced,
                        though perhaps the bass instruments were every now and then somewhat too
                        prominent, bat they were as a rule rather slow in “attack” and generally
                        dragged slightly. As Mimosa San Signorina Baldi failed to impart the
                        necessary “verve.” Except for a somewhat exaggerated tremelo, which was
                        noticeable in nearly all the principals, she sang excellently and, indeed,
                        she has an exceptionally clear and pleasing voice, but she made a not
                        inconsiderable mistake in giving so slow a rendering to all her songs. The
                        ohoras left much to be desired in their singing, the sopranos being often
                        distinctly harsh and almost discordant at times, while the tenors were very
                        feeble. Finally, and perhaps mainly, the representation was too much of a
                        parody of this popular English musical comedy and not a sufficiently literal
                        translation. </p>
                    <p>These were the principal faults which could be found and now we mast mete out
                        the considerable praise which is due to the company. With the exception of
                        the insufficiently representative costumes, no fault could be found with the
                        staging. The scenery was excellent, the manner in which the chorus per
                        formed was faultless, and the changing coloured lights gave a splendid
                        effect to the dancing. The principal parts were very well rendered,
                        especially those of Mimosa San by Signorina Baldi, Dick Cunninham by Signor
                        E. Saoohi, and Wun Hi by Signor E Urbano. As Lady Constance, Signor G.
                        Parole was rather too farcical. The only fault which could be found with
                        Signora C. Leoni as Molly Seamore was the occasional harshness of her low
                        notes; otherwise she sang well and acted her part admirably. As we said
                        before, several faults could be found with the details of the performance,
                        but the stage management minimised these and the general effect was most
                        successful. 8hould the company continue as they have begun we can readily
                        assert their exceptional qualifications for giving ns an acceptable
                        evening’s amusement—that is, for Cairo! </p>

                    <head>GREAT EXHIBITION FOR CAIRO. </head>
                    <p>A correspondent sends ns an interesting suggestion which at least deserves
                        consideration. He says:— </p>
                    <p>Most of the countries claiming attention in the world have followed the lead
                        given to England by the inauguration of the first Great Exhibition by the
                        Prince Consort, now so long ago that few of ns care to remember the date. </p>
                    <p>Since then we have seen show after show, world’s fairs, and mammoth
                        exhibitions. At first given with the idea of Blowing the industries of a
                        nation, this element has gradually in many snob exhibitions been
                        overshadowed by the attempts to entertain visitors by sights representative
                        of nation! life and character In this respect many Anglo-Egyptians are
                        familiar with the caricatures of Assouan villages and other sights supposed
                        to be familiar in Egypt. Occasionally, however, as in “Venice in London” and
                        later in “Austria in London,” Imre Kiralfry, the great entrepreneur of
                        exhibitions, has really given a first- class show. Bat these are at the best
                        merely to interest and entertain and have as their chief object the paying
                        of a dividend. The industrial exhibitions have generally, unless subsidised
                        and managed by a State Government, also been financially a success. </p>
                    <p>Would it not be possible, say in the season at Cairo in 1908 or even 1909, to
                        have a Great Exhibition representative of all that Egypt can show from her
                        ancient past to her picturesque present! Of course, Cairo is an exhibition
                        in itself. Bat would it not be possible in one space almost under the shadow
                        of the Pyramids to collect interesting exhibits from all parts of the world
                        of all that is modern in industrial development side by side with the
                        antiquities of Egypt, post and present? </p>
                    <p>The exhibition of horsemanship, to say nothing of camel racing by the
                        Bedonins, before the Prince of Wales, was only one of many instances which
                        could be cited to show that Egypt could provide special pageants and sports
                        of worldwide interest. As we are always having dinned into oar ears, East
                        meets West at Port Said, or ought to, but does it; perhaps the attractions
                        of Cairo, backed op by judicious worldwide advertising, the enterprise of
                        our tourist and hotel companies, and possibly the sympathy of the Government
                        might all combine in making succesful a great Oriental or other exhibition
                        in Cairo. </p>
                    <p>Come along yon Barnnms, Kiralfies, Liptons or anyone gifted with organizing
                        powers and better persuasive force against apathy, work op this idea or at
                        best marshal all the objections to it that ingenuity can devise.</p>

                    <head>THE COTTON MARKET Kearsley and Cunningham's Weekly Report </head>
                    <p>Liverpool, July 5. Egyptian Cotton is still neglected, the aotoa1 sales being
                        very small. Quotations are reduced 1/9d per lb, except tor Fine Brown, which
                        is lower. For Futures a moderate business has been done and the latest
                        values are delivery: — July 9.51d Oct. 9.9 Jan. 8.16 Aug. 9.88 Nov. 8.36
                        Sept. 9.27 Dec. 8.25</p>
                    <p>American Futures. The Market this week has again been dull and inanimate, and
                        the business has been of the most restricted character. In anticipation of
                        the Bureau report prices declined 5 @ 6 points, bat later, most of the
                        decline has been recovered, to-day’s closing values being 2 @ 3 points lower
                        for July, July/August, and August/September deliveries, and 1 point decline
                        to unchanged for the other positions, from those of last Thursday. The
                        Bureau report, estimating the condition at 83.3 against 84.6 last month, was
                        not quite up to expectation, bat as the weather since the 25th Jane, the
                        date at which it i3 compiled, has been very favourable, it has had very
                        little influence. The whole interest in the situation for the present is
                        concentrated a poo the weather map, and this is fully demonstrated by the
                        absence of all speculation, and the hand to month takings of spinners.
                        Everyone is waiting upon the weather reports:— </p>

                    <head> THE POWERS AND ABYSSINIA. REPORTED AGREEMENT. </head>
                    <p>The terms of an understanding relative to Abyssinia were (the "Standard’s”
                        Paris correspondent says) finally settled at last Wednesday’s meeting in
                        London between Sir Edward Grey, M. Cambon (the Frenoh Ambassador), and
                        Signor Tittoni, on behalf of Italy, subject, of course, to the approval of
                        the French and Italian Governments. A farther meeting was held on Friday to
                        approve the definite text of the agreement. The understanding follows the
                        main lines given in "The Standardon June 2G last. First of all, the
                        maintenance of the status quo in Abyssinia is guaranteed. The country has
                        been put as far outside the pale of political intrigue as possible, and it
                        will be difficult to make it the subject of an Algeciras Conference. At any
                        rate, there will be little chance of three signatory Powers falling out. In
                        order to define as Nearly as may be the status quo, the exact position of
                        Abyssinia to-day with regard to neighbouring Powers is set out in the
                        agreement by the inclusion in its schedule of all the agreements entered
                        into by those Powers with the Government of the Negus. Questions of
                        interpretation may arise, but the agreements themselves are ipso facto
                        accepted as valid. Equality of commercial [ rights of all nations is, of
                        course, recognised. </p>
                    <p>As to that part of the understanding which deals with the future (continues
                        the correspondent) and which endeavours to anticipate the occurrence of
                        possible untoward events, following the demise of a Sovereign or some other
                        internal crisis, I am informed that it was found impossible to lay down more
                        than the main lines of a common policy. The signatory Powers will consult
                        before taking measures to protect foreign interests, or the lives and
                        property of strangers placed in jeopardy, and any one of them will notify
                        the others of her intention to take individual action, in the event of
                        necessity for such a step arising. Finally, the railway difficulty has been
                        settled. The Ethiopian Railway Company’s concession, from Jibutil to
                        Addis-Abeba, is recognised. The company will remain French, but will be
                        reorganised, and one British and one Italian director will be added to the
                        board of direction. In this way it is considered that international
                        interests will be protected, under the farther agreement not to allow a
                        competing line to be constracted from the east coast. I say a competing
                        line, because Italy is left free to build a railway linking her Erythrian
                        colony with her Somaliland possessions, which may, if financial and
                        engineering difficulties ever permit its construction, have more than one
                        terminus on the east coast. The successful conclusion of this agreement
                        shows how groundless were the assertions made a few days ago, in a section
                        of the French Press, about the uncompromising attitude of Signor Tittoni. As
                        was stated in ‘‘The Standard there never has been any justification for
                        French criticism of Signor Tittoni’s actions, and real fear of the breakdown
                        of the negotiations, now happily terminated. </p>

                    <head>' MONEY AND SHARE MARKET (From our Financial Correspondent.)</head>
                    <p>London, July 6. The Money Market. The usual half-yearly movements of mon6y
                        due to the window-dressing called for by bankers’ balance-sheets, as well as
                        the dividend distribution, including about six millions in dividends on
                        Consols, has to some extent obscured the monetary position daring the last
                        few days, bat now the effect of these is clearing away, a very manifest easy
                        tone is supervening. Nor does it appear likely that anything will interfere
                        to prevent a continuance of easy money for several months to come. It is
                        true the Bank shows considerable withdrawals, notably by the public, no
                        doubt for holiday purposes, and that the reserve has been reduced in its
                        proportion to liabilities to 41 1/4 %, bat gold shipments to America, which
                        last week appeared to be imminent, have not taken place, and in view of the
                        large useless balance held by the Treasury of the United States, it is not
                        thought likely that any large amount will be exported without the Treasury
                        coming to the rescue of the markets in some form, as it certainly would not
                        pay the United States to create dearness of money in Europe, in view of the
                        fact that they have borrowed largely, and will want to repay their loans.
                        The floating supplies in Paris are being freely offered to bankers here, and
                        in view of the steady flow of gold from the mines it would appear that there
                        should be no scarcity, but rather a plethora, of money for some time. What
                        will be the requirements of gold in America in the Autumn is the question
                        bankers are asking themselves. It is known that the demand will be very
                        large, bat before that time the Fowler Bill may have become law, or some
                        other means found of making use of the Treasury snr pins, equivalent to
                        £70,000,000 sterling, now lying idle. Silver is in good demand, and although
                        India has a large stock, the good crops there will probably necessitate
                        purchases almost equal to tho.se of last year. </p>
                    <p>The Stock Markets. Russia and South Africa continue to be the bete noire of
                        the Stock Markets. This unhappy combination, which has given endless trouble
                        daring the past 18 months, is becoming an increasingly disturbing element in
                        the financial world, and there is promise of much more serious trouble
                        before a settlement in either case is effected. </p>
                    <p>Russia appears to be rapidly approaching the general upheaval, which has been
                        so long anticipated. As for South Africa, the condition of things there is
                        unsatisfactory in the extreme. The chief industry of the country has been
                        seriously crippled by the constant interference of the Government since they
                        came into office, following upon the disturbance caused by the war, and the
                        enormous depreciation in the value of the stocks of the mining concerns has
                        had an incalculably depressing effect upon investment business generally. In
                        view of the hostile attitude of his Majesty's Ministers from the first, it
                        is doubtfal if the latest announcement of Mr. Churchill that importations of
                        Chinese to the Rand are to cease in November will cause much alarm. </p>
                    <p>During the latter part of this week markets have shown a slightly improved
                        tone, the revival, as was the case last week, commencing on Wednesday, when
                        most sections showed welcome increases of business. Under this influence
                        prices sharply advanced, and although there was not a great amount of
                        activity yesterday, the tone remained firm. The rumour that the Russian
                        Cabinet was about to resign, and that in the re-constitution several
                        intelligential members of the Dama would be elected to office, served to
                        bring Russians, to an extent, out of the Slongh of Despond into which they
                        had fallen at the end of last week, and though there is no farther
                        information to hand that confirms or denies the rumour, the bonds have not
                        shown much relapse. Paris is now a better feature. The large banks have been
                        lending their assistance, with the result that the large quantities of
                        Russian and other stocks which have been floating about on the Bourse are
                        being absorbed. The outlook generally is, therefore, brighter. </p>
                    <p>CONSOLS</p>
                    <p>The gilt-edged market has been unsteady, and although at one time Consols
                        managed to go above 88, they fell back yesterday to 87J, They leave off
                        lower to-night at 87^. It may he mentioned that the Consols carry-over on
                        Monday showed a decline in the price during the account of 1, after
                        deducting the dividend. The script of the new Irish Land Loan is now quoted
                        discount. </p>
                    <p>Foreign Bonds. </p>
                    <p>In this section, Russians have not yet recovered from the heavy bear attack.
                        The tone has been less pessimistic, but the price rather lower than our last
                        quotation, though better than the closing figures last Saturday. The Fours
                        finish at 76, and the new loan 41 discount, after being 5 % discount on
                        Saturday. Japanese kept firm np to yesterday, when slight declines occurred
                        in two or three of the series. The first Fives are J up oi the week at 101},
                        after being 102, but the Fours are 2} down at 90}. </p>
                    <p>Home Ralls. </p>
                    <p>The terrible railway accident at Salisbury . on Sunday seriously affected
                        home railway stocks at the beginning of the week, the shares of the London
                        and 8oath Western falling 2} j points. A batch of highly gratifying traffic
                        returns to Complete the half year helped to r dispel the gloom, and the

                    <p>politan District, which lost }, put on from | to full point. Yesterday again
                        the tone was very firm, and farther advances were registered, North Westerns
                        gaining 3/4. Today, however, there has been some slight liquidation, and
                        prices close rather down. </p>
                    <p>The Midland Company head the list of traffics with a gain £28,000, due to the
                        holding of the Royal Agricultural Society’s show at Derby, and the London
                        and North Western have an increase of £20,000. The only decrease that of the
                        North London, amounting to £363, which comes on top of a loss of £349 in the
                        corresponding week last year. </p>
                    <p>Americans</p>
                    <p>After opening irregular owing to the look of support from Wall 8t. as the
                        result of increased money calls, the American railway market considerably
                        benefited by the more cheerful tone on Wednesday, and notwithstanding the
                        fact that New York was dosed in celebration of Independence Day, with the
                        consequent limitation of business, prices advanced appreciably, one or two
                        of the shares, which had been very depressed earlier, showing highly
                        satisfactory improvements. Thus, Chicago Milwaukee, which had lost 5 1/2,
                        put on 2 points, and Wabash "B” Debentures, after being 5 down, gained 2}
                        points. Yesterday the good tone was maintained, and several farther advances
                        occurred, there being declines in only three oases at the close. </p>
                    <p>Egyptians</p>
                    <p>The Egyptian market ba9 been a little more active lately, but with the
                        depression all round, especially in the Kaffir section, it is surprising
                        that these stocks hold their price so well. National Bank of Egypt, after
                        being 251/4 buyers, have reacted quickly to 25}, but Agricultural Banks
                        maintain their quotation of 91/2—3/4. Daira Sanieh are flat without any
                        support, the price of the Ordinary being 16}-} and the Deferred 95-99. Delta
                        Preference are unchanged at about 113/4, but Delta Land and Investment,
                        after being as low as 3}, are much better at 31/2 rather bid. Abyssinian
                        Banks are only discount and not a very good market, even at this price.

                        Egyptian 1}-}. Daira Sngar remain firm at 5, and Corporation of Western

                        and Soda are better at 1 }. Egyptian Estates are If-}, and the Deferred are

                    <p>Mining</p>
                    <p>In the South African market there has been farther heavy selling of Kaffirs,
                        and though this ceased for a time yesterday, it was resumed after the
                        statement made by the Undersecretary for the Colonies regarding Chinese
                        Labour became known. Rand Mines and East Rands declined }, Modderfontein

                    <p>Yesterday witnessed the prettiest racing that has been seen this season, 18
                        boats in all joining in the races. The much-abused handicap, which has been
                        strenuously adhered to by the committee in spite of all complaints, worked
                        out very well indeed, as will be seen by the above times, eight boats in
                        CUbs I crossing the finishing line well within four minutes, and the whole
                        of Class II. finishing also in approximately four minutes. The wind was
                        moderate from the N.W. and there was a typical summer breeze, similar to
                        those on which the handicaps have been based since last year, hence the
                        success of the same. </p>
