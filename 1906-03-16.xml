                    <head>CENSUS OF THE EMPIRE</head>
                    <p>The Blue Book issued last week dealing with the census of the British Empire
                        taken in 1901 provides a feast for those who can derive enjoyment from a
                        study of statistics, and even to the ordinary individual who hates to be
                        compelled to wade through a collection of fact I and figures it is
                        interesting to trace the remarkable development that has taken place in
                        Greater Britain during the past 40 years. The results of the census are
                        summarised in a long report by the Registrar General’s Department and the
                        President of the Local Government Board. From this it appears that at the
                        time of the census of 1861 the Empire comprised in round numbers eight and a
                        half millions of square miles. In the next two decennia no important
                        territorial additions took place, but between 1881 and 1891 the extensions
                        in the East Indies and in our Indian dependency and the great annexations of
                        territory in West, South East, and Central Africa added about two millions
                        of square miles. Since 1891 further expansions have occurred, principally in
                        Africa and in Asia, raising the total as nearly as can be ascertained to
                        11,908,378 square miles Thus, in the short space of forty years the
                        aggregate area of the British colonies, dependencies, and protectorates has
                        increased by about 40 per cent, and now amounts to more than one-fifth of
                        the land surface of the globe Of this huge territory somewhat more than four
                        millions of square miles are situated in the North, Central, and South
                        America, three millions in Australasia, two and a half millions in Africa,
                        and nearly two millions in the Indian Empire and other parts of Asia, while
                        the por­tion that lies in Europe constitutes a very inconsiderable fraction
                        of the whole, amounting to only 125,095 square miles, of which 121,089
                        constitute the area of the United Kingdom.</p>
                    <p>As far as can be ascertained the population of the British Empire in 1861,
                        inclusive of the Indian feudatory States, was about 259 millions. In 1871 it
                        had risen to nearly 283 millions, in 1881 to nearly 310 millions, in 1891
                        (largely through acquisition of territory) to more than 381 millions, and at
                        or about the date of the census of 1901 (exclusive of the population of
                        North-western Rhodesia, for which no estimate could be obtained) it had
                        reached a total of about 400 millions. For the whole Empire the aggregate
                        rate of increase of population showed a great decline in the last decennium,
                        and the report states that a large factor connected with the fall in the
                        increase of the population is the continued depression of the birth-rate,
                        which has now become general in nearly all countries. Excluding London, the
                        most populous city in the British Empire at the present time is Calcutta,
                        the population of which has grown from 10,000 or 12,000 in 1710 to nearly
                        843,000 in 1901. Bombay comes third with 776,000, and Glasgow fourth
                        761,000.</p>
                    <p>In the matter of religions, statistics are pre­sented regarding 319 millions,
                        or about four- fifths of the total population of the Empire, no returns of
                        religious belief being available for the remaining 79 millions of the
                        population. Of the 319 millions more than 20 millions, ex­clusive of the
                        population of Great Britain, were returned as professing one or another form
                        of the Christian religion, and over 295 millions were returned under
                        non-Christian religions, while the remainder, amounting to fewer than four
                        millions, were returned and classed as either having no religion or as
                        in­definitely expressed. If to these numbers are added the population of
                        Great Britain (37 millions), and a further half million as repre­senting the
                        Christians in the colonies where no religious census was taken, a total of
                        57 1/2 millions is arrived at as a rough estimate of the number of persons
                        in the Empire professing one form or other of the Christian religion.</p>

                    <head>THE STEAM ENGIME IN ANCIENT EGYPT</head>
                    <p>Mr. G. Gerald Stoney, lecturing last week at Carpenters’ Hall, London,on
                        "Steam Turbines,” said it was among the relics of ancient Egyp­tian
                        civilisation, 20 centuries ago, that the first records of the steam engine
                        were found. In Alexandria, the home of Euclid, Hero wrote his "Spiritalia
                        sen Pneumatica,” wherein he described two machines of special interest. The
                        one utilised the expansive force of air in a closed vessel, heated
                        externally, the pneumatic force being applied upon the surface of water in
                        other vessels, and the hydraulic force utilised for opening the doors of
                        Grecian temples, and working other pseudo-magic contrivances. The other was
                        a veritable steam turbine engine, such, in principle, as they were
                        discussing that night. It seemed doubtful whether this machine was ever more
                        than a toy, or whether it was used by- the Greek priests for producing
                        motion of apparatus in their temples. But from the experience of the last 20
                        years, it appeared that with some improvement in design and construction it
                        could have been applied to perform useful work, and might have claimed a
                        place among steam engines even up to the middle of the last century.</p>
                    <p>Only twenty years had elapsed since the Hon. C. A. Parsons brought out his
                        compound steam turbine, and already there were at work and on order about
                        2,000,000 h.p. Practically the whole of the great power distribution schemes
                        in the north-east of England were worked with steam turbines, but probably
                        the most important field of usefulness for turbine engines lay in the
                        propulsion of ships. Com­parisons between vessels propelled respectively by
                        reciprocating and turbine engines showed an economy of coal of from 15 to 20
                        percent. in favour of the latter, and already there were on the Atlantic
                        three great liners fitted with turbine engines. What might be the motive
                        power of the future it was difficult to say. At present only 12 per cent, of
                        the energy of the coal used in the very best steam engines was converted
                        into work. One way to get over that difficulty would be to form a battery,
                        using coal instead of zinc, and so to convert its ener­gy directly into
                        electricity. Who could Bay that was impossible 1 What would our
                        great-­grandfathers have thought of the "Flying Scotchman,” the wonders of
                        the telephone, and the gramophone, and the motor car ?</p>

                    <p>NOTES ET CRITIQUES</p>
                    <p>Le Caire, 10 mars.</p>
                    <p>A Londres, le Consolidé anglais a hanssé hier de 1/8 à 90 7/8 et TUnifiée de
                        1/1 à 105 1/2. La National Bank et l’Agrioole sont restées invariées à 27
                        5/8 et 10 1/*. LaDsïra Sanieh a baissé de 1/8 à 17 3/4.</p>
                    <p>A Paris, l’aotion Crédit Foncier Egyptien</p>
                    <p>est renseignée en reprise de 2 francs à 7 94 et</p>
                    <p>la Banque d’Athènes de 1 franc à 145.</p>
                    <p>*</p>
                    <p>* *</p>
                    <p>Notre marohé des valenrs a été, ce matin encore, très aotif et très ferme sur
                        plusieurs valeurs.</p>
                    <p>La National Bank, toujonrs inert9, est restée à ses prix d’hier. Plus animée,
                        l’Agri oole s’est insorite à 10 1,16 l’action ancienne, et 9 5/8 la
                        nouvelle. La Cassa di Soonto a haussé de 210 à 216. L’aotion Crédit Foncier
                        a progressé à 791 et l’obligation à lots 1836 à 342.</p>
                    <p>L’aotion Immobilière a avancé à 392 ; la part de fondateur à f59. La part de
                        fondateur Agrioole du Nil est montée à 7 1/2.</p>
                    <p>La part de fondateur Enterprise and Deve­lopment est revenue à 17 1/2. La
                        part de fondateur Land Allotment a atteint 177 pour olôturer à 168.</p>
                    <p>L’aotion Société d’Entreprise3 Immobilières et Travaux s'est maintenue à 4
                        1/2 ; on ne tardera pas certainement à voir des oours plus élevés. La part
                        de fondateur a atteint jusqu’à L. E. 19 1/2 pour olôturer à 18. On sait
                        qu’il avait été déoidé, dès la constitution de la Société, de subdiviser
                        ohaque part de fonda­teur en 25 couperas. Les nouveaux titres seront mis en
                        oiroulation dans deux mois.</p>
                    <p>L’aotion Brasserie des Pyramides est montée à 133 ; la part de dividende à
                        79. Un mouve ment de hausse sérieux semble se dessiner sur oe titre ; on
                        affirme que la Société est en train de conolnre la vente de ses terrains à
                        des prix extrêmement avantageux.</p>
                    <p>Les Omnibus du Caire sont à 27 aohetenra.</p>
                    <p>Dans le groupe des Hôtels, il y a eu des transactions très importantes sur
                        les National, qui ont atteint 4 5/8. Le public commence à s’intéresser à oe
                        titre, dont la hausse parait devoir s’aooentuer rapidement. Les acheteurs
                        sont sérieux</p>
                    <p>Parmi les petites valeurs, fort mo ivement de hausse—que nous avions prévu
                        depuis longtemps—sur les Cotton Mills ; on a clô­turé à 8 sb. 6. Les Oasis
                        ont également avancé à 1 5/8. Les Sait and Soda restent à 24 sh. 6. Les
                        Estâtes ont fait 2 3/16 ; la part de fondateur a enoore gagné £ 1 1/2 à 12
                        5/8. Les Egyptian Constructions sont revenues à 1 11/16.</p>
                    <p>*</p>
                    <p>* *</p>
                    <p>Il y a lieu de s’attendre Bur les Agricoles du Nil à un mouvement de hausse,
                        qui serait d’ailleurs justifié par les brillantes opérations faites par la
                        Société. Une seule d’entre elles a, paralt-il, donné un bénéfice de 11,000
                        livres.</p>
                    <p>Il ne faut pas, d'antre part, perdre de vue le revenu rapporté par le beau
                        domaine acquis Tan passé. Bien que oonsigné au milieu de l’année,
                        l’exploitation agrioole de oes terrains</p>
                    <p>donne déjà un profit “net” de 4 à 5 pour cent.</p>
                    <p>*</p>
                    <p>* *</p>
                    <p>On assure que l’émission publique de la Gairo Heliopolis Metropolitan
                        Eleotrio Rail- way Co. (Oasis du désert de l’Abbassieh), aurait lieu dans le
                        coarant du mois pTochaiD.</p>
                    <p>La oapital social, s’élevant à 15,&lt;"03,000 de franos, est représenté par
                        60,000 aotions de 210 francs chacune, entièrement souscrites par les
                        fondateurs.</p>
                    <p>La proportion qui serait offerte au public serait de 20 %, soit 12,000
                        aotions.</p>
                    <p>La souscription serait ouverte simultané­ment an Caire, à Bruxelles et à
                        Paris.</p>
                    <p>*</p>
                    <p>* *</p>
                    <p>Diverses rumeurs sont en oiroulation au sujet de la hausse qui vient de se
                        produire sur les aotions de la Western Egypt Corporation (Oasis). Le bruit a
                        couru hier en Bourse, au Caire et à Alexandrie, qu’une mine de houille avait
                        été découverte sur les lieux.</p>
                    <p>Ce qui est certain, o’est que la Sooiété a organisé une expédition chargée
                        d’explorer l’oasis Maluk, qui passe pour être très intéres­sante au point de
                        vue minéralogique. Cette expédition se mettra en route dans un dizaine de
                        jours.</p>
