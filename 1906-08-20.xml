                <p>HANDS OFF EGYPT!</p>
                <p>
                    To-morrow (says the “Pall Mall Gazette” of Tuesday last) his Majesty the King is to meet the German Emperor, and it is no secret that important affairs of State will occupy the attention of the two Sovereigns. First and foremost, as we must suppose, there will be the consideration of what steps it may be possible to take to assist the Tsar and the Russian Imperial family in the event of contingencies which are, at least, within the bounds of possibility. Then, presumably, they will exchange views upon the whole situation in Russia ; and, lastly, upon the somewhat delicate subject of the relations between their own respective countries. In that last con¬nection it is instructive to note that the German Press has made, as yet, absolutely no response whatever to those overtures of friend¬ship which have been so lavishly poured out in England during the past few months. On the 
                    contrary, the welcome—if such we may call it — extended to the British Sovereign by a Press of which the representatives were hospitably, and even enthusiastically, entertained at Windsor a few weeks ago, comes as near to positive rudeness as the circumstances permit. Of that, however, we do not com¬plain in the least : contrariwise, we prefer it, not only because it may possibly have some effect in diminishing the volume of the cataract of soapy sentimentality which will probably overflow a certain portion of our own Press during the next few days, but also because sincerity is preferable to insincerity, and, in the present instance, may tend to awaken a good many people (who badly want awakening) to the truth about the relations, present and future, between England and Germany. What, then, is it that the German Government is looking for from this meeting of the monarchs? If we may believe the “National Zeitung,” which is hardly likely to speak without know- ledge on such an occasion, while the Russian situation supplies the chief reason for the meeting, there is another. England, we are told, desires to regulate the affairs of Egypt as soon as possible, and to make the proposed settle¬ment seem plausible in the eyes of Germany. Again, as we learn from the Berlin correspon¬dent of the “Times,” the “Deutsche Revue” discusses the Egyptian “question” from the German standpoint, and proposes that Egypt should be treated “as an object of common interest to England and Germany, and that its future should be decided between the two Powers on the basis of compensating values.” In short, in this find in other matters the two nations must effect settlements “upon a footing of confiding reciprocity.”
                </p>
                <p>It is, no doubt, a little difficult to keep one’s temper in the face of the unabashed impudence of the German assumption that there is still an “Egyptian question” which requires “settlement” with Germany or, for that matter, any other Power. Nevertheless, let us draw upon the materia medica of our philosophy for a stiff dose of patience, and try to understand what our German friends are driving at. The “Deutsche Revue” is, it must be admitted, delightfully frank. It seeks to use Lord Cromer’s proposal of certain chan¬ges which would affect the status of foreigners in Egypt as a means of extorting British consent to give Germany a free hand on the shore of the Persian Gulf in the matter of the terminus of the Baghdad Railway. “For England to persist in her policy of transform¬ing the Persian Gulf into a mare clausum Britannicum would be to throw down the gauntlet, and her persistence would com¬pel us to meet British wishes with the same measure.” In other words, Germany threatens that she will treat Egypt as she has treated Morocco, and will try to obtain “compensation for the abandonment of her rights.” Now, that is a policy which no British Government can possibly tolerate. Germany’s legitimate in-terests in the Nile Valley, which are purely commercial, are infinitesimally small, and unless she had interests there as great as those of France, with all the tradition of historical relations such as those of France with Egypt behind her, we could not consent to treat Egypt as “an object of common interest be¬tween England and Germany.’’ There is no such “common interest,” and the German assertion that there is can only he regarded as an impudent attempt to levy blackmail. The rights of all foreigners, Germans with the rest, will be as scrupulously safeguarded in the future as in the past; but Egypt is, and must remain, to all intents and purposes, a British Protectorate. Whatever be the outcome of the Baghdad Railway question, it certainly not be settled by Germany’s offer to abandon “rights” in Egypt which she has never possessed. That is a consideration to be commended to the notice of those among our own people who are perpetually repeating that we have no grounds of difference with Germany. We have none; but ever since the success of the German veto upon the Anglo-French Agree¬ment in Morocco, Germany has evidently meditating the discovery of a ground of differ¬ence with us—and that ground is Egypt. In order to foment that difference, Germany has egged on the Turk to assert himself in the Pen¬insula of Sinai, as he is defying France (doubt¬less by-the same inspiration) in the hinterland f Tripoli. So long as Germany continues to play her game of blackmail, so long will it be impossible for us to arrive at that good understanding with her which all parties in England desire. Germany must be made to realise that Egypt is a piece in the game of chess which has been definitely swept off the board by Great Britain. Wherefore, to all such proposals as are suggested by the German Press there is only ore possible answer— Hands off Egypt 1”</p>

                    <p>The enquiry into the motor car accident which resulted in the death of a lady and injuries to Yessin Bey Mustapha, has shown that the motor car was being driven at too high a speed, and that the cart with which it collided carried no light Such, at least, was the evidence elicited from Gamila Saidla, a woman servant who was accompanying them. According to her, Dame Aisha Fadel was a close relative of the Moudir, and was a frequent caller at his house, and it was while returning to her own home that the accident took place.</p>

As regards the musical representation of the piece, there was not much fault to be found, but Mimosa San treated that pretty '‘Goldfish" song with great cruelty by singing it in such painfully slow time, and we cannot understand why the finest of all the songs, 'Star of my Soul,” should have been omitted. Despite these faults, however, the play went with an ex¬cellent swing, and Bignorine Baldi and Leoni, and Signori Urbano and Pirracini especially distinguished themselves in the principal characters of Mimosa San, Molly Seamore, Wun Hi, and Marquis Imaro, respectively.</p>

                    LONDON, August 20.
                    Prince Mohamed Ibrahim, whilst motoring between Bcrnay and Cormeilles, smashed violently into a train at the level crossing between Paris and Cherbourg at 7.30 o'clock on Saturday night Both the Prince and his chauffeur are dead. According to the evidence taken, the Prince's automobile was travelling at an excessive rate of speed.
                    PARIS, August 18.
                    An automobile conveying the Egyptian Prince Ibrahim Mohamed collided with a train near Bernay. The Prince has been seriously injured.

                    The automobile of Prince Mohamed Ibrahim (aged 38), cousin of H.H. the Khedive, ran into the engine of a train while crossing the Cherbourg road. It was entirely destroyed. The Prince’s condition is desperate. The chauffuer has already succumbed.	(Havas)

                    BERNAY, August 19.
                    Prince Mohamed Ibrahim succumbed after having undergone a trepanning operation. (H.)
                    [Bernay, where the catastrophe occurred, is on the main line to Cherbourg, between Evreux and Lisienx. It is a town of 7,966 inhabitants, and is the capital of the arrondissement of the Eure. The Chemin de Fer de l’Ouest passes through the town, and while crossing this railway line the Prince met with the accident.]
                    A private telegram from Cherbourg to the Daira received as we go to Press states that the Prince breathed his last at 9.30 o’clock yesterday evening. He was alone in his automobile with his chauffeur.
                    The Mayor of Cherbourg sent a telegram dated 4 p.m. yesterday to the Prince’s Daira at Alexandria to the effect that his High¬ness's condition was “tres grave.’’
                    Prince Mohamed Bey Ibrahim was the son of Prince Ibrahim Ahmed, tin cousin of the Khedive, and brother to H H. Prince Seif el Din, who is living in England. He was only 28 years of age, not 38, as stated in the Havas telegram. The Prince was married twice. Seven years ago he married Princess Fazilah, the daughter of Prince Osman Fazil. He had a son by the first wife who is now six years of age. After the death of Princess Fazilah, five years ago, his Highness married Prioress Salihab, daughter of Prince Ibrahim Hilmy, uncle of the Khedive, by whom be had two children, one a daughter who is now four years old, and the other a son, now two and a half years of age.
                    The Prince was the biggest landlord in the neighbourhood of Alexandria. The Alex¬andria Sporting Club’s grounds is on his pro¬perty, and he possessed a great deal of land in the city, including the large buildings in Mohamed Aly-. square where the offices of the Banco di Roma are situated. It is stated that the Prince was offered lately L.E. 2,200,000 for his estates in Alexandria and Cairo, but refused, as he wanted £3.000,000.
                    Prince Mohamed and his wife and children left Alexandria last month for France and took up their residence in the Prince's Parisian mansion in rae Callipert. His Highness was an ardent motorist and had already met with a terrible accident in Cairo the season before last, on the Pyramids road, when two European ladies who were with him, Mrs. Schrager and Mrs. Vuronoff, were also seriously injured.</p>

The telegraph line to Port Sudan being broken, the only means by which Bimbashi Lord could obtain assistance was by telegraphing to Atbara, which he did by 'tapping” a wire, and from there the message was transmitted to Cairo. From Cairo the officer's urgent summons was telegraphed to Suez, and thence to Port Sudan. In this round¬about way the unfortunate position of Bimbashi Lord was made known to his fellow-officers at Port Sudan, from where provisions and help were sent with the utmost rapidity.</p>

                    <head>RESCUED BY B. I. STEAMER,</head>
                    <head>(FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT).</head>
                    <p>Suez, Sunday.
                    The British India steamer Warora (Capt. A. E. Stebbing) arrived at Suez this morning from Bombay, having in tow the Turkish troopship Bars, which has on board 302 troops and 45 of a crew, from Hodeidah bound to Constan¬tinople.</p>
                    <p>The Warora sighted the Bars 17 miles south of Ras Garib, in the Gulf of Suez, at 8.30 am. on the 18th inst. She was in distress, her engines being disabled, and she was drifting towards the shore  ; in about half an hour’s time she would have been on the rooks and broken up.</p>
                    <p>The commander and troops of the Turkish transport were in terrible straits, and as they possessed no flags to signal with they were seen desperately waving and crying out for assistance, their only distress signal being the ship’s ensign halfmasted. The Warora, at great risk, owing to the heavy sea and strong wind, and also her close proxi¬mity to the land, approached the Bars and by mean of rockets threw lines to her. Finally she managed to get hold of the trans-port and tow her to Suez safely, after first getting the tow hawser parted, and the maneuvers had to repeated with greater risk owing to the ship drifting rapidly closer and closer to the shore.</p>
                    <p>The plan of passing ropes from one vessel to another in a heavy sea, where there is great danger attending the lowering of boats, has apparently never been attempted before, and is entirely an idea of Captain Stebbing, to whom, as well as to the officers, great credit must be given for saving the lives of so many people, who would have very likely perish¬ed were it not for the prompt assistance rendered.</p>

                    <head>THE CAPITULATIONS.</head>
                    <head>THEIR ORIGIN.</head>
                    <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE."
                    Sir,—A common error, shared largely by the European colonies in the Ottoman dominions, is that the Capitulations were granted only to subjects of foreign Powers. This is not so. Originally, the scope of the Capitulations comprised all non Musaulmans, resident in Turkey. If we accept the verdict of history these Capitulations were first granted, not by the Turkish Sultans, but by the Greek Emperors, to the foreign colonies within their realm, such as the Genoese, the Pisans, and the Venetians. After the Fall of Constantinople, Mahomed II., desirous of reconciling the Greeks for the loss of their political liberties, by allowing them a certain measure of their previous communal privileges, ratified the Capitulations which the Greek Lords of Byzantium had conferred upon the Latin colonies, and by a wise and masterly stroke of policy, the effects of which have lasted to this day, extended and fair proportion of those benefits to his new nor.-Mussulman subjects, chief amongst which of course at that time were the Orthodox Greeks ; and these benefits were, inter alia, that they should be governed by their own municipal laws, have their own Patriarchal Court and Justinian Code, be free of military service—in tact enjoy just as much self-government as do the foreign Colonies now with the exception of those penal and civil matters which were ultra vires of the Patriarchal Court. Moreover, the ground- work of these original Byzantine Capitulations has served as the basis of all subsequent treaties between the Ottoman Porte and Christian Princes.</p>
                    
                    
                    <p>An interesting and conclusive relict of this state of things is the fact that the Consul of a European Power is even to-day described in official documents, such as the exequatur, as the “Bayle,” a title borrowed from that which the head of the Genoese or Venetian colony held under the Lower Empire, and which he continued to hold under the Turks.</p>
                    <p>It was this "authority and immemorial prestige” to which I referred in my letter to you of August 4 as bound to suffer by the abolition of the Capitulations, not so much from juridicial privilege as from political status, of which more anon.</p>
                    <p>Greek Orthodoxy, therefore, in common with the several other communities, Christian and Hebrew, subject to, and resident within the dominions of the Sublime Ottoman Ports, have in greater or less degrees privileges just as valid as those of the colonies of foreign Powers. In the case of the Greek community these privileges are accentuated by the fact that the Orthodox Greek Church is the Christian State religion in Turkey. The (Ecumenical Patriarch is officially just as much the head of the Greek nation as is the Sultan the Caliph of the Mohamedans, or the Pope Pontiff of the Holy Roman Empire. The Greek Church is styled the Great Church, and claims precedence in all State cere¬monies, the Patriarch being alone permitted to represent the other religions commu¬nities, and as conclusive proofs of his high rank, the Sultan rises upon the entry of his (Ecumenical Holiness ; a mark of respect which is not shown to the Grand Vizier. I might enumerate various other items of Patriarchal privileges, such as the military honours, but the fact of his spiritual equality with the Sultan will suffice.</p>
                    <p>I now come to the crux of the question. Strictly speaking, and according to prece¬dents which are indisputable, the abolition of the Capitulations in the form proposed by Lord Cromer is impossible.</p>
                    <p>Firstly, because that measure applies to a vilayet of the Ottoman Porte, and not to the whole system of the Empire; secondly, because to become effective it must require a special Irade of the Sultan; thirdly, because to conform to the spirit of impartiality with which it has been conceived, it must apply to all the non-Mussulman communities resident within this Ottoman vilayet.</p>
                    <p>The abolition of the Capitulatiols in the sense Lord Cromer has suggested by excluding the subject non Mussulman communities would render the status of those communities in Egypt null and void ; it would subject to the Egyptian authority, and not the Ottoman Porte, all those Christian and Jewish com¬munities whose supreme authority is at Constantinople.</p>
                    <p>Thus, were the abolition realised, the Greek Patriarch of Alexandria would discover himself severed from the (Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, and, to carry the point further, would require from the Khedive, and not the Sultan, that Irade for the journey which I mentioned in my letter.</p>
                    <p>To sum up, my contentions are that the status of these non Mussulman communities of Ottoman nationality in Egypt has been over-looked in Lord Cromer's scheme; that to be thorough, that abolition must include them as well; that the effect of that measure will make the status of the Patriarchate of Alex¬andria an anomaly, by rendering it independent of the (Ecumenical Patriarchate without pro¬vision for a readjustment of its relations with the local Egyptian authority; that a special Irade is necessary from H.I.M. the Sultan for the abolition of the Capitulations, which would then, to be effective, have to apply to the Empire at large.</p>
                    <p>Opposition to Lord Cromer, to which a correspondent objected, although it might exist, as I know it to do, could not very well be officially expressed by a subordinate of the (Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, who alone has the prerogative to voice the views of the Orthodox Greek Church and the Greek nation.</p>
                    <p>The only solution to the difficulty would be a form of Protectorate exercised in Egypt by one or other of the Powers subject to the spiritual authority of the Orthodox Patriarch, such as Russia or Greece, and similar to that which France wields in the Levant over the Oriental Latin communities, subject to Turkey. —Yours, etc.,	XENOS.

                    <p>Saturday’s Skye Meeting on the A. S. C. ground was uneventful and unexciting. There was a remarkably small attendance of the public, and few of the regular race-goers were to be seen in the enclosure, which bore a more or less deserted appearance The racing did not present any features of interest, the only close finish being afforded by the Bulkeley Plate. The betting, too, was not very animated, and on the whole the meeting met with but mediocre success. The afternoon was warm, but a cool breeze came from the sea. The band of the Royal Dublin Fusiliers helped to while away the time by a choice selection of music. The following is a description of the various events:—</p>
