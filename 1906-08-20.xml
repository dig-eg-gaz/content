                    <p> To-morrow (says the “Pall Mall Gazette” of Tuesday last) his Majesty the
                        King is to meet the German Emperor, and it is no secret that important
                        affairs of State will occupy the attention of the two Sovereigns. First and
                        foremost, as we must suppose, there will be the consideration of what steps
                        it may be possible to take to assist the Tsar and the Russian Imperial
                        family in the event of contingencies which are, at least, within the bounds
                        of possibility. Then, presumably, they will exchange views upon the whole
                        situation in Russia ; and, lastly, upon the somewhat delicate subject of the
                        relations between their own respective countries. In that last con¬nection
                        it is instructive to note that the German Press has made, as yet, absolutely
                        no response whatever to those overtures of friend¬ship which have been so
                        lavishly poured out in England during the past few months. On the contrary,
                        the welcome—if such we may call it — extended to the British Sovereign by a
                        Press of which the representatives were hospitably, and even
                        enthusiastically, entertained at Windsor a few weeks ago, comes as near to
                        positive rudeness as the circumstances permit. Of that, however, we do not
                        com¬plain in the least : contrariwise, we prefer it, not only because it may
                        possibly have some effect in diminishing the volume of the cataract of soapy
                        sentimentality which will probably overflow a certain portion of our own
                        Press during the next few days, but also because sincerity is preferable to
                        insincerity, and, in the present instance, may tend to awaken a good many
                        people (who badly want awakening) to the truth about the relations, present
                        and future, between England and Germany. What, then, is it that the German
                        Government is looking for from this meeting of the monarchs? If we may
                        believe the “National Zeitung,” which is hardly likely to speak without
                        know- ledge on such an occasion, while the Russian situation supplies the
                        chief reason for the meeting, there is another. England, we are told,
                        desires to regulate the affairs of Egypt as soon as possible, and to make
                        the proposed settle¬ment seem plausible in the eyes of Germany. Again, as we
                        learn from the Berlin correspon¬dent of the “Times,” the “Deutsche Revue”
                        discusses the Egyptian “question” from the German standpoint, and proposes
                        that Egypt should be treated “as an object of common interest to England and
                        Germany, and that its future should be decided between the two Powers on the
                        basis of compensating values.” In short, in this find in other matters the
                        two nations must effect settlements “upon a footing of confiding
                        reciprocity.” </p>
                    <p>It is, no doubt, a little difficult to keep one’s temper in the face of the
                        unabashed impudence of the German assumption that there is still an
                        “Egyptian question” which requires “settlement” with Germany or, for that
                        matter, any other Power. Nevertheless, let us draw upon the materia medica
                        of our philosophy for a stiff dose of patience, and try to understand what
                        our German friends are driving at. The “Deutsche Revue” is, it must be
                        admitted, delightfully frank. It seeks to use Lord Cromer’s proposal of
                        certain chan¬ges which would affect the status of foreigners in Egypt as a
                        means of extorting British consent to give Germany a free hand on the shore
                        of the Persian Gulf in the matter of the terminus of the Baghdad Railway.
                        “For England to persist in her policy of transform¬ing the Persian Gulf into
                        a mare clausum Britannicum would be to throw down the gauntlet, and her
                        persistence would com¬pel us to meet British wishes with the same measure.”
                        In other words, Germany threatens that she will treat Egypt as she has
                        treated Morocco, and will try to obtain “compensation for the abandonment of
                        her rights.” Now, that is a policy which no British Government can possibly
                        tolerate. Germany’s legitimate in-terests in the Nile Valley, which are
                        purely commercial, are infinitesimally small, and unless she had interests
                        there as great as those of France, with all the tradition of historical
                        relations such as those of France with Egypt behind her, we could not
                        consent to treat Egypt as “an object of common interest be¬tween England and
                        Germany.’’ There is no such “common interest,” and the German assertion that
                        there is can only he regarded as an impudent attempt to levy blackmail. The
                        rights of all foreigners, Germans with the rest, will be as scrupulously
                        safeguarded in the future as in the past; but Egypt is, and must remain, to
                        all intents and purposes, a British Protectorate. Whatever be the outcome of
                        the Baghdad Railway question, it certainly not be settled by Germany’s offer
                        to abandon “rights” in Egypt which she has never possessed. That is a
                        consideration to be commended to the notice of those among our own people
                        who are perpetually repeating that we have no grounds of difference with
                        Germany. We have none; but ever since the success of the German veto upon
                        the Anglo-French Agree¬ment in Morocco, Germany has evidently meditating the
                        discovery of a ground of differ¬ence with us—and that ground is Egypt. In
                        order to foment that difference, Germany has egged on the Turk to assert
                        himself in the Pen¬insula of Sinai, as he is defying France (doubt¬less
                        by-the same inspiration) in the hinterland f Tripoli. So long as Germany
                        continues to play her game of blackmail, so long will it be impossible for
                        us to arrive at that good understanding with her which all parties in
                        England desire. Germany must be made to realise that Egypt is a piece in the
                        game of chess which has been definitely swept off the board by Great
                        Britain. Wherefore, to all such proposals as are suggested by the German
                        Press there is only ore possible answer— Hands off Egypt !”</p>

                            evidently based on the fact that a re¬presentative of a French firm of

                            English play, and though the staging was certainly excellent, many of
                            the costumes were quite incomprehensible. To see the naval officers
                            appear in military uniform made one smile, but even greater merriment
                            was provoked by the sight of a sailor in kilts! As regards the musical
                            representation of the piece, there was not much fault to be found, but
                            Mimosa San treated that pretty '‘Goldfish" song with great cruelty by
                            singing it in such painfully slow time, and we cannot understand why the
                            finest of all the songs, 'Star of my Soul,” should have been omitted.
                            Despite these faults, however, the play went with an ex¬cellent swing,
                            and Bignorine Baldi and Leoni, and Signori Urbano and Pirracini
                            especially distinguished themselves in the principal characters of
                            Mimosa San, Molly Seamore, Wun Hi, and Marquis Imaro, respectively.</p>

                        <p> Prince Mohamed Ibrahim, whilst motoring between Bcrnay and Cormeilles,
                            smashed violently into a train at the level crossing between Paris and
                            Cherbourg at 7.30 o'clock on Saturday night Both the Prince and his
                            chauffeur are dead. According to the evidence taken, the Prince's

                        <p> Prince Mohamed Ibrahim succumbed after having undergone a trepanning
                            operation. (H.) </p>
                        <p> [Bernay, where the catastrophe occurred, is on the main line to
                            Cherbourg, between Evreux and Lisienx. It is a town of 7,966
                            inhabitants, and is the capital of the arrondissement of the Eure. The
                            Chemin de Fer de l’Ouest passes through the town, and while crossing
                            this railway line the Prince met with the accident.] </p>
                        <p> A private telegram from Cherbourg to the Daira received as we go to
                            Press states that the Prince breathed his last at 9.30 o’clock yesterday
                            evening. He was alone in his automobile with his chauffeur. </p>
                        <p> The Mayor of Cherbourg sent a telegram dated 4 p.m. yesterday to the
                            Prince’s Daira at Alexandria to the effect that his High¬ness's
                            condition was “tres grave.’’ </p>
                        <p> Prince Mohamed Bey Ibrahim was the son of Prince Ibrahim Ahmed, tin
                            cousin of the Khedive, and brother to H H. Prince Seif el Din, who is
                            living in England. He was only 28 years of age, not 38, as stated in the
                            Havas telegram. The Prince was married twice. Seven years ago he married
                            Princess Fazilah, the daughter of Prince Osman Fazil. He had a son by
                            the first wife who is now six years of age. After the death of Princess
                            Fazilah, five years ago, his Highness married Prioress Salihab, daughter
                            of Prince Ibrahim Hilmy, uncle of the Khedive, by whom be had two
                            children, one a daughter who is now four years old, and the other a son,
                            now two and a half years of age. </p>
                        <p> The Prince was the biggest landlord in the neighbourhood of Alexandria.
                            The Alex¬andria Sporting Club’s grounds is on his pro¬perty, and he
                            possessed a great deal of land in the city, including the large
                            buildings in Mohamed Aly-. square where the offices of the Banco di Roma
                            are situated. It is stated that the Prince was offered lately L.E.
                            2,200,000 for his estates in Alexandria and Cairo, but refused, as he
                            wanted £3.000,000. </p>
                        <p> Prince Mohamed and his wife and children left Alexandria last month for
                            France and took up their residence in the Prince's Parisian mansion in
                            rae Callipert. His Highness was an ardent motorist and had already met
                            with a terrible accident in Cairo the season before last, on the
                            Pyramids road, when two European ladies who were with him, Mrs. Schrager
                            and Mrs. Vuronoff, were also seriously injured.</p>

                        <head> THE EXISTENCE OF FANATICISM.</head>
                        <p>In a letter which we have received from a correspondent at Port Sudan we
                            are informed that ever since the commencement of the Akaba affair
                            considerable unrest has been evident among the Sudanese of that
                            district, and, our correspondent remarks, 'the existence of fanaticism
                            thereabouts cannot be denied.”</p>
                        <p>No uneasiness is said to exist among the English inhabitants, who realise
                            that any trouble which might be brewing would very soon be discovered
                            and that immediate steps would be taken to convince the natives of the
                            futility of any outbreak. The couple of hundred or so Greeks in Port
                            Sudan show, however, a most unreasonable fear of an outbreak, and scares
                            among them are frequent.</p>
                        <p>On our part, we are convinced that Colonel Drury, Governor of that
                            province, will be able to maintain perfect order, and we would advise
                            our Greek friends of Port Sudan to reassure themselves.</p>

                        <p> We learn from Port Sudan that Mr. Cross, an ex-soldier and foreman of
                            works at Port Sudan, died the week before last from heat apoplexy. On
                            the day following the burial it was found that the railings round the
                            unfortunate man's grave had been pulled down and that the grave had been
                            reopened. The body was found in the grave, apparently undisturbed, and
                            it is thought that some of the Sudanese from the adjacent village had
                            opened the grave in the hopes of finding booty.</p>

                        <p>Considerable inconvenience has been caused by the recent wash-outs which

                            greatly.</p>
                        <p>At the time of the first of these washouts, which we reported a short
                            while ago, Bimbashi Lord was up in the hills some eighty miles from Port
                            Sudan and suddenly found himself altogether cut off from the nearest
                            villages and without provisions. The telegraph line to Port Sudan being
                            broken, the only means by which Bimbashi Lord could obtain assistance
                            was by telegraphing to Atbara, which he did by 'tapping” a wire, and
                            from there the message was transmitted to Cairo. From Cairo the
                            officer's urgent summons was telegraphed to Suez, and thence to Port
                            Sudan. In this round¬about way the unfortunate position of Bimbashi Lord
                            was made known to his fellow-officers at Port Sudan, from where
                            provisions and help were sent with the utmost rapidity.</p>

                        <head>RESCUED BY B. I. STEAMER,</head>
                        <head>(FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT).</head>
                        <p>Suez, Sunday. </p>
                        <p> The British India steamer Warora (Capt. A. E. Stebbing) arrived at Suez
                            this morning from Bombay, having in tow the Turkish troopship Bars,
                            which has on board 302 troops and 45 of a crew, from Hodeidah bound to
                            Constan¬tinople.</p>
                        <p>The Warora sighted the Bars 17 miles south of Ras Garib, in the Gulf of
                            Suez, at 8.30 am. on the 18th inst. She was in distress, her engines
                            being disabled, and she was drifting towards the shore ; in about half
                            an hour’s time she would have been on the rooks and broken up.</p>
                        <p>The commander and troops of the Turkish transport were in terrible
                            straits, and as they possessed no flags to signal with they were seen
                            desperately waving and crying out for assistance, their only distress
                            signal being the ship’s ensign halfmasted. The Warora, at great risk,
                            owing to the heavy sea and strong wind, and also her close proxi¬mity to
                            the land, approached the Bars and by mean of rockets threw lines to her.
                            Finally she managed to get hold of the trans-port and tow her to Suez
                            safely, after first getting the tow hawser parted, and the maneuvers had
                            to repeated with greater risk owing to the ship drifting rapidly closer
                            and closer to the shore.</p>
                        <p>The plan of passing ropes from one vessel to another in a heavy sea,
                            where there is great danger attending the lowering of boats, has
                            apparently never been attempted before, and is entirely an idea of
                            Captain Stebbing, to whom, as well as to the officers, great credit must
                            be given for saving the lives of so many people, who would have very
                            likely perish¬ed were it not for the prompt assistance rendered.</p>

                        <head>THE CAPITULATIONS.</head>
                        <head>THEIR ORIGIN.</head>
                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE." </p>
                        <p> Sir,—A common error, shared largely by the European colonies in the
                            Ottoman dominions, is that the Capitulations were granted only to
                            subjects of foreign Powers. This is not so. Originally, the scope of the
                            Capitulations comprised all non Musaulmans, resident in Turkey. If we
                            accept the verdict of history these Capitulations were first granted,
                            not by the Turkish Sultans, but by the Greek Emperors, to the foreign
                            colonies within their realm, such as the Genoese, the Pisans, and the
                            Venetians. After the Fall of Constantinople, Mahomed II., desirous of
                            reconciling the Greeks for the loss of their political liberties, by
                            allowing them a certain measure of their previous communal privileges,
                            ratified the Capitulations which the Greek Lords of Byzantium had
                            conferred upon the Latin colonies, and by a wise and masterly stroke of
                            policy, the effects of which have lasted to this day, extended and fair
                            proportion of those benefits to his new nor.-Mussulman subjects, chief
                            amongst which of course at that time were the Orthodox Greeks ; and
                            these benefits were, inter alia, that they should be governed by their
                            own municipal laws, have their own Patriarchal Court and Justinian Code,
                            be free of military service—in tact enjoy just as much self-government
                            as do the foreign Colonies now with the exception of those penal and
                            civil matters which were ultra vires of the Patriarchal Court. Moreover,
                            the ground- work of these original Byzantine Capitulations has served as
                            the basis of all subsequent treaties between the Ottoman Porte and
                            Christian Princes.</p>


                        <p>An interesting and conclusive relict of this state of things is the fact
                            that the Consul of a European Power is even to-day described in official
                            documents, such as the exequatur, as the “Bayle,” a title borrowed from
                            that which the head of the Genoese or Venetian colony held under the
                            Lower Empire, and which he continued to hold under the Turks.</p>
                        <p>It was this "authority and immemorial prestige” to which I referred in my
                            letter to you of August 4 as bound to suffer by the abolition of the
                            Capitulations, not so much from juridicial privilege as from political
                            status, of which more anon.</p>
                        <p>Greek Orthodoxy, therefore, in common with the several other communities,
                            Christian and Hebrew, subject to, and resident within the dominions of
                            the Sublime Ottoman Ports, have in greater or less degrees privileges
                            just as valid as those of the colonies of foreign Powers. In the case of
                            the Greek community these privileges are accentuated by the fact that
                            the Orthodox Greek Church is the Christian State religion in Turkey. The
                            (Ecumenical Patriarch is officially just as much the head of the Greek
                            nation as is the Sultan the Caliph of the Mohamedans, or the Pope
                            Pontiff of the Holy Roman Empire. The Greek Church is styled the Great
                            Church, and claims precedence in all State cere¬monies, the Patriarch
                            being alone permitted to represent the other religions commu¬nities, and
                            as conclusive proofs of his high rank, the Sultan rises upon the entry
                            of his (Ecumenical Holiness ; a mark of respect which is not shown to
                            the Grand Vizier. I might enumerate various other items of Patriarchal
                            privileges, such as the military honours, but the fact of his spiritual
                            equality with the Sultan will suffice.</p>
                        <p>I now come to the crux of the question. Strictly speaking, and according
                            to prece¬dents which are indisputable, the abolition of the
                            Capitulations in the form proposed by Lord Cromer is impossible.</p>
                        <p>Firstly, because that measure applies to a vilayet of the Ottoman Porte,
                            and not to the whole system of the Empire; secondly, because to become
                            effective it must require a special Irade of the Sultan; thirdly,
                            because to conform to the spirit of impartiality with which it has been
                            conceived, it must apply to all the non-Mussulman communities resident
                            within this Ottoman vilayet.</p>
                        <p>The abolition of the Capitulatiols in the sense Lord Cromer has suggested
                            by excluding the subject non Mussulman communities would render the
                            status of those communities in Egypt null and void ; it would subject to
                            the Egyptian authority, and not the Ottoman Porte, all those Christian
                            and Jewish com¬munities whose supreme authority is at
                            Constantinople.</p>
                        <p>Thus, were the abolition realised, the Greek Patriarch of Alexandria
                            would discover himself severed from the (Ecumenical Patriarchate of
                            Constantinople, and, to carry the point further, would require from the
                            Khedive, and not the Sultan, that Irade for the journey which I
                            mentioned in my letter.</p>
                        <p>To sum up, my contentions are that the status of these non Mussulman
                            communities of Ottoman nationality in Egypt has been over-looked in Lord
                            Cromer's scheme; that to be thorough, that abolition must include them
                            as well; that the effect of that measure will make the status of the
                            Patriarchate of Alex¬andria an anomaly, by rendering it independent of
                            the (Ecumenical Patriarchate without pro¬vision for a readjustment of
                            its relations with the local Egyptian authority; that a special Irade is
                            necessary from H.I.M. the Sultan for the abolition of the Capitulations,
                            which would then, to be effective, have to apply to the Empire at
                            large.</p>
                        <p>Opposition to Lord Cromer, to which a correspondent objected, although it
                            might exist, as I know it to do, could not very well be officially
                            expressed by a subordinate of the (Ecumenical Patriarchate of
                            Constantinople, who alone has the prerogative to voice the views of the
                            Orthodox Greek Church and the Greek nation.</p>
                        <p>The only solution to the difficulty would be a form of Protectorate
                            exercised in Egypt by one or other of the Powers subject to the
                            spiritual authority of the Orthodox Patriarch, such as Russia or Greece,
                            and similar to that which France wields in the Levant over the Oriental
                            Latin communities, subject to Turkey. —Yours, etc., XENOS. </p>

                        <head>AUGUST SKYE MEETING.</head>
                        <p>Saturday’s Skye Meeting on the A. S. C. ground was uneventful and
                            unexciting. There was a remarkably small attendance of the public, and
                            few of the regular race-goers were to be seen in the enclosure, which
                            bore a more or less deserted appearance The racing did not present any
                            features of interest, the only close finish being afforded by the
                            Bulkeley Plate. The betting, too, was not very animated, and on the
                            whole the meeting met with but mediocre success. The afternoon was warm,
                            but a cool breeze came from the sea. The band of the Royal Dublin
                            Fusiliers helped to while away the time by a choice selection of music.

                            them seemed to wish to make the pace it was taken up by Fadghan, who was
                            closely followed by Kordofan. Fadghan, on entering the straight, had a
                            lead of three lengths, and never once being challenged won comfortably
                            by a couple of lengths from India, Nigri just losing second place by
                            half a length. Time : 1.52.</p>

                            Mortality</head>

                        <p>LONDON, August 18.</p>
                        <p> The seriousness of the Valparaiso earthquake is apparent from the
                            records of the seismo¬graphs in the Isles of Wight, Vancouver, and
                            elsewhere, which showed prolonged shocks lasting for 5 hours. The tides
                            at Honolulu have been affected. The disturbance of the cable causes a
                            lack of details, but the stories of loss of life which are current at
                            New York are considered to be exaggerated. It is believed that the
                            country north of Valparaiso has suffered more especially. (Reuter.)</p>

                        <p>NEW YORK, August 18.</p>
                        <p> The telegrams received here represent the condition of Valparaiso as
                            terrible. Earthquake shocks began at 8 o’olock on Thursday evening. Many
                            houses collapsed and fires broke out. Many persons were killed or
                            injured. The business section has been almost entirely destroyed. A
                            large part of the fires have been unchecked owing to the panic and
                            gene-ai disorder. The shipping is undamaged. Belated messages from
                            Santiago (Chili) state that many houses have collapsed. The earthquake
                            was the severest known. The streets are filled with terrified people.

                        <p>PARIS, August 18.</p>
                        <p> The damage done by the earthquake at Santiago and Valparaiso is
                            enormous. {Havas)</p>

                        <p> NEW YORK, August 19.</p>
                        <p> According to the news received from Santiago on 18th inst., the
                            earthquake extended over a zone of two degrees. Many public and private
                            buildings have been greatly damaged. The losses are estimated at about
                            2,000,000 dollars. The mortality at Santiago is estimated roughly at
                            about 30 and at Valparaiso at about 500 persons. Firemen from Santiago
                            have gone to Valparaiso to quell the widespread fires. The villages of
                            Quillota, Melipilla, San Antonio, and Llillai are in mins. Many persons
                            have been killed or injured at Talca, Rengo, and San Fernando. Until the
                            telegraphs have been fully restored the extent of the disaster will be
                            uncertain. (Reuter)</p>

                        <p> A remarkable article in the "Norddeutsche Zeitung" describes the meeting
                            at Kronberg as another stage on the road to the improvement of the
                            relations existing between the peoples and governments and rulers of
                            Great Britain and Germany. It states that serious political questions
                            were broached during the free and friendly conversations at Kronberg.
                            The jour¬nal adds: "We knew that this was done in the desire to farther
                            consolidate European peace." (Reuter.)</p>

                        circumstances each incident may be easily dealt with. More¬over, it is far
                        from the desire of the sagacious ruler of Turkey to see the forces of Islam
                        in array against those of Christianity. Relatively unimportant, however, as
                        may be the unrest in Islam at the present time, it is likely to increase in
                        intensity, and possibly occasion trouble later on, unless some change he
                        brought about in the attitude of the Western world towards Turkey and its
                        ruler, and more parti¬cularly in England. It should not be forgotten that we
                        have more Mahomedan countries under our sway than any other Power, and
                        therefore such trouble, if it arose, would be more likely to come our way
                        than to move in the direction of other non- Mussulman people. Too little
                        heed has been paid in England to the spread of education among Mahomedans
                        and the publication of news through the medium of the native Press.
                        Incidents are made known far and wide and commented upon, and it should
                        surprise no one to find that exception is being taken to the constant
                        encroachment made upon Ma¬homedan rights and to the treatment that the
                        Sultan has met with at the hands of a large section of the British Press. It
                        has, unfor¬tunately, become a practice to speak slighting-ly of him on all
                        occasions ; at times the Turks and their Sovereign are spoken of in language
                        that might be much more fittingly applied to Russians and their Tsar. </p>
                    <p>Caliph and Defender of the Faith,</p>
                    <p>No one who has been privileged to witness the weekly ceremony of the
                        “Selamlik" during j the period of the "Haj" or pilgrimage to Mecca, can have
                        failed to note the variety of worshippers at the mosque attended by the
                        Sultan. For several weeks strangely-garbed Orientals of every hue and cast
                        of feature come trooping into Constantinople on their way to the Holy
                        Cities. Their ONE object in view in passing through the city of the Sultan
                        is to see the Caliph. Wandering about, they see the well-armed Turkish
                        soldiers in their thousands, and the war vessels with their great gnus lying
                        in the Golden Horn. As they pass through the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles
                        they also note the frowning bat¬teries and forts that guard the approaches
                        to his capital, and proceed onward greatly im¬pressed with the majesty and
                        power of their religious chief. Far and wide is spread the re¬nown of the
                        great Caliph, as they talk over the sights they have seen at Constantino¬ple
                        with their less favoured co-religionists, who have had to take another
                        route, when they meet at the Holy Cities, and to their owa people on their
                        return to their homes. Revered as the Caliph is by so many millions of
                        Mahomedans, is it strange that insult and ridicule in his direction should
                        be felt and resented ?</p>
                    <p>The Advance of Islam</p>
                    <p>AS time moves onward, ‘Islam’ a religions force is bound to increase in
                        strength. It is making vast strides in Africa, and in the opi¬nion of those
                        most competent to judge in the matter, will be the religion of that
                        Continent. In addition to this, there will probably bemany converts made in
                        Japan and a large addition to these already in China. If ever Pan-Islasism
                        were to become a great disturbing force in the Empire it will be due to
                        ourselves, to the un¬generous treatment the Sultan has received at our
                        hands, and to the conviction being driven home to the mind of the Mahomedans
                        that England is no longer their friend. With such an overwhelming number of
                        Mussulmans under British rule, would it not bewail to cultivate better
                        relations with the Sultan, more especially with the German Emperor ever
                        seeking opportunities to pose as the friend of the Mahomedan Great mistrust,
                        and rightfully so, is felt in England of his intentions ; but it is a great
                        mistake to imagine that Turkey and the Sultan are entirely in his hands.
                        Commercial advantages are obtained by Germany to our detriment because the
                        Sultan is human, and the Emperor never fails to remind him on all occasions
                        of his friendship and affection. Friendly vints are of frequent occurrence.
                        The Einperor has been twice the guestof the Sultan, and not a year passes
                        without one or two members of the family passing through Constantinople.</p>
                    <p>If our alliance with Japan (a non-Christian Power, let it be observed) has
                        enabled us to dispense with a large portion of our naval force previously
                        maintained in the Far East, what would not an alliance with Turkey do for us
                        in the way of adding to our military resources for defence The Germans know
                        this well, and therefore Teutonic intri¬gue is ever at work, and we are
                        forced by it into a false position, and made to appear as if working for the
                        destruction of Mahomedan rights, whereas in reality the Turks have no such
                        well-wishers as we are.</p>
                    <p>Injustice to Turkey.</p>
                    <p>The Turks unfortunately can point to many instances of the gross injustice
                        with which they are treated. It was never intended by the authors of the
                        Berlin Treaty that a Bul¬garia should be created, to become a menace to the
                        peace of Europe. Yet we have seen how, year by year, she has steadily
                        increased her army, without one word of remonstrance on the part of the
                        Powers, and, in face of the commanding position she has assumed in the
                        Balkans, the desire has been manifested in certain quarters to limit the
                        forces of the Sultan, and to restrict their action.</p>
                    <p>The Turks have seen their kinsmen driven out of Bulgaria and Eastern Roumelia
                        as the fruit of Christian administration, and the same process will commence
                        in Crete, unless the Powers remain firm in their attitude, and loyally
                        maintain the guarantees for the protec¬tion of the Mahomedan inhabitants of
                        that island. Naturally, it is the desire of the Sultan and the Turks to
                        restrict as much as possible foreign interference in Macedonia, seeing in it
                        the danger of its development into autonomy, always so fatal to their
                        interests.</p>
                    <p>It is the fashion with many English writers in the Press to speak of the
                        neglect of British interests by our diplomatic representatives, and of the
                        ill-will shown by the Porte. Yet it would not be difficult to show that many
                        ques¬tions have been satisfactorily settled through the agency of our
                        Embassy at Constantinople, more particularly by the present Ambassador.</p>
                    <p>All this is ignored by those who, while airing their jealousy of Germany,
                        will make no effort to win the goodwill of the ruler of Turkey, just as it
                        is forgotten how honestly he set to work after the war to restore her
                        financial credit and pay off the old debts, and the benefits he conferred
                        upon the "foreign bondholders" by the establishment of the Public Debt. In
                        spite of all, it may be added, the Turks still look to us as their most
                        disinterested friends and nothing is more desired by all patriotic Turks
                        than to see a good and friendly understanding between the two Governments.

                    <p>Mr. Victor Marsden, who holds the place of honour in the "Fortnightly,”
                        points out the commercial benefits to ourselves which should follow a good
                        understanding with Russia.</p>
                    <p>“New Russia will be a land of increasing needs; capital will be more evenly
                        distributed; the peasant will be relieved of the greater part of his present
                        crushing burden of taxation; self-respect and ambition, education and
                        free¬dom of movement, will teach him a thousand needs of which he is
                        ignorant to-day. Take, for instance, the change which has already come over
                        the working-classes, the factory hands of Russia. These men are the leaders
                        of the masses, precisely as the thinkers of the univer¬sities are the
                        leaders of the middle classes. The workman of Russia has abandoned his
                        national custom, and some of the dirty habits which accompanied it; he now
                        dresses much the same as the self-respecting workman of Western lands; he is
                        demanding sanitary dwell¬ings, and leisure hours for self-improvement. The
                        change of custom alone, when it reaches the monjik of the fields, will
                        revolutionize the industries of Russia, which, even now, cannot supply the
                        needs of the country except by State aid at the cost of intolerably high
                        protective tariffs on imports.”</p>

                    <p>(FROM OUR FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT.)</p>
                    <p>London, August 10.</p>
                    <p> The Money Market.</p>
                    <p> The money market continues to show ease, and the supply of gold is ample,
                        notwithstand¬ing the outflow for holiday purpose, which has been
                        exceptionally large, and would appear to have reached about two millions
                        during the last few weeks. With a bullion total 01 over £36,000,000, and a
                        reserve of 48.73, against 46.7 a year ago, with nearly two millions en route
                        to London, there is no ques-tion as to the Bank being in a strong position.
                        Nor have we any reason to alter our often- expressed opinion that ease of
                        money is likely to continue for the present, and will prove a help to the
                        impending activity of stocks and shares. France is again trying, to employ
                        her surplus money her?, but there are rumours of Germany wanting more gold
                        in the autumn months. </p>
                    <p>The great activity of trade as shown in the large increase of both imports
                        and exports is likely to keep the circulation active, but it can be safely
                        said that never has bcoming trade demanded so little assistance from London
                        banks or discount houses. Trade bills are now particularly plentiful, and
                        not more than 3 to 31 per cent is obtainable for good three months’ paper,
                        while Bank Bills are a shade under 3 per cent. Such accommodation as is
                        required by the great manufacturing centres is mainly supplied by the
                        country banks out of the deposits in the same centres, and the enormous
                        wealth of the country was never more clearly demonstrated than it is to day.
                        Any slackening of trade would no doubt bring large balances for investment
                        and employment in London, but there are no signs of this at present ; rather
                        the contrary. Meantime, large profits are being realised in industrials,
                        which will leave a surplus which must be invested, and will tend to raise
                        the price of all sound securities, and possibly some of the many speculative
                        stocks.</p>
                    <p>The Stock Markets.</p>
                    <p>This week we have seen the interesting and somewhat unusual spectacle of a
                        revival in the stock markets after a holiday which immediate¬ly precedes the
                        conclusion of a nineteen-day account From the outset, on Tuesday, the tone
                        was cheerful, and this has continued throughout Several influences have
                        conduced to this im¬proved state of affairs. In the first place, the
                        favourable monetary position has created a vigorous demand for gilt-edged
                        securities, which has operated very appreciably upon other sections. Then,
                        too, the Continental Bourses are much firmer. The strike movement in Russia
                        appears to be less serious than first thought, and the abrupt failure of the
                        attempt to institute a revolt against the Government is accepted as an
                        augury for peace—for the time being, at any rate.</p>
                    <p>The splendid trade returns issued this week j have also given additional
                        stimulus to investment business. They show that in July our exports to
                        foreign countries exceeded all pre¬vious records, having increased by
                        £5,621,000, while the imports are higher by £3,867,000. For the seven mouths
                        to the end of July the aggregate gains in exports amount to no less than
                        £30,5(9.000, and in imports to £31,299,000. These returns, added to the
                        excellent holiday prospects, have been specially appreciated in the home
                        railway market, which is now firmer than for some time past. Ame¬ricans, on
                        the other hand, have given away considerably.</p>
                    <p>The fact that many members are away on holiday has, of course, restricted the
                        amount of business transacted, added to which there appears to be little
                        stock to be had in the markets.</p>
                    <p>Consols.</p>
                    <p>Consols.</p>
                    <p> The leading feature of the week has been the active demand for gilt-edged
                        securities, and this has put up the price ot Consols, which are particularly
                        buoyant, at 88{ for cash, a gain on the week of 9/16. Irish Land Stock has
                        improved to 89} the new issue to § premium and other first class stocks are
                        proportionate^ higher. </p>
                    <p>Foreign Bonds.</p>
                    <p> The quieting-down of affairs in Russia, and the consequently steadier tone
                        of the Paris and Berlin Bourses, has brought strength to Rus¬sian bonds,
                        which during the week have daily advanced. The Fours are now as good as 73|,
                        while the discount on the new loan has been reduced to 9. Last Friday we
                        quoted the Fours at 71 J and Fives at 10 J discount. Japanese stocks are ft
                        m, the Five- per-cents having hardened to 103 J. </p>

                        announce¬ments of the three leading lines, the London and North Western, the
                        Midland, and the Great Western. At one time these dividends would have been
                        considered very satisfactory, tot, in view of the splendid half-year which
                        the lines have experienced, the market felt that it might reasonably expect
                        more generous distributions than are being made. The record Board of Trade
                        returns, and the prospects of bumper holiday traffics have, how¬ever,
                        dispelled the weakness of this section, which daring the past two days has
                        developed considerable strength, quite an active business having been done
                        in nearly all the shares. In several cases yesterday there were gains of a
                        fall point. </p>
                    <p>Americans.</p>
                    <p> There has been a considerable amount of liquidation in Wall Street since our
                        last, and this, together with the paralysing influence of the extremely hot
                        weather to which residents in New York have been subjected, has weakened the
                        American market here. Nearly all along the line the shares have declined,
                        Pennsylvanias being about the only exception. These stocks have been well
                        supported, and the price has gained 1 and on the week at 69 J after being as
                        high as 70 J. There has been an excellent enquiry for Canadian Police, in
                        view of the brilliant harvest prospects. The shares are quoted to¬night at
                        172 j, compared with 171 J last Friday. The last making-up price was 165 j. </p>

                    <p> The Egyptian market has been quite active during- the past few days, and
                        there is a good demand for the leading shares. National Bank have advanced
                        to 26 and Agricul¬tural Banks to 9 j—J. Delta Land and Invest¬ment are also
                        in request, and after being as good as 3 J, are now easier at 3 J. Egyptian
                        Estates are firm at 1}-ft. There has been a good business done in Daira
                        Sugar at prices between 5 and 5 Daira Sanieh have not yet felt the better
                        tone, and are ubi.i at 16 J, and the Deferred at 97 nominal. Delta
                        Preference Bearer are also unmentioned at about 11 The 4% Debentures of the
                        latter are still wanted at 102. Bank of Abyssinia are a bad market, with
                        absolutely no sup¬port, the prices being distinctly fl it at 1 {— J
                        discount. Union Fonqiere are firmer at 6 J— and Land Bank of Egypt at 8 j—J.
                        There is no change in Corporation of Western Egypt at | premium, and Salt
                        and Soda at 1 and Egyptian Markets at 1 } are without any transactions.

                    <p>Mining.</p>
                    <p> Commencing with Rhodesians, the South African market has received
                        considerable atten¬tion. When it is remembered that this is the eve of the
                        carry-over, this marked revival is all the more remarkable, and is very
                        welcome as an augury of better things to come. There has been a very active
                        demand for Tanganyikas, also for Zambesi and Bankets, the strength of these
                        and other leading Rhodesian shares being partly attributed to a fuller
                        realisation by investors of the wonderfal potentialities for the development
                        of the mining districts of Rhodesia contained in the late Mr. Beit's
                        munificent gift to the Cape-Cairo Railway. It most be apparent to the
                        meanest understanding that the results which must inevitably follow such an
                        opening up of the country will he enormous, and in view of this fact
                        far-seeing investors will not be slow to avail themselves of the present low
                        price of South African mining shares. Yesterday Kaffirs participated in the
                        activity, and they have continued firm to-day. Rand Mines have improved to
                        6j and East Rands to4j. Egyptian mining shares have kept steady. Egyptian
                        Mines have been very firm, the price having advanced to 4s. 6d. United
                        Africans have gained J at 1 J. Nile Valleys are unchanged at 58. 6d. and
                        Options at 1 J. </p>
