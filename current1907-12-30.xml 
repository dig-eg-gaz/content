                    proprietor). Olympus Hotel, Mount Troodos, 6000 ft. above the sea. Magnificent
                    Scenery. Perfect climate. Season May to end of October. For information apply to
                    Mr. Najem Houry, Managing Director of Cyprus Hotel Co., Army Contractor,
                    Limassol, Cyprus. There is a good carriage road from Kopia (on Railway) to
                    Troodos. At Famagusta may be seen the fine old Latin Cathedral (now a mosque)
                    begun in 1300 and finished in 1312, together with other ancient ruins and the
                    Venetian fortifications, the finest in the world. Also the tower or palace, the

                <p>EGYPTIAN MUMMIES ABOUT 1100 BC 
                    In the last published report of I'Institat 
                    Egyptien, says “The Lancet,” there are two
                    papers by medical men worthy of attention. The institute was founded in 1859
                    to carry on the literary and scientific work for which I'Institat d’Egypte was originally created by Napoleon and his famous group
                    of men of science during the French occupation
                    of Egypt. Until about ten years ago English-
                    men were very rarely admitted to the honour of
                    membership for, in spite of the red coats at
                    headquarters, France still remained in jealously
                    guarded, intellectual occupation of Egypt. Now
                    matters have somewhat changed and no less
                    than eight English names appear in the list of
                    active members, the number of which is strictly
                    limited to 50. To the report under notice Dr.
                    Bay contributes a paper on the electric phenomena
                    that accompany the “khamsin” wind which in Arabia and Syria is called the
                    ‘simoom” and bears the name of “sirocco” in
                    Algiers and Sicily. The wind blows intermittently from the south during a period of about
                    50 days in March, April, and May. The heated
                    air comes straight from the desert barged with
                    very fine dust and sand, obscuring the sun and
                    compelling people to shut up their houses as far
                    as possible. True phenomenon usually lasts
                    only three days, of which the second is the
                    most trying and reminds those exposed to it
                    of the sensation of standing near a furnace.
                    During the khamsin the earth, charges with negative electricity, holds in equilibrium the positive electricity of the atmosphere until at the close of the phenomenon, generally accompanied
                    by a few drops or showers of rain, the electricity is changed, the air becoming negative and the ground positive. 
                    Meanwhile accidents sometimes occur to the large machines which 
                    have recently been constructed for supplying 
                    electric light. Dr.G. Elliot Smith has been working for three years at the investigation of 
                    embalming in the twenty-first dynasty, having
                    been presented with 44 mummies of that period
                    for the anatomical department of the Egyptian School of Medicine at Cairo. These mummies
                    were found at Deir el Babar in 1891.  In spite
                    of many authors, and more conjunctures, nobody
                    knows exactly when the ancient practice of
                    embalming began. In pre-historic days, more
                    than 7,000 years ago, the inhabitants of
                    Upper Egypt exposed their dead to a sun-dry-
                    ing process which has preserved them until to-day.
                    It is suggested that so long ago as the fifth dynasty the pyramid builders made use
                    of artificial means to resist the natural decay
                    of the dead body, but there is no certainty as
                    to what they did. The Cairo Museum shows,
                    by its unique collection of mummies, that real 
                    mummification , aided by art, belongs to the
                    period between the seventeenth dynasty and the early days of the sixth century of the Christian era Dr. Elliot Smith reminds us 
                    that during this period of about 2,000 years 
                    the methods of embalming underwent many
                    changes. From the eighteenth to the twentieth
                    dynasties the methods adopted consisted only
                    in the preservation of the body itself, and as
                    everyone knows who has seen the Royal Rame-
                    side mummies this was accomplished so
                    successfully that the mode employed can only
                    have been the result of centuries of experiment.
                    About the beginning of the twenty-first
                    dynasty (a period of decline, when Egypt was
                    being menaced by victorious Assyria) the embalmers initiated a new practice which was
                    An attempt to restore to the shruken body
                    the form which it had lost during the early stages of embalming ; this was done by packing
                    under the skin and in the cavities linen,
                    sawdust, sand, and other materials. </p>

                    which the Rev D. P. Miller met his death was
                    held by the British Consul at Cairo yesterday. 
                    Dr. Madden and Major Hardy gave evidence
                    as to being called to the pharmacy to
                    which Mr. Miller had been conveyed and to
                    attending him. The evidence of three Euro-
                    peans and the tram conductors went to show
                    that the motor-car, which was the cause of the
                    accident, followed the tram for some distance
                    at a normal rate on the way to the garage.
                    The chauffeur, a Greek, after confirming this
                    evidence, said that be applied the brake as
                    soon as he saw the shadow thrown by the
                    deceased in front of him but it was too late and
                    Mr. Miller fell under the car. Private Davey,
                    of the Ordnance Office, gave evidence as to
                    attending the injured man in instance
                    and of obtaining assistance, the Consul thanking
                    him for the prompt manner in which be
                    had acted. Captain Jarvis, of the police, having
                    given technical evidence as to the car and
                    the distance from the tram at which it was
                    traveling, the jury after retiring for five
                    minutes returned a verdict of “accidental
                    death” and exonerated the chauffeur of the
                    car from all blame.  </p>

                    been conducted and brought to so satisfactory
                    a. conclusion, which augured well for the tuture
                    success of the vast scheme of Cairo drainage
                    upon which he was engaged, — a scheme so
                    essentially identified with the public health,
                    and the continued development and 
                    prosperity of the city.</p>

                    “healths” and “sentiments” having been pro-
                    posed, cordially received, and suitably acknowledged,
                    a subsequent smoking concert materially contributed
                    to the success of the entertainment, which was pronounced an unqualified
                    success.</p>

                    INAUGURATED YESTERDAY.
                </head>
               <p> Yesterday the new Great Pass to Alexandria
                harbour was officially inaugurated by Rear
                Admiral Sir R. Massie Blomfield, the inauguration being attended with full pomp and ceremony.</p>
                
               <p> At noon all the Government vessels in
                harbour and H.M.S. “Diana” (Capt. Heathooat
                Grant) dressed ship, taking their time from the
                yacht “Cubona” of Prince Aziz Pasha Hassan,
                who represented the Khedive.</p>
                
                <p>From 2.80 to 8 p.m. those invited to attend
                the inauguration boarded the “Cuhona,” the
                “Aida,” and the “Diana” On board the
                “Cuhona” the Consular Corps and Heads of
                Departments were received by the Prince ; the
                guests of the Admiral were entertained aboard
                the “Aida,” and on the “Diana”
                Heathcoat Grant received the ladies and those
                friends whom officialdom did not invite.</p>
                
                <p>Punctually at 3 p.m the Khedivial Standard
                was broken on board the “Cuhona,” and was
                immediately saluted by the guns of the German
                training ship “Freya” and then by H.M.S
                “Diana.” The “Cuhona” then got under wehig
                and, followed by the “Diana,” “Aida” and “Ab-
                bas,” proceeded to the harbour entrance, where
                they all dropped anchor under the breakwater.</p>
                
                <p>Owing to the heavy weather the original
                programme of inauguration was not strictly
                adhered to, but, despite the angry seas, Prince
                Ariz, Rear Admiral Sir Massie Blamfield,
                Sheehan Bey, and Mr. Girard (French Consol)
                boarded the pilot tag “Etaif” and, passing out
                and in through the new Great Pass, officially
                inaugurated it.</p>
                
                <p>On the return of the “ Etaif” to the calmer
                waters of the harbour, the “Diana” thundered
                out another royal salute to declare that the pass
                was open. The “Abbas” and “Teir el Mina” next
                proceeded through the pass and aboard the
                latter were Grafton Bey, chief engineer, and Mr.
                Gardner, dredger master, under whose technical
                directions the new lighthouse has been
                built and the pass dredged. On the return of
                “Btaif” all the vessels which had taken part in
                the ceremony returned to their moorings.
                Captain Heathcoat Grant then paid an official
                visit to H.H. Prince Aziz aboard the “Cu-
                hona” and the Prince on returning the visit
                shortly after sundown, was greeted with a
                salute of 21 guns.</p>

                <head> COMPANY PROCEDURE IN EGYPT.</head>
                <p>To The Editor oF The “Egyptian Gazette."
                    Dear Sir, — The following article is com-
                    prised in the “Articles of Association” of a
                    Limited Liability Company promoted and
                    foisted on the public of Egypt and London
                    some few years ago. It is almost needless to
                    state that this Company has turned out to be a
                    huge fiasco, if not worse. Nevertheless, I shall
                    be glad if your readers, many of them directors
                    of companies domiciled in London, but having
                    Egypt for their base of operations would
                    kindly inform me if such an article is imposed
                    as a usual and customary condition under
                    which shareholders are invited to subscribe
                    capital for Joint Stock Companies.
                </p>
                <p>92.— Tout ce qoi aura été fait par une As-
                    semblée da Conseil ou d’un Comité de Conseil,
                    ou par quelqn’un agissant comme Administra-
                    teur, quand méme il serait reconnu plus tard
                    qn'il y avait ea nomination do dit Administra-
                    tour irréguliére ou de la personne
                    comme Administrateur, ou méme s'ils n'avaient
                    pas qualité pour agir, sera aussi valeble que si
                    toutes ces personnes avaient été dfiment nom-
                    mées et avaient en qualité pour occuper le
                    poste d’Administrateur.</p>
                <p> Under the above it would seem that an
                    enterprising boab might ran the whole show
                    and having collected the shareholders money
                    in every available direction quietly decamps
                    with the connivance, say of the Managing
                    Director, and share the proceeds with him and
                    no blame attaches to any one.</p>
                <p>If people who may be about to subscribe
                    capital to public companies would only take
                    the trouble to read the published articles of
                    association they might in some cases save
                    their money—I don’t say they would necessarily 
                    save it, having regard to the facility with
                    which dishonest directors wreck bond fide concerns
                    here, and escape with impunity, bot if a
                    little precaution were taken, and some few pre-
                    liminary enquiries made, shareholders would
                    leas frequently give their support to rotten
                    concerns of which we have bad so many
                    instances in Egypt lately.
                    
                    Yours faithfully,
                    J. Gooding.

                    THE SOURCE OF IMPURITIES.</head>
               <p> The method of adding aluminum sulphate
                to the water entering the settling tanks of the
                Ghizeh supply by the judgment of the naked
                eye alone is condemned, it being considered
                necessary to introduce the use of apparatus to
                accurately measure the turbidity of the water,
                both previous to and after settling, and the
                necessity of absolute cleanliness in dealing
                with the sand on the filters is urged by the
                commission, who also offer many other suggestions
                of a technical nature applicable alike
                to the Ghizeh and Abbassia supplies. In regard
                to the latter it is stated that the present intake
                is in an unsatisfactory position and should be
                some distance from the town, while the practice
                of mixing water from this supply with that of
                Rod-el-Parag is condemned.</p>
                
               <p> With regard to the system of distribution
                the commission points out that this is largely
                an engineering matter and with the exception
                perhaps of the suggestion that the mains
                should be laid at a greater depth than at
                present there is nothing included in the report
                which would not occur to the mind of any
                modern engineer. It will be necessary, if the
                commission is to be followed by any beneficial
                for the authorities to take the suggested
                improvements and alterations immediately in
                hand, as it is of little value possessing a water
                supply which is chemically pore, if impurities
                are to creep in through a faulty system of
                distribution, and it would seem that there is
                argent need of alterations in that which at
                present exists, and now that the purity
                of the water at its source has been assured
                no time should be lost in perfecting the system
                of supply. It is, as pointed out in the report,
                difficult owing to the lack of any drainage
                system, to flash out dead-ends where they exist
                in the poorer quarters and we trust that
                something definite as to the much-talked-of
                drainage scheme may be done immediately.</p>
                
                <p>The scheme is, we believe, one which will put
                Cairo on a sanitary basis equal to that of any
                modern town, and as this will possibly be a
                work which will occupy years in its 
                accomplishment, it is of the utmost importance that the
                thing should be pushed through with the greatest
                possible dispatch. We had hoped that the
                year 1907 would have witnessed the conclusion
                of the preliminaries, but as this is now impossible,
                we can only trust that the authorities
                will make up for lost time in the coming year,
                and that the summer may find the work well in
                hand. Many of tho suggestions embodied in the
                report of the commission appear to be almost
                un-necessary at first sight, but it is to these
                small things that many of our European cities
                owe their sanitary reputation and the commission
                were wise in insisting upon absolute cleanliness
                in the work, no less than upon the elimination
                of chemical impurities from the water itself. </p>

                <p>At a meeting at Cairo of the Wady Kom
                    Ombé Company, which was held on Monday
                    afternoon and at which 207,000 shares were
                    Represented, it was resolved on the proposition
                    of the Chairman, M. Suares, that 21,00
                    feddans of land being now quite ready for
                    agricultural purposes, it would in the
                    interests of the Company to confine their
                    operations for the present principally to the
                    development of this land in order to ascertain
                    what the yield would be worth, and to proceed
                    with the work of reclaiming other land to
                    agriculture slowly and as opportunity present-
                    ed itself. It was also resolved to alter the
                    date of the issue of the balance sheet from
                    July 31st to December 31st. Mr. Walter

                    very accurate. Mr. Heller seems to have
                    proved in his polo and to observe the rules of

                <p>This was a most exciting match, very accurate
                    polo being played, and the ground seemed
                    to be in excellent condition. Mr.Evans at No.
                    1, kept Major Haig, his back, galloping for
                    his strokes, this had a good deal to do with
                    the result of the game Mr. Bowen, Capt
                    Bartlett, and Mr. Schreiber's team lost the
                    first two goals but eventually won by 5 goals to
                    2. There was a large gathering of spectators
                    watching the match.
                </p>
                <p>First shukker. The Dragoons seemed to have
                    rather the best of it, Mr. Schreiber saving his
                    goal several times: Major Ansell scored the
                    first goal for his side just as the bell rang. </p>
                <p>Second chukker. From the throw in Mr.
                    Bowen, who is beautifully mounted, came
                    away with the ball and scored a splendid goal
                    with a long high shot. Shortly after this Capt.
                    Bartlett dribbled the ball through from a
                    scrimage near goal. Score. Reds. 1 goal. Whites
                    2 goals. Major Haigs pony shying off the ball,
                    let in Capt. Bartlett who again scored. Score
                    two all. </p>
                <p>Third chukker. After this there was some even
                    play until Capt. Bartlett who was playing
                    beautifully scored again. Reds. 3. White.2 
                    Mr. Seymour was the next to score a good
                    centreing back hander giving him nice opening.
                    Score Reds 4. Whites 2.</p>
                <p>Fourth chukker. Mr. Schreiber was conspicuous
                    his defense being very Cound, and his
                    back handers all “coming through”. The last
                    goal was scored by Mr.Seymour with a very
                    clever back hand shot. </p>
                <p>Final Score.
                    Major Haig’s team 2 goals.
                    Mr. Schreiber’s team 5 goals. </p>

                <dateline>Aden, December 23</dateline>
                <p>Jedda was lately the scene of great commotion
                    owing to the occurrence of a destructive
                    fire in one of its principal bazaars. The outbreak
                    was in the Khasikiah street which is covered
                    with arcades of planks. Many shops, have been
                    destroyed, the fire having raged tor some hours
                    before it could be got under control. The
                    origin of the fire and the damages are not
                    exactly known, but bazaar rumor estimates
                    the damage at one lakh of dollars. It is a great
                    pity that in spite of the liability of buildings
                    to catch fire in these parts there is not a proper
                    fire-engine to check the conflagration on the
                    occurrence of a fire. The want of such an
                    engine is more particularly felt at Hodeida,
                    where a recent fire destroyed more than
                    hundred huts, nearly half of Hodeida being
                    made up of huts.

                <p>The ordinary expenditure for 1908 has been fixed at L.E. 259,798 as against LE. 239,498
                in 1907. This increase of LB. 90,300 is chiefly
                required for strengthening the staff to cope
                increased work and to meet the increased cost
                of transport, rents, etc. Receipts for 1907, estimated at L.E. 260,000, will approximately reach L.E.295,000. those for 1908 are estimated at L.E. 280,000. The total number of letters exchanged with Great Britain and her Colonies in 1907 will probably attain 3,571,000 as against 2,692,500 in 1906, an increase of over 30% Since the reduction in December 1905 of the cost of postage
                from 10 to 5 milliémes, the gross increase
                in the number of letters despatched “to these
                countries is 107%, or, after deducting the
                probable increase based on the normal growth
                of preceding years, 77%, which must be regarded
                as extremely satisfactory.</p>
              
                <p>The number of British postal orders issued
                amounts to 27,500 for the first ten months of
                1907, as against 21,000 for the whole of 1906.</p>
