                    <p>Sir Eldon Gorst's speech at Khartoum must be regarded with satisfaction by
                        all who have the interests of the Sudan at heart, inasmuch as we are
                        informed that he stated that Lord Cromer''s poli s to be upheld, and the
                        lines of his Administatjonfollowed-as long as he (Sir Eldon Gorst) at the
                        Agency. The development of the Sudan has been a remark ably rapid one,
                        and-all the existing conditions point to a continuance of the expansion of
                        its prosperity, and it is therefore of the utmost importance that-no
                        obstacle should be placed in the way of its administfators at the present
                        time. The note of the Financial Adviser set at rest the doubts as to the
                        financial treat- ment which the Sudan was to receive under the new regime,
                        but as the whole question of the Sudan and its administration is one of such
                        intense importance to this country, it is just as well that. a definite line
                        of policy should have been stated and it is relieving to find, that no
                        departure from the conditions laid down by the late Consul General are to be
                        made. When the size of the country is con- sidered, no less than the
                        numberless tribes who come under the jurisdiction of the Sudan Government,
                        the comparative smallness of the English and Egyptian staff which is
                        employed in its administration is certainly remarkable. A few years since
                        the country was seething in the throes of a savageand despotic Govern- ment
                        under which the laws of might were alone respected, while to-day the lawless
                        ad herents of that Government are the loyal and efficient soldiers of this,
                        and even the tribes which inhabit the provinoes to the extreme south of the
                        country are slowly, but none the less surely, being trained to the knowledge
                        of the advantages of labour and its attendant results. Countries, like
                        persons, are prone to forget the source from which their benefits have
                        sprung So long as these be</p>

                        frequent complaints as the sums of money which are occasionally voted (on
                        loan at interest let it be membered) to the Sudan by the Egyptian '
                        Government, the authors this discontent | being apparently forgetful of .
                        the 'enormous extent to which Egypt has profited by the | works which haye
                        been and are being, accom- | plished in the former country.</p>
                    <p>Take away the sdvantages thus gained -and we fancy that the critics of the
                        moment would be.the'ffrst to condemn what they would be, only too ready to
                        term short-sighted policy of a Government which had thus rendered useless
                        the expenditure of thousands and the labour of years. Iti' incredible that
                        anyone who has the interest of this country before him, should be so fur

                        loans is continued.</p>
                    <p>Such an attitude would be the more readily understood if there existed any
                        single instance where money advanced to the Sudan 'had been devoted to any
                        purpose other 'than to the most pressing reforms, but from the very first

                        undertaken but it was essential to the continued welfare of the country. The
                        Sudanese are naturally a smart race and one which only requires a modicum of
                        instraction, and this will perhaps account for the extraordinary success
                        which has attended the efforts of the Government. to implant civilization in
                        their country; even now when the people might with justice be supposed to

                        were only to be expected, the Sudanese being natorally a lover of the

                    <p>To-day, on the occasion of the anniversary of the accession of H.H. the
                        Khedive, Cairo bears a festive appearance. Everywhere are signs of rejoicing
                        and loyalty to the throne. The prin- cipal streets of the Capital are gaily
                        decorated with bunting, and the hotels, such as Shep- heard's and the Grand
                        Continental, have no small share in the scheme ot decoration.</p>
                    <p>The reception held by H. H. the Khetlive at Abdeen Palace this morning was
                        more than -usually well attended, and the stream of car- riages conveying
                        the Khedive's distinguished visitors was a source of great interest to the
                        tourists who happened to be on the route to the Palace, at the entrance to
                        which a goard of honour was drawn up to pay the usual com- pliments to the
                        members of the Diplomatic Corps.</p>
                    <p>At noon &amp; salute of 21 guns was fired from the Citadelaind thé Polygon
                        barracks, similar salutes being fired at Alexandria and Port Said.</p>
                    <p>This morning at 10.30 a.m. his Highness reviewed the Egyptian troops in Cairo
                        on the Observatory parade ground at Abbassieh, and inthe evening a fete will
                        be held at the Esbe- kieh Gardens in honour of the anniversary.</p>

                    <p>We beg to tender our hearty congratulations to the Khedive of Egypt on the
                        anniversary of his accession. On an occasion like the present it is both
                        customary and opportune to pass in review the chief events of the
                        sovereign's reign. But such a survey would be inadequate without
                        endeavouring to estimate the bearing ot such events upon the present
                        situation and their probable influence on the future. The most im- portant
                        of these events from this point of view, as standing out prominently from
                        among the rest, andas calculated to make his Highness's reign famous even in
                        the lengthy roll of Egypt's history, are the extension of her dominions by
                        the restoration of her lost provinces in the Su- dan and the building of the
                        Assouan Dani. The former has assured to this country durable peace upon her
                        borders and bas manifested to the world at large the bravery and capacity of
                        her soldiers when pitted against a most valiant. foe. But that brilliant
                        feat of arms bas been ri- valled, if not sarpassed, by the greatest of en-
                        gineering triumphs which the modern world has witnessed, and which must
                        necessarily be chief amongst the factors contributing to her future
                        prosperity. 'These events, even if unaccompa- nied by many useful
                        ameliorations in almost every department of the Administration, would | | be
                        sufficient to lend lustre and distinction to his Highness's -reign. At a
                        moment like the present, one naturally asks oneself what are the main
                        features of the era inaugurated by the accession of the Khedive, and the
                        conclusion suggested is that coming ages will note this | epoch as a period
                        of peaceful progress and pro- longed prosperity.</p>
                    <p>Called suddenly to the Throne at the . | age of eighteen, the Khedive was
                        brought face to face witha most difficult situation.</p>
                    <p>He was on all sidés "surrounded by pitfalls. On the one hand there was'a
                        foreign occupation of his country and on the other native advisers of
                        unscrapulous character and, fresh from the environment of Vienna, he was
                        quite in- . | experienced ofthe intrigues and cabals, which ever beset an
                        Oriental Court. But in addition to these perilous factors, the situation was
                        complicated by the jealousy of Turkey, who . | eagerly desired that Egypt
                        should fall again into her hands, and the rivalry and mutual hostility of
                        the European Powers. Aby serious and sastained affort to set himself at
                        variance with the occupying Power would have been fraught with the most
                        disastrous consequences, not alone to the Khedivial dynasty, but might have
                        led tothe shedding of Egyptian blood asa prelude to a Buropean conflict. The
                        danger of such an attitude is plainly hint- ed-at by Lord Milner in his
                        'England in Egypt," who does not exaggerate ita dire possibilities. But
                        despite his youth and con- sequent inexperience and the absence of capable
                        advisers, his Highness has/ risen superior to all the intrigues. to which
                        many a roler of matarer years, though less richly endowed with the qualities
                        of firmness, courage, and discrimination, might very well have suo- cumbed.
                        It is manifest to those who have </p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p>closely watched his Highness's cateer that the dangers by which he was
                        formerly surrounded are now entirely removed, and recent years have shown
                        that the futare which awaits him has all the elements of permanent
                        well-being and advancement.</p>
                    <p>The remarkable, nay exceptional, ability, with which His Highness grappled
                        with the complex problem of dual government and proved himself equal to an
                        abnormal situation, not of his own creation, merits high commendation The
                        part he has hed to play has been one of the most delicate and embarrassing
                        that could fall to the lot of any Sovereign and would have taxed the
                        patience and sagacity of states- men of no mean order. That task has been to
                        maintain his prestige and rightful position amongst his native subjects,
                        whilst acting in deference to the advice tendered to him by 'the British
                        Government. Is there anyone, who, will venture to suggest that his
                        endeavours in this direction have not been crowned with complete and
                        conspicious success </p>
                    <p>His Highness's solicitude for the welfare of his country, is evinced by his
                        constant and never-failing attendance at the Council of Ministers and the
                        active share taken by him'in their deliberations. He is, in fact, his own
                        Minister, "though holding himself rightly above faction and party. Not alone
                        is he his own Minister, but he is his own Ambassador, as witness his visits
                        to European Courts and to Turkey. By the sovereigns-of-Rurope 'he is always
                        received as a persona grata especially in England, where his relations with
                        the Royal Family are of the most cordial. His liberal hospitality to foreign
                        royal visitors, when they are his guests, and his frequent and friendly
                        receptions, accorded to representatives of Foreign Powers accredited to this
                        country, are eloquent testimony to his European sym- pathies.</p>
                    <p>It would be difficult to name an Oriental ruler, who takes a more absorbing
                        interest in the development.of his country, than does the | } present holder
                        of the Khediviate. The Mariout Railway would alone suffice to show the
                        practical energy of his Highness, The line when extended to the Tripolitan
                        frontier will one day become a solid, substantial, and effective link with
                        the rest of the North African railway system, and is destined to become a
                        great artery of traffic and to open cp a huge extent of country, which has
                        been allowed to fall into complete neglect since the Arab conquest. of
                        Egypt. His keen interest in agricultural pursuits, is evinced by the
                        improved methods of hasbendry on his estates and the great care be bestows
                        on the breeding of the finest cattle. This encouragement of agriculture is
                        one of his chief claims to popular devotion. Egypt is essentially an
                        agricultural country and agri- culture is.the greatest of all industries,
                        because the fertility of the soil is an inxhaustible source of wealth. It is
                        to the credit of His Highness that he has understood and given hiniself up
                        to the study of agricultural questions in a way unrivalled by any other
                        sovereign, except perhaps the founder of united Italy, the late Victor
                        Emanuel, whose boast it was to. describe himself as King and cultivator.
                        There is an advantage to a country, which has agriculture |* for its
                        principle industry of a.description seldom alluded to. That is, a8 was
                        pointed out by Aristotle, that it keeps the population away from politics,
                        an inestimable blessing assuredly in a state like Egypt where cultivation is
                        still in so backward a condition. This consideration as well as the
                        healthier life enjoyed away from the towns, to which in the building of
                        modal villages the Khedive has so. largely contri- buted, is probably
                        present.to his 'mind when by precept and example he. ever. inculcates the
                        exploitation by the people themselves of Egypt's most valuable asset.</p>
                    <p>If we have accurately gauged the situation and rightly cast the horoscope of
                        coming events, there lies before His Highness Abbas II, a fature of such
                        promise as may well be envied by many an ambitious potentate on the European
                        continent, a future, indeed, which should amply satisfy the aspirations of
                        one so practical in his aims and so reasonable in his desires.</p>
                    <p>It is the earnest hope of all true lovers'of this country that he may long be
                        spared to devote his energies to the furtherance of Egypt's advancement, to
                        watch over her destinies and to assist her to attain to the position of
                        foremost amongst Oriental nations.</p>

                        residents. Would that the Municipality could see their way to: spend a small
                        sum, which would be vastly less: than that spent oa the Nouzha gardens, in
                        placing one or two of our small streets lying between Rue Cleopatra and the

                        mere bye-lanes filled with filth and rubbish and can certainly not be
                        considered sanitary. The area is only a small one, butit is very important

                        quiring similar sanitation. This is a disgrace to the Municipality and
                        should be immediately attended to, especially in view of the fact that we

                    <p>Sir,—The casual visitor to Cairo cannot fail tobe struck by the fact that for
                        its size it is the noisiest town in existence.Coachmen crack their whips
                        inthe ears of the passer-by. Street vendors yell their wares with a
                        persistency, which is truly surprising, carts, of 4, design which would.
                        disgrace the days of Noah, rattle along with' their loads of stone or
                        building material, and to add to the pandemonium of formér days, there is
                        now the horn echoing pérpetually in almost every. street.o Cairo,</p>

                        regardless-ag to whether there-is traffic in the way or not. Bat the use of
                        these 'horrible inventions in place-of the old bieycle bell is a practice
                        which should be stamped out by law. Not only are they: nerve shattering,

                        Bat it was all of no avail, The owner of the horn.was evidently out to enjoy
                        himself and hepreserved his position until the other stopping he was forced
                        to pass and continued his way, still at bia infernal work until he waa lost

                        been compelled. to keep on blowing hishorn through the night, in order-that

                        few of the anomalies of modern Egyptian civilisation as practised at
                        Alexandria; of such were the usé of the feet in carpentry; the stabling of
                        horses with their heads outwards; and, last but not least, the adoption by
                        the Tramway Company of the red flag asa token of safety, and of the green
                        one as danger signal ; whilst it-was the practice of the wattman to
                        endeavour to remove obstucles from the line of rails by charging them at
                        full speed, with a grand display of fireworks, to the terror of lady
                        passengers. Of all these peculiarities and many others, he said, there was

                    <p>Mr. Isaac Rosenzveig, 9 Dumarais street, Montreal, Can., writes:</p>
                    <p>"About three years ago, I suffered with a bad cold, It settled in the bladder
                        . and kidneys, causing serious troliBle.</p>
                    <p>"I tried several advertised reme- dies, butitwas Peruns which finally; cured

                    <p>CATARRA of the kidneys is a very much neglected disease</p>
                    <p>It is not until the disease hss a firm hold upon the kidneys that the patient
                        begins to realize that there is some dé- rangement of these organs</p>
                    <p>The slight backaches, the feelings of iassitade,; and other warning symptoms
                        of kidney disease are overlooked.</p>
                    <p>They are notserions enough to detain the patient fromyhis regular work</p>
                    <p>Even when he discovers that the kidneys are affected, he does not recognize
                        the difficulty as being caused by catarth.</p>

                    <p>However, when Isisonee firmly sosted in the kidneys it becomes # difficalt
                        disease to exterminate.</p>
                    <p>Indeed, catarrh of the kidneys is more serious than catarrh asfecting some of
                        the other organs of thé body.</p>

                    <p>The thing to be done, when catarrh of the kidneys is discovered, ts to take
                        some internal, systemiccatarrhremedy, one that reaches the very source of
                        the catarrb and removes the cause of the difficulty.</p>
