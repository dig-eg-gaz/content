                        becomes a thing of the past. The Khedive's railway is gradually creeping
                        towards the Tripolitan frontier, while the northward march of the Cape to
                        Cairo line is always moving Railhead nearer and nearer. Meanwhile, the

                    <p>negotiating with the Ports on the subject of the construction of a line from
                        Damascus to Hamah, and from Hamah to Aleppo, by a French company. The
                        concession has at last been granted, in spite of the efforts which the
                        Germans made to render the project abortive. The proposed line is not a long
                        one, but its oommercial importance will be very marked. Aleppo is a great
                        trading centre, and the sur- rounding conntry is very rich. Hitherto.no line
                        has connected the town with the Syrian coast, and the new railway will
                        therefore afford a valuable outlet for the agricul- tural produce and
                        manufactures of the dis- trict. The French are all the more delighted at the
                        succcess of M. Constans in obtaining the concessions for the French company,
                        since the Germans have done their utmost at Con- stantinople to include
                        Aleppo in the coontry to be served by the Bagdad railway, and to induce the
                        Sultan to forbid the construction of any other railway near the town. The
                        traffic of the district, instead of going by the Bagdad line, will now be
                        tapped by the more natural way of Beyrout. In granting the concession the
                        Sultan said that he did so in order that the ancient and traditional
                        friendship between turkey and France might receive a new con- firmation. It
                        is evident that some suspicions have entered the Sultan's mind that the
                        Kaiaer’s attitude towards him is not altogether disinterested, at least so
                        far as relates to Asia Minor. The linking of the Syrian and Egyptian railway
                        systems will Inevitably come to pass and few engineering difficulties attend
                        the con- struction of a line by the short desert route via Kantara and Gaza
                        to the Jaffa-Jerusalem line. It may not be many years before there will be
                        through communioation from Cairo to Calais via Constantinople and

                        no definite decision on the matter as yet. The new german greek orient bank
                        will establish branches in egypt, but not immediately, as it will start
                        operation first at <placeName>athens</placeName> and

                        branches of the national bank will be at the disposal of the orient bank, so
                        it will not be necessary to open new branches in that country. But in
                        proportion with the development of business, the orient bank will establish
                        branches in various towns of turkey, egypt, and other countries in the east.
                        With regard to the capital, the national bank for deutschland, of berlin,
                        and the national bank of greece have taken all the shares, the value of
                        which is 10 million francs. They have reserved to themselves the right to
                        make a public issue within three years. M. Witting, manager of the national
                        bank for deutschland and one of those interested in the oriend bank, has
                        stated in an interview, that the aim of the new financial establishment is
                        to facilitate the importation of helllenic products into germanly. It will
                        advance money on bills of lading. M. witting also said that the orient bank
                        would establish in greece storehouses for wares which the proprietor does
                        not wish to export immediately and on which the orient bank will also
                        advance money. The bank will endeabour to come to an understanding with the

                    <p>Since the delta light railway company has taken over the cairo helouan line,
                        great satisfaction has been evinced at the reforms that the company has
                        introduced. We extract the following passage from our vernacular

                        express their warmest thanks for the many and various reforms brought about
                        by the delta company on the line which before long they expect to become one
                        of the most orderly and the least dangerous of lines. the reason that some
                        are conducting a virulent campaing against the company, despite its recent
                        existence, is due to the mere fact that they are not willing to squander
                        money in the same say as the former company with the view to preventing
                        hypocrites from exhibiting their crying and manifold defects. The object of
                        the new company is reforems in the full sense of the word, and no babbling
                        or nonsense whatever on the part of ill intentioned people is to deter them
                        from attaining this most commendable object</p>

                    <head>FEDORA AT THE ABBAS. SIGNA. BELLINCIONIS SECOND APPEARANCE</head>
                    <p>the performance of fedora at the abbas helmy theatre yesterday evening, with
                            <persName>signa. bennincioni</persName> in the title role, was
                        undoubtedly an event in the local theatrical world. A more finished
                        performance it would be impossible to imagine on any stage, and the result
                        was a repetition of the great artistes triumph of saturday last. Gedora is
                        an exceeding interesting opera, in that the orchestral treatment is very
                        distinct from that accepted in most works of the kind: it has a curious
                        reminiscence of wagner, notable of tristan, in certain parts. The libretto,
                        known to most people through M. V. Sardou, is certainly calculated to
                        furnish good dramatic singing, and no artiste is better fitted to bring out
                        to the full the dramatic points in which it abounds than signora
                        bennincioni. Her performance was one of the most remarkable achievements in
                        the art of music-drama that we have ever witnessed. She knew how to work
                        towards a climax, both in particular and in general when she first of all
                        realised the imprisonment of the great depths of her passion, and when she
                        later realised the ripeness and fulness of her ultimate despair. She ws, in
                        a word, magnificent; and her every action betrayed the consumate actress
                        that she is. The womanly love and devotion to the husband who is slain, her
                        cunning in compassing her terrible revenge, her passion for her lover, are
                        depicted with masterly skill and darling fedelity. With what exquisite
                        gentleness and feeling she wins the affection of her lover; with what
                        overpowering force and majesty she faces and vanquishes the murderer of her
                        husband. The infinite pathos of the concluding act, the pathetic picture of
                        the desperate woman who flies to poison as a relief from her mental agony,
                        with the face of a madonna, and the great, sad eyes full of a sorrow for
                        which there can be no alleviation are, in truth, things that no one who has
                        witnessed them will ever forget. Fedora is a character that exactly suits
                        the temperament, the personality, and the splendid talent of the great
                        italian actress and singer. She was well seconded in her trying role by Sig.
                        Pagani as conte loris, as well as by the other performers. Sig pagani is a
                        tenor with a future and shared in signora bellincionis great triumph. He
                        sang with taste and no little dramatic power, although at times he seemed
                        rather nervous, which was probably due to the presence and personality of
                        signora bellincioni. The orchestra did full and the chorus worked well. The
                        staging of the opera left nothing to be desired, both the acenery and
                        costumes being excellent. Signora bellincionis dresses were nothing less
                        than superb</p>

                    <p><persName>Miss hoeslis</persName> concert at the new khedivial hotel last
                        night was a great success. there was a large audience in spite of the bad
                        weather. The talented swiss lady was assisted by the distinguished amateurs,
                        messrs. foscolo, jacot des combes, weedon, and ehrlich. The concert began
                        with handels well known largo in g major, sung by miss hoesli, assist by mr
                        ehrlich at the piano and mr weedon with the violin. Miss hoeslis voice was
                        beautifully modulated to suit this difficult piece. It was much applauded by
                        a critical audience. M Fascolo followed with a violin duet by sinving, in
                        which he was assisted by a friend, whose name was not on the programme. This
                        intricate piece was executed with marvellous facility. The accompaniment was
                        cleverly given by Mrs Foscolo. Three romances were next sung by miss hoesli,
                        an die nacht (bohm), Chant hindou (bemberg), and Lievesfeier (weingartner).
                        The last time was especially appreciated and was given with great depth of
                        feeling and perfect harmony. beethovens adagio was well given by messrs
                        weedon, des combes, and ehrlich, followed by two solos by mr foscolo.
                        Schuberts L'abeille was excellently played and had to be given agian to
                        satisfy the demands for an encore. Miss hoesli then sang xavier lerouxs Le
                        nil, accompanied by M Des Combes on the cello and Mr. Ehrlich on the piano.
                        The cello adapted itself very well to miss hoeslis powerful voice. The
                        concert, which closed with three romances sung by miss hoesli, again showed
                        the variety of the ladys talents and the bouquets and applause she recieved
                        showed how much her splendid vocal gifts are appreciatd by the connoisseurs

                        The present week has been characterised by cheerfulness in our stock
                        markets, owing in a great measure to the growing belief that russia cannot
                        much longer continue the war, and also to the hope that the tsar is
                        beginning to have his own way in reference to the reforms. The paris and
                        berlin financiers have been making the most of the amelioration of the
                        trouble in st petersburg and hoisted up the price of russian fours to over
                        90 agian. Of stocks and shares there is little to report this week of
                        interest to your readers. As far as the mining section is concerned,
                        business in south africans seems to be at a complete standstill at present,
                        with a drooping tendency in prices. Egyptian mining properties, inlike the
                        other egyptian companies, are not yet independent and are still under the
                        wing of the south african market, and consequently they suffer with kaffirs
                        when the latter are weak. Nile valleys have dropped to 2.1/16.5 at the
                        present moment, a price which may tempt speculative investors, not
                        forgetting that the company is to a large extent in the hands of teh south
                        african magnate who specifically acquired a large and controlling interest.
                        United africans at 1.9/16 should be worth attention. It is evident that the
                        market anticipate an active future, for a special book of reference has just
                        been published "the egypt and sudan mining handbook." other egyptian stocks
                        are steady and hold their prices well generally. Bank shares are a strong
                        point, especially national banks, which are in demand at 26 in anticipation
                        of the dividend. the market expects a distribution of 15s per share. some
                        say under, but 15s is the general idea. Agriculturals are firm at 10 7/8,
                        other prices are steady with little or no change on the week, except
                        egyptian markets, which have fallen back to 1. All paris stocks have been
                        wonderfully well supported, especially russians, which they manage to keep
                        up to the level of 90; it is really wonderful how little of this stock comes
                        out at this price, for it certainly should tempt holders. Japanese stocks
                        keep strong. Money is cheap and the investment market is strong, though not
                        an active one, and consols keep firm at 881.</p>
