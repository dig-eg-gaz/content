                 of the Egyptian railway system becomes a
                 thing of the past. The Khedive's railway is
                 gradually creeping towards the Tripolitan
                 frontier, while the northward march of the
                 Cape to Cairo line is always moving Railhead
                 nearer and nearer. Meanwhile, the develop-
                 ment of the railway communications in Syria
                 is proceeding apace and for several months past

                 <div type="item"> <p>negotiating with the Ports on the subject of
                 the construction of a line from Damascus to
                 Hamah, and from Hamah to Aleppo, by a
                 French company. The concession has at last
                 been granted, in spite of the efforts which the
                 Germans made to render the project abortive.
                 The proposed line is not a long one, but its
                 oommercial importance will be very marked.
                 Aleppo is a great trading centre, and the sur-
                 rounding conntry is very rich. Hitherto.no
                 line has connected the town with the Syrian
                 coast, and the new railway will therefore
                 afford a valuable outlet for the agricul-
                 tural produce and manufactures of the dis-
                 trict. The French are all the more delighted
                 at the succcess of M. Constans in obtaining
                 the concessions for the French company, since
                 the Germans have done their utmost at Con-
                 stantinople to include Aleppo in the coontry
                 to be served by the Bagdad railway, and to
                 induce the Saltan to forbid the construction
                 of any other railway near the town. The traffic
                 of the district, instead of going by the Bagdad
                 line, will now be tapped by the more natural
                 way of Beyrout. In granting the concession
                 the Sultan said that he did so in order that
                 the ancient and traditional friendship between
                 turkey and France might receive a new con-
                 firmation. It is evident that some suspicions
                 have entered the Sultan's mind that the
                 Kaiaer’s attitude towards him is not altogether
                 disinterested, at least so far as relates to Asia
                 Minor. The linking of the Syrian and Egyptian
                 railway systems will Inevitably come to pass and
                 few engineering difficulties attend the con-
                 struction of a line by the short desert route
                 via Kantara and Gaza to the Jaffa-Jerusalem
                 line. It may not be many years before there
                 will be through communioation from Cairo to
                 Calais via Constantinople and Vienna.</p>

                    The remarkable struggle between the German
                    and french embassies here, with the object of
                    inducing the porte to expend a considerable

                    $5,000,000 from the imperial ottoman bank
                    upon guns in their respective countries, ended

              the nationality of the assassin was unsettled
              until the last few days.  Menegakis has made
              a complete confession of his crime, which appears
              to have been of a purely political character,
              the victim having, it is alleged, betrayed
              the cause of the islanders to the sultan in the

                    expects to have its alexandria branch opened
                    for working by next jume
                    the bank of romes new branch at alexandria
                    will open here in about two months time.
                    The credito italiano is considering the
                    advisability of establishing a branch here, but 
                    has come to no definite decision on the matter
                    as yet.
                    The new german greek orient bank will
                    establish branches in egypt, but not immediately, 
                    as it will start operation first at <placeName>athens</placeName>
                        and <placeName>constantinople</placeName>.
                    Our constantinople correspondent sends us 
                    the following details on this new levantine 
                    bank: In greece the branches of the national
                    bank will be at the disposal of the orient
                    bank, so it will not be necessary to open new
                    branches in that country.  But in proportion
                    with the development of business, the orient
                    bank will establish branches in various towns
                    of turkey, egypt, and other countries in the 
                    east.  With regard to the capital, the national bank 
                    for deutschland, of berlin, and the national
                    bank of greece have taken all the 
                    shares, the value of which is 10 million francs.
                    They have reserved to themselves the right to
                    make a public issue within three years.  M. 
                    Witting, manager of the national bank for deutschland
                    and one of those interested in the oriend bank,
                    has stated in an interview, that the aim of the new
                    financial establishment is to facilitate the 
                    importation of helllenic products into germanly.
                    It will advance money on bills of lading.  M. witting
                    also said that the orient bank would establish in 
                    greece storehouses for wares which the proprietor
                    does not wish to export immediately and on
                    which the orient bank will also advance money.
                    The bank will endeabour to come to an
                    understanding with the deutshe-levante
                    lanie to facilitate the export trade.

                        over the cairo helouan line, great
                        satisfaction has been evinced at the reforms
                        that the company has introduced.  We extract
                        the following passage from our vernacular
                        contemporary Misr:
                        We are requested by several people inhabiting
                        helouan to express their warmest thanks for
                        the many and various reforms brought 
                        about by the delta company on the line which 
                        before long they expect to become one of the
                        most orderly and the least dangerous of lines.
                        the reason that some are conducting a virulent
                        campaing against the company, despite its
                        recent existence, is due to the mere fact that they are 
                        not willing to squander money in the 
                        same say as the former company with the view
                        to preventing hypocrites from exhibiting 
                        their crying and manifold defects.  The object
                        of the new company is reforems in the full 
                        sense of the word, and no babbling or nonsense
                        whatever on the part of ill intentioned people

                    <head>SIGNA. BELLINCIONIS SECOND APPEARANCE</head>
                    <p>the performance of fedora at the abbas
                        helmy theatre yesterday evening, with <persName>signa.
                    bennincioni</persName> in the title role, was undoubtedly
                    an event in the local theatrical world.  A
                    more finished performance it would be 
                    impossible to imagine on any stage, and the
                    result was a repetition of the great artistes
                    triumph of saturday last.  Gedora is an exceeding
                    interesting opera, in that the orchestral
                    treatment is very distinct from that accepted
                    in most works of the kind: it has a curious
                    reminiscence of wagner, notable of tristan,
                    in certain parts.  The libretto, known to most
                    people through M. V. Sardou, is certainly
                    calculated to furnish good dramatic singing, and 
                    no artiste is better fitted to bring out to the full
                    the dramatic points in which it abounds
                    than signora bennincioni.  Her performance
                    was one of the most remarkable achievements
                    in the art of music-drama that we have ever
                    witnessed.  She knew how to work towards a 
                    climax, both in particular and in general
                    when she first of all realised the imprisonment
                    of the great depths of her passion, and when
                    she later realised the ripeness and fulness of her
                    ultimate despair.  She ws, in a word, 
                    magnificent; and her every action betrayed
                    the consumate actress that she is.  The
                    womanly love and devotion to the husband
                    who is slain, her cunning in compassing her 
                    terrible revenge, her passion for her lover, 
                    are depicted with masterly skill and darling 
                    fedelity.  With what exquisite gentleness and
                    feeling she wins the affection of her lover;
                    with what overpowering force and majesty she
                    faces and vanquishes the murderer of her
                    husband.  The infinite pathos of the concluding
                    act, the pathetic picture of the desperate
                    woman who flies to poison as a relief from her
                    mental agony, with the face of a madonna, 
                    and the great, sad eyes full of a sorrow for
                    which there can be no alleviation are, in truth, 
                    things that no one who has witnessed them
                    will ever forget.  Fedora is a character that
                    exactly suits the temperament, the personality, 
                    and the splendid talent of the great italian
                    actress and singer.  She was well seconded in 
                    her trying role by Sig. Pagani as conte loris,
                    as well as by the other performers.  Sig pagani
                    is a tenor with a future and shared in signora
                    bellincionis great triumph.  He sang with 
                    taste and no little dramatic power, although
                    at times he seemed rather nervous, which was 
                    probably due to the presence and personality 
                    of signora bellincioni.  The orchestra did full
                    and the chorus worked well.  The staging of 
                    the opera left nothing to be desired, both the 
                    acenery and costumes being excellent.  Signora 
                    bellincionis dresses were nothing less than
                    superb</p></div>

                    <head>MISS HOESLIS CONCERT</head>
                    <p><persName>Miss hoeslis</persName> concert at the new khedivial
                    hotel last night was a great success.  there 
                    was a large audience in spite of the bad weather.  The 
                    talented swiss lady was assisted
                    by the distinguished amateurs, messrs. foscolo,
                    jacot des combes, weedon, and ehrlich.
                    The concert began with handels well known
                    largo in g major, sung by miss hoesli, assist
                    by mr ehrlich at the piano and mr weedon
                    with the violin.  Miss hoeslis voice was
                    beautifully modulated to suit this difficult
                    piece.  It was much applauded by a critical
                    audience.  M Fascolo followed with a violin
                    duet by sinving, in which he was assisted
                    by a friend, whose name was not on the 
                    programme.  This intricate piece was executed
                    with marvellous facility.  The accompaniment
                    was cleverly given by Mrs Foscolo.  Three
                    romances were next sung by miss hoesli, an 
                    die nacht (bohm), Chant hindou (bemberg),
                    and Lievesfeier (weingartner). The last time
                    was especially appreciated and was given with
                    great depth of feeling and perfect harmony.
                    beethovens adagio was well given by messrs
                    weedon, des combes, and ehrlich, followed
                    by two solos by mr foscolo.  Schuberts
                    L'abeille was excellently played and had to
                    be given agian to satisfy the demands for an
                    encore.  Miss hoesli then sang xavier lerouxs
                    Le nil, accompanied by M Des Combes on the cello 
                    and Mr. Ehrlich on the piano. 
                    The cello adapted itself very well to
                    miss hoeslis powerful voice.  The concert,
                    which closed with three romances sung by miss
                    hoesli, again showed the variety of the ladys
                    talents and the bouquets and applause she
                    recieved showed how much her splendid vocal 
                    gifts are appreciatd by the connoisseurs of

                    <head>EGYPTIAN SHARE MARKET</head>
                    <p>(From our financial correspondent)
                        <placeName>London</placeName>, february 3
                    The present week has been characterised by 
                    cheerfulness in our stock markets, owing in a 
                    great measure to the growing belief that russia
                    cannot much longer continue the war, and 
                    also to the hope that the tsar is beginning to 
                    have his own way in reference to the reforms.
                    The paris and berlin financiers have been
                    making the most of the amelioration of the
                    trouble in st petersburg and hoisted up
                    the price of russian fours to over 90 agian.
                    Of stocks and shares there  is little to report
                    this week of interest to your readers.  As far
                    as the mining section is concerned, business in
                    south africans seems to be at a complete 
                    standstill at present, with a drooping tendency
                    in prices.  Egyptian mining properties, inlike
                    the other egyptian companies, are not yet 
                    independent and are still under the wing of the 
                    south african market, and consequently
                    they suffer with kaffirs when the latter are
                    weak.  Nile valleys have dropped to 2.1/16.5
                    at the present moment, a price which may
                    tempt speculative investors, not forgetting
                    that the company is to a large extent in the
                    hands of teh south african magnate who specifically
                    acquired a large and controlling interest.
                    United africans at 1.9/16 should be worth
                    attention.  It is evident that the market
                    anticipate an active future, for a special book
                    of reference has just been published "the 
                    egypt and sudan mining handbook." other
                    egyptian stocks are steady and hold their prices
                    well generally.  Bank shares are a strong
                    point, especially national banks, which are in demand
                    at 26 in anticipation of the dividend.
                    the market expects a distribution of 15s per
                    share.   some say under, but 15s is the general
                    idea.  Agriculturals are firm at 10 7/8, other
                    prices are steady with little or no change on
                    the week, except egyptian markets, which
                    have fallen back to 1.   All paris stocks have
                    been wonderfully well supported, especially 
                    russians, which they manage to keep up to
                    the level of 90; it is really wonderful how little
                    of this stock comes out at this price, for it
                    certainly should tempt holders.  Japanese stocks
                    keep strong.  Money is cheap and the investment
                    market is strong, though not an active one, and
                    consols keep firm at 881.</p></div>
