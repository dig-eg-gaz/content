                    <head>THE SUEZ CANAL</head>
                    <p>Last week the balance dividends to be paid by the Suez Canal Company for 1904
                        were announced. These showed a very considerable increment, giving rise to
                        expectations of an early realisation of the hope, expressed by the chairman
                        at the meeting last June, that a reduction of 50 centimes per ton in the
                        transit dues might be possible. A reduction of this amount came into
                        operation at the beginning of 1903; but, thanks to the growth in number and
                        tonnage of vessels using the waterway, the decline in receipts was
                        insignificant, only from frs. 103,720,020 to frs. 103,620,268. Economies in
                        working enbaled the company to enlarge its dividends for 1903, frs.5 being
                        added to the distribution on the Ordinary and redeemed shares and frs. 2 to
                        the amount falling to the Founders. Now the total dividend which was frs.
                        130 net for 1903, is advanced to frs. 141 net for 1904 on the Ordinary
                        shares of frs. 500 and the Founders' receive frs. 66.57 net, against frs.
                        60.50 for the preceding year. Needless, to say,</p>

                    <p>these rates are far and away the highest ever paid by the undertaking ;
                        indeed, the net dividend –– that is, after deduction of taxes –– exceeds the
                        gross dividend of 1903, which was the previous best. The sum distributed in
                        excess dividends to shareholders and founders will be nearly £2,300,000,
                        irrespective of the Egyptian Government's 15 per cent. of the net profits
                        (belonging since 1880 to a French company which bought it from the
                        Government) and of the 5 per cent. interest payable on each unredeemed
                        share. The accounts of the company have not reached us, but the annual
                        return to Parliament, issued last week, shows that the transit receipts rose
                        over frs. 12,000,000, to frs. 115,818,479 ––say £4,632,740.</p>
                    <p>The net tonnage passing through the Canal last year was 1,494,547 tons
                        greater than that of 1903, and about 500,000 tons of this is atttributed to
                        the consignments of coal to the Far East for the use of the belligerents.
                        That, of course, accounts for only about a third of the increase, and the
                        report of the British Government directors mentions the heavy shipments of
                        wheat from India as explaining a great part of the remainder. The effects of
                        the war are to be traced throughout the statistics of traffic. The
                        interruption of Russian commercial shipping is seen in the decline from 119
                        in 1903 to 82 last year in the number of Russian ships, and, as the latter
                        figure included 15 warships and transports, representing 76,763 tons out of
                        a total of 153,848 tons, the trade in Russian bottoms is seen to have nearly
                        disappeared. Only six Japanese ships passed through the Canal last year,
                        against 53 in 1903, and the net tonnage felll from 220,966 to 21,463, of
                        which 4,773 tons represented two warships and the rest four mail steamers,
                        leaving not a solitary Japanese merchant vessel in the list. The percentage
                        of British traffic continues to grow, and we show the figures for the next
                        five years :––</p>

                    <p>Germany is still an indifferent second, her net tonnage advancing from last
                        year from 1,773,265 to 1,969,561, against the British growth from 7,403,533
                        tons to 8,833,929 tons. The German increase in number of ships and their
                        aggregate burthen did not improve her proportion, which fell from 13.1 per
                        cent. of ships in 1903 to 12.8 per cent., and from 14.9 per cent. of net
                        tonnage to 14.7 per cent. If merchant vessels alone are to be reckoned, the
                        British proportion of tonnage rises to 76 per cent. and the German falls to
                        10.5 per cent., a proportion exceeding that of France, Holland, Norway,
                        Austria-Hungary, and Italy combined. The average net tonnage of vessels
                        using the Canal last year was 3,163, against 1,787 tons twenty years ago and
                        657 tons in the first year of the canal's existence. In that year (1869) the
                        Canal earned frs. 54,5460 on 10 vessels ; the receipts got over frs.
                        5,000,000 in 1870, over frs 50,000,000 in 1881, and over frs. 100,000,000 in
                        1901, though within the last period mentioned the dues fell from frs.11.50
                        to frs.9 per ton.</p>

                    <p>LONDON, June 2.</p>
                    <p>At a Conservative dinner at the Holborn Restaurant, Lord Landsdowne,
                        referring to the hope expressed by Sir Ed. Grey that the Anglo-Japanese
                        Agreement would be maintained, said that at no time on either side had there
                        been any question whatever of withdrawal from the alliance. It is our
                        opinion that, when the time comes when we must consider the renewal of the
                        agreement, the only practical question will be whether we should not seek
                        some means of strengthening and consolidating it. The alliance has been a
                        potent instrument lor maintaining peace, and if it be possible so to modify
                        it that it would prevent the spread of a conflagration when it has begun,
                        but prevent the conflagration from breaking out, all true lovers of peace
                        would recommend such modifications ,</p>
                    <p>There has never been a moment when our relations with France were upon a
                        firmer base, and if the inner history of the anxious mouths lately passed be
                        ever written, it will show that our understanding with France has greatly
                        mitigated the friction and trouble inevitable when a great war is still in
                        progress. Our alliance with Japan and our agreement with France are alike
                        with no selfish or aggressive purpose in view. Our sole object has been to
                        secure peace and restrict the evils of war. (R.)</p>

                    <p>PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT'S OFFER OF SERVICES.</p>
                    <p>WASHINGTON, June 3.</p>
                    <p>Count Cassini called on President Roosevelt yesterday. The President
                        expressed the earnest hope,as a friend of Russia, that she would seek to
                        conclude peace with Japan in response to the wish of the entire civilised
                        world. The prolongation of the war would mean increased Japanese demands. He
                        pointed out that Russia could hardly hope to win, and that influenced solely
                        by motives of humanity he offered his services as a mediator or an
                        intermediary in any way acceptable to Russia. Count Cassini replied that he
                        was without instructions, but that be personally believed that Russia would
                        continue the war, because the moment is not advantageous for the discussion

                        <p>A most unfortunate and serIous affray took place yesterday evening in
                            Sisters-street, Alexandria, in which a member of the Alexandria City
                            Police (an Italian) was seriously implicated While in plain clothes he
                            had a discussion with a compatriot in a drinking place in the street The
                            subject of the discussion is believed to have been a woman, and the two
                            Italians grew more and more excited until from words they came to blows.
                            The policeman drew a loaded revolver and held it at his compatriot in a
                            menacing manner. The latter sprang at him and in a fierce struggle
                            endeavoured to disarm his opponent But the policeman succeeded in
                            holding on to the weapon, and, getting his arms free, he emptied the
                            contents of two of the chambers into the man’s body, who fell writhing
                            to the floor. The injured man was at once conveyed to the European
                            Hospital, and it is not expected that the two wounds he sustained will
                            be mortal. According to the latest accounts he is progressing as
                            satisfactorily as can be expected under the circumstances. The policeman
                            was arrested and disarmed, and subsequently handed over by the
                            authorities of the Alexandria City Police to the Italian Consulate. It
                            is needless to state that he will be expelled from the police force.</p>

                    <p>Considerable sensation has occurred in Cairo owing to the report that two
                        deaths have taken place in the Capital within the last few days as the
                        result of vaccination.</p>
                    <p>The German Consulate has opened an enquiry into the circumstances attending
                        the death of Mr. Heinrich Klein, a young German who died at one of the Cairo
                        Hospitals on Thursday evening after an illness of some days, which is
                        alleged to have been occasioned by some vaccine given him by a local medical
                        man.</p>
                    <p>A Cairo contemporary remarked yesterday —</p>
                    <p>Une certaine emotion regne en villa a la suite de deux deces survenus a la
                        suite de vaccination. On dit—et nous reproduisons ces bruits sous toutes
                        reserves—que les instruments qui out servi a l'operation n’auraient pas ete
                        suffisamment sterilises. Sur trois cas de vaccination, deux ont eu une issue
                        fatale.</p>
                    <p>It is sincerely to be hoped that a satisfactory explanation of these cases
                        will be discovered, as if it is found that the deaths ensued owing to the
                        reason given above, a serious set back might be given to the progress of
                        vaccination in Egypt. During last year 408,981 successful vaccinations were
                        performed, as compared with 408,856 in 1903. it would be a great pity if
                        this steady progress in vaccinating were checked owing to the alarm arising
                        from the fatality in Cairo. The importance of vaccination in Egypt is very
                        great, and we may mention that, out of 185 cases of small-pox which were
                        reported in Cairo last year, one-half occurred amongst the European
                        population, more especially amongst the Greeks. This large number of cases
                        amongst Europeans appears to be due to want of vaccination on their part.
                        Many of the Greek patients were treated at the hospital for infectious
                        diseases, and it is reported that those who contracted the disease severely
                        and died had never been vaccinated.</p>
                    <p>The vaccine produced at the Cairo Vaccine Institute has up to now given very
                        satisfactory results. There were no less than 4,155 cases of small-pox, of
                        which 854 terminated fatally, in Egypt last year.</p>

                        pressed on the Government from every quarter, work on the new school cannot

                            able to ward off defeat. The chief features during last month’s cricket

                            B Davies, J D. Streeter, the fine bowling displays by Messrs. W.

                            be what one would call first-class in England, but they are precious

                    <head>NEW MUSIC HALL FOR ALEXANDRIA</head>
                    <p>Alexandria is at last within measurable distance of possessing a music ball
                        which will be worthy of the city. We say this in no disparagement of the
                        establishment, known as the Alhambra, which has been conducted with
                        remarkable success by Mr. Conegliano for some years past Mr. Conegliano,
                        however, has hitherto laboured under a great disadvantage in that his tenure
                        of the theatre site has been a most uncertain one. Now, as we announced
                        yesterday, the proprietor of the Alhambra has signed a ten years’ lease with
                        the owner of the ground, Mr. G. B. Alderson, and his tenure is secure et
                        least for that period.</p>
                    <p>The result of this agreement is that a new music-ball is to be built on the
                        plot of ground contiguous to the present Alhambra, on the south side, which
                        is now used as a garden. The theatre will be larger than the existing one,
                        with attractive boxes and the additional feature of a gallery. It will be
                        entirely constructed of iron, and will comprise every modern contrivance
                        against the chances of an outbreak of fire. The plans have been prepared and
                        are to be sent in a few days to England, where the theatre is to be built
                        and sent out here to be put together.</p>

                    <head>HUTCHINSON NURSING HOME</head>
                    <p>Our Cairo Correspondent writes"--- Cairenes, unlike Alexandrians, cannot
                        complain of a want of Nursing Homes, for there are now three such
                        institutions in Cairo, the latest being the Hutchinson Nursing Home, which
                        was opened about a fortnight ago and which I have had an opportunity of
                        visiting. This horne is well adapted to both surgical and medical cases, the
                        rooms on the second floor being set apart for the former cases and those on
                        toe first floor for the latter. The tourist, too, who has come to Egypt for
                        change and rest, and who is not actually ill, but feels himself unable to
                        stand the bustle and racket of hotel life, will find himself well-cared for
                        here, and he will also have the services of the resident medical officer at
                        his disposal, should he require them. Patients, however, may be attended by
                        their own doctors.</p>
                    <p>A visit to this Home shows the great care with which every detail in the
                        planning and furnishing of it has been thought out, and not a single
                        possible want of a patient has been left unsupplied. Every room is fitted
                        with the latest electrical conveniences, in the way of stoves, lights, and
                        fans, is furnished in the most luxurious manner, and has the advantage of
                        being differently arranged and furnished to any of its companions, so that
                        every taste is suited. Separate parte of the house are also apportioned to
                        the nurses, to the Goanese servants, and to the Arabs. There are in all
                        twelve single rooms set apart for patients, and in addition to these they
                        have both an exceedingly comfortable and well-arranged diningroom and a
                        lounge which will compare favorably with any first-class hotel drawing
                        room.</p>

                    <head>KARIANS IN EGYPT</head>
                    <p>Prof. Sayce has completed a study of some Lydian and Karian inscriptions
                        discovered in Egypt, and lately published in a more or less revised form.
                        Two new characters --one identical with the Cypriote to and the other with
                        the apparent value of a — are the chief features of these, and it should be
                        noted that most of them are to be need boustrophedon. The paper will shortly
                        be published in the Proceedings of the Society of which Prof. Sayce is the
                        President, and, with his former communications on the subject, make up all
                        the Karian and Lydian texts yet discovered. Most of them are of but a few
                        lines each, and the Lydian and Karian alphabets seem to be the greatest
                        acquisitions that they have yet yielded. It is a pity that those interested
                        in the subject do not turn their attention to the Greco-Egyptian Magic
                        Papyri, among the so-called "gibberish” incantations of which are several
                        words ending ia -anda, which may not improbably turn out to be Karian. The
                        settlement of many Karian mercenaries in the Fayoum and elsewhere must
                        certainly have left traces in the literature of their adopted country, could

                    <dateline>Nicosia, May 36.</dateline>
                    <p>The idea of combining together for trade purpose* cannot yet be said to have
                        made much headway among the commercial community of Cyprus. The people of
                        Larnaca and Limassol are now, however, to have an opportunity of becoming
                        familiarised with this method of doing business, as a steamship company has
                        lately been formed at both places, mainly for cargo trade with Egypt, while
                        an important brick and tile factory has just commenced operations at
                        Limassol as a societe anonyme.</p>
                    <p>It is to be hoped that the two steamship companies will not work on rival
                        lines, but that they will see the wisdom of uniting together and so acquire
                        sufficient power to do a useful and profitable carrying trade with our
                        nearest markets.</p>
                    <p>If the brick and tile factory succeeds in producing good-building material at
                        a moderate price it should have a successful future. There is an evident
                        tendency in this island to use roofing tiles in place of the mud roofs, and
                        it is regarded rather as a mark of superiority for a villager to roof his
                        building. Several mud cottages were washed away in the Limassol district
                        during the last winter season, and this should stimulate the taste for
                        bricks, which will not be so easily affected by wet weather.</p>

                        on vegetable oils used in the manufacture of soap from the £2 per 100 okes
                        heretofore charged ; provided that such oils are rendered unfit tor
                        alimentary purposes at the expense of the importer and under the supervision
                        of the Customs. This reduction of duty should give a considerable impetus to
                        the local soap industry. Some years ago there were seven or eight soap
                        factories in the island, the import duty on oils then being at the rate now
                        fixed by the new order. The duty, however, was raised to £2 per 100 okes in
                        order to prevent the importation of cotton seed oil for adulteration with
                        the native olive oil, and as a consequence this industry was crippled and
                        there exists to-day only one small soap factory. It is generally felt that
                        the reduction in the duty is a wire measure.</p>

                        will go to England together.</p>
                    <p>A large number of persons are leaving Egypt on Tuesday by the P. and O. S.S.
                        "Arabia." Among the Alexandria departures are Mr. Mr. and Mrs. Haselden, Mr.
                        B. S. Seed end family, and Miss Evans, Mrs. W. T. Smith and Miss Lamb.
                        Altogether about 30 bookings from Alexandria have been taken by the

                    <head>DE VERE TRUST</head>
                    <p>The usual half-yearly meeting of the above Trust was held by kind permission
                        of Idris Bey Ragheb. M W. G. M of Egypt, in the committee room of the Grand
                        Lodge on Tuesday evening last, 30th May. There were present: Dr. W. C.
                        Mackenzie, Messrs. P. Plunkett, and F. A. Beale, president. The minutes of
                        the last half-yearly and extraordinary meet-ing were read, passed, and
                        confirmed. Mr. G. Scott-Dalgleish wrote regretting his inability to he
                        present owing to another meeting. The President next produced the
                        balance-sheet for the half-year ending May, which, after being audited, was
                        unanimously accepted The balance-sheet shows a net total of credit amounting
                        to L.E. 387.621, a considerable increase over the balance of the last
                        half-year. It was notified that the monies had been invested in accordance
                        with the wishes of the trustees and that the bonds had been deposited with
                        the Trust bankers.</p>
                    <p>A letter was read from Mr. Jas. Edgell, J. P. (the trustee in England) who
                        was watching the local trustee's interests over Dora and Reggie De Vere. A
                        good amount was given of the program they were making with their stadias,
                        etc. It was proposed that a hearty vote of thanks be accorded to Mr. Edgell
                        for his greet kindness to three orphan children ; he had them at his home on
                        every occasion, and be was using every endeavour to gain admission into the
                        Duke of York's Royal Military School for Reggie, the necessary certificates
                        being asked for from the trustees. A cordial vote of thanks was also
                        expressed to the Permanent Committee of the National Grand Lodge of Egypt,
                        for their kindness in again voting the sum of L.E. 20 from the Benevolent
                        Fund for the year 1904.</p>
                    <p>The President intimated that he had now been three years president of the
                        Trust and in thanking the trustees for their help and sup port, tendered his
                        resignation. Dr. W. C. Mackenzie proposed re-election, strongly urged by Mr.
                        Plunkett. The President, whilst acknowledging</p>
                    <p>lodging the honor and confidence of the vote, thought that as the work was
                        now all in a satisfactory and smooth condition, some other member of the
                        Trust should have a turn as president. Dr. Mackenzie still strongly urged
                        Mr. Beale to accept the position for a farther period, which was finally
                        agreed to by him. At the same time the trustees wished it to be placed on
                        record that they fully appreciated the fact that it was owing to his
                        untiring efforts that the funds were in such a satisfactory conuition.</p>

                        <p>Sir.–– I must protest against the arguments of "Pigeon" in to-day's
                            issue. I daresay that when bull-baiting was abolished as pastimes as
                            cruel were cited in justification, as "Pigeon" now cites fox-hunting. It
                            is not because we are not in England that we should abstain from using
                            our influence to prevent cruelty, though unfortunately this argumentt
                            seems to prevail a great deal. The S.P.C.A. and the authorities do all
                            they can to improve matters, but the average European, Britisher
                            included, however revolted he may be by the particular case before him
                            is generally too indifferent to take the small amount of trouble
                            necessary to ensure at any rate the punishment of one offender, and the
                            consequent gradual improvement of the lot of dumb creatures generally in
                            Egypt. We cannot get things right all at once ; let us do all we can to
                            arrive at this by degrees, Yours truly, </p>

                        <p>Dear Sir, –– "Pigeon," in your yesterday's issue, urges the introduction
                            of pigeon shooting within the premises of the Alexandria Sporting Club
                            on the plea that we are not in England and therefore the non-English
                            members of the club might do as they like. I think this is the very
                            reason why the butchery of harmless birds should be tabooed from a
                            cosmopolitan club. To introduce a game or pastime which is distasteful
                            to some of the members and has the expressed disapprobation of their
                            Queen, is, to say the least, in very bad taste. However, I suppose
                            British memberes have a right to kick against a general club, started
                            since the British flag first floated over Alexandria, being turned into
                            a slaughter ground. ––Yours truly, </p>

                        <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                        <p>Sir, –– My attention has just been called to a letter in your issue of
                            May 8, on "Pumps in Egypt," signed by F. Allen, director of Messrs.
                            Allen, Alderson &amp; Co. The only possible for the explanation in this
                            letter of the names of J. and H. Gwynne and Gwynne &amp; Co., is to lead
                            your readers to assume that Messrs. Allen, Alderson &amp; Co. had given
                            up at their own desire the agencies of these two firms, now combined and
                            known as Gwynnnes, Limited. This, however, was very far from being the
                            case. The firm of Allen Alderson was originally started in 1868 by Mr.
                            Stafford S. Allen as S.S. Allen &amp; Co., with J. and H. Gwynne and
                            Ransome, Sims, and Heads' agencies. After the death of Mr. S.S. Allen
                            (his firm at that time holding the agency for centrifugal pumps for
                            Egypt of J. and H. Gwynne) I was of the opinion that the terms of the
                            agreement were not being carried out in their entirety by the new firm
                            of A. A. &amp; Co. I therefore in 1872 paid a visit to Egypt and my
                            investigations fully confirmed what I anticipated, and I then terminated
                            the agreement. I need not refer further to this subjet, or the
                            subsequent reason for Messrs. Gwynne &amp; Co. discontinuing their
                            agency. I wish to call your attention, however, to one or two misleading
                            statements in Mr. Allen's letter.</p>
                        <p>(1) As to the general efficiency of centrifugal pumps: –– Mr. Allen says,
                            "We are prepared to guarantee in all sizes about 80% mechanical
                            efficiency with these pumps." Such a statement from one who professes to
                            be intimate with the subject does the cause of centrifugal pumps much
                            harm, as it should be well-known that in certain sizes and lifts such
                            results cannot be attained. I scarcely think that Mr. Allen's
                            principals, Messrs. Ruston Proctor &amp; Co., will be gratified with Mr.
                            Allen's exposure of their methods in designing, namely, that they sent
                            to the Continent, purchased centrifugal pumps, tested them, examined
                            them, took them to pieces, copied them, and re-introduced them under
                            some other name.</p>
                        <p>(2) Mr. Allen states, –– "The efficiency of some of these pumps is very
                            good and much in advance of what British makers are as a rule disposed
                            to guarantee." I entirely repudiate this statement and can prove that
                            large numbers of my company's pumps have been at work for many years and
                            have, and are still giving out, over 80% efficiency, that the best pumps
                            made on the Continent and elsewhere are with some slight modifications
                            copies of the pumps made and introduced from time to time by Gwynnes,
                            that in other cases they have been re-patented or re-introduced under
                            other names (as Mr. Allen's principals appear to be doing in the case of
                            their new pump), as can be seen from a perusal of John Gwynne's
                            Centrifugal Pump Patent No. 13,577 of 1851, with the thirty-five (35)
                            claims set out therein.</p>
                        <p>I challenge Mr. Allen to prove that any of the pumping installations made
                            by either his principals or by Continental engineers have given better
                            results on the same lifts and under similar conditions, to those
                            manufactured by my company, and I have no doubt that I can arrange for
                            as many sets and sizes as Mr. Allen can name to be tested by independent
                            experts with the machinery that he is prepared to champion.</p>
                        <p>It may be that Continental engineers have reduced the consumption of
                            steam in ther engines (much increasing the first cost) by the
                            introduction of elaborate valve gear, superheated steam, &amp;c., but it
                            has yet to be shown whether the introduction of these expensive engines
                            will prove in the long run a real economy in Egypt, where the atmosphere
                            is charged with large quantities of sand and grit. ––I am, etc.,</p>

                        <p>Monsieur le Directeur de l'"Egyptian Gazette."</p>
                        <p>Jusqui'ici l'Egypte etait affranchie de ces innombrables decrets dont on
                            commerce a etre excede en Europe. Cela ne contribuait pas peu a faire de
                            ce beau pays une contres privilegiee sous le rapport de la liberte
                            individuelle, dont la population d'ailleurs tant europeenne qu'indigene
                            ne songeait pas a abuser.</p>
                        <p>Malheureusement, la vallee du Nil n'a rieu perdu pour attendre et ces
                            derniers temps ont ete pour elle exceptionnellement feconds en "arretes"
                            de toutes sortes, qui doivent theoriquement etre consideres comme
                            excellents, mais qui n'en sont pas moins des entraves a la liberte dont
                            je viens de parler.</p>
                        <p>Il semble par la promulgation du reglement regissant le commerce des
                            armes qu'on veuille inaugurer en Egypte l'ere des lois vexatoires, qui
                            etaient jusqui'ici une specialite de l'empire moscovite. Ce reglement
                            est presque la reproduction des lois en vigueur au Congo, au Cameroun,
                            au Niger, au Senegal, dans l'Ouganda et au Soudan, pays qui sont encore
                            a l'etat sauvage et qui ne sauraient raisonnablement etre compares au
                            notre.</p>
                        <p>Il suffit pour constater le caractere tyrannique de la loi, de lire les
                            articles qui soummettent les armuriers aux visites domiciliaires de la
                            police a tout instant du jour ou de la nuit, et qui les obligent de
                            tenir des registres ou ils devront relater "toutes les ventes effectuees
                            avec indication de l'espec d'armes vendues, du numero d'inscription, des
                            noms, prenoms, domicile, profession de l'acheteur, le prix d'achat, la
                            provenance et le prix de ente de l'article."</p>
                        <p>On se fait deja une idee de ce que sera un etablissement mis a la
                            discretion des moindres caprices des agents de la police locale. Quant
                            aux registres, comment l'armurier pourra-t-il, dans un pays si mefiant,
                            faire decliner le nom veritable du client pour le consigner dans un
                            registre destine a la police. Faudra-t-il l'obliger de se pourvoir d'un
                            extrait d'etat civil et de venir en compagnie de deux temoins? C'est la,
                            on le voit, une loi qui ne pourra jamais passer dans la pratique. Quant
                            aux prix d'achat et de vente, on ne comprend guere l'interet que peut
                            avoir le Gouvernement a les savoir, alors que les armes sont estimees a
                            la Douane, pour la perception des droite.</p>
                        <p>Toutes ces mesures, sussi inutiles qu'arbitraires, ne serviront en somme
                            qu'a causer des ennuis aux armuriers et de l'embarras a la police.</p>
                        <p>Le Gouvernment a declare, pour s'excuser, s'inquieter du grand nombre de
                            fusils qui entrent annuellement en Egypte. Cette augmentation est
                            pourtant justifee par l'enorme extension de la culture de terres, qui
                            exige une grande distribution des fusils aux gardiens, par la qualite
                            inferieure des fusils qui sont hors d'usage au bout de quelques mois et
                            enfin par la chasse qui est toujours plus en vogue dans ce pays au fur
                            et a mesure que sa prosperite augmente.</p>
                        <p>Il n'y a donc pas lieu de redouter une telle progression dans le debit
                            des armes ; ce debit rentre dans les causes normales de la richesse du
                            pays. D'ailleurs la loi de Novembre dernier a eu pour effet de
                            restreindre sensiblement la vente des fusils.</p>

                    <head>WORLD'S OLDEST INHABITANT.</head>
                    <p>The world's oldest inhabitant is said to be a giant tortoise, who spends his
                        time near a stove in a naturalist's place at St. Louis. Toto is his name,
                        and we are told he was grown when Columbus sailed. He was middle-aged and of
                        family when the Puritans landed on Plymouth Rock. When Jamestown was founded
                        he had a city of his own. Age had begun to deaden his faculties when
                        Napoleon swept Europe. Toto may live to see Maculay's New Zealander explore
                        the ruins of London.</p>
                    <p>A mark was put on his shell early in the seventeenth century. He has carried
                        the naked children of the Seychelles Islands ; he has carried the midshipmen
                        of the forgotten wooden frigates of Nelson's days. Perhaps Drake's hardy
                        mariners wrote him. The children of the World's Fair were his last riders.
                        For centuries Toto has lived and wooed. Tigers have broken their talons his
                        sharded back. Elephants have vainly tried to crush him. Balls have glanced
                        harmlessly from his shell. To-day he huddles by the fire, the one
                        indestructible, undying animal of Earth. Like the Indian and Yogi, he dozes
                        and dreams, and only asks warmth and a bite to eat.</p>
                    <p>The deep indentations on Toto's shell determine his age. It is certain that
                        he was full grown when Captain Cook sailed in the Pacific and gave his name
                        to fame. Toto survived, and will survive, perhaps when all the merry tots
                        who have ridden him die grey-haired men and women.</p>

                    <head>SUPERSTITION OF THE WOMAN-SPECULATOR</head>
                    <p>A sneaking belief in "luck" or "ill-luck" is innate in most people, but it is
                        said that for blind downright faith in good or bad omens, the woman who
                        dabbles in stocks or shares is hard to outdo.</p>
                    <p>Many a woman speculator never stirs without her "mascot," and should she
                        inadvertently omit to have it with her when about to embark on some
                        important business, she will let the most promising opportunities pass
                        rather than risk a venture unaided by her pet fetish.</p>
                    <p>As she snatches a hasty breakfast in the intervals of studying the money
                        columns of the daily paper, she seeks to read the future in the grounds of
                        her coffee cup, and settles her daily business in advance by the aid of this
                        unfailing medium.</p>
                    <p>If the number of the car in which she drives into town is an unlucky one, or
                        should she catch sight of a black cat, a person with a squint, or a
                        one-legged man, she knows to a certainty that misfortune is in store for
                        her.</p>
                    <p>Some women select the quaintest and most original talismans to ward off the
                        "evil eye." One pins her faith to a weird and fanciful Maori charm with
                        perhaps some sombre past history she knows not of, another to a tiny
                        coralled hand with uplifted dagger of Italian manufacture, or perhaps a
                        bronze lizard, a crystal pig, or a rabbit's foot. Others, again, see special
                        virtue in a lucky sixpence or in some bent or crooked coin, to whose aid
                        they may attribute all the lucky deals which have been carried out with
                        success.</p>
                    <p>Seeing the moon through glass is regarded by the woman-speculator as an omen
                        of disaster should she embark on any venture during the month.</p>

                    <head>MALARIA IN ITALY</head>
                    <p>An interesting report has been issued at Rome on the work accomplished by the
                        Red Cross Society in the Roman Campagna in combating the malaria. The
                        society has seven stations in the Campagna, and its methods are very
                        systematic. The population of the Agro Romano consists of two classes ––
                        those who live there all the year round and those who only come down to the
                        plain from the mountains for a certain season of the year. A further
                        classification divides the permanent and temporary population of this vast
                        district into those who are considered immune from malaria and those who are
                        liable to it. These latter receive from the society five to six tabloids of
                        quinine a day for a week, and then one to two tabloids daily according to
                        their age; the former one to two tabloids a day throughout the bad season
                        without the heavy preliminary doses applied in the case of malarial
                        subjects. The results of this treatment have been to diminish the amount of
                        malaria in the Campagna very considerably, so that last year out of 12,061
                        persons who took the prescribed doses of quinine only 800 caught malarial
                        fever, that is to say, between 6 and 7 per cent. Such is the result of the
                        society's fifth year of work.</p>
                    <p>In addition to quinine most houses most houses, all railway stations, octroi
                        offices, and public buildings in the neighborhood of Rome have their windows
                        covered with close wire netting, and the octroi officials wear wire masks
                        towards sundown, which give them the appearance of bandits in disguise.</p>

                        Backacke Kidney Pills have done me. They have saved my life. Before I began
                        using them, the doctor said I couldn't live another three months, but was a
                        year and a quarter ago and <hi rend="italic">I'm as well to-day as ever I
                            was in my life</hi>.</p>
                    <p>"Before using Doan's Pills I was suffering from Bright's disease and dropsy.
                        My body was so swollen that I couldn't get my clothes or boots on ; the
                        pains in my back were fearfully agonizing, and I could hardly breathe.
                        Though I went under hospital treatment, and had the best of medical advice,
                        I kept getting worse and worse until I began with Doan's Pills. I cannot
                        speak too highly of this medicine, for it did me good from the first, and
                        although it was <hi rend="italic">a year and a quarter ago</hi> that I was
                        cured, I am still in splendid health."</p>

                        can't stoop, can't eat, can't sleep, and who seldom smile –– are recommended
                        to try Doan's Backache Kidney Pills ; for Doan's Pills help the kidneys to
                        purify the blood and drive out the dissolved or crystallised poisons that
                        ––when kept back in the body by clogged kidneys –– cause fatal kidney
                        complaints such as dropsy, stricture, Bright's disease and diabetes.</p>

                    <p>It is exceedingly gratifying to find that the proposal of the A.S.C. to
                        introduce pigeon shooting on the club ground, is meeting with strenuous
                        opposition. It will be simply disgraceful if the committee persist in their
                        intention, and if the members of the club permit them to carry out such a
                        retrograde step.</p>
                    <p>Surely the time has passed even in Egypt for fresh opportunities to be
                        created for the practice of cruelty such as that involved in the shooting of
                        innocent birds for gambling purposes, disguised under the name of sport.
                        Even the few who defend the practice cannot deny its cruelty, and have
                        nothing to urge in its favor, merely contenting themselves with comparing it
                        with other undoubtedly cruel pastimes.</p>
                    <p>How on earth can cruelties practised in England or on the continent condone
                        wrong done in Egypt? This, too, is not a question of the abolition of pigeon
                        shooting at the Velodrome, but one of the institution at the A.S.C., a club
                        mainly, though by no means entirely, supported by British residents.</p>
                    <p>And what steps are its influential patrons taking to protest against the
                        course adopted by the club committee? Many have left Egypt for the summer
                        vacation, but the names of many who have not yet gone will readily be called
                        to mind, and it will be shameful if they permit this to take place without a
                        word of remonstrance against the inquity of the thing.</p>
                    <p>People seem somehow to be tongue-tied in Egypt, and to have so many diverse
                        interests to study that they are afraid to open their mouths. Letters to the
                        paper we get, but they are mostly written under<hi rend="italic">
                            noms-de-plume</hi>, and as a consequence do not carry anything like the
                        weight they would if the writers signed their names. And in this case it
                        ought not to require much effort to append one's name to a protest against
                        cruelty to poor, defenceless birds, and wanton destruction of animal life. I
                        hope to see within the next day or two a still more emphatic expression of
                        opinion than that already made in the columns of the "Gazette."</p>
                    <p>It seems somewhat remarkable to find in a hospital report that it is claimed
                        that the year 1904 has been "a year of advance," in consequence of the
                        "marked progres in numbers" (of patients treated) that has taken place.
                        After this one may expect prison or lunatic asylum authorities making it a
                        matter of congratulation that the number of inmates shows similar "marked
                        progress."</p>
                    <p>For the inference to be drawn is certainly that, like crime, disease is on
                        the increase in this country. The hospital to which I refer is that of the
                        C.M.S. at Old Cairo, whose medical mission seems to be attended with the
                        same amount of success that generally follows missionary work when directed
                        towards alleviating human suffering.</p>
                    <p>As for the main purpose for which missionary societies are established, the
                        following extract from the report tells its own tale :</p>
                    <p>"Tangible spiritual results are few indeed, and were those our only guarantee
                        of success, and were it not for the knowledge that results are in higher
                        hands, it would be truly hard, having put one's hand to the plough, not to
                        look back."</p>
                    <p>Nor is the C.M.S. in Cairo alone in its lament over its non-success in
                        proselytising. Major-General Sir Alexander Tulloch, in a letter to the
                        London "Times," quotes the following statement made by a medical missionary
                        working among the mountains in the north of India.</p>
                    <p>"I have been at work now for 15 years. I do not believe I have made one
                        sincere convert, but I have operated successfully for stone on over 1,000
                        natives."</p>
                    <p>It is impossible to shut one's eyes to the fact that an immense amount of
                        good is done by foreign missionaries, but it is equally impossible to doubt
                        that it is done in a <hi rend="italic">very</hi> different direction to that
                        generally understood to be the one intended by "the kind-hearted old ladies
                        who so liberally subscribe (I quote Major-General Tulloch) to the conversion
                        of the poor benighted heathern who bow down to stocks and stone." Had it not
                        been for the openings that presented themselves for medical and educational
                        work –– opportunities of which the quick-witted Americans were not slow to
                        avail themselves –– foreign missions would have been in a far more hopeless
                        position to-day than they are.</p>
                    <p>But the old original tale is told, and the pretence made that the real good
                        done is only a secondary consideration, and thus the money for the support
                        of missions is obtained under what, to speak plainly, are nothing but</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>false pretences, and the old stock tales of "conversions" are as greedily
                        swallowed now as they were when as a boy I attended the many missionary
                        meetings to which my good mother took me.</p>
                    <p>But I used to do little sums in arithmetic, and sometimes was fairly
                        staggered at the exceeding great cost of "conversions," and as my eyes
                        became open to the misery and sin around me on every side, and the want of
                        help at home, I somehow lost interest in foreign missions, feeling that the
                        money they cost could be better spent in England, although it has been only
                        recently that I have been able to estimate the cock-and-bull stories to
                        which I listened in the days of my youth, at their true value.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Rudolph has rendered yeoman's service to the cause of humanity in the
                        past, but he probably never helped the cause of truth and honesty more than
                        by his letter in last Wednesday's paper. Nor did he err on the side of want
                        of charity, for he could have made out a much stronger case than he did, and
                        I should not wonder if there is a good deal of flatter in the dove cotes,
                        not unmixed with anxiety as to what further relevations he may make as to
                        so-called conversions of Jews.</p>
                    <p>"A Native of Upper Egypt" has also had something to say as to missions to
                        Mohamedans, and altogether more than a little light has been thrown on
                        mission work during the past few days.</p>
                    <p>A very valuable book entitled "The Principles of Heredity," by Dr. G.
                        Archdall Reid, has lately been published, about which I hope to be able to
                        write at some length when I have completed my study of it. Valuable as a
                        medical treatise on a subject upon which hitherto no text books have
                        appeared, the technical part of the work is small compared with the matter
                        that the general reader can appreciate, and the concluding chapters, in
                        which the subject is approached from the mental and religious point of view,
                        are instructive in the highest degree.</p>
                    <p>The author makes frequent extracts from the writings of Professor James of
                        Harvard University, whose recently published work, "Varieties of Religious
                        Experience," is one that no student of the different phases of religious
                        beliefs, emotion, and experience should omit to read. It is in the Ramleh
                        Library, and perhaps is also obtainable at Cairo.</p>
                    <p>The volume consists of the Gifford lectures delivered at Edinburgh University
                        in 1901-2, and it contains many very striking features, one of the most
                        interesting of which is the discussion of the phenomenon of conversion. The
                        views of so eminent a psychologist on such a matter are well worth studying,
                        however disposed orthodox theologians may be to pick holes in them, and to
                        dispute the professor's conclusions.</p>
                    <p>After an exhaustive analysis of religious experiences, which extends over
                        nearly 500 pages, the professor asks, "Is the existence of so many religious
                        types and sects and creeds regrettable?"</p>
                    <p>And to this question he answers emphatically "No," giving many cogent reasons
                        for this conclusion, which I regret I have not sufficient space now to
                        enumerate. The high spiritual discernment of the author is evidenced all
                        throughout the book –– a very rare thing in purely scientific literature, ––
                        which greatly adds to its value.</p>
                    <p>As I have not of late signed my full name to these nates, and, in this paper,
                        have remarked on the necessity of signatures to personal expressions of
                        opinion, I will append mine this week, although it is pretty generally

                    <head>GREEK DEBT CONVERSION</head>
                    <p>The rumours which have been for some time in circulation pointing to a
                        conversion of the foreign debt of Greece are taking more definite shape. The
                        process, it is said, will be similar to that employed in connection with the
                        Turkish debt. As with that affair, a French syndicate has the matter in
                        hand, and two of its members have been despatched to Athens to impress upon
                        the Greek Government the advantages of unification. Terms are not likely to
                        be arranged for some little time at least to come, but no doubt they will
                        represent an improvement upon the present position, though in return for
                        this something will have to be sacrificed in the way of further
                        developments, and, as we know, the revenues of the country have been on an
                        improving scale for a considerable period. British holders of Greek
                        obligations are numerous, and it is to be hoped that they will insist
                        against the interference with the powers of the International Commission,
                        which was appointed in 1897-8. The Guaranteed Loan would, of course, be
                        excluded from the scheme.</p>

                    <head type="sub">RETURNS OF SHIPPING AND TONNAGE.</head>
                    <p>The returns of the navigation through the Suez Canal for the year 1904, as
                        compared with those of the two previous years 1902 and 1903, show that the
                        net tonnage for the pasy year increased by 1,494,547 tons as compared with
                        that of 1903, and by 2,153,422 tons as compared with that of 1902.
                        Notwithstanding the reduction of 50 centimes in the tonnage dues which took
                        effect from the 1st January, 1903, the transit receipts during that year
                        amounted to fr. 103,620,268, or only fr. 99,752 less than those of 1902,
                        while those for last year amounted to fr. 115,818,479, and were higher than
                        in any previous year since the opening of the Canal. The increase in the
                        tonnage passing through the Suez Canal during 1904 is owing to heavy
                        shipments of wheat from India to Europe, and to the large quantities of coal
                        consigned to the East, which latter exceed by about 500,000 tons the
                        shipments during the year 1903, and which were, no doubt, principally for

                    <p>The number of vessels which passed through the Canal was 3,708 in 1902, 3,761
                        in 1903, and 4,237 in 1904, of which 2,165 in 1902, 2,278 in 1903, and 2,679
                        in 1904 carried the British flag. There has been an increase of 1,430,376
                        tons last year as compared with 1903 in the tonnnage of British vessels,
                        which amounted to 6,772,911 tons in 1902, 7,403,553 tons in 1903, and
                        8,833,929 tons in 1904. During the same period, the tonnage of German
                        vessels has increased from 1,707,322 tons in 1902 to 1,773,265 tons in 1903,
                        and to 1,969,661 tons in 1904.</p>
                    <p>The percentage of British vessels and their net tonnage increased in 1904,
                        being 63.2 and 65.9 respectively, as against 60.6 and 62.2 in 1903 and 58.4
                        and 60.2 in 1902. The percentage of German vessels and their net tonnage was
                        12.8 and 14.7 respectively, as compared with 13.1 and 14.9 in 1903, and 12.9
                        and 15.2 in 1902, while the percentage of net tonnage of the other maritime
                        nations using the Canal in 1904 remained practically stationary as compared
                        with the preceding year.</p>
                    <p>Of 3,289 merchant-vessels and vessels in ballast, of a net tonnage of
                        10,316,600 tons, passing through the Canal, 2,433 ships, of a net tonnage of
                        7,847,307 tons, were British, being fully 74 per cent. of the number and
                        fully 76.06 per cent. of the tonnage ; 356, or 13.8 per cent., were German
                        vessels, whose tonnage was 10.5 per cent. of the whole ; France, Holland,
                        Norway, Austria-Hungary, and Italy combined furnishing a total of 10.5 per
                        cent. of the tonnage carrying trade to the East through the Suez Canal.</p>
                    <p>In the ten years 1891-1900, the annual net tonnage ranged from 8,698,777 tons
                        to 9,738,152 tons, and the transit receipts from fr. 83,422,101 to fr.
                        90,623,608 The average of the net tonnage was 8,588,947 tons ; while in 1904
                        the net tonnage amounted to 13,401,835 tons, and the transit receipts to fr.
                        115,818,479. The mean net tonnage per vessel, which in 1881 was only 1,517
                        tons, rose from 2,067 tons in 1891 to 2,926 tons in 1901, and amounted to
                        3,163 tons in 1904. During last year the Canal was used 63 times by steamers
                        exceeding 150 metres (492 feet) in length or more than 18 metres (59 feet)
                        in breadth, with a draught of over 7 metres 50 (24 feet 7 inches).</p>
                    <p>The mean duration of passage for all vessels navigating the Canal was 17
                        hours 48 minutes in 1903 as compared with 18 hours 8 minutes in 1904, while
                        the percentage of vessels navigating by night amounted to 96.1 per cent. in
                        1903 as compared with 95.7 per cent. in 1904.</p>
                    <p>The percentage of vessels drawing less than 24 ft. 7 in. (7 m. 50 c.) was
                        83.3 in 1904 as against 84.9 in 1903, while that of vessels drawing more
                        than 24 ft. 7 in. was 16.7 in 1904 as compared with 15.1 in 1903. Up to the
                        end of the year 1901, the maximum draught allowed for vessels passing
                        through the Canal was fixed at 25 feet 7 inches, and during 1904, 705
                        vessels, drawing more than 24 feet 7 inches, used the Canal, as compared
                        with 566 in 1903 and 431 in 1902, representing a percentage of 11.6 in 1902,
                        15.1 in 1903, and 16.7 in 1904. Since the 1st January, 1902, the maximum
                        draught allowed has been raised to 26 feet 3 inches (8 metres), and during
                        last year 145 vessels, or 3.4 per cent., took advantage of this improvement.
                        During 1904 377 vessels passed through the Canal for the first time, of
                        which 92 belonged to shipping companies whose vessels regularly use the
                        Canal.</p>
                    <p>The number of troops carried through the Canal during last year amounted to
                        81,431 as against 80,583 in 1903, being an increase of 848. There was an
                        increase of 7,092 British, 190 Dutch, 137 Russian, 109 Portuguese, and 341
                        American, against a decrease of 4,222 French, 1,296 Italian, 1,202 Turkish,
                        and 18 German troops as compared with 1903. The number of civilian
                        passengers amounted to 90,708 in 1904 as against 89,272 in the preceding
                        year, being an increase of 1,436, while the number of pilgrims, emigrants,
                        and convicts was 38,706 in 1904, as compared with 25,362 in 1903, or an
                        increase of 13,344.</p>
                    <p>In the year 1870,26,758 civil and military passengers were carried through
                        the Canal ; in 1880 the number rose to 98,900, in 1890 to 161,352, in 1900
                        to 282,203, and in 1904 it amounted to 210,849, as against 195,232 in
                        1903.</p>

                    <head>THE GERMAN ARMY.</head>
                    <p>The text of the Bill passed recently, which alters the method of recruiting
                        the German Army, has just been officially released. Henceforward every
                        German who is medically fit will have to serve seven years in the active
                        army, from the age of twenty to twenty-seven and a day. He will then pass
                        into the first category of the Landwehr, in which he will remain five years,
                        and will then be enrolled in the second category until the 21st March of the
                        year in which he reaches the age of thirty-nine. During the seven years of
                        their active service the cavalry and artillery will have to remain three
                        years with the colours, and the infantry two years. The reservists of all
                        arms will have to serve eight weeks, at two different periods, and there are
                        also alterations in the service of the Landwehr. At the same time, the
                        numbers of the army are to be gradually increased, so that in 1910 the army
                        will include 505,039 men, 25,000 officers, 85,000 non-commissioned officers,
                        and 10,000 volunteers for a year. These figures do not include the marines,
                        the gendarmerie, and the soldiers serving in China. In this manner the
                        German army in 1910 will be increased to 633 battalions of infantry, 510
                        squadrons of cavalry, and 574 field batteries, while all the other branches
                        will be proportionally augmented. It is evident that the policy of the
                        Kaiser does not tend towards peace, for this enormous increase takes place
                        at a time when the Navy is also being brought up to first-class rank, while
                        on land the Russian army has been hopelessly defeated, and the stationary
                        population of France makes it harder every year to keep the army of the
                        Republic up to its normal standard.</p>

                    <p>The story of the dog who recently caused the discovery of a tragedy at
                        Bridgend by barking outside the house in which it occurred recalls a
                        sensational incident that took place in Grand Canary a few years ago (says
                        the "Chronicle"). A young American was mudered for his money in one of the
                        Spanish inns near the harbour, and his fox-terrier was carried off to a
                        plantation in the hills by one of the accomplices. Two whole years the later
                        the dog was brought back again to the town, and it immediately went to a
                        certain hole in the road, tried to scratch a hole in it, and howled so
                        piteously that it attracted the attention even of the Spanish policeman.
                        This led to the discovery of its master's body and the final conviction of
                        his murderer.</p>

                    <p>On a pu assister a une agreable surprise a la un de ce mois qui avait si mal
                        commence et qui semblait devoir se clore par une liquidation des plus
                        laborieuses. Contrairement a l'ordre normal, l'animation a reparu au moment
                        de la liquidation et la cote est remontee sur presque toute la ligne. Cet
                        effet, contraire a toutes les previsions, a ete determine par deux mobiles
                        principaux : d'une part, la defaite navale russe qui permet d'envisager la
                        paix comme prochaine et, de l'autre, les mesures de precaution prises par
                        les speculateurs trop engages qui avaient eu l'occasion lors des deux
                        dernieres liquidations de voir ce qu'il en coutait d'attendre au dernier
                        moment pour alleger des positions intenables. Ces allegements ont beaucoup
                        contribue a assainir la place, mais c'est au seul desastre russe qu'il faut
                        attribuer la hausse a Londres et par contre-coup en Egypte, dont le marche
                        depend surtout de Londres. Ajoutons a ce propos que les bourses de tous les
                        pays attendent impatiemment la paix et cela est si vrai que la Bourse de
                        Paris a ete elle-meme fort peu affectee par la nouvelle du desastre russe,
                        dans l'espoir sans doute que ce desastre, de tous le plus irreparable,
                        amenera enfin la paix.</p>
                    <p>Au debut de la periode que nous passons en revue, l'attention etait
                        concentrate presque uniquement sur la Daira Sanieh et sur les actions Credit
                        Foncier Egyptien. Aux termes de l'accord intervenu entre les deux societes
                        tout l'actif et le passif de la Daira passerait au Credit Foncier moyennant
                        un paiement par ce dernier de £.9.900.000 qu'il se procurerait par
                        l'emission de £.6.600.000 d'obligations (Avec un interet probable de 3%) et
                        de £.3.300.000 d'actions emises au cours de 825 francs. Ces deux emissions
                        sont deja garanties par deux syndicate. Les actions nouvelles du Credit
                        Foncier seront entierement reservees aux actionnaires actuels dans la
                        proportion d'une action nouvelle pour deux anciennes et de 50 actions
                        nouvelles pour une part de fondateur. Quant aux actions Daira, on dit
                        qu'elles seront payees a raison de 30 a 30 ½ £. les actions ordinaires et
                        200 £. les actions Deferred. Les porteurs de Daira's attendaient a beaucoup
                        mieux ou du moins escomptaient l'echange de leurs titres-contre des titres
                        Credit Foncier. Les actions Credit Foncier elles-memes n'ont guere profite
                        du nouvel etat de choses et, a moins qu'un mouvement a la hausse ne se
                        dessine bientot, l'emission des actions nouvelles Foncier ne pourrar
                        reussir.</p>
                    <p>De 29 1/8 au debut la Daira flechit graduellement a 28 11/16 ; on comprend
                        qu'a ce prix c'est un placement avantageux, meme si la liquidation de fin
                        octobre se fait seulement a £30. Par contre, la Fondateur Daira remonte de
                        178 £ a 185 acheteurs. Pour le Credit Foncier il se produit le meme
                        mouvement en sens inverse : l'action flechit de 832 a 826 pendant que la
                        Fondateur monte de 7500 fr. a 7900.</p>
                    <p>De 13 ½ au debut, l'Agricole flechit plus tard a 13 ¼ sous la pression des
                        ventes fin du mois, mais elle ne tarde pas a reprendre a la nouvelle que
                        l'emission d'actions au pair, au lieu d'etre retardee jusqu'en octobre,
                        comme on le supposait, aura lieu tres prochainement. On cloture a 14 tres
                        ferme et en bonne tendance. Le chiffre d'affaires a ete enorme.</p>
                    <p>Delaissee d'abord a 27 ½, la National Bank revient en faveur et atteint £28
                        l'action ancienne et £ 26 13/16 la nouvelle. Ce dernier prix est egalement
                        celui de la National Bank ex-droit de souscription. Le prochain lancement de
                        la Banque Nationale d'Abyssinie dans lequel la National Bank est fortement
                        interesse, est pour beaucoup dans la hausse du cours.</p>
                    <p>La Land Bank a fluctue entre 9 et 9 1/8, pour cloturer a ce dernier prix. Les
                        operations ont ete assez nombreuses.</p>
                    <p>De 13 la Delta Light reprend a 13 ¼, pour retomber bientot entre 13 1/16 et
                        13 1/8. Cette valeur, qui semble en ce moment peu recherchee, ne tarders pas
                        a revenir en vogue.</p>
                    <p>En Banque d'Athenes on fluctue entre 121 et 124, pour finir a 123. Le
                        mouvement d'affaires a ete considerable. La hausse provient en partie du
                        prochain lancement d'un Credit Foncier Hellenique sous le patronage de la
                        Banque d'Athenes.</p>
                    <p>Tres faible deja a 33/, la Salt &amp; Soda a encore flechi jusqu'a 32/3 a la
                        suite de ventes importantes, provenant des porteurs d'actions Huileries qui
                        vendaient le resultat de leur faculte d'obtenir 11 actions Salt &amp; Soda
                        au cours de 32 shellings, plus 23 actions Salt &amp; Soda contre une action
                        Huileries. Ces ventes etant terminees, le marche a deja repris et le cours a
                        regagne 35/6, pour finir acheteur a 35/.</p>
                    <p>Apres avoir debute a 1 15/16, l'Investment a flechi jusqu'a 1 19/32 sur les
                        ventes forcees de certains petits speculateurs qui se sont trouves dans
                        l'impossibilite de recevoir ou du</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>fait de certains autres qui escomptaient des prix beaucoup plus bas pour la
                        liquidation de fin du mois. On cloture a 1 25/32 en bonne demande. La
                        societe est en train de conclure plusieurs affaires qui promettent de beaux
                        profits.</p>
                    <p>Le meme mouvement a eu lieu sur les Estates et pour les memes motifs. Le
                        cours, apres avoir flechi de 31/32 a 13/16m est remonte a 31/32 acheteurs,
                        avec des transactions se chiffrant par milliers de titres.</p>
                    <p>De forts paquest de Trust ont egalement change de mains a un cours variant de
                        1 ¼ a 1 5/16.</p>
                    <p>La Behera debute a 45 5/8, atteint 46 et retombe en cloture a 45. L'action de
                        jouissance est demandee a 5 1/16.</p>
                    <p>En Delta Land les affaires ont ete restreintes. Le cours flechit de 2 9/16 a
                        2 7/16.</p>
                    <p>La Ramleh demeure stationnaire a 7 ¾.</p>
                    <p>Les Priviligiees Tramways ont donne lieu a d'importantes transactions entre
                        154 et 155 ½. On cloture a 149 ½ ex-coupon (6 fr. 50.)</p>
                    <p>Sur un rapport des plus satisfaisants et sur la nouvelle definitive d'un
                        dividende de 9 %, l'Anglo-American Nile reprend eufiu de 5 9/16 a 5 11/16
                        acheteurs.</p>
                    <p>La Khedivial Mail monte de 4 1/16 a 4 ¼ pour finir a 4 1/8.</p>
                    <p>De 1 1/16 l'Oasis tombe a 15/16, mais reprend bientot a £1 acheteurs.</p>
                    <p>Les Brasseries demeureut sans changements appreciables, celles d'Alexandrie a
                        205 ex-coupon, et celle du Caire a 122.</p>
                    <p>Le chiffre d'affaires en Markets a ete assez important. Le cours debute a
                        22/6 et cloture a 22/3 acheteurs.</p>
                    <p>Les Eaux du Caire flechissent de 1150 a 1130 francs et l'Alexandria Water Co.
                        de 16 a 15 7/8, avec affaires tres limitees.</p>
                    <p>L'Urbaine est ferme entre 4 5/16 et 4 3/8.</p>
                    <p>En resume le marche a l'air un peu plus sain et la tendance est bonne. Il
                        semble bien, cependant, que l'heure soit peu propice aux emissions de
                        nouvelles societes. Celles-ci feront bien, a notre avis, d'atteudre pour se
                        lancer, le mois d'octobre, epoque a laquelle le courant est generalement a
                        la hausse.</p>

                    <p>Le marche a ouvert ce matin avec beaucoup d'animation ; mais, vers la fin, la
                        liquidation de fin du mois a pese un peu sur les cours et il se pourrait que
                        la faiblesse persiste encore lunci.</p>
                    <p>La National Bank hausse de 28 a 28 1/16, la Banque d'Athenes de 123 a 123 ¾,
                        la Salt &amp; Soda de 35 a 35/6, l'Anglo American Nile de 5 11/16 a 5 ¾ et

                        the future, if possible, excel in those duties. A number of officers of the

                    <p>Temperance principles are making such steady progress in the Army that even
                        the most fanatical zealot might be expected to wait and watch for the final
                        outcome. It appears, however, that some of these well-meaning but utterly
                        wrong-headed persons are striving to confine membership of the Royal Army
                        Temperance Association exclusively to teetotallers. At present this
                        excellent institution is happily free from that restriction on its
                        usefulness, and the result is that thousands of the rank and file join who
                        would hold aloof were total abstinence made a governing condition of
                        membership. It is not disputed that this professional combination against
                        over-indulgence in strong drink operates most beneficially both individually
                        and collectively. All military authorities are agreed on that point, and
                        they are also practically unanimous in opposing the mischievous proposals of
                        the fanatical</p>
                    <cb n="3"/>
                    <p>faddists. As matters stand, the way is smoothed for the moderate drinker to
                        become a total abstainer gradually if so disposed, a process which
                        constantly produces the effect desired by the teetotal crusaders. They would
                        do well to reflect, therefore, whether the cause they have at heart –– a
                        right good cause, in itself –– would be likely to benefit by barring out
                        from membership of the association every soldier who could not see his way
                        to subscribe to their particular shibboleth.</p>
                    <p>We have it now, on the authority of the Army Council, that a number of men
                        serving in the Army Reserve have applied to be taken back to the colours
                        because of their inability to find work. It is impossible to over-estimate
                        the seriousness of the announcement, in view of the fact that the whole
                        recruiting problem turns on this question of unemployment of soldiers on
                        their return to civil life. Things have been tending this way for some time
                        past, and it is having its due effect on the recruiting market. With the
                        prospect of their sons having to join the ranks of the unemployed in return
                        for serving their King and country, it is unreasonable to expect respectable
                        parents to allow them to enlist if they have the power to prevent them. The
                        behaviour of some of the railway companies and other large employers of
                        labour in finding work for ex-soldiers is most patriotic, and it is to be
                        regretted the Government departments do not follow their example. It is
                        rather the duty of the authorities to set the example, but they do not do
                        so. At the recent meeting of the Society for the Employment of Reserve and
                        Discharged Soldiers, it was prominently remarked upon that the civil
                        departments of the Government, outside the War Office, have done nothing ;
                        they are most apathetic in the matter. Among the class from which the Army
                        used to draw its best recruits it is now common report that enlistment in
                        the Army is the very worst look-out for a decent lad. The Government is, to
                        a very great extent, responsible for this –– not the War Office, because I
                        think every effort has been made there to find employment for the men ; and
                        I hope that the War Secretary will now hasten to urge on the other
                        departments their duty in the matter.</p>
                    <p>Confidence is still shaken in Mr. Balfour's assurances that, provided we
                        maintain a predominant Navy, we need never foreign invasion. The discussion
                        verges, however, on the academic, the premises remain problematical, the
                        security we are promised is still conditional. Not so the threat to India,
                        which looms much nearer, with no more guarantee against it than safeguarding
                        Afghanistan. We are told that any attempt on its integrity will be taken as
                        a <hi rend="italic">casus belli</hi>, and that we shall fight forthwith. It
                        is but common prudence to consider what this means. What array of force
                        could we marshal for the defence of India against attack from the North-West
                        Frontier? Lord Kitchener has fixed the numbers he would require in immediate
                        reinforcement at eight infantry divisions, with the necessary artillery and
                        cavalry, the whole totalling to upwards of 100,000 men. Now, we have in all,
                        exclusive of the permanent Indian garrison, barely 300,000 men available for
                        external war, and this total includes every regular soldier at home and
                        abroad, in these islands and at the Colonies, with the first class Army
                        Reserve of say, 75,000 men thrown in. The balance of less than 200,000,
                        after deducting the first immediate addition to the Indian garrison as
                        above, will be the sum total of our armed strength left to meet the wastage
                        on the first year's campaigning. Here is matter for very grave and solemn
                        consideration. We may hug ourselves in the knowledge that invasion of these
                        islands has been pronounced impossible by experts, but the invasion of India
                        is certainly on the cards, and Mr. Balfour has gone the length of stating
                        exactly would bring us into the field. No alarmist is needed to point out
                        how ludicrously unequal we should be to the crisis, and, properly used, the
                        champions of conscription should find they have in this a powerful weapon in
                        their hands.</p>

                    <p>It is, perhaps, just as well as to recall the fact that the Anglo-Japanese
                        Treaty, which was signed on January 30, 1902, is to remain in force for five
                        years from that date, and that it contained a stipulation to the effect that
                        if neither party to it notified, twelve months before the expiration of that
                        period, an intention to terminate it, it should continue in force until the
                        expiration of one year from any date on which either of them should denounce
                        it. The Treaty, therefore, primarily holds good until January 30, 1907, but
                        his Majesty's Government must, naturally enough, already be seriously
                        considering what steps, in the not very distant future, will have to be
                        taken in regard to it. The considerations that necessarily arise are whether
                        it should be renewed in its present form, or whether a new Treaty should be
                        entered into, giving a much wider and more comprehensive scope to the
                        alliance between the two countries. The subject is one of the most vital
                        importance, and we may rest assured that it has Lord Lansdowne's very
                        earnest and anxious attention. So long as the war between Russia and Japan
                        lassts the existing Treaty, of course, endures ; but as well as devoutly
                        hope that it may be over before 1907, it is eminently desirable that
                        negotiations between Japan and ourselves should proceed so that when the
                        adjustment of things in the Far East has to be faced our position and theirs
                        may be perfectly clear.</p>
                    <p>Colonel <persName>Lonsdale Hale</persName> sounds a note of serious warning
                        in the "Times" against the light-hearted optimism of his Majesty's
                        Govrernment on the subject of possible "raids" upon our coast lines by the
                        enemy in the event of war. Mr. Arnold-Forster has stated, in the House, that
                        raids "are not a source of serious anxiety to his Majesty's Govvernment." To
                        which Colonel Lonsdale Hale replies, in effect, that, if they are not, they
                        ought to be. Mr. Arnold Forster has issued certain Army Orders giving the
                        reorganisation of military commands, which specify the duties of the
                        "commanders of coast defences." But where are those "200,000 Volunteers,
                        thoroughly trained and thoroughly equipped," who, he told the House of
                        Commons, "will suffice to meet a raid"? And echo answers ––"Where?" Colonel
                        Hale points out that raids are not only possible but extremely probable, and
                        furthermore, that it will be impossible to improvise adequate coast defence
                        at the last moment. All which suggests that, <hi rend="italic">pace</hi> Mr.
                        Balfour, we have yet something to do before we ought to feel quite happy and
                        confortable as to safety of our enormous coast line.</p>
                    <p>Monday's "scene in the House" was, of course, in colloquial language, "such a
                        scene as never was." It has shocked the members and the public, and amazed
                        the oldest inhabitant of Westminster, who can find no parallel for it, in
                        his experience. The damage done reacts in several directions. This crazy
                        "Scene" makes us contemptible in the eyes of foreign observers, once envious
                        of our calm and order, and encourages the further ravages of that disorder
                        that makes modern government a difficult matter. It may also have
                        far-reaching consequences at home. Already pessimism was prevalent enough.
                        Experienced observers have deplored in hopeless despair the "decay of
                        Parliament," without being able to suggest a plausible remedy for the
                        disease, and the public has shown a marked impatience with the way in which
                        the nation's business is conducted by those who are sent to Westminster for
                        that high purpose. But this last extravagance crowns all. Nothing more is
                        needed to prove how low we have sunk, and a point may now have been reached
                        at which comes the conviction that "something must be done." It is a
                        thousand pities that there is no law enforcing severe penalties against
                        those who organise degrading and dangerous exhibitions, for under its
                        operations many honorable members would assuredly have come. Failing that
                        some other plan must be tried. For it is plain that a continuance of present
                        conditions endangers the stability of the Constitution, and does
                        incalculable harm to the welfare of the State.</p>
                    <p>If anything could make the Opposition thoroughly ashamed of themselves for
                        Monday night's scene it should be the criticisms in the German papers. All
                        deplore it, and most treat it as a proof of the decadence of the
                        parliamentary principle and as indicating the approaching end of our
                        Parliamentary system. The Berlin "Post" pertinently asks what impression the
                        scene will make in Russia, where the people are just beginning to reach
                        forward to the Parliamentary idea. It must be a proud thought for the
                        Opposition, that they have not</p>
                    <cb n="4"/>
                    <p>only degraded the Mother of Parliaments in the eye of the world, but have
                        done what they could to stifle aspirations towards freedom in other
                        lands.</p>
                    <p>Once again the Channel Tunnel scheme, which has been in abeyance for over
                        twenty ears, is likely to be dragged into the light and seriously considered
                        as a practical project. The matter has been under discussion at a meeting of
                        English and French railway managers, and the opinion was expressed that the
                        time was near when the national approval might be sought with reasonable
                        prospects of success. The support of France and its investors is reckoned as
                        assured. It is from this side of the Channel that opposition will come, if
                        at all. Twenty years ago the argument that killde the Bill was that of the
                        increased risk of invasion. The cordial relations now existing between
                        France and England, of course, discount this objection to some extent. It is
                        a pity that Mr. Balfour, in his recent estimate of the chances of invasion,
                        could not have taken this possible factor into account. As to the commercial
                        advantage to both countries of such a tunnel, if once constructed, there
                        could be but little question.</p>
                    <p>I am glad to see that the Motor Union have determined to take stringent
                        measures against reckless driving, bu they will not need to lose time if
                        they have hopes of doing anything to ward off fresh and drastic legislation.
                        There are some edifying items of motoring intelligence in this morning's
                        newspaper. A lady cyclist near Windsor was knocked off her machine by a
                        large motorcar and left insensible upon the road. In South Wales a labourer
                        has been discovered bleeding and senseless on the spot where he had been run
                        down by a motor several hours before. It appears to be the settled policy of
                        certain drivers to make a run for it if they think the victim is too
                        seriously hurt to be able to take a note of their number. It only requires a
                        few more incidents of this kind, and we shall have something approaching a
                        state of civil war.</p>
                    <p>Slowly but surely the motor omnibus is displacing its older rival, the
                        horse-drawn vehicle. Two new motor omnibuses were put to-day on the
                        Cricklewood to Marble Arch route by the London General Omnibus Company,
                        bringing its total up to four. This number would be considerably greater had
                        there not been so many disappointments in the delivery of some of the sixty
                        odd similar vehicles on order. These are being supplied by seven different
                        makers, as the desire of the company is to decide by trial which is the best
                        make. The London Road Car Company has at present twelve motor omnibuses on
                        the streets, and about fifty more ond order from three different firms. </p>
                    <p>In the opinion of Mr. Kingham, the Secretary of the London General Omnibus
                        Company, as well as Mr. Duff, the manager of the London Road Car Co., the
                        new vehicle has come to stay. As regards the financial side of the question,
                        neither is willing to express an opinion. Both, however, state that on any
                        route a saving of time would be effected, which is the principal factor
                        towards success. A motor-omnibus is capable of a daily mileage half as great
                        again as that of a horse-drawn omnibus on an average route. The carrying
                        capacity also is greater.</p>
                    <p>"Whether they will be more profitable depends entirely upon the life of the
                        chassis," said Mr. Kingham. "I do not think anybody will be able to tell
                        until these have been worked for a couple of years." Tyres are an expensive
                        item.</p>
                    <p>Of all the methods of treating disease (not even excluding the casting out of
                        devils by the saltations of medicine men of which Sir Frederick Treves has
                        told us entertaining stories) none is less easy to comprehend than
                        "Christian Science." This thinking away of illness, and self-persuasion of
                        the non-existence of hurtful matter, which is part mysticism of a sort and
                        part pure crankiness, may have its uses. For the "malade imaginaire," for
                        the tooth-ache, and for the nervous troubles of the age, it may serve, and
                        can do no harm. But when it comes to bronchial pneumonia, and when it comes
                        to letting your child die of this because you deliberately prefer the
                        prayers of the "faith-healer" to the poultices of the qualified doctor, then
                        it is time to put a stopper on absurdity that has a criminal touch in it.
                        Such was a case that the Twickenham Deputy Coroner has had before him. At
                        the request of the jury he censured the father, "telling him that if another
                        such case happened he would committed for trial for manslaughter."</p>
                    <p>Some of the Colonial ecclesiastical dignitaries seem to have a poor opinion
                        of the mother-country. Dr. Julius, the Bishop of Christchurch, according to
                        a "Times" telegram, has just been uttering "a scathing condemnation of
                        English fashionable life." His Lordship recently visited London, and this is
                        what he found :</p>
                    <p>England had broken loose from the religious, the parental, and the social
                        code, and the tendency was to break away from the moral code. There was a
                        strange licence in a great deal of modern English life.</p>
                    <p>Well, perhaps we are no better than we should be, but are we quite as bad as
                        the Bishop would have his flock believe? It is at all events something new
                        to be lectured in this fashion from the Colonies.</p>
