                <div type="item"><head>THE SUEZ CANAL</head>
                <p>Last week the balance dividends to be paid by the Suez Canal Company for 1904
                        were announced. These showed a very considerable increment, giving rise to
                        expectations of an early realisation of the hope, expressed by the chairman
                        at the meeting last June, that a reduction of 50 centimes per ton in the
                        transit dues might be possible. A reduction of this amount came into
                        operation at the beginning of 1903; but, thanks to the growth in number and
                        tonnage of vessels using the waterway, the decline in receipts was
                        insignificant, only from frs. 103,720,020 to frs. 103,620,268. Economies in

                <p>these rates are far and away the highest ever paid by the undertaking ; indeed,
                        the net dividend –– that is, after deduction of taxes –– exceeds the gross
                        dividend of 1903, which was the previous best. The sum distributed in excess
                        dividends to shareholders and founders will be nearly £2,300,000,
                        irrespective of the Egyptian Government's 15 per cent. of the net profits
                        (belonging since 1880 to a French company which bought it from the
                        Government) and of the 5 per cent. interest payable on each unredeemed
                        share. The accounts of the company have not reached us, but the annual
                        return to Parliament, issued last week, shows that the transit receipts rose
                        over frs. 12,000,000, to frs. 115,818,479 ––say £4,632,740.</p>
                    <p>The net tonnage passing through the Canal last year was 1,494,547 tons
                        greater than that of 1903, and about 500,000 tons of this is atttributed to
                        the consignments of coal to the Far East for the use of the belligerents.
                        That, of course, accounts for only about a third of the increase, and the
                        report of the British Government directors mentions the heavy shipments of
                        wheat from India as explaining a great part of the remainder. The effects of
                        the war are to be traced throughout the statistics of traffic. The
                        interruption of Russian commercial shipping is seen in the decline from 119
                        in 1903 to 82 last year in the number of Russian ships, and, as the latter
                        figure included 15 warships and transports, representing 76,763 tons out of
                        a total of 153,848 tons, the trade in Russian bottoms is seen to have nearly
                        disappeared. Only six Japanese ships passed through the Canal last year,
                        against 53 in 1903, and the net tonnage felll from 220,966 to 21,463, of
                        which 4,773 tons represented two warships and the rest four mail steamers,
                        leaving not a solitary Japanese merchant vessel in the list. The percentage
                        of British traffic continues to grow, and we show the figures for the next
                        five years :––</p>

                    <p>Germany is still an indifferent second, her net tonnage advancing from last
                        year from 1,773,265 to 1,969,561, against the British growth from 7,403,533
                        tons to 8,833,929 tons. The German increase in number of ships and their
                        aggregate burthen did not improve her proportion, which fell from 13.1 per
                        cent. of ships in 1903 to 12.8 per cent., and from 14.9 per cent. of net
                        tonnage to 14.7 per cent. If merchant vessels alone are to be reckoned, the
                        British proportion of tonnage rises to 76 per cent. and the German falls to
                        10.5 per cent., a proportion exceeding that of France, Holland, Norway,
                        Austria-Hungary, and Italy combined. The average net tonnage of vessels
                        using the Canal last year was 3,163, against 1,787 tons twenty years ago and
                        657 tons in the first year of the canal's existence. In that year (1869) the
                        Canal earned frs. 54,5460 on 10 vessels ; the receipts got over frs.
                        5,000,000 in 1870, over frs 50,000,000 in 1881, and over frs. 100,000,000 in
                        1901, though within the last period mentioned the dues fell from frs.11.50

                <p>LONDON, June 2.</p>
                <p>At a Conservative dinner at the Holborn Restaurant, Lord Landsdowne, referring to
                    the hope expressed by Sir Ed. Grey that the Anglo-Japanese Agreement would be
                    maintained, said that at no time on either side had there been any question
                    whatever of withdrawal from the alliance. It is our opinion that, when the time
                    comes when we must consider the renewal of the agreement, the only practical
                    question will be whether we should not seek some means of strengthening and
                    consolidating it. The alliance has been a potent instrument lor maintaining
                    peace, and if it be possible so to modify it that it would prevent the spread of
                    a conflagration when it has begun, but prevent the conflagration from breaking
                    out, all true lovers of peace would recommend such modifications ,</p>
                <p>There has never been a moment when our relations with France were upon a firmer
                    base, and if the inner history of the anxious mouths lately passed be ever
                    written, it will show that our understanding with France has greatly mitigated
                    the friction and trouble inevitable when a great war is still in progress. Our
                    alliance with Japan and our agreement with France are alike with no selfish or
                    aggressive purpose in view. Our sole object has been to secure peace and
                    restrict the evils of war. (R.)</p>

                <p>Count Cassini called on President Roosevelt yesterday. The President expressed
                    the earnest hope,as a friend of Russia, that she would seek to conclude peace
                    with Japan in response to the wish of the entire civilised world. The
                    prolongation of the war would mean increased Japanese demands. He pointed out
                    that Russia could hardly hope to win, and that influenced solely by motives of
                    humanity he offered his services as a mediator or an intermediary in any way
                    acceptable to Russia. Count Cassini replied that he was without instructions,
                    but that be personally believed that Russia would continue the war, because the
                    moment is not advantageous for the discussion of peace Russia has not lost any
                    of her own territory and nothing in the present situation necessitates suing for
                    peace. He promised, however, to communicate President Roosevelt's view and offer
                    to the Tsar. (Reuter.)</p>

                    the Syrian crops, which come in through the autumn and winter. '</p>

                <p>Alhambra Theatre.--- Il Duchino (Le Petit Duc) was produced last night before a large and fashionable audience, the performance
                    meeting with great success. Signa. Im bimbo was a sprightly and vivacious Duca,
                    and was well supported by Signa. Sevres as the Du chessa, while Sig. Berardi as
                    the tutor was excruciatingly tunny. The piece will be repeated to-night.

                    consider the desirability of refunding to British tonnage passing through the
                    canal last year some proportion, say, 5 or 10 per cent, of the dividend, having
                    regard to the charges it had to meet to earn such an income for the company</p>
                <p>POLICEMAN Shoots AN ITALIAN—A most unfortunate and serIous affray took place
                    yesterday evening in Sisters-street, Alexandria, in which a member of the
                    Alexandria City Police (an Italian) was seriously implicated While in plain
                    clothes he had a discussion with a compatriot in a drinking place in the street
                    The subject of the discussion is believed to have been a woman, and the two
                    Italians grew more and more excited until from words they came to blows. The
                    policeman drew a loaded revolver and held it at his compatriot in a menacing
                    manner. The latter sprang at him and in a fierce struggle endeavoured to disarm
                    his opponent But the policeman succeeded in holding on to the weapon, and,
                    getting his arms free, he emptied the contents of two of the chambers into the
                    man’s body, who fell writhing to the floor. The injured man was at once conveyed
                    to the European Hospital, and it is not expected that the two wounds he
                    sustained will be mortal. According to the latest accounts he is progressing as
                    satisfactorily as can be expected under the circumstances. The policeman was
                    arrested and disarmed, and subsequently handed over by the authorities of the
                    Alexandria City Police to the Italian Consulate. It is needless to state that he
                    will be expelled from the police force.</p>

            <div type="item"><head>STRANGE CASES IN CAIRO.
                ALLEGED VACCINATION SCANDAL.</head>
                <p>Considerable sensation has occurred in Cairo owing to the report that two deaths
                    have taken place in the Capital within the last few days as the result of
                    vaccination.</p>
                <p>The German Consulate has opened an enquiry into the circumstances attending the
                    death of Mr. Heinrich Klein, a young German who died at one of the Cairo
                    Hospitals on Thursday evening after an illness of some days, which is alleged to
                    have been occasioned by some vaccine given him by a local medical man.</p>
                <p>A Cairo contemporary remarked yesterday —</p>
                <p>Une certaine emotion regne en villa a la suite de deux deces survenus a la suite
                    de vaccination. On dit—et nous reproduisons ces bruits sous toutes reserves—que
                    les instruments qui out servi a l'operation n’auraient pas ete suffisamment
                    sterilises. Sur trois cas de vaccination, deux ont eu une issue fatale.</p>
                <p>It is sincerely to be hoped that a satisfactory explanation of these cases will
                    be discovered, as if it is found that the deaths ensued owing to the reason
                    given above, a serious set back might be given to the progress of vaccination in
                    Egypt. During last year 408,981 successful vaccinations were performed, as
                    compared with 408,856 in 1903. it would be a great pity if this steady progress
                    in vaccinating were checked owing to the alarm arising from the fatality in
                    Cairo. The importance of vaccination in Egypt is very great, and we may mention
                    that, out of 185 cases of small-pox which were reported in Cairo last year,
                    one-half occurred amongst the European population, more especially amongst the
                    Greeks. This large number of cases amongst Europeans appears to be due to want
                    of vaccination on their part. Many of the Greek patients were treated at the
                    hospital for infectious diseases, and it is reported that those who contracted
                    the disease severely and died had never been vaccinated.</p>
                <p>The vaccine produced at the Cairo Vaccine Institute has up to now given very
                    satisfactory results. There were no less than 4,155 cases of small-pox, of which
                    854 terminated fatally, in Egypt last year.</p>

                    officers and 120 non-commissioned officers more than in 1904. A new building is
                    much required. Plans and estimates are being prepared, but in view of the very
                    targe demands for public buildings of all sorts, which are being pressed on the

                <p>Alexandria is at last within measurable distance of possessing a music ball which
                    will be worthy of the city. We say this in no disparagement of the
                    establishment, known as the Alhambra, which has been conducted with remarkable
                    success by Mr. Conegliano for some years past Mr. Conegliano, however, has
                    hitherto laboured under a great disadvantage in that his tenure of the theatre
                    site has been a most uncertain one. Now, as we announced yesterday, the
                    proprietor of the Alhambra has signed a ten years’ lease with the owner of the
                    ground, Mr. G. B. Alderson, and his tenure is secure et least for that
                    period.</p>
                <p>The result of this agreement is that a new music-ball is to be built on the plot
                    of ground contiguous to the present Alhambra, on the south side, which is now
                    used as a garden. The theatre will be larger than the existing one, with
                    attractive boxes and the additional feature of a gallery. It will be entirely
                    constructed of iron, and will comprise every modern contrivance against the
                    chances of an outbreak of fire. The plans have been prepared and are to be sent
                    in a few days to England, where the theatre is to be built and sent out here to
                    be put together.</p>

                <p>Our Cairo Correspondent writes"--- Cairenes, unlike Alexandrians, cannot complain
                    of a want of Nursing Homes, for there are now three such institutions in Cairo,
                    the latest being the Hutchinson Nursing Home, which was opened about a fortnight
                    ago and which I have had an opportunity of visiting. This horne is well adapted
                    to both surgical and medical cases, the rooms on the second floor being set
                    apart for the former cases and those on toe first floor for the latter. The
                    tourist, too, who has come to Egypt for change and rest, and who is not actually
                    ill, but feels himself unable to stand the bustle and racket of hotel life, will
                    find himself well-cared for here, and he will also have the services of the
                    resident medical officer at his disposal, should he require them. Patients,
                    however, may be attended by their own doctors.</p>
                <p>A visit to this Home shows the great care with which every detail in the planning
                    and furnishing of it has been thought out, and not a single possible want of a
                    patient has been left unsupplied. Every room is fitted with the latest
                    electrical conveniences, in the way of stoves, lights, and fans, is furnished in
                    the most luxurious manner, and has the advantage of being differently arranged
                    and furnished to any of its companions, so that every taste is suited. Separate
                    parte of the house are also apportioned to the nurses, to the Goanese servants,
                    and to the Arabs. There are in all twelve single rooms set apart for patients,
                    and in addition to these they have both an exceedingly comfortable and
                    well-arranged diningroom and a lounge which will compare favorably with any

                <p>Prof. Sayce has completed a study of some Lydian and Karian inscriptions discovered in Egypt, and lately published in a more or less revised form. Two new characters --one identical with the Cypriote to and the other with the apparent value of a — are the chief features of these, and it should be noted that most of them are to be need boustrophedon. The paper will shortly be published in the Proceedings of the Society of which Prof. Sayce is the President, and, with his former communications on the subject, make up all the Karian and Lydian texts yet discovered. Most of them are of but a few lines each, and the Lydian and Karian alphabets seem to be the greatest acquisitions that they have yet yielded. It is a pity that those interested in the subject do not turn their attention to the Greco-Egyptian Magic Papyri, among the so-called "gibberish” incantations  of which are several words ending ia -anda, which may not improbably turn out to be Karian. The settlement of many Karian mercenaries in the Fayoum and elsewhere must certainly have left traces in the literature of their adopted country, could we only hit upon them.</p>

                <p>TRADE COMBINATION.</p>
                <p>( From our correspondent. )</p>
                <p>Nicosia, May 36.</p>
                <p>The idea of combining together for trade purpose* cannot yet be said to have made
                    much headway among the commercial community of Cyprus. The people of Larnaca and
                    Limassol are now, however, to have an opportunity of becoming familiarised with
                    this method of doing business, as a steamship company has lately been formed at
                    both places, mainly for cargo trade with Egypt, while an important brick and
                    tile factory has just commenced operations at Limassol as a societe anonyme.</p>
                <p>It is to be hoped that the two steamship companies will not work on rival lines,
                    but that they will see the wisdom of uniting together and so acquire sufficient
                    power to do a useful and profitable carrying trade with our nearest markets.</p>
                <p>If the brick and tile factory succeeds in producing good-building material at a
                    moderate price it should have a successful future. There is an evident tendency
                    in this island to use roofing tiles in place of the mud roofs, and it is
                    regarded rather as a mark of superiority for a villager to roof his building.
                    Several mud cottages were washed away in the Limassol district during the last
                    winter season, and this should stimulate the taste for bricks, which will not be

                <p>The “Cyprus Gazette" of 19th inst. publishes an Order by the High Commissioner, approving of a general bonded warehouse being established in the Customs stores at Larnaca in which goods destined for local consumption or for re-exportation may be deposited.	</p>

            <div type="item"><head>THE SOAP INDUSTRY</head>
                <p>There is also gazetted an Order in Council reducing the import duty leviable on vegetable oils used in the manufacture of soap from the £2 per 100 okes heretofore charged ; provided that such oils are rendered unfit tor alimentary purposes at the expense of the importer and under the supervision of the Customs. This reduction of duty should give a considerable impetus to the local soap industry. Some years ago there were seven or eight soap factories in the island, the import duty on oils then being at the rate now fixed by the new order. The duty, however, was raised to £2 per 100 okes in order to prevent the importation of cotton seed oil for adulteration with the native olive oil, and as a consequence this industry  was crippled and there exists to-day only one small soap factory. It is generally felt that the reduction in the duty is a wire measure.</p>

                <p>The usual half-yearly meeting of the above Trust was held by kind permission of
                    Idris Bey Ragheb. M W. G. M of Egypt, in the committee room of the Grand Lodge
                    on Tuesday evening last, 30th May. There were present: Dr. W. C. Mackenzie,
                    Messrs. P. Plunkett, and F. A. Beale, president. The minutes of the last
                    half-yearly and extraordinary meet-ing were read, passed, and confirmed. Mr. G.
                    Scott-Dalgleish wrote regretting his inability to he present owing to another
                    meeting. The President next produced the balance-sheet for the half-year ending
                    May, which, after being audited, was unanimously accepted The balance-sheet
                    shows a net total of credit amounting to L.E. 387.621, a considerable increase
                    over the balance of the last half-year. It was notified that the monies had been
                    invested in accordance with the wishes of the trustees and that the bonds had
                    been deposited with the Trust bankers.</p>
                <p>A letter was read from Mr. Jas. Edgell, J. P. (the trustee in England) who was
                    watching the local trustee's interests over Dora and Reggie De Vere. A good
                    amount was given of the program they were making with their stadias, etc. It was
                    proposed that a hearty vote of thanks be accorded to Mr. Edgell for his greet
                    kindness to three orphan children ; he had them at his home on every occasion,
                    and be was using every endeavour to gain admission into the Duke of York's Royal
                    Military School for Reggie, the necessary certificates being asked for from the
                    trustees. A cordial vote of thanks was also expressed to the Permanent Committee
                    of the National Grand Lodge of Egypt, for their kindness in again voting the sum
                    of L.E. 20 from the Benevolent Fund for the year 1904.</p>
                <p>The President intimated that he had now been three years president of the Trust
                    and in thanking the trustees for their help and sup port, tendered his
                    resignation. Dr. W. C. Mackenzie proposed re-election, strongly urged by Mr.
                    Plunkett. The President, whilst acknowledging</p>
                <p>lodging the honor and confidence of the vote, thought that as the work was now
                    all in a satisfactory and smooth condition, some other member of the Trust
                    should have a turn as president. Dr. Mackenzie still strongly urged Mr. Beale to
                    accept the position for a farther period, which was finally agreed to by him. At
                    the same time the trustees wished it to be placed on record that they fully
                    appreciated the fact that it was owing to his untiring efforts that the funds
                    were in such a satisfactory conuition.</p>

                        <p>Sir.–– I must protest against the arguments of "Pigeon" in to-day's
                            issue. I daresay that when bull-baiting was abolished as pastimes as
                            cruel were cited in justification, as "Pigeon" now cites fox-hunting. It
                            is not because we are not in England that we should abstain from using
                            our influence to prevent cruelty, though unfortunately this argumentt
                            seems to prevail a great deal. The S.P.C.A. and the authorities do all
                            they can to improve matters, but the average European, Britisher
                            included, however revolted he may be by the particular case before him
                            is generally too indifferent to take the small amount of trouble
                            necessary to ensure at any rate the punishment of one offender, and the
                            consequent gradual improvement of the lot of dumb creatures generally in
                            Egypt. We cannot get things right all at once ; let us do all we can to
                            arrive at this by degrees, Yours truly, Clay-Pigeon.</p>
                        <p>Cairo, May 31.</p>
                        <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                        <p>Dear Sir, –– "Pigeon," in your yesterday's issue, urges the introduction
                            of pigeon shooting within the premises of the Alexandria Sporting Club
                            on the plea that we are not in England and therefore the non-English
                            members of the club might do as they like. I think this is the very
                            reason why the butchery of harmless birds should be tabooed from a
                            cosmopolitan club. To introduce a game or pastime which is distasteful
                            to some of the members and has the expressed disapprobation of their
                            Queen, is, to say the least, in very bad taste. However, I suppose
                            British memberes have a right to kick against a general club, started
                            since the British flag first floated over Alexandria, being turned into
                            a slaughter ground. ––Yours truly, </p>

                        <p>PUMPS IN EGYPT</p>
                        <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                        <p>Sir, –– My attention has just been called to a letter in your issue of
                            May 8, on "Pumps in Egypt," signed by F. Allen, director of Messrs.
                            Allen, Alderson &amp; Co. The only possible for the explanation in this
                            letter of the names of J. and H. Gwynne and Gwynne &amp; Co., is to lead
                            your readers to assume that Messrs. Allen, Alderson &amp; Co. had given
                            up at their own desire the agencies of these two firms, now combined and
                            known as Gwynnnes, Limited. This, however, was very far from being the
                            case. The firm of Allen Alderson was originally started in 1868 by Mr.
                            Stafford S. Allen as S.S. Allen &amp; Co., with J. and H. Gwynne and
                            Ransome, Sims, and Heads' agencies. After the death of Mr. S.S. Allen
                            (his firm at that time holding the agency for centrifugal pumps for
                            Egypt of J. and H. Gwynne) I was of the opinion that the terms of the
                            agreement were not being carried out in their entirety by the new firm
                            of A. A. &amp; Co. I therefore in 1872 paid a visit to Egypt and my
                            investigations fully confirmed what I anticipated, and I then terminated
                            the agreement. I need not refer further to this subjet, or the
                            subsequent reason for Messrs. Gwynne &amp; Co. discontinuing their
                            agency. I wish to call your attention, however, to one or two misleading
                            statements in Mr. Allen's letter.</p>
                        <p>(1) As to the general efficiency of centrifugal pumps: –– Mr. Allen says,
                            "We are prepared to guarantee in all sizes about 80% mechanical
                            efficiency with these pumps." Such a statement from one who professes to
                            be intimate with the subject does the cause of centrifugal pumps much
                            harm, as it should be well-known that in certain sizes and lifts such
                            results cannot be attained. I scarcely think that Mr. Allen's
                            principals, Messrs. Ruston Proctor &amp; Co., will be gratified with Mr.
                            Allen's exposure of their methods in designing, namely, that they sent
                            to the Continent, purchased centrifugal pumps, tested them, examined
                            them, took them to pieces, copied them, and re-introduced them under
                            some other name.</p>
                        <p>(2) Mr. Allen states, –– "The efficiency of some of these pumps is very
                            good and much in advance of what British makers are as a rule disposed
                            to guarantee." I entirely repudiate this statement and can prove that
                            large numbers of my company's pumps have been at work for many years and
                            have, and are still giving out, over 80% efficiency, that the best pumps
                            made on the Continent and elsewhere are with some slight modifications
                            copies of the pumps made and introduced from time to time by Gwynnes,
                            that in other cases they have been re-patented or re-introduced under
                            other names (as Mr. Allen's principals appear to be doing in the case of
                            their new pump), as can be seen from a perusal of John Gwynne's
                            Centrifugal Pump Patent No. 13,577 of 1851, with the thirty-five (35)
                            claims set out therein.</p>
                        <p>I challenge Mr. Allen to prove that any of the pumping installations made
                            by either his principals or by Continental engineers have given better
                            results on the same lifts and under similar conditions, to those
                            manufactured by my company, and I have no doubt that I can arrange for
                            as many sets and sizes as Mr. Allen can name to be tested by independent
                            experts with the machinery that he is prepared to champion.</p>
                        <p>It may be that Continental engineers have reduced the consumption of
                            steam in ther engines (much increasing the first cost) by the
                            introduction of elaborate valve gear, superheated steam, &amp;c., but it
                            has yet to be shown whether the introduction of these expensive engines
                            will prove in the long run a real economy in Egypt, where the atmosphere
                            is charged with large quantities of sand and grit. ––I am, etc.,</p>

                <p>Monsieur le Directeur</p>
                        <p>de l'"Egyptian Gazette."</p>
                        <p>Jusqui'ici l'Egypte etait affranchie de ces innombrables decrets dont on
                            commerce a etre excede en Europe. Cela ne contribuait pas peu a faire de
                            ce beau pays une contres privilegiee sous le rapport de la liberte
                            individuelle, dont la population d'ailleurs tant europeenne qu'indigene
                            ne songeait pas a abuser.</p>
                        <p>Malheureusement, la vallee du Nil n'a rieu perdu pour attendre et ces
                            derniers temps ont ete pour elle exceptionnellement feconds en "arretes"
                            de toutes sortes, qui doivent theoriquement etre consideres comme
                            excellents, mais qui n'en sont pas moins des entraves a la liberte dont
                            je viens de parler.</p>
                        <p>Il semble par la promulgation du reglement regissant le commerce des
                            armes qu'on veuille inaugurer en Egypte l'ere des lois vexatoires, qui
                            etaient jusqui'ici une specialite de l'empire moscovite. Ce reglement
                            est presque la reproduction des lois en vigueur au Congo, au Cameroun,
                            au Niger, au Senegal, dans l'Ouganda et au Soudan, pays qui sont encore
                            a l'etat sauvage et qui ne sauraient raisonnablement etre compares au
                            notre.</p>
                        <p>Il suffit pour constater le caractere tyrannique de la loi, de lire les
                            articles qui soummettent les armuriers aux visites domiciliaires de la
                            police a tout instant du jour ou de la nuit, et qui les obligent de
                            tenir des registres ou ils devront relater "toutes les ventes effectuees
                            avec indication de l'espec d'armes vendues, du numero d'inscription, des
                            noms, prenoms, domicile, profession de l'acheteur, le prix d'achat, la
                            provenance et le prix de ente de l'article."</p>
                        <p>On se fait deja une idee de ce que sera un etablissement mis a la
                            discretion des moindres caprices des agents de la police locale. Quant
                            aux registres, comment l'armurier pourra-t-il, dans un pays si mefiant,
                            faire decliner le nom veritable du client pour le consigner dans un
                            registre destine a la police. Faudra-t-il l'obliger de se pourvoir d'un
                            extrait d'etat civil et de venir en compagnie de deux temoins? C'est la,
                            on le voit, une loi qui ne pourra jamais passer dans la pratique. Quant
                            aux prix d'achat et de vente, on ne comprend guere l'interet que peut
                            avoir le Gouvernement a les savoir, alors que les armes sont estimees a
                            la Douane, pour la perception des droite.</p>
                        <p>Toutes ces mesures, sussi inutiles qu'arbitraires, ne serviront en somme
                            qu'a causer des ennuis aux armuriers et de l'embarras a la police.</p>
                        <p>Le Gouvernment a declare, pour s'excuser, s'inquieter du grand nombre de
                            fusils qui entrent annuellement en Egypte. Cette augmentation est
                            pourtant justifee par l'enorme extension de la culture de terres, qui
                            exige une grande distribution des fusils aux gardiens, par la qualite
                            inferieure des fusils qui sont hors d'usage au bout de quelques mois et
                            enfin par la chasse qui est toujours plus en vogue dans ce pays au fur
                            et a mesure que sa prosperite augmente.</p>
                        <p>Il n'y a donc pas lieu de redouter une telle progression dans le debit
                            des armes ; ce debit rentre dans les causes normales de la richesse du
                            pays. D'ailleurs la loi de Novembre dernier a eu pour effet de
                            restreindre sensiblement la vente des fusils.</p>

                <div type="item"><head>WORLD'S OLDEST INHABITANT.</head>
                <p>The world's oldest inhabitant is said to be a giant tortoise, who spends his time
                            near a stove in a naturalist's place at St. Louis. Toto is his name, and
                            we are told he was grown when Columbus sailed. He was middle-aged and of
                            family when the Puritans landed on Plymouth Rock. When Jamestown was
                            founded he had a city of his own. Age had begun to deaden his faculties
                            when Napoleon swept Europe. Toto may live to see Maculay's New Zealander
                            explore the ruins of London.</p>
                        <p>A mark was put on his shell early in the seventeenth century. He has
                            carried the naked children of the Seychelles Islands ; he has carried
                            the midshipmen of the forgotten wooden frigates of Nelson's days.
                            Perhaps Drake's hardy mariners wrote him. The children of the World's
                            Fair were his last riders. For centuries Toto has lived and wooed.
                            Tigers have broken their talons his sharded back. Elephants have vainly
                            tried to crush him. Balls have glanced harmlessly from his shell. To-day
                            he huddles by the fire, the one indestructible, undying animal of Earth.
                            Like the Indian and Yogi, he dozes and dreams, and only asks warmth and
                            a bite to eat.</p>
                        <p>The deep indentations on Toto's shell determine his age. It is certain
                            that he was full grown when Captain Cook sailed in the Pacific and gave
                            his name to fame. Toto survived, and will survive, perhaps when all the
                            merry tots who have ridden him die grey-haired men and women.</p>

                <p>A sneaking belief in "luck" or "ill-luck" is innate in most people, but it is
                            said that for blind downright faith in good or bad omens, the woman who
                            dabbles in stocks or shares is hard to outdo.</p>
                        <p>Many a woman speculator never stirs without her "mascot," and should she
                            inadvertently omit to have it with her when about to embark on some
                            important business, she will let the most promising opportunities pass
                            rather than risk a venture unaided by her pet fetish.</p>
                        <p>As she snatches a hasty breakfast in the intervals of studying the money
                            columns of the daily paper, she seeks to read the future in the grounds
                            of her coffee cup, and settles her daily business in advance by the aid
                            of this unfailing medium.</p>
                        <p>If the number of the car in which she drives into town is an unlucky one,
                            or should she catch sight of a black cat, a person with a squint, or a
                            one-legged man, she knows to a certainty that misfortune is in store for
                            her.</p>
                        <p>Some women select the quaintest and most original talismans to ward off
                            the "evil eye." One pins her faith to a weird and fanciful Maori charm

                            tiny coralled hand with uplifted dagger of Italian manufacture, or
                            perhaps a bronze lizard, a crystal pig, or a rabbit's foot. Others,
                            again, see special virtue in a lucky sixpence or in some bent or crooked
                            coin, to whose aid they may attribute all the lucky deals which have
                            been carried out with success.</p>

                <div type="item"><head>MALARIA IN ITALY</head>
                <p>An interesting report has been issued at Rome on the work accomplished by the Red
                            Cross Society in the Roman Campagna in combating the malaria. The
                            society has seven stations in the Campagna, and its methods are very
                            systematic. The population of the Agro Romano consists of two classes ––
                            those who live there all the year round and those who only come down to
                            the plain from the mountains for a certain season of the year. A further
                            classification divides the permanent and temporary population of this
                            vast district into those who are considered immune from malaria and
                            those who are liable to it. These latter receive from the society five
                            to six tabloids of quinine a day for a week, and then one to two
                            tabloids daily according to their age; the former one to two tabloids a
                            day throughout the bad season without the heavy preliminary doses
                            applied in the case of malarial subjects. The results of this treatment
                            have been to diminish the amount of malaria in the Campagna very
                            considerably, so that last year out of 12,061 persons who took the
                            prescribed doses of quinine only 800 caught malarial fever, that is to
                            say, between 6 and 7 per cent. Such is the result of the society's fifth
                            year of work.</p>
                        <p>In addition to quinine most houses most houses, all railway stations,
                            octroi offices, and public buildings in the neighborhood of Rome have
                            their windows covered with close wire netting, and the octroi officials
                            wear wire masks towards sundown, which give them the appearance of
                            bandits in disguise.</p></div>

                <head type="sub">CURED 1 1/4 YEARS.</head>
                <p>Miss A. M. Steadman, living at 130, Cambridge Road, Kilburn, London, England,
                            says :––"I wish I could tell you how thankful I am for the good Doan's
                            Backacke Kidney Pills have done me. They have saved my life. Before I
                            began using them, the doctor said I couldn't live another three months,
                            but was a year and a quarter ago and <hi rend="italic">I'm as well
                                to-day as ever I was in my life</hi>.</p>
                        <p>"Before using Doan's Pills I was suffering from Bright's disease and
                            dropsy. My body was so swollen that I couldn't get my clothes or boots
                            on ; the pains in my back were fearfully agonizing, and I could hardly
                            breathe. Though I went under hospital treatment, and had the best of
                            medical advice, I kept getting worse and worse until I began with Doan's
                            Pills. I cannot speak too highly of this medicine, for it did me good
                            from the first, and although it was <hi rend="italic">a year and a
                                quarter ago</hi> that I was cured, I am still in splendid
                            health."</p>

                            recommended to try Doan's Backache Kidney Pills ; for Doan's Pills help
                            the kidneys to purify the blood and drive out the dissolved or
                            crystallised poisons that ––when kept back in the body by clogged
                            kidneys –– cause fatal kidney complaints such as dropsy, stricture,

                        <p>It is exceedingly gratifying to find that the proposal of the A.S.C. to
                            introduce pigeon shooting on the club ground, is meeting with strenuous
                            opposition. It will be simply disgraceful if the committee persist in
                            their intention, and if the members of the club permit them to carry out
                            such a retrograde step.</p>
                        <p>Surely the time has passed even in Egypt for fresh opportunities to be
                            created for the practice of cruelty such as that involved in the
                            shooting of innocent birds for gambling purposes, disguised under the
                            name of sport. Even the few who defend the practice cannot deny its
                            cruelty, and have nothing to urge in its favor, merely contenting
                            themselves with comparing it with other undoubtedly cruel pastimes.</p>
                        <p>How on earth can cruelties practised in England or on the continent
                            condone wrong done in Egypt? This, too, is not a question of the
                            abolition of pigeon shooting at the Velodrome, but one of the
                            institution at the A.S.C., a club mainly, though by no means entirely,
                            supported by British residents.</p>
                        <p>And what steps are its influential patrons taking to protest against the
                            course adopted by the club committee? Many have left Egypt for the
                            summer vacation, but the names of many who have not yet gone will
                            readily be called to mind, and it will be shameful if they permit this
                            to take place without a word of remonstrance against the inquity of the
                            thing.</p>
                        <p>People seem somehow to be tongue-tied in Egypt, and to have so many
                            diverse interests to study that they are afraid to open their mouths.
                            Letters to the paper we get, but they are mostly written under<hi rend="italic"> noms-de-plume</hi>, and as a consequence do not carry
                            anything like the weight they would if the writers signed their names.
                            And in this case it ought not to require much effort to append one's
                            name to a protest against cruelty to poor, defenceless birds, and wanton
                            destruction of animal life. I hope to see within the next day or two a
                            still more emphatic expression of opinion than that already made in the
                            columns of the "Gazette."</p>
                        <p>It seems somewhat remarkable to find in a hospital report that it is
                            claimed that the year 1904 has been "a year of advance," in consequence
                            of the "marked progres in numbers" (of patients treated) that has taken
                            place. After this one may expect prison or lunatic asylum authorities
                            making it a matter of congratulation that the number of inmates shows
                            similar "marked progress."</p>
                        <p>For the inference to be drawn is certainly that, like crime, disease is
                            on the increase in this country. The hospital to which I refer is that
                            of the C.M.S. at Old Cairo, whose medical mission seems to be attended
                            with the same amount of success that generally follows missionary work
                            when directed towards alleviating human suffering.</p>
                        <p>As for the main purpose for which missionary societies are established,
                            the following extract from the report tells its own tale :</p>
                        <p>"Tangible spiritual results are few indeed, and were those our only
                            guarantee of success, and were it not for the knowledge that results are
                            in higher hands, it would be truly hard, having put one's hand to the
                            plough, not to look back."</p>
                        <p>Nor is the C.M.S. in Cairo alone in its lament over its non-success in
                            proselytising. Major-General Sir Alexander Tulloch, in a letter to the
                            London "Times," quotes the following statement made by a medical
                            missionary working among the mountains in the north of India.</p>
                        <p>"I have been at work now for 15 years. I do not believe I have made one
                            sincere convert, but I have operated successfully for stone on over
                            1,000 natives."</p>
                        <p>It is impossible to shut one's eyes to the fact that an immense amount of
                            good is done by foreign missionaries, but it is equally impossible to
                            doubt that it is done in a <hi rend="italic">very</hi> different
                            direction to that generally understood to be the one intended by "the
                            kind-hearted old ladies who so liberally subscribe (I quote
                            Major-General Tulloch) to the conversion of the poor benighted heathern
                            who bow down to stocks and stone." Had it not been for the openings that
                            presented themselves for medical and educational work –– opportunities
                            of which the quick-witted Americans were not slow to avail themselves ––
                            foreign missions would have been in a far more hopeless position to-day
                            than they are.</p>
                        <p>But the old original tale is told, and the pretence made that the real
                            good done is only a secondary consideration, and thus the money for the
                            support of missions is obtained under what, to speak plainly, are
                            nothing but</p>
                <cb n="2"/>
                <p>false pretences, and the old stock tales of "conversions" are as greedily
                            swallowed now as they were when as a boy I attended the many missionary
                            meetings to which my good mother took me.</p>
                        <p>But I used to do little sums in arithmetic, and sometimes was fairly
                            staggered at the exceeding great cost of "conversions," and as my eyes
                            became open to the misery and sin around me on every side, and the want
                            of help at home, I somehow lost interest in foreign missions, feeling
                            that the money they cost could be better spent in England, although it
                            has been only recently that I have been able to estimate the
                            cock-and-bull stories to which I listened in the days of my youth, at
                            their true value.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Rudolph has rendered yeoman's service to the cause of humanity in the
                            past, but he probably never helped the cause of truth and honesty more
                            than by his letter in last Wednesday's paper. Nor did he err on the side
                            of want of charity, for he could have made out a much stronger case than
                            he did, and I should not wonder if there is a good deal of flatter in
                            the dove cotes, not unmixed with anxiety as to what further relevations
                            he may make as to so-called conversions of Jews.</p>
                        <p>"A Native of Upper Egypt" has also had something to say as to missions to
                            Mohamedans, and altogether more than a little light has been thrown on
                            mission work during the past few days.</p>
                        <p>A very valuable book entitled "The Principles of Heredity," by Dr. G.
                            Archdall Reid, has lately been published, about which I hope to be able
                            to write at some length when I have completed my study of it. Valuable
                            as a medical treatise on a subject upon which hitherto no text books
                            have appeared, the technical part of the work is small compared with the
                            matter that the general reader can appreciate, and the concluding
                            chapters, in which the subject is approached from the mental and
                            religious point of view, are instructive in the highest degree.</p>
                        <p>The author makes frequent extracts from the writings of Professor James
                            of Harvard University, whose recently published work, "Varieties of
                            Religious Experience," is one that no student of the different phases of
                            religious beliefs, emotion, and experience should omit to read. It is in
                            the Ramleh Library, and perhaps is also obtainable at Cairo.</p>
                        <p>The volume consists of the Gifford lectures delivered at Edinburgh
                            University in 1901-2, and it contains many very striking features, one
                            of the most interesting of which is the discussion of the phenomenon of
                            conversion. The views of so eminent a psychologist on such a matter are
                            well worth studying, however disposed orthodox theologians may be to
                            pick holes in them, and to dispute the professor's conclusions.</p>
                        <p>After an exhaustive analysis of religious experiences, which extends over
                            nearly 500 pages, the professor asks, "Is the existence of so many
                            religious types and sects and creeds regrettable?"</p>
                        <p>And to this question he answers emphatically "No," giving many cogent
                            reasons for this conclusion, which I regret I have not sufficient space
                            now to enumerate. The high spiritual discernment of the author is
                            evidenced all throughout the book –– a very rare thing in purely
                            scientific literature, –– which greatly adds to its value.</p>
                        <p>As I have not of late signed my full name to these nates, and, in this
                            paper, have remarked on the necessity of signatures to personal
                            expressions of opinion, I will append mine this week, although it is
                            pretty generally understood that T.A. stands for</p>

                <p>The rumours which have been for some time in circulation pointing to a conversion
                            of the foreign debt of Greece are taking more definite shape. The
                            process, it is said, will be similar to that employed in connection with
                            the Turkish debt. As with that affair, a French syndicate has the matter
                            in hand, and two of its members have been despatched to Athens to
                            impress upon the Greek Government the advantages of unification. Terms
                            are not likely to be arranged for some little time at least to come, but
                            no doubt they will represent an improvement upon the present position,
                            though in return for this something will have to be sacrificed in the
                            way of further developments, and, as we know, the revenues of the
                            country have been on an improving scale for a considerable period.
                            British holders of Greek obligations are numerous, and it is to be hoped
                            that they will insist against the interference with the powers of the
                            International Commission, which was appointed in 1897-8. The Guaranteed
                            Loan would, of course, be excluded from the scheme.</p></div>

                <head type="sub">RETURNS OF SHIPPING AND TONNAGE.</head>
                <p>The returns of the navigation through the Suez Canal for the year 1904, as
                            compared with those of the two previous years 1902 and 1903, show that
                            the net tonnage for the pasy year increased by 1,494,547 tons as
                            compared with that of 1903, and by 2,153,422 tons as compared with that
                            of 1902. Notwithstanding the reduction of 50 centimes in the tonnage
                            dues which took effect from the 1st January, 1903, the transit receipts
                            during that year amounted to fr. 103,620,268, or only fr. 99,752 less
                            than those of 1902, while those for last year amounted to fr.
                            115,818,479, and were higher than in any previous year since the opening
                            of the Canal. The increase in the tonnage passing through the Suez Canal
                            during 1904 is owing to heavy shipments of wheat from India to Europe,
                            and to the large quantities of coal consigned to the East, which latter
                            exceed by about 500,000 tons the shipments during the year 1903, and
                            which were, no doubt, principally for the use of the belligerent
                            fleets.</p>
                        <p>The number of vessels which passed through the Canal was 3,708 in 1902,
                            3,761 in 1903, and 4,237 in 1904, of which 2,165 in 1902, 2,278 in 1903,
                            and 2,679 in 1904 carried the British flag. There has been an increase
                            of 1,430,376 tons last year as compared with 1903 in the tonnnage of
                            British vessels, which amounted to 6,772,911 tons in 1902, 7,403,553
                            tons in 1903, and 8,833,929 tons in 1904. During the same period, the
                            tonnage of German vessels has increased from 1,707,322 tons in 1902 to
                            1,773,265 tons in 1903, and to 1,969,661 tons in 1904.</p>
                        <p>The percentage of British vessels and their net tonnage increased in
                            1904, being 63.2 and 65.9 respectively, as against 60.6 and 62.2 in 1903
                            and 58.4 and 60.2 in 1902. The percentage of German vessels and their
                            net tonnage was 12.8 and 14.7 respectively, as compared with 13.1 and
                            14.9 in 1903, and 12.9 and 15.2 in 1902, while the percentage of net
                            tonnage of the other maritime nations using the Canal in 1904 remained
                            practically stationary as compared with the preceding year.</p>
                        <p>Of 3,289 merchant-vessels and vessels in ballast, of a net tonnage of
                            10,316,600 tons, passing through the Canal, 2,433 ships, of a net
                            tonnage of 7,847,307 tons, were British, being fully 74 per cent. of the
                            number and fully 76.06 per cent. of the tonnage ; 356, or 13.8 per
                            cent., were German vessels, whose tonnage was 10.5 per cent. of the
                            whole ; France, Holland, Norway, Austria-Hungary, and Italy combined
                            furnishing a total of 10.5 per cent. of the tonnage carrying trade to
                            the East through the Suez Canal.</p>
                        <p>In the ten years 1891-1900, the annual net tonnage ranged from 8,698,777
                            tons to 9,738,152 tons, and the transit receipts from fr. 83,422,101 to
                            fr. 90,623,608 The average of the net tonnage was 8,588,947 tons ; while
                            in 1904 the net tonnage amounted to 13,401,835 tons, and the transit
                            receipts to fr. 115,818,479. The mean net tonnage per vessel, which in
                            1881 was only 1,517 tons, rose from 2,067 tons in 1891 to 2,926 tons in
                            1901, and amounted to 3,163 tons in 1904. During last year the Canal was
                            used 63 times by steamers exceeding 150 metres (492 feet) in length or
                            more than 18 metres (59 feet) in breadth, with a draught of over 7
                            metres 50 (24 feet 7 inches).</p>
                        <p>The mean duration of passage for all vessels navigating the Canal was 17
                            hours 48 minutes in 1903 as compared with 18 hours 8 minutes in 1904,
                            while the percentage of vessels navigating by night amounted to 96.1 per
                            cent. in 1903 as compared with 95.7 per cent. in 1904.</p>
                        <p>The percentage of vessels drawing less than 24 ft. 7 in. (7 m. 50 c.) was
                            83.3 in 1904 as against 84.9 in 1903, while that of vessels drawing more
                            than 24 ft. 7 in. was 16.7 in 1904 as compared with 15.1 in 1903. Up to
                            the end of the year 1901, the maximum draught allowed for vessels
                            passing through the Canal was fixed at 25 feet 7 inches, and during
                            1904, 705 vessels, drawing more than 24 feet 7 inches, used the Canal,
                            as compared with 566 in 1903 and 431 in 1902, representing a percentage
                            of 11.6 in 1902, 15.1 in 1903, and 16.7 in 1904. Since the 1st January,
                            1902, the maximum draught allowed has been raised to 26 feet 3 inches (8
                            metres), and during last year 145 vessels, or 3.4 per cent., took
                            advantage of this improvement. During 1904 377 vessels passed through
                            the Canal for the first time, of which 92 belonged to shipping companies
                            whose vessels regularly use the Canal.</p>
                        <p>The number of troops carried through the Canal during last year amounted
                            to 81,431 as against 80,583 in 1903, being an increase of 848. There was
                            an increase of 7,092 British, 190 Dutch, 137 Russian, 109 Portuguese,
                            and 341 American, against a decrease of 4,222 French, 1,296 Italian,
                            1,202 Turkish, and 18 German troops as compared with 1903. The number of
                            civilian passengers amounted to 90,708 in 1904 as against 89,272 in the
                            preceding year, being an increase of 1,436, while the number of
                            pilgrims, emigrants, and convicts was 38,706 in 1904, as compared with
                            25,362 in 1903, or an increase of 13,344.</p>
                        <p>In the year 1870,26,758 civil and military passengers were carried
                            through the Canal ; in 1880 the number rose to 98,900, in 1890 to
                            161,352, in 1900 to 282,203, and in 1904 it amounted to 210,849, as
                            against 195,232 in 1903.</p>

                <p>The text of the Bill passed recently, which alters the method of recruiting the
                            German Army, has just been officially released. Henceforward every
                            German who is medically fit will have to serve seven years in the active
                            army, from the age of twenty to twenty-seven and a day. He will then
                            pass into the first category of the Landwehr, in which he will remain
                            five years, and will then be enrolled in the second category until the
                            21st March of the year in which he reaches the age of thirty-nine.
                            During the seven years of their active service the cavalry and artillery
                            will have to remain three years with the colours, and the infantry two
                            years. The reservists of all arms will have to serve eight weeks, at two
                            different periods, and there are also alterations in the service of the
                            Landwehr. At the same time, the numbers of the army are to be gradually
                            increased, so that in 1910 the army will include 505,039 men, 25,000
                            officers, 85,000 non-commissioned officers, and 10,000 volunteers for a
                            year. These figures do not include the marines, the gendarmerie, and the
                            soldiers serving in China. In this manner the German army in 1910 will
                            be increased to 633 battalions of infantry, 510 squadrons of cavalry,
                            and 574 field batteries, while all the other branches will be
                            proportionally augmented. It is evident that the policy of the Kaiser
                            does not tend towards peace, for this enormous increase takes place at a
                            time when the Navy is also being brought up to first-class rank, while
                            on land the Russian army has been hopelessly defeated, and the
                            stationary population of France makes it harder every year to keep the
                            army of the Republic up to its normal standard.</p>

                            incident that took place in Grand Canary a few years ago (says the
                            "Chronicle"). A young American was mudered for his money in one of the
                            Spanish inns near the harbour, and his fox-terrier was carried off to a
                            plantation in the hills by one of the accomplices. Two whole years the
                            later the dog was brought back again to the town, and it immediately

                            howled so piteously that it attracted the attention even of the Spanish
                            policeman. This led to the discovery of its master's body and the final

                    <p>On a pu assister a une agreable surprise a la un de ce mois qui avait si mal
                        commence et qui semblait devoir se clore par une liquidation des plus
                        laborieuses. Contrairement a l'ordre normal, l'animation a reparu au moment
                        de la liquidation et la cote est remontee sur presque toute la ligne. Cet
                        effet, contraire a toutes les previsions, a ete determine par deux mobiles
                        principaux : d'une part, la defaite navale russe qui permet d'envisager la
                        paix comme prochaine et, de l'autre, les mesures de precaution prises par
                        les speculateurs trop engages qui avaient eu l'occasion lors des deux
                        dernieres liquidations de voir ce qu'il en coutait d'attendre au dernier
                        moment pour alleger des positions intenables. Ces allegements ont beaucoup
                        contribue a assainir la place, mais c'est au seul desastre russe qu'il faut
                        attribuer la hausse a Londres et par contre-coup en Egypte, dont le marche
                        depend surtout de Londres. Ajoutons a ce propos que les bourses de tous les
                        pays attendent impatiemment la paix et cela est si vrai que la Bourse de
                        Paris a ete elle-meme fort peu affectee par la nouvelle du desastre russe,
                        dans l'espoir sans doute que ce desastre, de tous le plus irreparable,
                        amenera enfin la paix.</p>
                    <p>Au debut de la periode que nous passons en revue, l'attention etait
                        concentrate presque uniquement sur la Daira Sanieh et sur les actions Credit
                        Foncier Egyptien. Aux termes de l'accord intervenu entre les deux societes
                        tout l'actif et le passif de la Daira passerait au Credit Foncier moyennant
                        un paiement par ce dernier de £.9.900.000 qu'il se procurerait par
                        l'emission de £.6.600.000 d'obligations (Avec un interet probable de 3%) et
                        de £.3.300.000 d'actions emises au cours de 825 francs. Ces deux emissions
                        sont deja garanties par deux syndicate. Les actions nouvelles du Credit
                        Foncier seront entierement reservees aux actionnaires actuels dans la
                        proportion d'une action nouvelle pour deux anciennes et de 50 actions
                        nouvelles pour une part de fondateur. Quant aux actions Daira, on dit
                        qu'elles seront payees a raison de 30 a 30 ½ £. les actions ordinaires et
                        200 £. les actions Deferred. Les porteurs de Daira's attendaient a beaucoup
                        mieux ou du moins escomptaient l'echange de leurs titres-contre des titres
                        Credit Foncier. Les actions Credit Foncier elles-memes n'ont guere profite
                        du nouvel etat de choses et, a moins qu'un mouvement a la hausse ne se
                        dessine bientot, l'emission des actions nouvelles Foncier ne pourrar
                        reussir.</p>
                    <p>De 29 1/8 au debut la Daira flechit graduellement a 28 11/16 ; on comprend
                        qu'a ce prix c'est un placement avantageux, meme si la liquidation de fin
                        octobre se fait seulement a £30. Par contre, la Fondateur Daira remonte de
                        178 £ a 185 acheteurs. Pour le Credit Foncier il se produit le meme
                        mouvement en sens inverse : l'action flechit de 832 a 826 pendant que la
                        Fondateur monte de 7500 fr. a 7900.</p>
                    <p>De 13 ½ au debut, l'Agricole flechit plus tard a 13 ¼ sous la pression des
                        ventes fin du mois, mais elle ne tarde pas a reprendre a la nouvelle que
                        l'emission d'actions au pair, au lieu d'etre retardee jusqu'en octobre,
                        comme on le supposait, aura lieu tres prochainement. On cloture a 14 tres
                        ferme et en bonne tendance. Le chiffre d'affaires a ete enorme.</p>
                    <p>Delaissee d'abord a 27 ½, la National Bank revient en faveur et atteint £28
                        l'action ancienne et £ 26 13/16 la nouvelle. Ce dernier prix est egalement
                        celui de la National Bank ex-droit de souscription. Le prochain lancement de
                        la Banque Nationale d'Abyssinie dans lequel la National Bank est fortement
                        interesse, est pour beaucoup dans la hausse du cours.</p>
                    <p>La Land Bank a fluctue entre 9 et 9 1/8, pour cloturer a ce dernier prix. Les
                        operations ont ete assez nombreuses.</p>
                    <p>De 13 la Delta Light reprend a 13 ¼, pour retomber bientot entre 13 1/16 et
                        13 1/8. Cette valeur, qui semble en ce moment peu recherchee, ne tarders pas
                        a revenir en vogue.</p>
                    <p>En Banque d'Athenes on fluctue entre 121 et 124, pour finir a 123. Le
                        mouvement d'affaires a ete considerable. La hausse provient en partie du
                        prochain lancement d'un Credit Foncier Hellenique sous le patronage de la
                        Banque d'Athenes.</p>
                    <p>Tres faible deja a 33/, la Salt &amp; Soda a encore flechi jusqu'a 32/3 a la
                        suite de ventes importantes, provenant des porteurs d'actions Huileries qui
                        vendaient le resultat de leur faculte d'obtenir 11 actions Salt &amp; Soda
                        au cours de 32 shellings, plus 23 actions Salt &amp; Soda contre une action
                        Huileries. Ces ventes etant terminees, le marche a deja repris et le cours a
                        regagne 35/6, pour finir acheteur a 35/.</p>
                    <p>Apres avoir debute a 1 15/16, l'Investment a flechi jusqu'a 1 19/32 sur les
                        ventes forcees de certains petits speculateurs qui se sont trouves dans
                        l'impossibilite de recevoir ou du</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>fait de certains autres qui escomptaient des prix beaucoup plus bas pour la
                        liquidation de fin du mois. On cloture a 1 25/32 en bonne demande. La
                        societe est en train de conclure plusieurs affaires qui promettent de beaux
                        profits.</p>
                    <p>Le meme mouvement a eu lieu sur les Estates et pour les memes motifs. Le
                        cours, apres avoir flechi de 31/32 a 13/16m est remonte a 31/32 acheteurs,
                        avec des transactions se chiffrant par milliers de titres.</p>
                    <p>De forts paquest de Trust ont egalement change de mains a un cours variant de
                        1 ¼ a 1 5/16.</p>
                    <p>La Behera debute a 45 5/8, atteint 46 et retombe en cloture a 45. L'action de
                        jouissance est demandee a 5 1/16.</p>
                    <p>En Delta Land les affaires ont ete restreintes. Le cours flechit de 2 9/16 a
                        2 7/16.</p>
                    <p>La Ramleh demeure stationnaire a 7 ¾.</p>
                    <p>Les Priviligiees Tramways ont donne lieu a d'importantes transactions entre
                        154 et 155 ½. On cloture a 149 ½ ex-coupon (6 fr. 50.)</p>
                    <p>Sur un rapport des plus satisfaisants et sur la nouvelle definitive d'un
                        dividende de 9 %, l'Anglo-American Nile reprend eufiu de 5 9/16 a 5 11/16
                        acheteurs.</p>
                    <p>La Khedivial Mail monte de 4 1/16 a 4 ¼ pour finir a 4 1/8.</p>
                    <p>De 1 1/16 l'Oasis tombe a 15/16, mais reprend bientot a £1 acheteurs.</p>
                    <p>Les Brasseries demeureut sans changements appreciables, celles d'Alexandrie a
                        205 ex-coupon, et celle du Caire a 122.</p>
                    <p>Le chiffre d'affaires en Markets a ete assez important. Le cours debute a
                        22/6 et cloture a 22/3 acheteurs.</p>
                    <p>Les Eaux du Caire flechissent de 1150 a 1130 francs et l'Alexandria Water Co.
                        de 16 a 15 7/8, avec affaires tres limitees.</p>
                    <p>L'Urbaine est ferme entre 4 5/16 et 4 3/8.</p>
                    <p>En resume le marche a l'air un peu plus sain et la tendance est bonne. Il
                        semble bien, cependant, que l'heure soit peu propice aux emissions de
                        nouvelles societes. Celles-ci feront bien, a notre avis, d'atteudre pour se
                        lancer, le mois d'octobre, epoque a laquelle le courant est generalement a
                        la hausse.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="italic">(Aujourd'hui a midi et demie)</hi></p>
                    <p>Le marche a ouvert ce matin avec beaucoup d'animation ; mais, vers la fin, la
                        liquidation de fin du mois a pese un peu sur les cours et il se pourrait que
                        la faiblesse persiste encore lunci.</p>
                    <p>La National Bank hausse de 28 a 28 1/16, la Banque d'Athenes de 123 a 123 ¾,
                        la Salt &amp; Soda de 35 a 35/6, l'Anglo American Nile de 5 11/16 a 5 ¾ et
                        les Privilegiees Tramways de 149 ½ a 151.</p>

                        <p>The colonelcy of the 2nd Battalion King's Royal Rifle Corps is vacant by
                            the appointment of <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q335773">Lord Grenfell</persName> to that of the 2nd Life Guards.</p>
                        <p>Some details of Engineers, Artillery, and infantry will be sent to Egypt
                            next month, to fill vacancies in the usual course.</p>
                        <p>It is expected that the 2nd Battalion Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers and
                            the 2nd Battalion Royal Berkshire Regiment in Egypt will leave that
                            country next trooping season for Malta and India respectively.</p>

                        <p>The 3rd Battalion Rifle Brigade, which left England in 1887 for Egypt,
                            will leave Aden about September for home. On arrival home it will be
                            stationed at Devenport.</p>

                        <p>Yesterday –– Empire Day ––the <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q20875">King</persName> witnessed some
                            manoeuvres at Aldershot and subsequently unveiled a memorial to the
                            memory of the officers and men of the Royal Army Medical Corps who laid
                            down their lives in the late South African War. In doing so his Majesty
                            said that it gave him a melancholy pleasure to accede to the request to
                            unveil the memorial in remembrance of the gallant officers and men who
                            fell in South Africa. He was aware of the valuable services they
                            rendered to their country and to the sick and wounded, and he was sure
                            that the Corps would now and in the future, if possible, excel in those
                            duties. A number of officers of the R.A.M.C. were afterwards presented
                            to the King.</p>
                        <p>Empire Day was marked at St. Paul's Cathedral by the unveiling by the

                            in South Africa. The impressive ceremony was carried out in the presence
                            of a very large and fashionable congregation, including the <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q19008">Prime

                        <p>Temperance principles are making such steady progress in the Army that
                            even the most fanatical zealot might be expected to wait and watch for
                            the final outcome. It appears, however, that some of these well-meaning
                            but utterly wrong-headed persons are striving to confine membership of
                            the Royal Army Temperance Association exclusively to teetotallers. At
                            present this excellent institution is happily free from that restriction
                            on its usefulness, and the result is that thousands of the rank and file
                            join who would hold aloof were total abstinence made a governing
                            condition of membership. It is not disputed that this professional
                            combination against over-indulgence in strong drink operates most
                            beneficially both individually and collectively. All military
                            authorities are agreed on that point, and they are also practically
                            unanimous in opposing the mischievous proposals of the fanatical</p>
                    <cb n="3"/>
                        <p>faddists. As matters stand, the way is smoothed for the moderate drinker
                            to become a total abstainer gradually if so disposed, a process which
                            constantly produces the effect desired by the teetotal crusaders. They
                            would do well to reflect, therefore, whether the cause they have at
                            heart –– a right good cause, in itself –– would be likely to benefit by
                            barring out from membership of the association every soldier who could
                            not see his way to subscribe to their particular shibboleth.</p>
                        <p>We have it now, on the authority of the Army Council, that a number of men
                            serving in the Army Reserve have applied to be taken back to the colours
                            because of their inability to find work. It is impossible to
                            over-estimate the seriousness of the announcement, in view of the fact
                            that the whole recruiting problem turns on this question of unemployment
                            of soldiers on their return to civil life. Things have been tending this
                            way for some time past, and it is having its due effect on the
                            recruiting market. With the prospect of their sons having to join the
                            ranks of the unemployed in return for serving their King and country, it
                            is unreasonable to expect respectable parents to allow them to enlist if
                            they have the power to prevent them. The behaviour of some of the
                            railway companies and other large employers of labour in finding work
                            for ex-soldiers is most patriotic, and it is to be regretted the
                            Government departments do not follow their example. It is rather the
                            duty of the authorities to set the example, but they do not do so. At
                            the recent meeting of the Society for the Employment of Reserve and
                            Discharged Soldiers, it was prominently remarked upon that the civil
                            departments of the Government, outside the War Office, have done nothing
                            ; they are most apathetic in the matter. Among the class from which the
                            Army used to draw its best recruits it is now common report that
                            enlistment in the Army is the very worst look-out for a decent lad. The
                            Government is, to a very great extent, responsible for this –– not the
                            War Office, because I think every effort has been made there to find
                            employment for the men ; and I hope that the War Secretary will now
                            hasten to urge on the other departments their duty in the matter.</p>
                        <p>Confidence is still shaken in Mr. Balfour's assurances that, provided we
                            maintain a predominant Navy, we need never foreign invasion. The
                            discussion verges, however, on the academic, the premises remain
                            problematical, the security we are promised is still conditional. Not so
                            the threat to India, which looms much nearer, with no more guarantee
                            against it than safeguarding Afghanistan. We are told that any attempt
                            on its integrity will be taken as a <hi rend="italic">casus belli</hi>,
                            and that we shall fight forthwith. It is but common prudence to consider
                            what this means. What array of force could we marshal for the defence of
                            India against attack from the North-West Frontier? Lord Kitchener has
                            fixed the numbers he would require in immediate reinforcement at eight
                            infantry divisions, with the necessary artillery and cavalry, the whole
                            totalling to upwards of 100,000 men. Now, we have in all, exclusive of
                            the permanent Indian garrison, barely 300,000 men available for external
                            war, and this total includes every regular soldier at home and abroad,
                            in these islands and at the Colonies, with the first class Army Reserve
                            of say, 75,000 men thrown in. The balance of less than 200,000, after
                            deducting the first immediate addition to the Indian garrison as above,
                            will be the sum total of our armed strength left to meet the wastage on
                            the first year's campaigning. Here is matter for very grave and solemn
                            consideration. We may hug ourselves in the knowledge that invasion of
                            these islands has been pronounced impossible by experts, but the
                            invasion of India is certainly on the cards, and Mr. Balfour has gone
                            the length of stating exactly would bring us into the field. No alarmist
                            is needed to point out how ludicrously unequal we should be to the
                            crisis, and, properly used, the champions of conscription should find
                            they have in this a powerful weapon in their hands.</p>

                        <p>London, May 27.</p>
                        <p>It is, perhaps, just as well as to recall the fact that the
                            Anglo-Japanese Treaty, which was signed on January 30, 1902, is to
                            remain in force for five years from that date, and that it contained a
                            stipulation to the effect that if neither party to it notified, twelve
                            months before the expiration of that period, an intention to terminate
                            it, it should continue in force until the expiration of one year from
                            any date on which either of them should denounce it. The Treaty,
                            therefore, primarily holds good until January 30, 1907, but his
                            Majesty's Government must, naturally enough, already be seriously
                            considering what steps, in the not very distant future, will have to be
                            taken in regard to it. The considerations that necessarily arise are
                            whether it should be renewed in its present form, or whether a new
                            Treaty should be entered into, giving a much wider and more
                            comprehensive scope to the alliance between the two countries. The
                            subject is one of the most vital importance, and we may rest assured
                            that it has Lord Lansdowne's very earnest and anxious attention. So long
                            as the war between Russia and Japan lassts the existing Treaty, of
                            course, endures ; but as well as devoutly hope that it may be over
                            before 1907, it is eminently desirable that negotiations between Japan
                            and ourselves should proceed so that when the adjustment of things in
                            the Far East has to be faced our position and theirs may be perfectly
                            clear.</p>
                        <p>Colonel <persName>Lonsdale Hale</persName> sounds a note of serious
                            warning in the "Times" against the light-hearted optimism of his
                            Majesty's Govrernment on the subject of possible "raids" upon our coast
                            lines by the enemy in the event of war. Mr. Arnold-Forster has stated,
                            in the House, that raids "are not a source of serious anxiety to his
                            Majesty's Govvernment." To which Colonel Lonsdale Hale replies, in
                            effect, that, if they are not, they ought to be. Mr. Arnold Forster has
                            issued certain Army Orders giving the reorganisation of military
                            commands, which specify the duties of the "commanders of coast
                            defences." But where are those "200,000 Volunteers, thoroughly trained
                            and thoroughly equipped," who, he told the House of Commons, "will
                            suffice to meet a raid"? And echo answers ––"Where?" Colonel Hale points
                            out that raids are not only possible but extremely probable, and
                            furthermore, that it will be impossible to improvise adequate coast
                            defence at the last moment. All which suggests that, <hi rend="italic">pace</hi> Mr. Balfour, we have yet something to do before we ought
                            to feel quite happy and confortable as to safety of our enormous coast
                            line.</p>
                        <p>Monday's "scene in the House" was, of course, in colloquial language,
                            "such a scene as never was." It has shocked the members and the public,
                            and amazed the oldest inhabitant of Westminster, who can find no
                            parallel for it, in his experience. The damage done reacts in several
                            directions. This crazy "Scene" makes us contemptible in the eyes of
                            foreign observers, once envious of our calm and order, and encourages
                            the further ravages of that disorder that makes modern government a
                            difficult matter. It may also have far-reaching consequences at home.
                            Already pessimism was prevalent enough. Experienced observers have
                            deplored in hopeless despair the "decay of Parliament," without being
                            able to suggest a plausible remedy for the disease, and the public has
                            shown a marked impatience with the way in which the nation's business is
                            conducted by those who are sent to Westminster for that high purpose.
                            But this last extravagance crowns all. Nothing more is needed to prove
                            how low we have sunk, and a point may now have been reached at which
                            comes the conviction that "something must be done." It is a thousand
                            pities that there is no law enforcing severe penalties against those who
                            organise degrading and dangerous exhibitions, for under its operations
                            many honorable members would assuredly have come. Failing that some
                            other plan must be tried. For it is plain that a continuance of present
                            conditions endangers the stability of the Constitution, and does
                            incalculable harm to the welfare of the State.</p>
                        <p>If anything could make the Opposition thoroughly ashamed of themselves
                            for Monday night's scene it should be the criticisms in the German
                            papers. All deplore it, and most treat it as a proof of the decadence of
                            the parliamentary principle and as indicating the approaching end of our
                            Parliamentary system. The Berlin "Post" pertinently asks what impression
                            the scene will make in Russia, where the people are just beginning to
                            reach forward to the Parliamentary idea. It must be a proud thought for
                            the Opposition, that they have not</p>
                        <cb n="4"/>
                        <p>only degraded the Mother of Parliaments in the eye of the world, but have
                            done what they could to stifle aspirations towards freedom in other
                            lands.</p>
                        <p>Once again the Channel Tunnel scheme, which has been in abeyance for over
                            twenty ears, is likely to be dragged into the light and seriously
                            considered as a practical project. The matter has been under discussion
                            at a meeting of English and French railway managers, and the opinion was
                            expressed that the time was near when the national approval might be
                            sought with reasonable prospects of success. The support of France and
                            its investors is reckoned as assured. It is from this side of the
                            Channel that opposition will come, if at all. Twenty years ago the
                            argument that killde the Bill was that of the increased risk of
                            invasion. The cordial relations now existing between France and England,
                            of course, discount this objection to some extent. It is a pity that Mr.
                            Balfour, in his recent estimate of the chances of invasion, could not
                            have taken this possible factor into account. As to the commercial
                            advantage to both countries of such a tunnel, if once constructed, there
                            could be but little question.</p>
                        <p>I am glad to see that the Motor Union have determined to take stringent
                            measures against reckless driving, bu they will not need to lose time if
                            they have hopes of doing anything to ward off fresh and drastic
                            legislation. There are some edifying items of motoring intelligence in
                            this morning's newspaper. A lady cyclist near Windsor was knocked off
                            her machine by a large motorcar and left insensible upon the road. In
                            South Wales a labourer has been discovered bleeding and senseless on the
                            spot where he had been run down by a motor several hours before. It
                            appears to be the settled policy of certain drivers to make a run for it
                            if they think the victim is too seriously hurt to be able to take a note
                            of their number. It only requires a few more incidents of this kind, and
                            we shall have something approaching a state of civil war.</p>
                        <p>Slowly but surely the motor omnibus is displacing its older rival, the
                            horse-drawn vehicle. Two new motor omnibuses were put to-day on the
                            Cricklewood to Marble Arch route by the London General Omnibus Company,
                            bringing its total up to four. This number would be considerably greater
                            had there not been so many disappointments in the delivery of some of
                            the sixty odd similar vehicles on order. These are being supplied by
                            seven different makers, as the desire of the company is to decide by
                            trial which is the best make. The London Road Car Company has at present
                            twelve motor omnibuses on the streets, and about fifty more ond order
                            from three different firms. </p>
                        <p>In the opinion of Mr. Kingham, the Secretary of the London General
                            Omnibus Company, as well as Mr. Duff, the manager of the London Road Car
                            Co., the new vehicle has come to stay. As regards the financial side of
                            the question, neither is willing to express an opinion. Both, however,
                            state that on any route a saving of time would be effected, which is the
                            principal factor towards success. A motor-omnibus is capable of a daily
                            mileage half as great again as that of a horse-drawn omnibus on an
                            average route. The carrying capacity also is greater.</p>
                        <p>"Whether they will be more profitable depends entirely upon the life of
                            the chassis," said Mr. Kingham. "I do not think anybody will be able to
                            tell until these have been worked for a couple of years." Tyres are an
                            expensive item.</p>
                        <p>Of all the methods of treating disease (not even excluding the casting
                            out of devils by the saltations of medicine men of which Sir Frederick
                            Treves has told us entertaining stories) none is less easy to comprehend
                            than "Christian Science." This thinking away of illness, and
                            self-persuasion of the non-existence of hurtful matter, which is part
                            mysticism of a sort and part pure crankiness, may have its uses. For the
                            "malade imaginaire," for the tooth-ache, and for the nervous troubles of
                            the age, it may serve, and can do no harm. But when it comes to
                            bronchial pneumonia, and when it comes to letting your child die of this
                            because you deliberately prefer the prayers of the "faith-healer" to the
                            poultices of the qualified doctor, then it is time to put a stopper on
                            absurdity that has a criminal touch in it. Such was a case that the
                            Twickenham Deputy Coroner has had before him. At the request of the jury
                            he censured the father, "telling him that if another such case happened
                            he would committed for trial for manslaughter."</p>
                        <p>Some of the Colonial ecclesiastical dignitaries seem to have a poor
                            opinion of the mother-country. Dr. Julius, the Bishop of Christchurch,
                            according to a "Times" telegram, has just been uttering "a scathing
                            condemnation of English fashionable life." His Lordship recently visited
                            London, and this is what he found :</p>
                        <p>England had broken loose from the religious, the parental, and the social
                            code, and the tendency was to break away from the moral code. There was
                            a strange licence in a great deal of modern English life.</p>
                        <p>Well, perhaps we are no better than we should be, but are we quite as bad
                            as the Bishop would have his flock believe? It is at all events
                            something new to be lectured in this fashion from the Colonies.</p>
