                            Address of the Duma is shown equally in the Imperial Decree recording
                            its dismissal. ‘The representatives of the nation have strayed into
                            spheres beyond their competence,” says the Tsar; and the instances oited
                            are three. They have made inquiries into the aots of local authorities
                            instituted by the Emperor, which, being i nterpreted, is, that they have
                            presumed to fix the responsibility of the Bielostok massacres upoo their
                            real authors, md they have complained cf the corruption of the
                            Bureaucracy. Again, they have made com- mentg/on the imperfections of
                            the fundamental iaw», which can only be modified by the Im- perial will.
                            Bit the Russian code is notorioosly both contradictory and barbarous ;
                            and it is mrely not beyond the competence even of a merely deliberative
                            body to suggest the exci­sion of admitted fanlts. Thirdly, they have
                            appealed'to the nation, and this, it is true, was a mistake both in
                            tactics and on higher constitutional ground. Whether it was a orimeb
                            which necessitated the dissolution of the body which committed it we
                            take leave to doubt: but the excuse put forward that the peasants were
                            “disturbed by saoh anomalies" will not hold. They were much more
                            disturbed by the war with Japan, which to many was a revela- ‘ion of a
                            new world; and the fact that they had a voice in the affairs of their
                            ooontry at all was a more glaring anomaly than any excess committed by
                            their representatives in St Petersburg. The alternative see-saw between
                            Parliamentary government and the inflexible will of Nioholas II. will
                            beoome a disturbing feature of the first magnitude during the next few
                            months, aid though the peasant’s mind I moves slowly, when he has once
                            decided on aotion he does not draw back.</p>
                        <p>Taken at the best, the situation is moat serioas. Even though we indulge
                            in the almost impossible hope that everything will remain quiet, the
                            next Duma mast be far less concilia­tory in tone than the one whose end
                            has now come, says the “Globe . The moderating infiaenoe of the
                            Constitutional Demoorats will be absent,for, like the Trimmers of old in
                            England, the party of compromise will be rejeoted as men unfit for a
                            crisis. It is inconceivable that either the Court or officialdom will be
                            represented to any extent. The former has alienated all save its
                            immediate circle, and perhaps the lowest class of the bourgeoisie, the
                            smaller shopkeepers, who have ever been its most fanatical sup­porters.*
                            The Bureaucracy are detested from eud to end of the Empire; in this all
                            Rus­sian opinion is at one with the audience which first saw an historio
                            drama dealing with that class at St. Petersburg years ago, and was moved
                            to exolaim, “There is not an honest man among them all.” This leaves for
                            members of the next Duma merely the extremists, whose opposition to the
                            Tsar knows no bounds, and the visionaries, whose remedies are made up of
                            a mixture of French philosophy trwo centuries old and a parody of German
                            socialism. It is not to such men that the Mperor can look for the
                            salvation of his country. But before the next election so much may
                            happen that the speculation is unproditblina any event, the Tsar has
                            played his last card, and played it badly. It revolution does not come,
                            he will be face to face witrh a Duma whose demands tiw ill be impossible
                            to concede. If the situation becomes so threatening that he gives way
                            and convokesParliament before the date stated in the Ukase he will be a
                            defeated monarch, and the people will have an anormous advantage on the
                            next rubber. On the other hand, if the revolution can no longer be
                            stayed, he will find the has lost the support of the whole Empire, and
                            even the Army may prove to be a broken reed when he requires its aid the
                            most.</p>

                        <p>SERIOUS FIRE IN CAIRO.</p>
                        <p>A serious fire occurred on Moaday evening in Cairo in 8haria el Godarieh,
                            in the Darb p) Ahmar district, in an oil and paint store whioh is
                            situated between the Greek Orthodox church and the Mttwalli mosqne. Very
                            shortly after the fire was discovered the flames apsu- med alarming
                            proportions, and had it not been for the prompt arrival of the Fire
                            Brigade under the command of Captain Blake with three fire engines, tbe
                            damage must have been far more extensive.</p>
                        <p>In consequence of the highly ii flammable nature ot the oontents of tbe
                            store and the remote possibility of saving i\ the attention of the
                            brigade was chiefly directed towards the surrounding buildings and,
                            though it was not until tin small hours of the morning that the brigade
                            could leave the seme, all danger of a serioas extension of tbe fire was
                            averted in a very short space of time.</p>
                        <p>A considerable portion cf the contents of the stoie were rescued, but the
                            damages, whioh include the destruction of tw» bui’dings, are estimated
                            at about £ If ,&lt; 00.</p>

                        <p>A PRECEDENT FOR SPECIAL COURTS.</p>
                        <p>One seems to have overlooked the fact, says the. Cairo Correspondent of
                            the “Pall Mall Gazette ” that onoe before in the history ot the British
                            occupation of Egypt, unconstitu­tional measures had to be taken in order
                            to settle the natives. It was in 1884, when raid* ing and brigandage was
                            oarried on on an pi.ojiu ua scale in the provinces, and bad come to such
                            a pass that the Native Courts were helpless to repress it. The Criminal
                            Code was set aside, and special oourts, under the title of “Commissions
                            of Brigandage,” were instituted for the trial of all criminal acts. They
                            were given the power of summary juris- diotion, and their decisions
                            savoured very muoh of oourt-martial law. These Commissions sat for five
                            years, until the arrival in the country of Mr. (afterwards Sir John)
                            Soott, who was destined to become Judioial Adviser.</p>
                        <p>These special oourts had a great effect on the raids and brigandage, and,
                            so to speak, stamped them oat, hat they, themselves, were g i’ty of
                            great abases. In many cases the innocent suffered for the guilty, and
                            the per­sonal element entered verueften into the oases. The Commissions
                            were composed of natives, presided over by the Madir or Governor of the
                            province. There was no Earopean gaiding spirit, or even a system of
                            inspection. The Commissions depended from the Ministry of the Interior,
                            which was at that time an entirely native department, and not, strange
                            to say, from the Ministry of Justice. Tbe appointment of M Legrelle to
                            the post of Public Prosecutor in 1887 marked the starting point of
                            reform. He investigated the working of these speoial courts, and demnn^r
                            vted the enormity of their abases, dnp to tin absence of Earopean
                            supervision.</p>
                        <p>In May, 1889, they were at last abolished. Although originally instituted
                            for a fewmon4bs. tbe first short period had been prolonged by special d
                            crees, nntil the oourts bad been in working for five years. The work for
                            which they had been formed had been done by them, for in 1890 acts of
                            brigandage were few and far between, although the means by which this
                            end was attained were snoh as would not bear close investigation. But it
                            was the abolition of these very courts which started the ill-feeling
                            between Ri z Pasha, the Premier, and Sir Evelyn BariDg ill-feeling which
                            culminated in the appointment of Mr. Sjott as Jadioal Ad- vuer to the
                            Egyptian Gjvemment and the re-igrutijn of R’sz.</p>
                        <p>Thus, if S r Edward Grey’s threat of un­constitutional measures is to be
                            oarried oat, there is a very good precedent for the insti­tution of a
                            similar set of conrts for the re­pression of acts of assault. Only this
                            time there will ba no abuses, for the jadioial system in Egypt has been
                            regulated since the Com­mission of Brigandage, and every case will be
                            thoroughly investigated—as all judgments are now—by the staff of
                            Earopean inspectors which iaat present attached to the Ministry of
                            Jastioe.</p>
                        <p>THE DENISHWAI AFFAIR.</p>
                        <p>“Al Moayad” publishes the following re­marks on the Denishawi affair, the
                            papers concerning whioh are to be submitted to the House of Commons to
                            day ;—</p>
                        <p>The documents in regard to the Danishwai case have been translated and
                            submitted to the British Government ; and the first day of Aagust is the
                            date when those papers will be examined by Parliament. How will it end ?
                            To this question the former measures taken by the British officials give
                            the reply. The arrangements made by Lord Cromer and Sir Edward Grey will
                            give a political colour to the papers, and produce an excuse strong
                            enough to let the British officials in Egypt esoape from any blame or
                            responsibility for the acts they oommitted in the Denishwai affair The
                            Mex affray and the aggression on Mr. Ashton, the British inspector of
                            irrigation, may be added to tbe Denish­wai outrage to emphasise the
                            “dangerous fanaticism” whioh has been declared by Sir E. Grey in the
                            British Parliament. The Liberal members will, we presume, remain silent
                            and then the documents will be put aside for ever. This isjtbe
                            conclusion whioh, it is thought, will be arrived at to-morrow,"</p>

                        <p>The announcement that Mr. Runoiman made on Monday night in the House of
                            Commons, to the effect that the future strength of the British foroe in
                            Egypt is to be about 5,700 meD, will be received with general
                            satisfaction among the Earopean population in Egypt, but at the same
                            time it may be doubted whether the inoreaee is not too small considering
                            the actual condition of affairs, and that there would have been a
                            greater sense of seourity if the dambers of the garrison had bsen nearer
                            10,000 than 5,COO. The native Press can have no valid grounds for
                            complaint at the extra expense which Egypt will have to bear for
                            maintaining an inoreased garrison, for that “he who calls the tone must
                            pay the piper” is a principle of world wide application.</p>
                        <p>As there is a good deal of ignorance as to the exaot financial relations
                            between the British and Egyptian Governments in regard to the Army of
                            Occupation, the following aooount will not be inopportune at the present
                            moment. In 1904 the.zimnual cost of the Army of Occupation to the
                            Egyptian Government was inoreased from L.E. 84,825 to L.E. 97,500. The
                            reasons for this increase were as follows : In the early days ot the
                            Occupation, the yearly contribution of the Egyptian Treasury towards the
                            expenses of the British garrison was a sum representing at the time the
                            true extra oost of maintaining the then existing garri­son, over and
                            above that whioh would have been incurred had the troops been stationed
                            in the United Kingdom. For 1885, an ar­rangement was made ander whioh
                            Egypt paid a sum of 4/. per head per month to­wards the expenses of the
                            troops op to a maximum ot 200,000/. This arrangement remained in force
                            for two years, after whioh the snm was reduoed to L.E. 84,825. At this
                            figure, independently of extraordinary expenditure connected with
                            military opera­tions in the Sadan, it was allowed to re­main nntil 1301,
                            although it was far from representing the true extra cost of the
                            gar­rison. Io the course ot the summer of that year the matter was
                            reconsidered, and the British Government, taking into considera­tion the
                            improved financial condition of Egypt, expressed a desire to retain to
                            the original agreement. It was impossible to contest so legitimate a dem
                            tnd, bat in order that the fature charge should not weigh heavily on the
                            Egyptian Treasury it was agreed that the namber of British troops
                            permanently stationed in this country should be reduced, and the sum
                            payable fixed at L E. 97,500 (100.O0G/.) a year, or an inorease of only
                            L.E. 12,675. This sum, which was not to be liable to fluctuations
                            arriving from any minor changes in the total oost of the garrison,
                            represented approximately the true extra expenditure incurred by tbe
                            British Government by reason of the presence ot a British foroe in
                            Egypt, as constituted from the 1st January 1905. The reduction in the
                            foroe (including the British troops at Khar­toum) was expected to bring
                            the number of the garrison to about 3,500 men. Lord Cromer in his
                            pennltimate R°pjrt remarked that it was not necessary nor desirable ‘ on
                            Egyptian as on more general grounds, that the force should be large,”
                            and his Lordship added that “the reduced garrison will amply suffice as
                            a guarantee for the maintenance of public order under all ordinary
                            oircamstanoes.” The circumstances that have ensued in the eighteen
                            months since these words were written have induced Lord Cromer to

                        <p>MUSSAPHA KAMEL’S ROLE.</p>
                        <p>The following suggestive letter appears in the “Standard” :</p>
                        <p>Sir,—Tbe letter appearing in yonr issue of the 23rd ult. from Mustapha
                            Pasha Kamel will he found instructive in England as an authoritative
                            exposition of the views of the self-named National party in this
                            country. That numerous portion of the home poblio which indulges in the
                            belief that the Egyptians are grateful for the benefits arising to them
                            from the British occupation will be surprised to learn that not only
                            snoh is not the case, but that actaally the British are the subjects of
                            their cordial detestation. This, however, is a truth to whioh, as an old
                            resident in Egypt, I can confidently testify. Never, since 1882, do I
                            remember a period when the people, both in town and country, were more
                            antagonistic to us.</p>
                        <p>This result is unquestionably owing to Mus­tapha Pasha Kamel himself and
                            his congeners of the pan-Islam Press, who, sinoe the Akaba dispute, have
                            (doubtless under orders from Yiidiz) persistently directed the anti
                            Earopean sentiment, always more or less current here, against the
                            British. Without the pernicious teachings of that Press the peaceable
                            and normally-phlegmatic Egyptian peasant would never have developed into
                            the demoniac of Denishwai, ready to bludgeon, or even burn aVve, British
                            officers in uniform, and that within six miles of their armed force of
                            150 men capable of scattering like ohaff before the wind the whole of
                            the inhabitants of the village.</p>
                        <p>Daring last year’s Earopean naval demon­stration against *he Porte a
                            belief was current amongst the low class native population of
                            Alex­andria that an order from the Saltan might be daily excepted in
                            Egypt to oommenoe the “Jehad,”or Holy War, and this oulminated in a riot
                            on December 10,which might have resulted much more seriously than it
                            aotually did. The popular sentiment was then unquestion­ably anti
                            Earopean, but, since Akaba it has been directed specially against the
                            British, and the Denishwai outrage with its stern re­tribution has been
                            one of the results. I regard the school of whioh Mastapha Pasha Kamel is
                            the ohief as being the direct oaase of both these incidents.</p>
                        <p>When Mastapha Pasha Kamel affirms that “outsiders” have chiefly profited
                            by British rule in Egypt, he makes a statement entirely ’ contrary to
                            fact, it being impossible to peruse any of Lord Cromer’s reports without
                            perceiv­ing the exclusive way in whioh all his efforts have been
                            directed to the good of Egypt and the Egyptians. To the Egyptian
                            peasant—the bulk of the population—the British occupation has been
                            salvation; others, if profiting, have done so hut incidentally.</p>
                        <p>In my view, the proper recognition of tbe oontents of the letter of
                            Mustapha Pasha Kamel would be the prompt abandonment by us in Egypt of
                            onr blameworthy latitude in Press matters, so astonishing to all the
                            foreign colonists there resident, and the cutting off of the stream of
                            perennial poison with which the pan-Islam journals now so disastrously
                            flood the oountry. I know that in England the “liberty of the Press” is
                            a maxim of almost idolatrous worship, and any proposed restraint in this
                            respect is looked at askanoe. The advantages arising from the liberty of
                            the press as from other forms of liberty depend maoh upon the education
                            and capacity of the receiver. Actually, in Egypt, a country emerging
                            from a serfdom of centuries, snoh liberty in the hands of writers of the
                            type of Mnstapa Pasha Kamel and his colleagues is a source ot great
                            danger to the whole commun­ity, whether native or foreign—henoe th:s

                            to transfer their schools at Kasr el Niland Clot Bey from French to
                            Italian protection by placing them under the patronage of the Italian
                            National Association for Eastern Missions, whioh has undertaken to pay
                            the annual subsidy of 6,000 franos, till then pay­able by the
                            Propagation of the Faith of Lyons, a French institution. In addition to
                            this, the Italian Ministry for Foreign Affairs has grant­ed the schools
                            a subsidy whioh, together with the 6,000 frano% will guarantee the
                            existence of these schools.</p>

                            arrival in that locality is considered here as a diplomatic 8000698 for
                            the Egyptians. The first pour parlers, howsver, gave rise to such

                            straired. They were never very oordiat,Kat lately they have become
                            bitter over the question of the sohool founded in 1861 by the brothers
                            Raphael and Anania Ampetion, for poor children of the Greek community
                            Aooording to the will of the founders, the school was to be placed under
                            the control o a committee of nine, whose president was by right to be
                            the Archbishop of Moant Sinai. 11 now appears that the Arohbishop wished
                            tc prohibit certain persons not possessing the confidence of the
                            community from joining the board of the sohool. Regrettable inoidenti

                            Photius asked the Archbishop of Mount Sinai bis reasons for excluding
                            these persons, and why he had gone to Cairo without the authorisation of

                        <p>' The garrison of the artillery fortress of Sveaborg mutinied last night
                            and bombarded the quarters of the loyal infantry. 500 men were killed or

                            urging them to seize the land of which they had been deprived by the
                            diabolical designs of the Grand Dukes and other counsellors of the Tsar,
                            and to remove the local authorities and select their own representatives
                            instead. The Government had declared war on the nation and now was the
                            time for the country to rise.</p>
                        <p>The Government ha9 decided to prosecute the signatories of the Viborg

                        <p>The gravity of this mutiny will be appreciat­ed by everyone who has any
                            acquaintance with the capital of Finland, for Sveaborg is one of the
                            stock excursions from Helsingfors, from which it is only half an hour's
                            trip in a steam­er. Sveaborg has been called the “Gibraltar of the
                            North" and is of enormous strategic im portanoe, for it proteots the
                            naval harbour of Heisingfors, which is the most important naval station
                            of the Russian Baltic fleet after Cron stadt. The entrance to the
                            harbour is secured by a ohain of seven or eight small islands three of
                            which have been oocupied by the mu­tineers, and the defence? of which
                            are called the fortifications of Sveaborg.</p>
                        <p>There is only one entrance by whioh large ships can reach the harbour;
                            shoals or dams from one island to another blocking up all the other
                            passages. The immediate entrance lies between the islands of Lmgern
                            (whioh i9 200 yards from the southern extremity of the town) and
                            Vester-Svert, and is about 200 yards across ; it is commanded by the
                            fire from the two islands, besides being raked by the batteries on the
                            Oster Lilya-Svert, whioh lies south of the opening between the two
                            former. These three northern fortresses not only defend the ohannel, but
                            also command points on the mainland, where an enemy after takirg the
                            town might attempt to plant his batteries. Three other islands to the
                            southward (Vargen, Gustav Svert, and Oster-Stuor Srert), similarly
                            situated, and if possib’e still more strongly defended, oommand the
                            entranoe from the Gulf, the whole front presented by the succes­sive
                            works being abiut a mile in length. The fortifications on these grunite
                            rooks are suid to be of the mo?t formidable description: the ramparts
                            are scarped out of the rock itself; the batteries are armed with the
                            heaviest ordnance; and each series of works has its own stores of all
                            kinds and bomb-proof cove'*. Casern utes are formed for 6,0.0 or 7,000
                            small arms, and the united fortresses are said to mount 900 cannon and
                            to be garrisoned by 12,000 men ; and there are magazines, arsenal*, and
                            barrack? both upon one of the islands (Gustav Svert) and upon the
                            mainland.</p>
                        <p>The serioas natare of the outbreak is apparent, and if the mutinous
                            troops can hold the fortifications of Sveaborg, not only the Finnish
                            capital, but the whole of the Grand Dnchy, may raise the flag of
                            revolt.</p>

                            evil precedent. Lord Camperdown ridiculed the idea that the reduction?

                            place of two Dreadnoaghts andtwubig armoured cruisers— the original
                            shipbuilding programme for this year—the British Government, as a result
                            of a compromise with theBoardof Admiralty,intend to build three
                            Dreadnoaghts, is authoritatively confirmed. These ships will be laid
                            down at an early date, one being constructed at Ports­mouth, another at
                            Devonport, and a third by a private shipbuilding firm. By the end of the
                            year after next the British Fleet will thas obtain, with the vessel now
                            completing at Portsmouth, a homogeneous strategical unit of four of
                            these powerfol mon-of war, mounting forty gans of the new 12in. type,
                            throwing ai> 850 b shell, and 108 12-pounder anti torpedo- boat weapon0,
                            with a very rapid fire.</p>
                        <p> The squadron of Dreadnoughts will have a sea speed of twenty-one knots,
                            and will be able to cross the Atlantic and return with ont re coaling,
                            so ample will be the provision of coal and oil fuel. These ships will
                            draw less water than any battleship bnilt in recent years and will be
                            admirably suited either for service in the shallow waters of the North
                            Sea or for use east of Suez, as they are well propor­tioned for passing
                            throngh the Canal. In spite of their great displacement, 17,900 tons,
                            the D eadnonght? will require 18in. less water for navigation than the
                            15,000-fcon battleships of the Queen, Bulwark, and Formidable types, and
                            will have tbe advantages of three knots in speed, while they will maik a
                            gain of 42in in draught over the Majestic olass, of whioh one, ths

                            be the longest and broadest battleships hitherto built, and will form
                            the swiftest and most pewerfni battle squadron in the world’s

                        <p>No river on the face of the globe has appeal- ed so long and so vividly to
                            the human * imagination as the Nile. Its regular annual rise and fall, so
                            nnlike the random vagaries of * other streams, its indispensable and never

                            surrounding de g sert, the persistent mystery in which it shrouded i s
                            distant soarces (fontium gui celat origines Nilas') have afforded from re- ’
                            mote antiquity subjects for vagne wonder- ment and crude speculation. Only
                            within onr 1 own time has the problem of the Nile been t solved, though even
                            now it still presents aspects that will demand further exploration and
                            study. The reader who, familiar only with the history of the problem as it
                            appears in ancient literature, opens the large vo- j lume on the
                            “Physiography of the; River Nile r and its Basin,” which has been prepared
                            by c Captain Lyons, Director of the Egyptian Sorvey Department, may be
                            pardoned if he should receive a kind of shock when he turns Q over the
                            crowded paragraphs of statistics, the repellent tables of measurements, the
                            seemingly interminable diagrams of river-sec- 8 tions, and the serried array
                            of dry facts which t follow each other through more than 400 a printed
                            pages. His first feeling may, perhaps, be that he would rather have had the
                            old q brooding mystery perpetuated for centuries to come than see it
                            dissipated in this way by the ruthless and resistless methods of the j
                            modern man of scienoe. There is certainly no poetry or romance in this
                            voluminous report. And yet the story which it has to tell, stripped of its
                            technical verbiage, is not without a kind of romantio interest. As by the
                            labours of successive courageous ex­plorers the oortain has been raised
                            behind which for so many centuries the secret of ® the great river lay
                            hidden, and as the real j explanation has been revealed of the fea- tores
                            that so long puzzled mankind, the old sensation of blank wonder is replaced
                            by g one of keen appreciation of the simple and yet complex beauty of the
                            phenomena. We j are made to confess that the actnal truth proves to be even
                            more marvellous than g were the speculations of antiquity in search of it.

                        <p>The report discusses the climate, meteoro­logy and hydrology of i hi whole
                            extensive region drained by the Nile, stretching 'nm the water shed of Lake
                            Victoria on the south side of the equator throngh more than 30 deg. of
                            latitude to the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. For oonvenieocs of
                            treatmint this large part of Africa is grouped into separate basin’. Far to

                            Farther north the Bihr el GhazU Basin on the west and the Sobat Basin on the
                            east mingled their waters to form the White Nile. From the high tab’e- land
                            of Abyssinia the drainage of the basins of the Blue Nile and the Atbara
                            descends into the plains to unite with the White Nile in forming the great
                            river of Egypt. The Nile below this junction is deec ibed in throe
                            sec­tions—from Khartoum to Assoaan, from As­souan to Cairt, and from Cairo
                            to the Medi­terranean. These several traots of country present some
                            remarkable contrasts of climate. They include, on the one hind, hot,
                            rainless plains, and on the other cod, moist plateaux surmounted by
                            frost-bound mountain peaks. Of special importance in regard to the fl .w of
                            the Nile is tin distribution of the rainfall. It will be remembered that,
                            according to one of the ancient explanations, the annual flood of the liver
                            arises from the melting of snows in Ethiopia. Herodotus forcibly argaed
                            against thia view, and the objections to it were still more clearly urged by
                            Seneca, who pointed in support of his argument to the proofs of the great
                            heat of the climate cf Ethiopia as evin­ce d by the dark oolour of the
                            inhabitants, by</p>
                        <p>the absence of lrbernating animals in the country, and by the presence of
                            serpents even on the highest ground. We now know definite ly that the annual
                            inundation is due to the copious rains that fall in certain parts of the
                            Nile Basin. In Egypt and the greater part of the Sudan the yearly, amount of
                            rain is so small as to be practically negligible. Upon the Abyssinian
                            plateaa, on the other hand, it Bmonnts to probably not less than from 60 in.
                            to 70 io. In the region of the equatorial lakes it appears to vary
                            considerably, being in some plaoes only 30 in. or less, while in others it
                            is 90 in. or mor\ The rain belt has its mean position about 1 deg. north of
                            the equator, where there is almost constant preoipitation. As the belt moves
                            northward with the summer it carries its moisture into the Southern Sudan
                            and the basin of the White Nile and provides the copious downpour on
                            Abyssinia.</p>
                        <p>The most important result of the modern study ot the hydrology of the Nile is
                            shown by Captain Lyons to be the discovery of the relative shares taken by
                            the White and the Blae Nile in the supply of water to the main river. It has
                            been ascertained that a praotically uniform supply is furnished by the vast
                            reser­voirs of the equatorial lakes, so that the White Nile above its
                            junction with the Sobat maintains all the year ronnd nearly the same
                            constant volame. The variations in the rainfall from one season to another
                            do not appear serioasly to modify this uniformity, so that the White Nile
                            plays bat a feeble part in the annual rise of the river in Egypt, amounting
                            perhaps to le-s than one twentieth of the flood. The most important
                            influence affeoting this branch of the Nile is that of the Sobat river,
                            which, descending from the Abyssinian high lands, is periodically swollen by
                            the heavy rains ot that region, and when ponded back at high water by the
                            flood in the Blue Nile pro­vide* a material increase m the volnme of the
                            White Nile in mid-winter.</p>
                        <p>It is the contribution of the Bine Nile which gives to the Egyptian river its
                            distin­guishing characteristics. In consequence of the copious rains that
                            descend upon the Abyssinian tableland that tract of high land has been
                            deeply trenched with innumerable gullies, ravines, and valleys, which have
                            been cut out of the solid rocks by the streams that flow in them. From Jane
                            to September these channels are filled with rushing muddy water, which
                            sweeps its burden of sediment into the Bine Nile and the Athara, and thus
                            supplies Egypt with its regularly recurring inundation and its annually
                            renewed layer of silt. Few regions on the face of the globe illustrate more
                            vividly than Abyssinia the extent to which a fence continuous tableland of
                            solid durable volcanic rock may be carved by running water into an intricate
                            system of gorges and valleys. The river Bashilo, near Magdala, flows at the
                            bottom of a canon which it has eroded in the level sheets of basalt to a
                            depth of more than 3 000ft., while the gorge of the Jitta river is still
                            more profound. Thus it is at the expense</p>
                        <p>receives a constant increase to its fertile soil.</p>
                        <p>* Many observations and measurements have been made of the amount of sediment
                            carried</p>
                        <p>tabulated in the present volume. The river has been flawing and depositing
                            its annnal load of fine mud for so long a lapse of time that it has laid
                            dowa upon the floor of its valley a deposit ranging from 30 to 80 feet in
                            thickness. From observations of the rate which the deposit is thought to
                            take place and measurements of the depth of alluvium, computations have been
                            given of the time which has passed away since the river first began to fl
                            iw. But the data on which snch estimates have been framed are hardly of such
                            a trustworthy character as to warrant their acceptance. Th re cr, of course,

                        <p>Sir,—The anonymous letter which Lord Gromer gives as an example of the

                            in the breast of every subject of the Saltan who apprehends the fact that
                            England has reonded on him, and has been so openly at cross-purpo­ses with
                            the suzerain of Islam. Small wonder that his sense of justice is violated,
                            when he finds his whilom friend ready to accept as gospel the inventions of
                            interested fanatics anent Armenian and other “atrocities,” without inquiring
                            whether the so called “victim” was the placid angel he was sopposed to be,
                            or whether he was not the more crafty ruffian and the more consummate

                        <p>The very latest thing in cures for hay fever is “cold-storage.” It comes, as
                            one might almost have guessed, from aoros9 the Atlantic. A gentleman who was
                            a great victim to hay fever happened one summer to spend two hours in the
                            refrigerating hold of a steamer. This cured him, and he had no farther
                            at­tacks that summer. Thenceforward, whenever an attaok threatened, he beat
                            a hasty retreat to a cold atorage ohamber, and was cured. The idea, says the
                            “Hospital,” is simple and pretty, but still in its infancy and awaiting
                            judgment. It is quite likely to be as success­ful as other oures, with the
                            single exception of a sea voyage. This our contemporary has never known to
                            fail.>2</p>
                        <p>OUR COTTON INDUSTRY.</p>
                        <p>The Manchester oorrespondent of the ‘ Globe” says :—</p>
                        <p>The ontlook in oar staple trade is improved by the continuation of good rains
                            in India.The crops in our dependency are now assured, for the ground will be
                            prepared for seed. Though there is very little basiness going on in cotton
                            piece goods, it is expected that in a month or so dealers in Bombay and
                            Caleotta will begin to give out cloth orders to make. It must be stated,
                            however, that stocks in the “godowns” in Bombay are heavy. Raw cotton
                            prospects in America are again most encouraging, the weather in the States
                            being all that could be desired. Egypt, too, is doing well. The crops in
                            Pern and Brazil are likely to be larger than the current season. One thing
                            seems pretty sore—that the snpply of raw material for next year is likely to
                            be folly equal to the wants of the world.</p>

                                <p>BY AN EYE-WITNESS.</p>
                                <p>It lies in British India, forty miles from any­where, on a great
                                    tongue of barren land, that thrusts itself, parched and rugged,
                                    between two poverty stricken native States. It lies alone ; alone in
                                    its poverty, its dust, and its blazing sunshine ; alone with its
                                    starving inhabitant’, and its bitter, parched fields ; alone with
                                    its desolate ravines, its brackish wells, and its ruined temples.
                                    When the famine began in Jaganir the inhabitants were driven to
                                    desperate straits to save their starv­ing oattle—for, without
                                    oattle, no well can be worked, and no water drawn to irrigate the
                                    little patches, that stand, in famine time, be­tween tbe native and
                                    complete starvation. But nor the oattle toil no more at the wells,
                                    for they are all dead, and the little patches of young oorn are
                                    withered and destroyed ; while in the desperate struggle to find
                                    fodder for their oattle, every tree over vast traots of oountry has
                                    been denuded of its foliage, and now the leafless trees stretch
                                    their gannt arms to a fiery sky—with fearful resemblance to the
                                    starving and plagne-strioken people who matter and die beneath
                                    thee^</p> The mined houses and temples whioh form the town, enoirole
                                a great mass of rook that rises a sheer 300 feet above it. This rook is
                                orowned with an anoient fort, and with still more anoient temples, the
                                summit being reach­ed from the town by a great flight of worn and
                                sun-beaten steps, ont in the faoe of the rook and ornamented with carved
                                arohways and porohes. The temples on the summit are Jain and BrahmiD,
                                and the great red stone fort was raised by the mighty Mogul Emperor,
                                Akbar the Wise. Bat all is now deoay and desolation. In equal ruin lie
                                the carved wonders of Jain Priests and pions Brahmin, with the inlaid
                                marbles and arabesques of the Mogul Em­perors. Here the only inhabitants
                                are the mangy hysena and the fieroe panther, and, perhaps, some starving
                                wretch, who having ex­hausted the generosity of his oaste-fellows, has
                                orawled up from the rained town below to orouoh in some dark reoess, and
                                to die — alone. It is but early Maroh, bat the heat is intense ; already
                                the blazing son of an Indian summer beats down with a force that is not
                                soon forgotten ; while from the son- beaten snrfaoe of the rock there
                                seem? to leap the fiery breath of 1,000 years of fieroe snnshine and hot
                                winds. Far down below the flat-topped roofs of the ruined houses shimmer
                                and tremble in a haze of beat Away on all sides the horizon stretches
                                like a petrified sea ; mile after mile of arid stony hills, and barren
                                plains, aoro38 whioh smoking pillars of hot air and dnst whirl in a mad
                                danoe, mock­ing the empty fields and the withered trees ; while the
                                whole landscape trembles in an into­lerable glare. Down in the narrow
                                stone-paved streets of the town, miserable wretches who have never known
                                the meaning of a good meal, matter aud stumble along, in dimless misery.
                                The air here is like a furnace ; the minnte shops, little dark stone
                                recesses blackened with the smoke and toil of centuries, are mostly
                                good.</note>

                        <p>“For fifteen years prior to 1900 I was a sufferer from hay asthma and
                            chronic diarrhea. I grew weak and emaciated and was tortured with

                            ever. In fact, I was in as miserable a condi­tion as a man could be.</p>

                            encouraged, / continued, and after tak­ing several bottles of your

                            Peruna, after so many years of needless suffering, there can be no doubt

                    <p>MARSEILLE EN 1905.</p>
                    <p>Le service da port de Marseille, soas la di­rection da commandant Gappeter,
                        vient de publier la Statistique de l’année 1905, faisant connaître le
                        mouvement général de la naviga­tion et da trafic, avec ses éléments
                        constitutifs, oomparé à celai de l’exercice précédent.</p>
                    <p>Pendant l’année éconlée, le mouvement ma­ritime total du port de Marseille,
                        entrées et sorties réanies, s’est élevée à 16 882 navires, aveo 15.623.COO
                        tonneaux de jaage nette et 6,215,000 tonnes de marchandises, portant 398,0C0
                        passagers et 560,000 hommes d’é- quipage.</p>
                    <p>Par rapport à 1904, ces chiffres sont en augmentation de 992 navires, de
                        2,270,000 tonneaux de jauge, et 362,000 tonnes de mar chandises, de 66,000
                        passagers et 67,000 hommes d’^qaipage.</p>
                    <p>La statistique du port en 1905 renferme une foule d’autres indications
                        précieuses. C’est ains’ qne la répartition da tonnage de jau­ge, entre les
                        principaux pavillons, attribue 7,866,000 tonneaux à la France, 3,966,000
                        toDneaax à l’Angleterre, 887,000 tonneaux à l’Italie, 766,000

                        l’Antriohe-Hongrie, 415,000 tonneaux à la Hollande et 380,000 tonneaox à la
                        Grèce. De tous les pavillons, l’allemand est celui qui a relativement le
                        plas progressé dans ces der­niers temps ■ il n’était représenté en 1900 que
                        par 171,000 tonneaux.</p>
                    <p>Dans Ue chiffre total de* importations de* marchandises, qui égale 3,879,000
                        tonne?, les houilles étrangères figurent pour 890,000 ton ne\ Le total des
                        exportations,évalué à 2.367,000 tonnes, ne comprend pas les charbons, vivres
                        et autres approvisionnements de navires, soit 575,000 tonnes, ce qui élève à
                        2,941,000 tonne* le chiffre global des sorties et à 6,820,000 ton­ne* le
                        mouvement général du trafic.</p>
                    <p>Le tonnage de jauge total, entrées et sortie' réunies, se répartit en 71,5%
                        pour la navi­gation de concurrence et eu 28,5 % pour le cabotage réservé au
                        pavillon national. Dans l’ensemble, le pavillon français et le pavillon
                        étranger se partagent par moitié le tonnage de jauge. La navigation a vapear
                        absorbe 95 % du mouvement maritime. Ces chiffres s’ap pliquent aux navires
                        chargés, auxquels il y h lieu d’ajouter 10% du tonnage de jauge du port,
                        concernant les navires sur lest.</p>

                        institutions. The Russian Government obtained their loan, by what now looks
                        uncommonly like false pre­tences, bat they cannot live on it for ever. The

                        present policy. With a depleted exchequer and a disaffected army, how can
                        they hope to hold down for ever an exasperated people, welded by their
                        fatnoos shortsightedness into a strength and unity of purpose that it has
                        never known before 1 (“Times”.)</p>
                    <p>An International Peril.</p>
                    <p>Since the days when the development of the French Revolution compelled the
                        inter­vention of the neighbouring Powers—an event which seemed as remote in
                        1789 as its repeti­tion appears improbable now—there has been no moment
                        charged with a heavier anxiety for the general interests of mankind.
                        An­archy in France wrapped the Continent and this coantry in the flame of
                        war, whioh lasted, with interruption, for a quarter of a century, until
                        peace had well-nigh disappeared from the memory of nations. Instead of
                        indulging in irresponsible emotionalism, as did Fox and the English Whigs
                        after the fall of the Bas­tille, with respect to the events that were
                        happening across the Channel, let ns remember that the Tsar’s re Urn is in
                        the throes of a no less mighty travail, which may involve (qually stupendous
                        consequences for good or ill, not only to Europe at large, bat to every
                        people vhose interests are directly or indirectly oon- leoted with those of
                        Russia, from the English channel to the Yellow Sea, and from the coast if
                        Kent to the shores of Japan. ("Telegraph.”) Russian's Credit Gone.</p>

                        damage Russian credit, and make borrowing impossible on the foreign bourses.
                        Without ready money, and plenty of it, the Government will be unable to pay

                    <p>Mr. Beit’s bequest of a million and a quarter for the construction of the
                        Cape to Cairo railway recalls the fact that the late Cecil Rhodes was once
                        considered a crank. The story was told not long ago by an old member of the
                        Cape Parliament at a meeting at the Royal Colonial Institute. When Mr.
                        Rhodes made his first appearance in the Cape Parliament he coaid talk of
                        nothing but his great idea of a trans continental railway, and with the aid

                        a crank. His dream is now materialising. Many of ns can remember when Wagner
                        was cons’dered a crank also, and when his ftiusio was a stock subject cf

                    <p>MANCHURIA’S “OPEN DOOR.”</p>
                    <p>As reported by the “Times” correspondent at Tokio, Viscount Hayashi enters
                        indignant protest against those foreign suspicions of Japanese good faith
                        which have lately made themselves heard. These libels attribute to the
                        insular Government a treacherous design of keeping the commerce of Manchuria
                        wholly for the profit of its subjects, and in proof of that prop«'8itioD,
                        they point to the long delay in establishing the "open door” in the Southern
                        province. Viscount Hayashi does not attempt to deny that considerable delay
                        has occurred, or that some Japanese traders have taken advantage of the
                        opportunity to smuggle goods into the interior. Bat abases of one sort or
                        another are bound to happen at the conclusion of any big war, involving the
                        employment of exceptionally large foroes. At the termination of hostilities
                        between Japan and Russia, our gallant allies found themselves responsible
                        for supplying a million and a quarter of their
                        fellow-countrymen.combatants.and camp follow­ers, with the necessaries ot
                        life. That was an obligation of humanity as well as of patriotism, and who
                        will censure the Tokio Government tor giving it the first place in their
                        arrange­ments ? B it by accepting the onerous task, the Executive imposed on
                        itself the duty of tempo­rarily monopolising all available transport, and it
                        is only now that the strain is beginning to be lightened. As for the traders
                        who are alleged to have done brisk trade with the Chinese in goods
                        hall-marked for the use of the Japanese troops, it is to be feared that
                        precisely the same charge might be advanced against "smart” dealers
                        belonging to other nationalities. But it is full time for these oensorious
                        bickerings to cease ; Viscount Hayashi undertakes that in about a couple of
                        months the Manchurian door will be thrown open to all comers on eqaal
                        conditions.</p>
                    <p>THE BAHR-EL GHAZAL.</p>
                    <p>The Congo State Government apparently waits to be “hurried up” before
                        withdrawing its occupying forces from the Bahr el-Ghszal, in compliance with
                        the Anglo Belgian Con­vention. By that arrangement, it was pro­vided that
                        the evacuation should take place “as soon as possible,” but although some
                        month-i have elapsed sinoe the signature of the Convention, the latest
                        information goes to show that the Congolese troops have not badged an inch.
                        While quite agreeing with Sir E. Grey that large allowance should be made
                        for the diffi julty of communicating with sach a remote country, we cannot
                        forget that the Congo State used very qaick dispatch when fint permitted to
                        enter the province. The Foreign Offne usually so fl ora detriment, in such
                        cases, whenever it intermits the appli­cation of pressure, for as soon as
                        the atten­tion of Downing street is direoted elsewhere nothing is done. It
                        was a mistake to have employed such a very elastic phrase as “as soon as
                        possible ; ” some definife date should have been fixed tor withdrawing the
                        five little garrisons from the province. So long as they remain in

                        owe allegiance. As they are somewhat lawleis people, it is not odd that they
                        should be beginning to doubt wh ither they are not releas­ed from any such

                    <p>THE COST OF A YACHT.</p>
                    <p>ARMY AND NAVY.</p>
                    <p>Fifty years ago sailing yachts of from sixty to a hundred toifipVere much
                        more namerous, and they were owned by yachtsmen who trea ted them much as
                        they would a suit of clothes of which they w$re food, keeping them till they
                        were positively out ot date or old, fitting them out year after year as a
                        matter of course, and enjoying their cruising like sensible beings. These
                        are the views of Mr. Clive Holland, in a beautifully illustrated artiole in
                        the Summer (August) number of the “Pall Mall Magazine.’’</p>
                    <p>From the tbirty-tonners of the days of King Charles II, to the floating
                        palaces of five Hun­dred tons and upwards of the present time is indeed a
                        transition. &lt;</p>
                    <p>The family boat of from, say, fifty to eighty tons (which is happily not
                        quite an extiuot type), either hired or owned, runs away with a far greater
                        sum of money than the uninitiated would suppose daring the three or four
                        months of the season. *Saoh a boat—of say ninety tons— will make a large
                        hole in £600, even if sailed on economical lines, and with a orew no more
                        that sufficient to handle her properly. The cost of provisions is a heavy
                        item, and harbour does also entail a very considerable expenditure when one
                        is ornising either in home or foreign waters. Should a yaohtsman’s fancy
                        turn toward steam and “speed,” the ooal bill will, in the case of a
                        three-hnndred-tonner, probably monnt up to some £25 or £30 per week, or even
                        more under exceptional cironm stances; and although there will be fewer
                        hands than on a sailing yacht of similar tonnage, ooaling labour and other
                        incidentals may be set off as against the reduced wages bill.</p>
                    <p>The cost of a fall season’s “pot hunting” may be roughly estimated as £1,000
                        for the equivalent of the old forty rater, whioh sum affords a fairly
                        accurate gauge if reduoed or increased as the boat may be smaller or
                        larger.</p>
                    <p>In the case of the very well known oraoks, past and present, such as Ailsa,
                        Bona, Britannia, Meteor, Shamrock, Luoida, and other similar oraft, probably
                        a thoroughgoing season of thirty or forty starts will stand their owners in
                        from £3,500 to £5,000, which latter sum will be greatly increased by
                        competing in the earlier part of the year in Mediterranean water?, or by the
                        yaoht in question being sent across the Atlantic.</p>
                    <p>Few summer holidays, indeed, if the weather be fine, are pleasanter than
                        tho33 spent on an old, roomy, but seaworthy, yaoht of the past generation,
                        of say twenty to forty tons, with a handy mar, and the crew formed of
                        oneself and sea-loving friends. The cost of running each a boatfor twomonths
                        in the summer has, of ocurse, no relation as regards expense to the sum
                        required successfully to fit out and maintaia a modern yacht and its
                        attendant luxuries such as we have described. A rough estimate based upon
                        personal experience would put the hire of such a boat as we have described
                        at from £5 tc £6 per week—wh:cb, supposing she be taken for six weeks, will
                        amount to from £30 to £36. The wages of a thoroughly competent hand, iu fact
                        a “handy” man capable of acting as captaio, steward, and cook, will not be
                        mach less thaa 35’. a week—that is to say £10 10i. for the six weeks. A boy
                        is al­ways useful and as appetities have a habit of sharpening up, it woald
                        be unsafe to put down a less sum than 15s. a week per head for ordinary
                        board, exclusive of any speoial luxaries, and, of course, of wines and
                        spirits. Probably odds and ends in the way of tips when in harbour, harbour
                        dues, and incidentals which are inseparable from a yachting cruise, will
                        amount to another £2 per week ; but this item is one of the most variable,
                        and it »s im­possible to make an estimate with ary exactitude.</p>
                    <p>Totalled up, the cost of a six weeks’ oruise, tor a party consisting of four
                        friends, the owner, man, and boy, will amount to about £100, whioh split ap
                        into five shares amongst the owner and his friends, amounts to £20 apiece.
                        Patting it at £25, to provide for emergencies, it cannot be called a dear
                        holi­day ; but it, of course, means that a good part of the work must be
                        done by the holiday­makers themselves, and a certain amount of care and
                        eoonomy exercised all round.</p>

                    </list>
                    <p>AMUSING STORY OF MISUNDER­STOOD SIGNAL.</p>
                    <p>Some time ago King Edward sent a don­key as a present to his little grand on,
                        Grown Prince Olaf of Norway. The don­key was carried by the steamer
                        Montebello and the oaptain got instructions to lo:k well after the
                        animal.</p>
                    <p>On arrival outside the Christiania fjord the captain signalled to the
                        lighthouse “All right,” but received no signal in reply. He then gave orders
                        to signal “Ass” on one mast and “all right” on the other, but still no reply
                        oame.</p>
                    <p>As it is a very important matter that the signals from vessels passing the
                        light­house should be properly reported, the oap- taiu complained to the
                        authorities.</p>
                    <p>The official explanation, says a Christiania correspondent, is this. At the
                        moment the Montebello passed the light house the signal­man on duty was
                        oalled to the telephone, and consequently oould not reply immediately. After
                        having finished the conversation on the telephone, he saw the second signal
                        flying— “Ass! ’ “All right,”—and taking it as a personal snob, did not think
                        it necessary to report it.</p>
                    <p>Because the representative of the Egyptian fellaheen now in London is oalled
                        Kamel Pasha, it does not follow that he has got the hump,</p>
                    <p>(From our Correspondent.)</p>
                    <p>London, July 21.</p>
                    <p>Mijor V. S. Sandeman, 6th (Inniskilling) Dragoons, has gone on retired pay.
                        He received his commission originally in the 17th Lancers in November, 1886,
                        was promoted captain in 1896, whilst adjutant of the regiment, and was
                        specially promoted major 1903, and trans­ferred to the 6th InniskilliDgs
                        last October, as second in command. Msjor Sandeman served with the i 7 th
                        Lanoers through the Boer War of 1899 ’901, and shared in the operations in
                        Orange River Colony, the Transvaal, Cape Colony and Orange Fiee State, and
                        was se verely wounded in action (mentioned in des­patches, brevet majority,
                        Queen’s medal with five clasps).</p>
                    <p>Captain T.E. Bayley, 20thHussars, Brighton, has severed h:s connection with
                        that regiment after serving over twelve years in it. He was appointed to it
                        in January, 1894, got his troop iu 1899, and up till recently was a staff
                        oap­tain at Cairo. His active service experience extended to the Tirah
                        Expedition, 1897-98, in whioh he aoted as Assistant Transport Officer to the
                        3rd Brigade (medal with two olasps), and the Sooth African War, 1901-02,
                        including the operations iu the Transvaal, Orange River Colony (Qaeen’s
                        medal with four clasps).</p>
                    <p>Major and Brevet Lieutenant Colonel G.T. Forestier-Walker has been
                        transferred from the oommand of No. 5 Depot Royal Field Artillery, Clonmel,
                        to the 122nd Battery R.F.A. Bulford, on completing the usual tour, with eff
                        :ct from the 5th prox.</p>
                    <p>On the 5th piox., Lieatenant J. R. Bassett, 2ud Battalion Royal Berkshire
                        Regiment, Khartoum, will vacate the adjntanoy, and four days later Captain
                        A. G. Macdonald will vacate the adjutancy of the 1st Battalion at
                        Dublin.</p>
                    <p>The unpopularity of the “Broderick” oap is so great that the Army Coancil has
                        again found it necessary to isaae a special order against the wearing of
                        obsolete pattern oaps when soldiers, particularly those of the mounted
                        service, are home on leave. The old “pill box” is still the favourite
                        amongst the cavalry men. It seems a great pity that the oracs stupidity of
                        the powers that be will not permit of Tommy Atkins wearing the smart looking
                        ‘ pill-box” and the late field service oap in preference to the hideous and
                        detested “Broderick,” whioh has not a single redeeming feature.</p>
                    <p>The peace-at any-prioe shufflers of the British Cabinet have gone down before
                        the determined attitude of the few men who put the Empire’s interest before
                        party, backed ap by the Admiralty officials responsible for the naval
                        defence of the country. No thanks to the Little Englanders, the policy of
                        “Britannia rules the Waves” is to be oarried out, and the first line of
                        defence is to be kept ap to the usual standard of going anywhere, and doing
                        aDythmg. The three Dreadnoughts originally proj -cted by the late
                        Conservative Government, inclusive of the Dreadnought just launched, will be
                        built, and the other departments of the navy will be kept in an efficient
                        state. Men of the type of Sir Edward Grey are badly wanted in
                        Campbell-Bannerman’s collection of fad­dists. Sir John Fisher has had a lot
                        to do with the continuance of the late Government’s naval policy. “Jacky
                        Fisher” is a hard man to beat, and the Empire’^ interests are safe so long
                        as he is at the head of naval affairs.</p>

                    <p>A cable from Sydney, published by the ' Shipping Gazette,” discloses apiece
                        of infor­mation whioh has been eagerly awaited iu the shipbuilding and
                        shipowuing world. It is as to the constitution of the syndicate which has
                        secured the contract with the Commonwealth Government for a fortnightly mail
                        service between Australia and Great Britain, in sub­stitution for that of
                        the Orient and Royal Mail Companies, which expires on Jan. 31, 1908. The
                        names of the syndicate are given as follows.</p>
                    <p>1.Messrs. William Boardmore and Sons, ship builders, Dalmuir, N.B.</p>

                        Whitworth, and Co. (Limited), whioh firm, it may be definitely stated, has
                        an interest in the shipbuilding policy of the syndicate.</p>

                        Australian trade, wh )se name is not at present disclosed.</p>
                    <p> It is evident from the names ab >ve given that the new enterprise ha9 fallen

                        opportune moment, for the delay in the formal intimation of the Commonwealth
                        Premier—a delay entirely due to the pressure of other Parliamentary
                        business—had given rise to various rumours in Australia. In London, too,
                        there were those who were inolined to throw doubt on the undertaking into
                        whioh it had entered. All suoh suggestions are now onoe and for all disposed

                    <p>A BROKEN-DOWN SYSTEM.</p>
                    <p>This is a condition (or disease) to which doctors give many names, but which few
                        of them really understand. It it simply weakness—a break-down, as it were, of
                        the vital forces that sustain the system. No matter what may be its causes (for
                        they are almost numberless), its symptoms are much the same; the more prominent
                        being sleeplessness, sense of prostration or weariness, depression of spirits
                        and want of energy for all the ordinary affairs of life. Now, what alone is
                        absolutely essential in all such cases is increased vitality—vigour--</p>
                    <p>VITAL STRENGTH &amp; ENERGY</p>
                    <p>to throw off these morbid feelings, and experience proves that as night succeeds
                        the day this may be more certainly secured by a course of the celebrated
                        life-reviving tonic</p>
                    <p>THERAPION No.3</p>
                    <p>than by any other known combination. So surely as it is taken in accordance with
                        the printed directions accompanying it, will the shattered health be
                        restored,</p>
                    <p>THE EXPIRING LAMP OF LIFE LIGHTED UP AFRESH,</p>
                    <p>and a new existence imparted in place of what had so lately seemed worn-out,
                        "used up,” and valueless. This wonderful medicament is purely vegetable and
                        innocuous, is agreeable to the taste —suitable for all constitutions and
                        conditions, in either sex; and it is difficult to imagine a case of disease or
                        derangement, whose main features are those of debility, that will not be
                        speedily and permanently benefited by this never-failing recuperative essence,
                        which is destined to cast into oblivion everything that had preceded it for this
                        wide-spread and numerous class of human ailments.</p>
