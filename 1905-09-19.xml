                    <head>THE REVOLT IN THE YEMEN.</head>
                    <p>The latest news from the Red Sea shows that the well-timed capture of Sana on
                        the twenty ninth anniversary of the accession of H. I. M. the Sultan of
                        Turkey was considerably ante-dated. Taking the will for the deed, the staff
                        at Hodeida congratulated the Padishah, on the long-desired victory over the
                        Imam and his sectaries and rebels. The Imperial Ottoman Agency in Egypt and,
                        we suppose, the Ottoman Embassies in Europe lost so time in communicating
                        the good new-to the Press ; the grateful monarch conferred the order of the
                        Imtiaz on Ahmed Faisi Pasha, decorated a troop of generals and staff
                        officers; and, as a special token of his satisfaction, presented the
                        officers and men of the expeditionary i force with their pay fox January.
                        Whether these long deferred sum will now reach the troops is an interesting
                        question. Sana was captured —or rathe-entered—on the 5th inst after the Imam
                        Yehya had destroyed every public building and barrack in the town and
                        removed, the stores of wheat and barley that he or his opponents had
                        accumulated. The situation did not commend itself to the peaceful
                        inhabitants of the district, who fled into the Aden territory as a role, and
                        did not at all please AhmedFaisi Pasha, whose first demand was for
                        reinforcement . His losses had not been inconsiderable. during the march
                        from the coast to the Capital, and the Imam with a large force had merely
                        retired to a high plateau east of Sana, and,posted in a commanding position,
                        awaited the next move on the part of the Turkish General. His chiefs have
                        all sworn to fight to the last against the enemy and after the execution of
                        the Turkish prisoners that took place when Sarâ' fell, and the Imam’s
                        proclamations denouncing the Saltan as unworthy to retain the spiritual
                        headship of Islam, they and their leader doubtless realise that "They must
                        pay for what they played for at the.finish of the game.” and will fight with
                        the spirit of desperate men. The position must be one of considerable
                        interest to the British authorities at Aden, who cannot view the complete
                        suspension of trade with the Yemen and the possible extension of fighting to
                        the Aden frontier with equanimity. It is, of course, unthinkable that any
                        direct attempt of intervention will be made by Great Britain, but we have no
                        doubt that the Foreign Offioe would welcome any possibility of mediating
                        between the combatants. At present however mediation is a dream, for the
                        decisive encounter between the Turks and the Imam has yet to be fought
                        Perhaps it will never be fought—the Imam doubtless knows that the Turkish
                        army is superior to his levies in the open field, and may attempt to wear
                        down his opponents in a long guerilla war. Not a pleasant prospect for the
                        Turkish Army! </p>

                        Friederikstein. In the nineties one of the wrangles that occurred every
                        three or four years between the ill-mated partners had for its consequence a
                        Swedish scare in Norway. The Norwegian marine was strengthened by
                        iron-clads, small but modern, and torpedo boats, and the two fortresses
                        named were modernised to the huge annoyance of the Swedes, who very justly
                        complained of the hostile attitude of their partner. Now that Norway and
                        Sweden are separate States the situation has completely changed, and while
                        it might, have been reasonable enough to demand a promise that Norway would
                        make no farther additions to its frontier defences, the clamor for their
                        demolition seems an unnecessary display of offensive Chauvinism. These
                        fortresses, too, have a great history. Often attacked, they have never
                        surrendered, and the high spirited and independent Norwegians are not likely
                        to regard such a demand on the part of Sweden as anything but an insult The
                        mediation of the British Government will, we hope, find a way out of the
                        difficulty that will prove acceptable to both states. A conflict between
                        Sweden and Norway would probably have great consequences ; it would invite
                        the armed intervention perhaps of Germany, anxious to dominate the Baltic
                        perhaps of Russia, aiming at an ice-free port on the Atlantic, and hoping to
                        inflict a blow at the same time on the Swedish people, which has steadily
                        supported the cause of the Finns, while the possibility of a Scandinavian
                        league would disappear for good and all As a disinterested friend of both
                        parties, Great Britain can at all events give the beet advice to the
                        disputants, and the lessening of the dangerous tension between the two
                        Powers may be ascribed in part at least to the “unofficial intervention” of
                        British diplomacy. We trust that the reports of a friendly compromise,
                        published to-day and bearing the date of the 32nd anniversary of King Oscar
                        ascension to the throne, may be founded in something more than hope. </p>

                    <p>As was the case last month the Customs report is again out early, and those
                        who predicted that the administration would be unable to “keep it up” will
                        be pleasantly disappointed. The imports for the past month totalled L.E.
                        1,803,691 against LE. 1,626,093 in August 1904, showing a decided increase.
                        The imports for the period commencing on January 1 and ending on August 31,
                        amounted to L.E. 12,740,913 against LE. 11,831,292 in the corresponding
                        period of the past year, an increase of L.E. 909,621 in favor of 1905. </p>
                    <p>The exports, which had showed an advance for the month of July over the
                        figures of July 1904, maintained and increased their lead over August's
                        figures in 1904. In that month the total exports amounted to LE. 800,024. In
                        August 1905, goods amounting to LB. 1,165,510 left the country, a balance of
                        L.E. 365,486. The export figures for the first eight months of the year
                        still show a certain falling off, the total value of goods exported being
                        LE. 11,949,871 against LE. 12,687,678 in the corresponding period in 1904
                        but another two or three returns like those of August and July, and Egypt’s
                        exports will show an increase on the whole year. </p>
                    <p>In August, imports from Great Britain and the British Mediterranean
                        possessions amounted to LE. 602,049, against HE. 511,691 in August 1904,
                        while for the two-thirds of the year they amounted to L.E. 4,362,501 against
                        L.E. 4,037,635 daring the corresponding period of the past year. French,
                        Russian and Turkish imports show a similar increase for the eight months,
                        but Russian imports fell off last month totalling only L.R. 43,541 against
                        L.E. 64,795 in August last year. In the export tables for the month Great
                        Britain shows an increase of over 80%. France, Germany, and the U.S.A. have
                        also been good customers. </p>
                    <p>In the period comprised between New Year’s day 1905 and August 31, the only
                        notable increase of Egyptian exports to any one country is to be found in
                        the oase of Turkey and the U. S. A. Great Britain (L E. 5,806,705 against LE
                        6,214,459 in 1904) Russia L E. 673.615 against L.E. 948,558, and above all
                        Italy with only L.E. 326,375 against L.E. 705,308 are all notable examples
                        of the decrease in value daring this period of Egyptian exports. </p>

                    <head>REMARKABLE SWIMMING FEAT.</head>
                    <p>Mr. George W. Poss, an American by birth, resident in Cairo, and chief
                        engineer of the Egyptian Cotton Mills in Cairo, having heard many people say
                        that to cross the Nile near the bridges was very dangerous and almost
                        impossible, thought he would try the experiment himself, and succeeded with
                        comparative ease. A day so after, he swam from the new bridge at Old Cairo
                        to Basus, which is a small town eleven and a quarter miles distant from
                        Cairo. This feat was accomplished b two hours. </p>
                    <p>Accompanying him to prevent any mishap, and to carry Mr. Poss’s clothes, was
                        an employe of the cotton mills named Joseph de Santis. </p>
                    <p>At Old Cairo they had some difficulty in getting a boat, the Arabs refusing
                        when they learned of his intention of swimming down the river; bat crossing
                        the river by the ferry they managed to obtain a boat. Reading the centre of
                        the river Mr. Poss undressed, and greatly to the astonishment of the Arabs
                        plunged into the water. </p>
                    <p>A strong wind was blowing at the time up the river, and the boat was unable
                        to keep pace with the swimmer ; yet they managed to keep Mr. Poss in view
                        when he passed under the new bridge at Old Cairo, and as far as the bridge
                        at Kasr-el-Nil, after which they lost sight of him entirely. At this point
                        J. De Santis left the boat and taking Mr. Poss’s clothes went on to Rod el
                        Farag thinking he would find him there, and it was not without some
                        misgivings that he failed to do so, for no one had seen a man swim past that
                        place. </p>
                    <p>At this point J. De Santis gave up the search and Mr. Poss was left to do his
                        best in a bathing suit. At Basus Mr. Poss went ashore, being afraid of
                        taking cramp with no boat near to render help ; and Amin Effendi, Omdeh of
                        Basus, kindly lent him some clothes and sent some of his men with a boat to
                        take him back to Cairo. If the conditions are favorable, so that a boat can
                        keep pace with him, Mr. Poss hopes very soon to attempt to swim from Cairo
                        to the Barrage. </p>

                    <head>CONCORDAT PREVENTIF GRANTED</head>
                    <head type="sub">(By telephone).</head>
                    <p>This morning the Commercial Chamber of the Cairo Mixed Court of First
                        Instance decided to grant the Sucreries Company benefit of the Concordat
                        Preventif. The chief feature of the audience was the extremely dear and able
                        speech on behalf of the application of this measure which was delivered by
                        Maitre Carton de Wiart and lasted half an hour. At the conclusion of the
                        speech Judge Tuck, who presided over the audience, Asked if there was any
                        opposition. None was made and the Court adjourned at 11 a.m. to deliberate
                        on this and several other cases. At 12.45 p.m. Judge Tuck announced that the
                        Concordat Preventif had been granted and ordered the company to send their
                        books into court within eight days. No mention was made whether the names of
                        the three liquidators submitted to the court, viz. Sir Elwin Palmer, Harari
                        Pasha and M. Dubourg, had been accepted or not. Fall particulars will be
                        given to-morrow. </p>
                    <p>The decision of the court is fortunate from every point of view. It is the
                        only possible means of preventing a terrible crash which would not only
                        cause heavy losses to many of the company's creditors and to the
                        shareholders, but would ruin the native cultivators of cane. This
                        provisional judgment will not prevent the Parquet from having the
                        compulsionary winding up declared later so as to take criminal proceedings
                        against any director or official found at fault, should events demand this
                        course. </p>

                    <head>THE CHOLERA SCARE.</head>
                    <p>The recent outbreak of cholera in Russia and Germany has caused quite a scare
                        throughout Europe, and it behoves the Sanitary Department to take prompt
                        measures to prevent the dread malady appearing in Egypt with the return of
                        the pilgrims from the Holy Places of Islam next season. Thera is no denying
                        the fact that the chief homes of cholera are firstly British India, where
                        the disease is endemic, and secondly the Hedjaz, where, however, it assumes
                        an epidemic form. Of recent years Egypt has been visited by cholera on three
                        different occasions. The first visitation was in 1883, when, according to
                        the official returns, it claimed over 28,000 victims. The second outbreak
                        was in 1895, when there were 18,133 deaths from the disease, and the third
                        was three years ago, when the number of deaths recorded was close on 84,000.
                        These figures are those famished by the Sanitary Department, but doubtless
                        they are rather under than over the mortality in each case. It is worthy of
                        note that the disease in this country has invariably broken oat in the hot
                        month, and disappeared with the advent of cold weather, so that it is
                        reasonable to assume that we shall be spared any visitation this year. The
                        matter came last week before the Quarantine Board of Alexandria, which
                        decided that no measures were at present necessary against arrivals from the
                        northern ports of Europe. </p>
                    <p>This last invasion of Western Europe seems to have come from India, sweeping
                        slowly and, almost unobserved, over East Europe, then through Galicia,
                        Poland and East Prussia until it reached Dantzio, and lastly Hamburg Any
                        introduction into Egypt through Europe seems somewhat remote, and there is
                        no record that at any of the previous visitations it came from that quarter.
                        On the contrary, each time it appeared in this country it was conclusively
                        proved that it reached ns from the Red Sea ports, and it is in that
                        direction that the sanitary authorities should turn their attention. The
                        Quarantine Board should see that the utmost vigilance is exercised at Tor
                        and Suez on the return of Egyptian pilgrims after the next cold weather, and
                        it is to this board that the country looks for protection against another
                        invasion of cholera. In our opinion there does not seem at present the
                        slightest came for any alarm. </p>

                        pardon was to be also extended to those of the prisoners who are detained on
                        charges of incendiarism of houses and shounas, has received a reply in the

                    <head>A VISIT TO KHARPOOTY.</head>
                    <p>( From our Fort Said Correspondent).</p>
                    <p>In order to see how the new Menzaleh canal is getting on, and what were of
                        the steamer service commencing, I paid a visit to day to the Island of
                        Kharpooty and there spent on hour looking about me. </p>
                    <p>At the Greek church I boarded a tram, which for the modest sum of two pence
                        took me right to the works. </p>
                    <p>We wended a somewhat bumpy way past the gas works and the sailing craft
                        loading and discharging coastwise cargoes, on round by the new road which is
                        to lead direct to Raswah, and from there past the sterns of numerous
                        colliers discharging their cargoes and emitting clouds of dust. An agreable
                        change occurred when our vehicle approached the Port Said end of the fresh
                        water canal. Here the road took us through something over a third of a mile
                        of palms and other vegeta tion ; leaving the plantations, which continue
                        along the bank of the Suez Canal some 20 miles, we suddenly turned and swung
                        over the railway lines on to toe causeway which connects the lake shore with
                        Kharpooty. The causeway constructed some years ago of the remains of small
                        islands and dredgings, is winding and tortuous ; twisting from side to side,
                        and having an average width of ton yard, with tram lines throughout its
                        length, flanked with wooden groyne-like erections to prevent the sea
                        encroachments, it, after passing through two toll gates, eventually lands
                        one at the Island. From a distance the village, built on this narrow strip
                        of land, seems to grow out of the water itself. The lake shows numerous
                        sailing boats, dahabiehs and fishing vessels, many of which are laying at
                        anchor close to the tram terminus, unloading into trolleys which carry their
                        cargoes to the town of Port Said. Approaching the Island I saw to the left
                        several vessels in course of construction, huge channel marks erected here
                        and there, marking out, with the aid of small buoys, the limits of the lm.
                        60c.m. channel, which is practically completed, in a direct line to
                        Matarieh. A careful look round the ground, which is enclosed, and which
                        holds the workshop, revealed two pretty little paddle-wheel tugs, a large
                        two-deck passenger vessel, three lighters of great length and shallow draft,
                        capable of carrying some 300 tons of cargo each, a number of smaller craft,
                        and a large boat containing one of Gwynne's powerful centrifugal pumps,
                        which I suppose was at work during the dredging. </p>
                    <p>I was told that all would be in regular working order and the service a fact,
                        by the end of this year, when the vessels now at Matarieh would join forces
                        with those I saw to-day, to enable a regular daily passenger and cargo
                        service to be kept up. The vessels themselves look very well, and I promise
                        myself an early trip across the lake, a trip which to-day, means a lull day
                        and more if wind is unfavorable. </p>
                    <p>From the sheds and worships extends a line of dirty and very dilapidated Arab
                        houses, all in a broken-down condition, and crowded with the members of the
                        large families of the fishing-boat owners, and others. One large shed
                        contained some thousands of freshly caught eels which had been landed an
                        hour or so before, and in front of the large heaps were seated two men
                        busily cleaning the fish previous to sending them to Port Said, where I
                        believe the majority of the eels caught on the lake, are frozen and shipped
                        to Europe. </p>
                    <p>I understand that there will be a service of of trains running from Matarieh
                        to Mansourah in connection with the lake sevice, and that, as the Matarieh
                        canal is now quite completed, the dredgers which have cut it will, in a
                        short time, commence operations on the Damietta branch. This, I understand,
                        will prove easier, for there is supposed to be deeper water and a less
                        number of islets to negotiate along the west shore of the lake than between
                        Matarieh and Kharpooty. </p>

                    <head type="sub">REFUTING A LIBEL</head>
                    <p>The British Cotton Growing Association denies emphatically a statement which
                        has appeared in a number of home, newspapers, alleging that the Association
                        is only paying the natives at their model cotton-growing plantations in West
                        Africa 6d. per week, and that a condition of semi-slavery prevails among
                        their employés. The wages actually paid, the Association adds, are at the
                        standard rate current in West Africa, viz, 6d. to 1s. per day,and the
                        conditions which obtain are known to, and cordially approved of by, the
                        local representatives of the British Government, and by the native chiefs.
                        The Association further states that, so far as they have been able to trace

                    <head>M. ROUVIER AND THE FRENCH</head>
                    <p>At the important stage which has now been reached in the negotiations between
                        France and Germany on the subject of Morocco— with the spectre of war
                        apparently laid—there is little doubt that the great majority of Frenchmen
                        heartily endorse the cool-headed and practical statesmanship of M. Rouvier.
                        German diplomatists had evidently counted upon an outburst of Chauvinistic
                        feeling in France as an outcome of their provocative action in Morocco, but
                        they failed to allow for the fundamental changes which have affected the
                        spirit of the French nation since l870. </p>
                    <p>For more than thirty years France has turned resolutely aside not only from
                        all policy of adventure but from all adventurers with a policy. The
                        ignominious collapse of Bonlangism was followed by the gradual withering
                        away to a state bordering upon nothingness of all the old parties of Royal
                        or Imperial pretension. The cause of the Orleanists, which even in 1884 had
                        some claims to popular recognition, makes to-day no wider or stronger appeal
                        to sympathies of the French voter than it did ten years ago the now defunct
                        Legitimist Party, or '‘Whites of Spain,” and the political hopes of the
                        Bonapartists are on the same level. An annual banquet at the Continental
                        Hotel, that unctio in extremis of all the old lost causes of France, will
                        soon be the sole visible demonstration of their flickering vitality. Even
                        the German Emperor, who has evidently at times conceived the hope that his
                        Imperial strenu-ousness would rouse an echo of sympathy and admiration in
                        that corner of the French heart which is still warm with the memory of
                        Napoleon, must be convinced by now how vain was that dream, how deaf is the
                        French ear to all the blandishments of latter-day Imperialism. </p>
                    <p>France is to day firmly Republican, and Re publican in an intensely
                        democratic sense. She undoubtedly needs and desires peace, and will continue
                        to maintain it to the best of her ability. This, indeed, has been her policy
                        ever since the present Republic was founded. Her military Bystem, which is
                        far more comprehensive that it was at the time of the last war, brings home
                        to every family, irrespective of class, the terrible responsibilities which
                        war entails and the danger of playing with fire. She knows, moreover, that a
                        war, even if it were victorious, would mean the temporary suspension of many
                        of her democratic liberties, while should it be disastrous the political
                        door would be opened wide to all those importunate pretenders and sinister
                        adventurers whom she has hitherto so successfully looked out. </p>
                    <p>To-day the country is master of its own destinies, and fully conscious of the
                        fact No dynastic interests, as in 1870, can plunge the nation into war
                        against its will or the promptings of its better sense. There is no Empress
                        to proclaim "C’est ma guerre !” And with the disappearance of the old
                        Monarchical régimes the methods and spirit of French diplomacy have been
                        greatly transformed. The Mornys and the Gramonts have been replaced by the
                        Delcassés and the Rouviers, representatives of a bourgeoisie -brilliant,
                        in-tellectual, and highly cultivated, but born and bred in the traditions of
                        the French peasantry, itself an agricultural bourgeoisie, and with none of
                        the special failings or fascinations of the old French aristocracy. German
                        diplomacy, on the other hand, unsoiled by plebeian contact, remains, in its
                        undeniable efficiency, tho aristocratic and strictly conventional instrument
                        that it always was, allowance being made for occasional eccentricities due
                        to the Emperor’s personal inspiration. It is a diplomacy with an acute sense
                        of amour propre ; the word "prestige” is for ever on its lips. And being
                        more of a Court functionary than a public servant, it is capable of
                        exaggerating the importance of an Imperial whim to the detriment of the
                        national interests. </p>
                    <p>To dynastic extravagances on the part of 1er rulers, France, with her
                        well-established democratic institutions, is in nowise exposed any longer ;
                        she has no high-flown Quixotic ideals to live up to, no feudal traditions to
                        maintain. Her President, a simple peasant's son, on State occasions wears a
                        silk hat, bat never, under any circumstances, the panoply of war. And in her
                        dealings with other nations, in her diplomacy, France of the Third Republic
                        has displayed in a marked degree the same broad spirit of democracy from
                        which all element of fantastic amour propre has been absent, which a
                        rational sense of self-interest has alone ruled. Thus she was able to
                        recognise with M. Delcasse, the value of a cordial understanding with
                        England, her best commercial customer. And in the various arrangements she
                        has made with other European Powers, it is her simple everyday welfare which
                        she has been pursuing, undeterred by the promptings of those who, from
                        interested motives, would have liked to fan her old quarrels into a flame.
                        To the Francs of to-day what is the cost of a small sacrifice of amour
                        propre ? It means as much and as little as it would to the average French
                        peasant cheapening a pig in the market </p>
                    <p>But though the spirit of the French peasant be devoid of false pride and
                        petty vanity, it is tenacious in the extreme. Economy, taciturn sobriety,
                        untiring perseverance in the path of gain, a deep-rooted materialism,
                        combined with an inborn and carefully nurtured cunning, are among its most
                        marked features. Balzac, in “Les Paysane,” and Zola, in "La Terre,” have
                        drawn somewhat overcharged portraits of the French peasant’s
                        acquisitiveness, but, without going to extremes, it is yet easy to recognise
                        that the dogged determination and astuteness of the French peasant
                        temperament enter as important elements into the plain democratic spirit by
                        which the national councils of France are now guided. The prompt resignation
                        of M. Delcasse showed more than anything else that the fortunes of France
                        are no longer dependent on a single man or a single issue. "Your coin, is I
                        bad!” shouts the angry bargainer, seeking a quarrel. "Really !" says the
                        imperturbable peasant, looking at the spurned coin with deferential
                        curiosity. ‘Take this one !" And the good piece, wrongfully accused, after
                        giving place to another neither better nor worse, is slipped back into the
                        peasant’s wallet, to join many others of the same currency, if not of equal
                        value. For in its broad lines it is still the policy of M. Delcasse, hedged
                        about by treaties and conventions of the best kind—for they are based upon
                        practical interests—which is being followed by M. Rouvier. The personal
                        relations between M. Rouvier and M. Delcasse are known to be excellent. Bnt
                        there was undoubtedly a sigh of relief throughout the country when M.
                        Delcasse abandoned a situation which his mere presence made unnecessarily
                        dangerous, and that M. Rouvier has earned the gratitude of the great
                        majority of the French people by his determination to maintain peace, even
                        at an apparent sacrifice of amour propre, cannot be disputed. In a talk
                        which I have had with M. Henri Prost, the great provincial banker, who is
                        perhaps better situated than anyone to gauge the feeling of the French
                        provincial populations, he expressed this view. "The peasantry,” he said,
                        "and the small provincial capitalists never lost their sang-froid in the
                        presence of the German threats, but they could not admit that France should
                        shed torrents of her blood and expend vast treasure for the sake of Morocco,
                        and they are profoundly grateful to M. Rouvier for having avoided war. They
                        consider that he acted with the energy and the prudence which the highest
                        interests of the country demanded ; his personal popularity has been greatly
                        enhanced in consequence; and at the forthcoming elections the Republican
                        Party will certainly sweep the board. Had war broken out it is probable that
                        the Republic would have been shaken to its foundations, but as matters
                        stand, Republicanism has been strengthened and consolidated all over the
                        country.” </p>

                    <head>TO THE ZAMBESI</head>
                    <p>In so brief a period as fifteen years from the date when active occupation of
                        the immense territory now known as Rhodesia began, that very peaceable
                        scientific organisation, the British Association, makes a pleasure trip by
                        rail to the rolling Zambesi, and Professor Darwin performs the ceremony of
                        opening the recently constructed bridge over the Victoria Falls. Portuguese,
                        Mashona, and Matabele antagonism to British colonisation have alike
                        succumbed to the masterful genius of one great Englishman. It was Mr. Rhodes
                        who, with clear prophetic vision, discerned the latent possibilities of the
                        mighty province so rightly named after him. It was he, too, whose daring
                        mind projected and carried forward the Comprehensive railway system which
                        has rendered it practicable for the British Association to participate in
                        the opening of the gigantic bridge at Victoria Falls. But his enterprising
                        spirit went far beyond even that in its lofty •oaring. Already railhead is
                        nearly 150 miles north of the great river, and before very long, connection
                        will be formed with the Congo State on the one side and with Nyasaland on
                        the other. All of the most serious difficulties now lie behind, and an
                        immense stride has been made towards the complete realisation of that daring
                        "dream”—the Cape to Cairo trank line. Of a truth, as has been well said, the
                        great work of great men usually lives after them. Baring his life Mr. Rhodes
                        steadily persevered with the splendid work to which he had set his strong
                        hand, and it is entirely due to his magnificent clearness of sight and
                        tenacity of purpose that through tickets to the Zambesi from London can now
                        be obtained. It is one of the grandest achievements ever accomplished by
                        individual genius, and as the British savants viewed the wonders of the
                        stupendous Fall, their thoughts must have dwelt on the heroic adventurer who
                        now sleeps among the stern solitudes of the Matopo Hills. </p>

                    <p>If the conclusions as to the origin and history of the mysterious rains in
                        Rhodesia pat before the British Association at Bulawayo by Mr. Randall
                        MacIver are correct, they are not relics of ancient Ophir, and we mast seek
                        elsewhere for the region where King Solomon pro-pared his stores of gold and
                        precious stones. Mr. MacIver went to Rhodesia last April, under the auspices
                        of the Association and the Rhodes trustees, and examined minutely the reins
                        of Inyanga, Niekerk’s farm (16 miles north of Inyanga), Khami, Dhlo Dhlo,
                        Unatali, Inriza, and Zimbabwe. After careful investigation he has (says the
                        "Times” correspondent) decided that none of the rains in Southern Rhodesia
                        are older than the fifteenth or sixteenth century, and that they are the
                        handiwork of African natives of the negro or negroid race under the dynasty
                        known by the collective name of Monomotapa. The bases of these conclusions
                        were formed on the following data:— </p>
                    <p>The buildings are essentially of a native kind or type common to-day; nearly
                        all retain some original wooden stakes embedded in the walls ; there is no
                        trace of inscription on any of the ruins ; stone and iron implements were
                        found together ; neither the buildings nor the other articles found show
                        traces of early Oriental or European influence ; finally, the discovery of
                        pieces of blue and white Nankin china and other articles of medieval
                        manufacture in the lowest parts of the foundations proves that such
                        commodities were the object of barter before the buildings were erected. </p>
                    <p>Mr. MacIver maintains that the reins were originally fortified places,
                        usually enclosing a kopje built in the form of a rough ellipse following
                        mainly the contour of the surrounding country. The so-called slave pits,
                        described as pit dwellings, were originally citadels of their strong places
                        round which concentric circles of walls were built. </p>

                    <head>COMMON SENSE V. LAW.</head>
                    <p>The London City magistrates do an immense amount of good work without
                        adequate recognition. Their experience of the world — that is, their
                        experience of the average man — often enables them to compare favorably with
                        his Majesty’s judges, some of whom have devoted so much time to the study of
                        the law that they have had none to spare for the inevitable ignorance, the
                        trials and troubles, of their less cultivated brethren. Few judges can
                        understand how any man can be ignorant of the law. One City magistrate, Sir
                        Joseph Renals, confessed the other day that, though everybody was supposed
                        to know the law, be did not, nor did he know anybody who does ; and from
                        that point of view he declined to convict a respectable man who had been
                        hauled before him for unwittingly transgressing the regulations of a railway
                        company by using an expired return ticket. At the same sitting his knowledge
                        of social conditions drove Sir Joseph to sympathise with a convicted thief
                        who had been driven into crime a second time by the impossibility of keeping
                        a situation. "I am sorry to say,” said the magistrate, "that I know what you
                        tell me is true. Many men who are unfortunately in your position, when they
                        do get a situation and it is found they have been convicted, invariably have
                        to leave. It is very hard, but it is a very censorious world, and seems
                        never to overlook a fault” The man had to go to prison but a little sympathy
                        of this magisterial kind will probably do him more good than the punishment
                    </p>

                    <head>SHARK-ANGLING.</head>
                    <p>Although the British sea-angler has no op-portunity of making personal
                        acquaintance with that monstrous fish, the tarpon, there are parts of the
                        coast where the shark makes a fairly satisfactory substitute. As in the
                        other case, strong tackle has to be used, and plenty of line to play the
                        fierce fighter when hooked A Lancashire angler, who lately secured about a
                        dozen off the Yorkshire littoral, prescribes 200 yards of tanned hemp line,
                        and a stout eleven-foot rod, as suitable gear ; with this apparatus and half
                        of a mackeral as bait on each hook, the seafisher can make sure of lively
                        sport. Sometimes, the so-called shark it is really a large species of
                        dog-fish—-runs to 150lbs., but these are the giants of the family, the
                        average weight being very much less. But whether big or little, the
                        voracious ' tigers of the sea” play sad havoc with its finny population, and
                        on that account alone the sport deserves encouragement To fill up time when
                        bites are few and far between, the angler can amuse himself with trying for
                        whiting or any other fish that happens to be in evidence, using a lighter
                        rod and tackle. Every "school” is sure to have seme sharks in attendance,
                        and it will not be long before the whirling reel on the heavier rod gives
                        notice that a "toper’’—the local pseudonym of the big dog-fish-is hooked. It
                        makes off at express speed, sometimes running out 150 yards of line, and
                        even when exhausted by its strenuous efforts to escape, the gallant “tiger”
                        fights hard to the very last. </p>
