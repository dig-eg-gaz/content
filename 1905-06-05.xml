                        <p>MONDAY, JUNE 5, 1905. Egypt is so deeply interested Is confined to a
                            single undertaking, the property of the State, a monopoly, and in most
                            respects the simplest possible machine of its kind and to the remedying
                            of its defects and wants, which are as clear as the day. Mr. Robertson's
                            report • was upon the best method of dealing with and number of the most
                            complicated problems which could possibly arise out of a multiplicity of
                            different lines, owners* rights, interests at-. Mr. Priestley's was
                            simply upon the parts if any, of the American systems of railway working
                            whioh could with advantage be introduced into India. Taking these
                            reports again in the same order, we certainly have fair reason to be •
                            lieve that the first has been accepted by. those best able to judge as

                            nothing of. the sort can be said of either ot the others. It is true an
                            Indian Railway Board has been formed, hot this had been proposed and
                            discussed form my years before Mr. Robertson ever went to India, and it
                            was not formed as proposed by him “somewhat - imperfectly1' according to
                            “Traffic, " but more wisely so, according to Lord Carzon and his
                            advisers. The division of a railway under ‘•Traffic Management ’ seems
                            to us too amateurish to consider, and finds no place in our reading of
                            Lord Farrar s Report Traffic itself is a department only. As the earning
                            one its place. and its efficient management are all-important—its wants
                            must be administered to by all, but it does not, aud never should, take'
                            the place of “General Management. ” We would wish to make ourselves
                            dear. The success of a railway depends more upon traffic management than
                            anything else. All other things being equal, probably the best General
                            Manager is a traffic man, ‘but in either capacity, his qualifications
                            depend upon his business aptitude and business experience. Such do not
                            usually comprise any civil or mechanical engineering knowledge, and that
                            traffic quA traffic should have these or other departments or sections
                            of these under its heel is an unheard-of proposition. There are points
                            in connection with this division, as advocated by “Traffic, V which
                            remind us of the “Horse, ” “K^frjjSbmeut,: and some other departments of
                            Soane 'English railways. By thus misnaming separate sections the number
                            may go far beyond eleven, but happily for share-holders and for,
                            management, the number of departments proper is kept down at about half
                            this number, and Lord Farrar s report gives their generally accepted
                            constitution. In their details we cannot either accept many of
                            “Traffic’s” expressed opinions. Surely in its provisions for stock and
                            station accom modation Lord Farrar’s Commission supplies what is
                            necessary for working the present and immediately prospective; in regard
                            to "General Management " the idea has been that there are too many at it
                            not that it is done at present mainly by the traffic manager, and the
                            creation of a capital account hardly heads the list in the matter of
                            improved financial control. As a matter of fact we have not been in

                        <p>During the past month our columns have contained three articles on the
                            Egyptian State Railways, by ‘'Traffic. ’’ The subject is one so full of
                            interest and importance to this country, that we welcome such
                            contributions, provided they are of a nature to promote the interests
                            involved either directly or indirectly, but their acceptance by us for
                            publication involves the challenging of opinions which we cannot
                            endorse. From our contributor’s reference to the reports of Mr. Thomas
                            Robertson and Mr. Neville Priestly on Indian and American Railways
                            respectively, our readers might be led to believe that there is
                            something in common between them and that of Lord Farrar’s Commission.
                            This is not so. The report in whioh Mr. Robert Hichens asks, in “ The
                            Queen, " whether women like to be free. “Some years ago, ” he says,
                            “there seemed to be a new unrest in the world of Englishwomen; they
                            seemed to be dissatisfied with the existing conditions of their lives,
                            to want a greater emancipation.... Women were to be this and were to be
                            that. They were to enter all the professions. They were to sit in
                            Parliament They were to wear trousers if they pleased, and they did—a
                            few of them—wear those frightful garments called 'divided skirts, ’ at
                            which when I looked I sometimes desired their death, for in death they
                            shall not be divided. There was a cropping of hair and a wearing of
                            shirt collars, and, a good deal of swaggering that was supposed, to be
                            ‘manly. ’ And the old-fashioned women cned, ‘What are we coming to? ’
                            And some of us men echoed the wail in bass voices, but with acute
                            anxiety. And what has it all ended in—or shall I say ii> it all ending

                            whole—the great majority of women, that is—wish to be free-' Women
                            themselves often make me doubt it There are certainly women who
                            passionately rebel against any attempt on the part of men at dominion,
                            even at guidance. But are they typical, or are they, on the contrary,
                            exceptional women! My observation leads me to suppose that they are not
                            typical at all Being a man, I find it extremely difficult to understand
                            how any human being can take pleasure in being ruled, but I have
                            certainly met numbers of women, and many of them women of strong
                            character, who obviously enjoyed being ruled, who even Fought a ruler

                        <p>A KIDNAPPING CASE.</p>
                        <p>An educated Sudanese youth, who had obtained the Primary Certificate of
                            the Ministry of Public Instruction, went to Cairo from Assouan to see
                            some of his relations some time ago. He was on his way back again, and
                            when near Gebel Silsileh, the boat in which he was making the journey
                            southwards was becalmed there. Some Bedouins of the village, called
                            Kagoog, came down to the bank of the river and asked the youth to come
                            to their huts in the village and partake of their hospitality until the
                            wind got up. The invitation was accepted and the Sudanese dined with the
                            Bedouins. After the meal a fair wind began to blow, and the youth told
                            his hosts that he must be off to his boat and go on his way homewards.
                            But the Bedouins would not let him go, and they bound him with cords and
                            strapped him on the back of a camel. The men then went on their way with
                            the camels across the desert to the shores of the Red Sea, where they
                            sold the boy for £13 to some Bedouins of the Hedjaz. These men resold
                            him to an Arabian for £17 and he remained in a state of slavery for some
                            months. But one day he met some Ottoman officials and told them that he
                            was an Egyptian Sudanese and had been wrongfully kidnapped and sold into
                            slavery. The officials took charge of him until the caravan of the
                            Egyptian Mahmal came to Yambo, when they gave him in charge to the
                            leader of the caravan, and told him to take the youth back with him to
                            his own country. So the Sudanese came back to Egypt and was taken to his
                            kinsmen. Ahmed Effendi Bekri, of the Repression of Slave Trade
                            Department, has opened an enquiry into the case and the kidnappers have
                            been caught and placed under arrest. They will shortly be tried by court
                            martial.</p>

                        <head>REASSURING STATEMENTS</head>
                        <p>We are glad to be able to contradict, the report that a death had
                            occurred in Cairo in consequence of a, use of bad lymph in vaccination,
                            and to state that it is entirely without foundation. The facts of tip
                            case, to which wo give full publicity op account of its great
                            importance, are as follows. Three men were vaccinated with lymph
                            obtained from a chemist. Two of these three had not been previously
                            vaccinated, whilst the third had been vaccinated in childhood, and the
                            natural consequence was that the lymph acted very strongly in the two
                            former cases, whilst in the latter case the action was very slight. One
                            of the men, who had not submitted himself to vaccination in childhood,
                            became feverish and on going into hospital he was examined by two
                            doctors, who. pronounced the case to be one of suspected small-pox. Time
                            however proved that the fever was simply due to the action of the.
                            lymph, and after seventeen days he was dismissed, with a warning to take
                            great care of his vaccinated arm, and on no account to. set up.
                            irritation by scratching it. This warning was repeated on the occasion
                            when he visited the hospital for the dressing of the arm, but was
                            apparently unheeded, for on a subsequent visit a scar was found on it.
                            Every attention was paid to the case but in spite of all the patient
                            developed erysipelas, and death ensued. From these facts it is perfectly
                            evident that it is altogether wrong to assume that depth was due either
                            to improper vaccination or to the use of bad lymph.</p>

                            the Khedivial Agricultural Society several cultivators are making
                            experiments on small areas with Mr. Richmond's method of destroying the

                            with the success which is anticipated, for the simplicity of the method
                            and the small cost at which it can be carried out will be extremely
                            advantageous to the cotton-grower, and moreover, the solution of the

                        <p>Thu Adviser to the Ministry of the Interior arrived yesterday at Zagazig
                            with Abdel Hamed Bey Abaza, acting Secretary General of the Khedivial
                            Agricultural Society, and immediately went to Kafr-El-Hamam to inspect
                            the work of collecting the cotton worms. He was accompanied by the
                            Mondir of the Shar-kieh province, the Wakeel, the Commandant of Police,
                            and the Mamour of Zagazig district. Mr. Machell was pleased to see that
                            the gathering of the worms was being carried on in a satisfactory manner
                            here. Tbe Adviser returned to the Moudirieh, and after inspecting other
                            work in connection with the cotton worm, he visited Abdel Hamed Bey
                            Abaza’s house, where the Agricultural Society’s office is. There he
                            interviewed Ibrahim Eff. Fahmy, acting secretary of the K.A.S. for
                            Sharkieh, Dakablieh, and Galioubieh provinces. He expressed his
                            satisfaction with the way the work of the society is being carried on.
                            The Adviser took some refreshments at Abaza Bey’s house and then
                            accompanied the Moudir to his residence, where he lunched, and left for

                                alleged that a policeman and a ghaffir had been assaulted by the
                                broker. It appears that on the evening of 28th May Messrs. Yasoo
                                Vella, a Maltese and a British subject, and Pio Tonna, a
                                Maltese,were together in the Savoy Bar on the Ramleh-boulevard.
                                Vella went into a lane adjoining the bar and attempted to-commit a
                                nuisance, which the ghaffir, Ismail Aly, would not let him perform.
                                The broker became indigent and struck the ghaffir. A policeman and
                                the broker also assaulted him. The policeman was so badly assaulted
                                that he had to be taken to hospital. The case was heard on Friday
                                and judgment was given on Saturday last, the defendant being fined
                                £10 for the assault on the policeman ’in the execution of his duty,
                                £1 for a simple assault on the ghaffir, and costs.</p>

                    <head>ALEXANDRIA HORSE SHOW. AN UNQUALIFIED SUCCESS.</head>
                    <p>What was practically the first Horse Show over held at Alexandria took place
                        on Saturday last, under the auspices of the Trotter Egyptien, at the
                        ex-Velodrome, Rond Point. That the show would be a success was certain from
                        the large number of entries which bad been received, but the actual results
                        of their laudable efforts exceeded all the expectations of the committee. To
                        the members of the : ttter we tender-our hearty congratulations. onsideripg
                        the fact that this was the first attempt of the kind at Alexandria, and the
                        very short time taken in organisation, besides he advanced date in. the
                        season, they have •very reason to be gratified. Something like jC 100 was
                        taken as gate money pn Saturday, ' ind it was plainly evident that the show
                        was a popular fixture, which will no doubt become an annual one. Among those
                        present on the grounds we noticed H. H. Prince Omar Toussoun, Thur-neyssen
                        Pasha, Comte de Vauvineux, Baron and Bironess_ von Humboldt-Dachroeden,
                        Barons A., and E. de Menasce, CoL Lewis, Lieut. -Col. Lucas, Miralai
                        Hopkinson Bey, Capt. Gillson, Izzet Pasha, Ibrahim Bey (. herif, Mr. A. E.
                        Benachi, Mr. A. S. Preston, Mr. and Mrs. R. Lang Anderson, Mr. Henry Barker,
                        Mr. A. J. Miehaelides, Mr. A. Sursock, etc. The “concoure” began at 9.30
                        aon. and were continued almost without intermission up to seven in the
                        evading. In Class I., for thoroughbred stallions, H.H. Prince Mohamed
                        Ibrahim showed Fra Antonio, a very fine made animal, which was the only one
                        shewn, but would no doubt have beaten all comers. The winner of Class 3, Mr.
                        A. J. Miehaelides’ mare Actis, was a perfect chestnut, half Eoglish and half
                        Aral* ; Mr. E. Karam's Berg^re, who was second, appeared to be lacking in
                        good points. In Class 2. Priuce Omar Toussoun took first prize with Si^ltau,
                        a fine bay. Mr. Sursock’s Bright night have carried off first prize in this
                        class, had it not been for the unsoundneas d his hocks. In Class 4, Mr.
                        Miehaelides’ Actis was again an easy lirst. Prince Omar Toussoun bjok first
                        prize in class 5 with Mouftakhar, a tine big upstanding C.B. who is not
                        unknown ■. a liio race course. There was some difference of opinion among
                        the public as to who should be iirst m^Class 21, but Lampowas indubitably a
                        truer trotter than his rival Nelly Lafne. Espoir, a swift goer, who is the
                        best trotting horse in Egypt, of course took first place in Class 22. Mr. C.
                        W. Hemp fully deserved first in the polo pony class toith his Grand Slam, a
                        pony which is very quick in his movements and turning to a polo ball, and
                        was far ahead of the other exhibits. Class 23 was for Arab police horses,
                        and the six which showed were as good looking and well turned out as could
                        be. It was a matter of difficulty for the judges to choose the best, but
                        ultimately the prize went to ShawishUoma. Theblueribbon in Class 19 would
                        probably have gone to Mr. Amato had that gentleman’s horse not been a
                        trained trotter. As it was, judged on its individual merits, Mr. A.
                        Sursock’s horse secured the honors. In Class 19, for European horses in
                        single harness, Mr. A. E. Benachi’s No. 13 was much fancied by the judges
                        for his manners and paces, though opinion on the other side of the fence
                        leaned towards Mr. Benachi’s other horse, No. 12. In Class 12, the winners,
                        Mr. C. Tamvaco’s pair, were undoubtedly the best of their class, but they
                        would have made a better appearance, we think, without bearing rein$ as then
                        they could have carried themselves more naturally. In Claae 8, for heavy
                        weights, we were pleased to see the blue ribbon go to Thurneyssen Pasha,
                        while for light weights Mr. A. E. Benachi’H Shellal, the well known old
                        racer, was the first among a hue selection, and seemed in the pink of
                        condition, being well ridden by Mr. J. Taylor. There was a poor turn-out of
                        tandems, only two exhibits coming forward, of which Mr. Lian’s was the beat.
                        The obstacle jump could not be classed as an unqualified success, the only
                        horse that distinguished himself being Ibrahim Bey Cherifs Saclawy. In this
                        event, unfortunately, Thurneyssen Pasha, who was third with Azlan, met with
                        a rather -nasty spill, his horse fouling the water jump. The Pasha fell on
                        his head and sustained slight injuries, which, however, did not prevent him
                        from winning the tirat prize in the subsequent high jump with the same
                        horse. Master Zervu-flachi’s turn-out in Class 10, for poniea of 12£ hands,
                        was a pretty one, and we should have liked to have seen more of the same
                        thing. There were four entries, for the four-in-hand class, but as Ibrahim
                        Bey Cherif did not come on the ground until too late with what was
                        undoubtedly the best $nrn-out, the prize went to Mr. Amato, who caused some
                        comment by turning up with a team selected from different ^tables. In the
                        Arab Hack clasa the winner, l aroos, a well made pony, waa splendidly ridden
                        by Mrs. Kelham. There was some difference of opinion as to which horse
                        should get third prize, but Miss Allen’s Marool was chosen ultimately on his
                        manners. Ihe Governess Cars claw only produced one exhibit, namely that of
                        Mr. C. Zervu-uachi. Ihis might have been made a very pretty event with more
                        entries. Class 11 was very satisfactory and brought out no lesa than 15
                        pairs, the turn-out being remarkably fine. '1 ie entries were all of them
                        good,but there waa no doubt that Mr. A. E. Benachi’s pair was superior to
                        the others. They ahowed good-training and were*well handled. Saleh Bey
                        Aboue-bach's pair,which took second prize,were a very hne pair but had only
                        one pace. Baron A. de Menasce’a pair, which were equal second, want ed a
                        little more training although they were well matched. Thia waa the laat
                        olaaa, and at the conclusion there waa a march past of all £ho winners. Thua
                        a very aucoeaaful and enjoy- able meeting, whioh was enlivened by aelectiona
                        by the Bellini Band, waa brought to a cloae. The judging, we believe, gave
                        every aatiB-faction, no favoritism whatever having been shown. The judges
                        were : Prinoe Omar Tous-80un, Prince Mohamed Ibrahim, Haasan Paaha Mohsen,

                        was assisted by Mr. Ch. della Marra, rendered yeoman’s service, •'and much
                        of the success of the meeting is due to him. The stewards, also, deserve

                    <p>In our- opinion, aaya the “Comhill” for June, the real secret of the Russian
                        reverses—and if we are right it is one that leaves no hope for the
                        future—lies in their inferior organisation, the absence in any considerable
                        degree of the capacity for combined action on the part of the higher
                        commanders, and, above all, in the fact that their infantry, individually
                        and collectively, are inferior to their opponents in battle. The larger the
                        armies which are employed, the more diffioult does clear insight into the
                        diapoaitions of the enemy beoome, the greater growa the proportion of eventa
                        which muat be controlled by local commanders, and the more vital the need of
                        intelligent oo-operation. But even the po8aeaaion of these qualities is by
                        itself insufficient to secure victory. It ia impoaaible for any commander to
                        control theae vast seas of combat of which the fluctuationa, indefiniteneaa,
                        and extent preaent problema of a atrategio rather than of a tactical nature,

                        formalism, to throw aaide all idea8 of a central reaerve— which, as at
                        Mukden, may arrive too late and too exhausted for attack or for defence—and
                        by an unshrinking offenaive to endeavour to upset hia opponent’a
                        combinations and force him to conform to his own. The atrategio defenaive
                        has long been condemned by all aohoola of military opinion; it would seem
                        that the taotioal defensive, as it oomea to approximate more and more to the

                    <p>"The Manchester Guardiajn” says : — "In view of the approaching
                        International Cotton Congress in Mancheater the attention of thoughtful
                        people engaged in the trade ia being turned to the practical possibilities
                        of common action for the oommon good. The questions of the supply and prioe
                        of the raw material are naturally the first to engage attention, for the
                        most acute troubles of the trade have been due to short supplies of the raw
                        material and to violent fluctuations in its price resulting from apeoulative
                        manipulation. Our Mancheater contemporary reproduoes a draft agreement
                        between apinnere and growers tor the regulation of ootton prices whioh was
                        drawn up by a well-known English spinner and has already been under the
                        consideration of the Convention of American Cotton-growere whioh met at New
                        Orleans last January. The prioe of middling American ootton in Liverpool
                        when the Convention met at New Orleans on January 21 was 3|cL per lb. Within
                        three weeks the prioe was raised to 4fd., and this has been the average
                        prioe ever since, with an average weekly fluctuation of only three
                        thirty-seoonds of a penny. It is not unreasonable to suppose that the
                        Cotton-growers’ Convention was the means of effecting the ohange. It, then,
                        the ootton-growers have this year, by ooncerted action in abstaining from
                        selling, saved themselves from a disastrous collapse of prices, just as last
                        year the English Master Spinners’ Federation, by; concerted action in
                        abstaining from buying, saved themselves from a threatened oomer.itmay
                        pertinently be asked whether the two organisations— the International
                        Spinners’ Committee on the one hand and the Southern Cotton-growere’
                        Convention on the other hand—might not join in making a treaty to conserve
                        the legitimate interests of both. </p>

                    <head>PIGEON SHOOTING. To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</head>
                    <p>Sir,—The amount of twaddle talked by your various correspondents on the
                        subject of pigeon shooting at the Alexandria Sporting Club is extraordinary.
                        For example, ‘ British Pigeon’ bases his (or her) argument on the grounda
                        that no game or pastime diataateful to some of the members of the club
                        should be introduced into the A.S.C. Therefore a small, olique of members
                        may block the. introduction of any game or pastime, however much the rest of
                        the club may be in favor of it. The non-Engliah members of the club are the
                        m^in supporters of the olub financially and there would be no racea at all
                        but for them, while the English on the other hand have a far greater share
                        in the benefits of the club,—in regard to polo, for example,—in proportion
                        to what they pay towards the club,as it is obvious that the polo players
                        have a larger share of the club Allotted to them than they should have
                        compared with the limited number who play. Mother of the arguments advanced
                        by “British Pigeon” ia that pigeon-shooting is disapproved -of by their
                        Queen 1 Can we therefore be per-nlitted to have bull fights at the A.S.C.,
                        for Edward VII. approves of that form of “sport,”, as he attended such a
                        spectacle when in Lisbon not long ago ! Edward VII. when in Paris goes to
                        the races on Sunday. I presume therefore that ia an absolutely valid reason
                        to the mind of “Britiah Pigeon” for the A.S.C. to hold races on the Day of
                        Reat ! Because any Sovereigu (or his consort) to whom the many subjects of
                        various European nations, members of the A.S.C., owe allegiance, approve or
                        disapprove of any Bport or pastime, is it a valid argument that their taatea
                        should be oonsulted in the matter at all ? “British Pigeon” on this line of
                        argument would, I presume, be perfectly willing to allow any Spaniards, if
                        members of the A.S.C., to indulge in pigeon shooting there because it is the
                        favorite sport of the King of Spain ! If it is such a wicked pastime why waa
                        it in vogue at Hurlingham up to only a few daya agol All the arguments are
                        nonsense, and if the English members of the A.S.C. object let them leave the
                        olub and form one of their own. - I am, etc., “PnANAR.” Alexandria, Juqe

                    <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette. Sir,—It does one good to see the noble
                        stand that the Alexandriana are making against pigeon-ahooting. I have read
                        the strong pro-teata that have been appearing day by day >f late in the
                        “Egyptian Gazette” againat thia barbarous project and it is pleasant to know
                        that the European oolonies at Alexandria ■lumber so many earnest members,
                        ever ready to fight the good fight Would that we had many auch atalwarta in
                        Cairo ! But now that the campaign has begun it ought not to be flowed to be
                        confined merely to pigeon shoot ing. getting is a far greater evil in my
                        opinion, and one of the moat pleasing reforms needed in the Khedivial and
                        Alexandria Sporting Clubs is the extermination of the parimutuel. We all
                        know the terriblo lengths to which betting on races goes on in England, Wt
                        here it is worse, for by the pari-mutuel the vice is recognised and
                        systematised in a way it never ia at home. I do not go ao far aa to Bay that
                        raoing ia bad in itself; but if it cannot be carried on without betting it
                        ought to be atopped. Will not the English members of the Alexandria Sporting
                        Club lead the way} Foblic opinion in that city seems to be in a far
                        healthier and) robosfer state than it is here. Why then should you not set
                        an example to the Spotting Clob at Cairo, whioh I am sure will be obliged to
                        follow the example of Alexandria, if it is given the neoeaiary lead ? We pay
                        for too much attention to mere material reforms, for what is the use of
                        irrigation or sound finance, if the soul ia allowed to wither? I am, eto.,

                    <p>To The Editor of the Egyptian Gazette. Sir,—We had not intended to trouble
                        you with any further communication upon this subjeot but the letter you
                        published in your ia8ue of the 3rd inat from Mr. John Gwynne calla for a few
                        lines in reply. Permit us to point out that Mr. Gwynne has completely
                        misunderstood our letter in your issue ot 8th May. The objeot of this letter
                        was to oonfirm from our own experience (extending over 40 years in this
                        oountry) the statements of the “Times" correspondent that Continental-made
                        pumps had been ooming more and more into favor in this oountry until two or
                        three years ago. This we repeat to be a fact in spite of all statements to
                        the contrary. Our objeot in mentioning that we had in past years represented
                        Messrs. J. and H. Gwynne and Messrs. Gwynne and Co. and others was with the
                        view of showing that we had had considerable experience in the matter under
                        disousaion. We do not imagine the oironmstanoes whioh led to our
                        discontinuing business relations with these two firms are of the smallest
                        interest to the public, though our recollection of them differs entirely
                        from that mentioned in Mr. Gwynne’s letter. Neither do we propose to allude
                        further to the origin of our own business connection with Egypt, beyond
                        stating that the date oommenced waa 1864 and not 1868. Theae detaila, though
                        intereating to ourselves, have nothing to do with the question under
                        discussion. There is one point, however, upon which Mr. Gwynne is apparently
                        labouring under a misapprehension; he more than once alludes to “our
                        principala,” evidently meaning thereby the firms from whom we purchase our
                        machinery. Our firm purchases such maohinery a8 fixed engines and pumps from
                        any makers it pleases, and buys what from its own experience it considers
                        best suited to the requirements of this oountry. We are free to purchase
                        pumps from any British or Continental maker who i8 willing to aell them to
                        ua as we may desire. Returning now to the actual circumstances that gave
                        rise to this correspondence, we may say that we have frequently in the past
                        supplied machinery for driving pumps made by Continental firms. We have
                        ourselves imported auch pumps and have aome in stock at thia moment. * We
                        have had probably a larger experience in centrifugal pumps tlmn any firm in
                        thia country, having sold aome thousands in the last 40 years. Messrs.
                        Ruston Prootor n Co., Limited, being anxious to seoure as large a share of
                        our busineaa as poaaible, agreed to design a pump that ahould at all events
                        equal anything the best Continental makers could, offer us. We apeak of
                        things as we find them, and hold no brief for any special maker, but when we
                        found a firm who was willing to spend hundreds of poundd in testa and
                        experiments in the endeavour to meet our requirements we naturally
                        considered auch enterprise worth mentioning. It is so frequently advanced
                        that Britiah makere will not improve their manufactures, nftr adapt them to
                        the apeoial requirements of their customers, that thia exoeption wa8 the
                        more noteworthy. « Messrs. Ruston Proctor and Co. Limited’s Helical” pump is
                        not, as your correspondent appears to infer, an exact copy of any particular
                        pump, but a pump designed on and embodying the beat points of all the pumps,
                        both British and foreign, that they tested. These tests, we are informed,
                        revealed aome moat extraordinary facts ; thua one maker’a pump of a certain
                        aize gave the poor result of 45 % only. Each teat waa repeated many times to
                        eliminate, aa far aa possible, all ohanoe of error. With their own pump
                        Messrs. Rnston altered and realtered their patterns until they had got each
                        size to give approximately the same modulous. We must leave the Continental
                        makers to reply or not .as they should think fit, to your correspondent’s
                        oharge of having copied hia manufactures. As regards mechanioal efficiency
                        we can only repeat and confirm what we stated in our letter of May 8th.,
                        viz., that the testa, to whioh we alluded, of the Continental pumps in Borne
                        cases revealed an effioienoy “much in excess of what Britiah makers are as a
                        rule disposed to gnarantee.”We are quite aware that the maximum mechanical
                        effioienoy of a pump is obtained only on given conditions. In conclusion, if
                        we are to be blamed for learning from our opponents and endeavouring to move
                        with the times, then we have “sinned indeed”, but as a set-off we can feel
                        that we can procure from Messrs. Ruston Prootor n Co., Limited, a pump far
                        superior to any we have sold before and which is giving complete
                        satisfaction to our oustomere. We have no intention of impugning the
                        veracity of Mr. Gwynne’s statements as to the performance of hia
                        manufactures, and as regards the proposal in the laat paragraph but one o(
                        hia letter, we can only say that such a comparison as he suggests is a
                        practical impossibility which we have neither the time nor the opportunity
                        to attempt.— Yours faithfully, For Allen, Aldehson and Company, Limited. F.
                        Allen, Director. Alexandria, June 5.</p>
