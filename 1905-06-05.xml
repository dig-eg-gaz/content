                    chamberlain, and General Husni Pasha, aide-de-camp, to go to meet the Khedive at

                    anchored in front of Dolma Baghtche on the Bosphorus. Being informed of their

                    of ceremonies, to welcome his Highness. H. E. Ghani Agha, "Dar-us-saddet

                    envoys, landed and drove to the imperial Palace in gala carriages. On arriving
                    there, his Highness was received by the Sultan. The Khedive’s mother proceeded
                    on board the steam-launch "Nil” to receive her daughter-in-law and convey her to

                <head>THE FIKI QUESTION. THE VACCINATION SCARE.</head>
                <p>A KIDNAPPING CASE.</p>
                <p>An educated Sudanese youth, who had obtained the Primary Certificate of the
                    Ministry of Public Instruction, went to Cairo from Assouan to see some of his
                    relations some time ago. He was on his way back again, and when near Gebel
                    Silsileh, the boat in which he was making the journey southwards was becalmed
                    there. Some Bedouins of the village, called Kagoog, came down to the bank of the
                    river and asked the youth to come to their huts in the village and partake of
                    their hospitality until the wind got up. The invitation was accepted and the
                    Sudanese dined with the Bedouins. After the meal a fair wind began to blow, and
                    the youth told his hosts that he must be off to his boat and go on his way
                    homewards. But the Bedouins would not let him go, and they bound him with cords
                    and strapped him on the back of a camel. The men then went on their way with the
                    camels across the desert to the shores of the Red Sea, where they sold the boy
                    for £13 to some Bedouins of the Hedjaz. These men resold him to an Arabian for
                    £17 and he remained in a state of slavery for some months. But one day he met
                    some Ottoman officials and told them that he was an Egyptian Sudanese and had
                    been wrongfully kidnapped and sold into slavery. The officials took charge of
                    him until the caravan of the Egyptian Mahmal came to Yambo, when they gave him
                    in charge to the leader of the caravan, and told him to take the youth back with
                    him to his own country. So the Sudanese came back to Egypt and was taken to his
                    kinsmen. Ahmed Effendi Bekri, of the Repression of Slave Trade Department, has
                    opened an enquiry into the case and the kidnappers have been caught and placed
                    under arrest. They will shortly be tried by court martial.</p>

                <head>REASSURING STATEMENTS</head>
                <p> We are glad to be able to contradict, the report that a death had occurred in
                    Cairo in consequence of a, use of bad lymph in vaccination, and to state that it
                    is entirely without foundation. The facts of tip case, to which wo give full
                    publicity op account of its great importance, are as follows. Three men were
                    vaccinated with lymph obtained from a chemist. Two of these three had not been
                    previously vaccinated, whilst the third had been vaccinated in childhood, and
                    the natural consequence was that the lymph acted very strongly in the two former
                    cases, whilst in the latter case the action was very slight. One of the men, who
                    had not submitted himself to vaccination in childhood, became feverish and on
                    going into hospital he was examined by two doctors, who. pronounced the case to
                    be one of suspected small-pox. Time however proved that the fever was simply due
                    to the action of the. lymph, and after seventeen days he was dismissed, with a
                    warning to take great care of his vaccinated arm, and on no account to. set up.
                    irritation by scratching it. This warning was repeated on the occasion when he
                    visited the hospital for the dressing of the arm, but was apparently unheeded,
                    for on a subsequent visit a scar was found on it. Every attention was paid to
                    the case but in spite of all the patient developed erysipelas, and death ensued.
                    From these facts it is perfectly evident that it is altogether wrong to assume
                    that depth was due either to improper vaccination or to the use of bad
                    lymph.</p>

                <head> THE COTTON WORM.</head>
                <p>We understand that at the suggestion of the Ministry of the Interior and the
                    Khedivial Agricultural Society several cultivators are making experiments on
                    small areas with Mr. Richmond's method of destroying the cotton worm, which was
                    fully described in a recent issue of the "Gazette.” It is sincerely to be hoped
                    that these experiments will meet with the success which is anticipated, for the
                    simplicity of the method and the small cost at which it can be carried out will
                    be extremely advantageous to the cotton-grower, and moreover, the solution of
                    the important and difficult problem of how to get rid of the cotton-worm will be
                    an inestimable boon to the country at large. Zagazig, Saturday.</p>

                    Abdel Hamed Bey Abaza, acting Secretary General of the Khedivial Agricultural
                    Society, and immediately went to Kafr-El-Hamam to inspect the work of collecting
                    the cotton worms. He was accompanied by the Mondir of the Shar-kieh province,
                    the Wakeel, the Commandant of Police, and the Mamour of Zagazig district. Mr.
                    Machell was pleased to see that the gathering of the worms was being carried on
                    in a satisfactory manner here. Tbe Adviser returned to the Moudirieh, and after
                    inspecting other work in connection with the cotton worm, he visited Abdel Hamed
                    Bey Abaza’s house, where the Agricultural Society’s office is. There he
                    interviewed Ibrahim Eff. Fahmy, acting secretary of the K.A.S. for Sharkieh,

                    the work of the society is being carried on. The Adviser took some refreshments
                    at Abaza Bey’s house and then accompanied the Moudir to his residence, where he
                    lunched, and left for Cairo by the 3.35 train.</p>

                        examination, two were expelled for fraud, the rest (270) failed. Of 195

                        prepared at private* schools 53 were successful, while of 122 private pupils
                        only ten satisfied the examiners. In the French section there were. 208

                        “cramming” the examination papers are not printed, but if rumour may be
                        trusted, the geometry paper proved a stum-, bling block to many. That the

                    <p>On Saturday an interesting case, of assault terminated before the British
                        Consular Court at Alexandria, the defendant being a broker on the Bourse and
                        the complainant, the Alexandria City Police, who alleged that a policeman
                        and a ghaffir had been assaulted by the broker. It appears that on the
                        evening of 28th May Messrs. Yasoo Vella, a Maltese and a British subject,
                        and Pio Tonna, a Maltese,were together in the Savoy Bar on the
                        Ramleh-boulevard. Vella went into a lane adjoining the bar and attempted
                        to-commit a nuisance, which the ghaffir, Ismail Aly, would not let him
                        perform. The broker became indigent and struck the ghaffir. A policeman and
                        the broker also assaulted him. The policeman was so badly assaulted that he
                        had to be taken to hospital. The case was heard on Friday and judgment was
                        given on Saturday last, the defendant being fined £10 for the assault on the
                        policeman ’in the execution of his duty, £1 for a simple assault on the
                        ghaffir, and costs.</p>
