                    <head>The Railway Report</head>
                    <p>e are pleased to learn that the recommendations of the Railway Commission are
                        beginning to take effect. We were able recently to announce that Major
                        Johnstone, the present chairman of the administration, is to be the first
                        general manager. He has oar good wishes in the task before him, and ’in its
                        performance his high qualifications and past experience should stand him in
                        good stead. We have, from the first, recognised the risks surrounding this
                        appointment, and we are glad the Government has decided to accept the least
                        of these. Major Johnstone’s appointment must be accepted as emphasising the
                        conclusion that the past defects in management were due to the system and
                        not to the individual. We do not know what further proofs of the same may'
                        be given, but it naturally occurs to ns that there will be vacancies
                        upstairs for either or both of the other members of the present board of
                        administration. Their great abilities and gear&amp;l qualifications
                        eminently fit them for such posts, but in ordinary business and on railways,
                        we have seen a manager practically deprived of his proper position by
                        predecessors in his office being similarly promoted. It must be clearly
                        recognized that the work to be done is that of the general manager—he must
                        not hark it if he will,— others must not do it if they can. Former partners
                        in the job mast, if necessary, abandon their policy, and no longer continue
                        in close touch with the work or the staff, or the whole change becomes a
                        farce. The present army of secretaries must be rather a difficulty.
                        Personality rather than utility often governs these very necessary or
                        absolutely superfluous positions. The requirements I of the feature are a
                        business secretary and . a private secretary to the general manager, and one
                        to attend to the important and continuous duties of the official meeting*.
                        The first of these is not to be found in Egypt nor easy to find anywhere. If
                        he is not good enough to “dry nurse” or to carry on in a temporary
                        emergency, some one else is wanted between him and the general manager. The
                        commissioners have said that six-wheeled coaches rid$</p>
                    <p>rough. Verb. tap. The fact has to be boldly fired that the shears have to be
                        applied not only to individuals, but to bodies of them, * h. accumulations
                        of time, ^and job*, and the r««t We trust that it is decided to treat all,
                        ant deserving cases in particular, with liberality We hope to see present
                        incumbent* used ups far as is compatible with the object in visa but beyond
                        these limits feelings must not gc Efficiency is to be the sole object and it
                        must be secured from the tea^, and not attempts! rom the heart. In this view
                        we symposia with Major Johnstone in his new position wit] bis old staff, but
                        no one will more readily se he duty before him, .and the danger of delta in
                        hesitations. He require* the support of all He has earned it, and the task
                        is not of his own making.</p>
                    <p>One word as to the cost of all this. .It must involve a big sum of money as
                        compensation The whole of it can be made and saved in year's working of the
                        railways. If we are correctly informed, the Audit and Account department has
                        been undertaken in the wriggle spirit Major Johnstone's bands have here ui
                        doubtedly been strengthened by the recommendation of a gentleman outside the
                        regular staff who is known* to possess the necessary experience, but this
                        part of the deed has been doming very thoroughly and justly done, without
                        fear, favor, or affection. May we be able to say I much, in due course, for
                        the rest of the world The railways are undoubtedly to have, we wish we could
                        say have got, — m audit not to be ignored, and the audit should now come
                        forward and justify its exist each by taking its share in the responsibility
                        for what is done or left undone in other depart meats. On the head of this
                        department devolve no light nor pleasant duty. May he, too, have • he
                        necessary courage to perform it. it is a open secret that the engineering
                        department i to have a new chief. Under the circumstances it is well. He has
                        to do or undo great and d»fi cult things. Evidently one of the first is t
                        gather his work together, then he must reduce and reorganise his staff, and
                        after this to “pressing needs” of the railways tau be attended to. The
                        Commission have clearly laid dow the duties of the chief civil engineer of a
                        railway, they have pointed to the excessive st perior staff, the changes
                        needed are bat to clear. We are decidedly of opinion that there deputies
                        (each with an assistant), of whom on would be in the head office, and
                        perhaps “bridge adviser,” is all the permanent stay necessary. The pay and
                        responsibilities ma well be large, compared with those which ex is
                        correspondence be reduced, and increased tin and attention given to work.”
                        With a lot new work some special assistance may be required for a time, and
                        evidently an expert i required to demarcate land, eta, bat the su plus
                        establishment will be large and mix01 The locomotive department is left in
                        the on sent hands. It has escaped criticism by the Commission, but this may
                        not mean this there is no room for internal reform. The on sent is the
                        opportunity for it, and whether i be taken up voluntarily or under pressure,
                        it i not to be lost We should be disappointed t learn that any persuasion is
                        needed.</p>
                    <p>Evidently the new arrangements are base upon undivided responsibility, and
                        beads &lt; departments must feel it, and are evidently t be paid
                        accordingly. But above all things, i the future their Fork must be theirs,
                        over they most have authority, with it they may not part, with other
                        people's work they have no right to interfere excepting on the appointed
                        occasions—the official meetings to which 11 will refer. May they realise
                        their powers 1 well as their responsibilities, and so person their duties
                        that the general manager may b as little worried from below as from above. V
                        have left to the last the all important earning department of the railways.
                        We have mad our recommendation as to this, and we adhere to it The able and
                        distinguished, officers 1 the head of the traffic department have 1 realise
                        that its proper conduct is a very sera thing to the country, is a big lesson
                        to lean and not to be picked up on these isolate railways. Disregard of the
                        fact means the penditnreof time and money in gaining e: perinea which can be
                        bought readily an (at any price) cheaply in comparison. In the and all
                        departments we have a right to expect that economy be combined with
                        efficiency, an that proper arrangements be made for and continuous
                        supervision. We have 1 above to the institution of official It is on these
                        occasions that the chief office! meet to discuss important problems, and3

                        kept in ban they are most useful means of deliberation,-otherwise they are

                    </p>
                    <p>The distance that divides the stage from the concert-hail is a subject on
                        which operatic artistes are apt to filler widely. While some assume a staid
                        and reserved deportment before a concert audienc, others' endeavour in a
                        certain measure to replace the platform by the “boarus,’ and to this latter
                        category belongs Mr. c. Nicolaou, whose concert last night at the New
                        Kuedivial Hotel was very well at timed. We are lar from considering that a
                        display ot Mr. Nieoiaou's histrionic was aecia when interpreting what, with
                        a few exceptions,</p>
                    <p>" was an operatic programme ; but it must be borne in mind that, in a
                        concert, such talent is of secondary importance and must not be allowed to
                        serve as a blind to the rendering ol music jjtr >Y. Mr. Nicolaou is the
                        possessor ol a tine poweilul voice,capable of tilling any opera house. He
                        cannot theretore but have undergone some dilliculty in reducing it to the
                        compass ol a comparatively small concert-room, and tbis caused us to teel
                        that we were deprived ot appreciating bis accomplishments to their tull
                        extent. Ills programme, as we have said, was largely operatic, and opened
                        with a "Graud Air,” Irom Verdi s ihn Carlost ib which he was satisfactory,
                        hut if anyUiiug insuthciently melodious. His reudenug of FalstalFs
                        “Air’lrumThomas’s Midsummer Sight's Dream was vigorous though a trifle hard.
                        The Drinking Bong from Bizet s Fair Jlaid of Perth showed Mr. Nicolaou to
                        lar better advantage and was a spirited performance. Tbis was followed by
                        thebeuuliful “Stances a JLakunT ol Delibes, in which he struck us a«
                        somewhat unconvincing. Mr. Nicolaou was decidedly at his best in his
                        interpretation of Handel’s “War Bong" from the oratorio founded ou Dryden’s
                        “Alex andor’s Feast.” Here his commanding bau- tono luund tto lull scope,
                        while his bass notes were truly excellent, and he may be said to have well
                        lulhlled P. Gevaert’s dicta*(inserted iu the progtamme) as to the vocal
                        requirements for the production of this work. Mr. Nico- laou’s manner of
                        singing the “Ballata del Pischio” from Boito’s Mejistofele was properly
                        gruesome, while Mepbisiophelea’Bcreuade Irom Gounod's Faust was given with
                        much eclat. Iu the ‘ Air’’ from the Suets de Figaro of Mozart, he was less
                        happy, but thoroughly captivated the bulk of his audience by stirring their
                        national spirits with several Greek melodies.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Nicolaou was assisted in his concert by the violin solos of Mr.
                        Afeudoulis, who was ably accompanuied by Mmo. Foscolo; be played with great
                        ease aud correctness, if somewhat lacking in verve and sentiment. The “Airs
                        Hougrois” ol Tinudelli were well given ; but of Tschaikowsky’s ditficult
                        “Canzonetta" he proved himself thoroughly master and quite carried aw*y his
                        audience. In Neruda’s “Berceuse Blave”a wanton sympathy was noticeable, but
                        the performance left otherwise nothing to be desired. Mr. Felix’s pianoforte
                        contribution* were, though performed with dash, not entirely to "concert
                        pitch,"</p>

                        other parts of Egypt, they think that this electro-pueumatic signalling can
                        hardly be necessary.</p>

                    <p>I agree with the writer of “Under the Mosquito Net,” that this country is
                        advancing in every way aud that everybody can see the difference between
                        Egypt of thirty years ago and Egypt of to-day. The industrious peasant is
                        quite safe now and is working his lands very successfully. But I would ssk
                        him to write about backshish and drink, which are checking the development
                        and prosperity of the country. The district employes are continually taking
                        backshish from the peasants. Their chiefs of course know this, but cannot
                        prove it, because the others take great precautions to cover their
                        misdeeds.</p>

                            <p>The events were interesting and in many cases extremely amusing, the
                                hat-trimming and house-keeping competitions being perhaps the best.
                                The Affinity Stakes were easily wou by Capt the Hon. A. Stanley and
                                Miss Hurley from 10 other competitors, while the D&amp;k Race Was a
                                hollow victory for Mr. Langley. The hat-trimming competition was
                                greatly enjoyed, the incogruity of the hats, —and very pretty many
                                oj them were—held on by male riders going at full gallop being quite
                                comic. The House-keeping Stakes revealed a sad absence of the higher
                                ma^uematios among the ladies, who mostly succumbed to the fatal
                                problem of the “herring and &amp; half that cost 1} piastres,” aud
                                of whom oue only gave her companion a correct answer. The last event
                                was very interesting, Capt and Mrs. Bay ley and the Hon. A. Stanley,
                                with Mins Hurloy, giving a very good display of riding.</p>

                            <item>Morice winning from Mr. E. P. Blenoowe after a capital game. Both
                                players were troubled throughout by the strong glare and the
                                keenness of the ““greens.” The game opened cautiously, play being
                                unexoitiug for the first 2 holes. A fine iron shot out of a dusty
                                lie enabled Morice to claim the lead at the 3rd hole. This he
                                quickly iucreased, winning’ the 5th and 6th by correct play,
                                Bleocowe’s tee shots running wild At the 7th both drove well over
                                the rails, but Morice was all at sea in the short game and lost the
                                hole comfortably. The 8ih was halved by untidy golf; Blencowe
                                overran his pitch at the 9th aud Morice turned 3 up. He increased
                                his lead to 4 up at the 10th, where he rattled iu a fine put for 3.
                                A poor tee shot at the next hole found Morice in the sand, and
                                Blencowe, making no mistake, reduced the lead to 3. Morice hit a big
                                shot off the 12th tee and went ahead again, and after correct 4*s at
                                the 13th, the match ended on the 14th green, where Morice found his
                                iron shot within 6 ft. of the hole with "2 for the cup.”</item>

                    <p>Price Aziz Pasha Hassau has returned to Alexandria from Cairo.</p>
                    <p>Sir F. R Wingate Pasha, Governor General of the Sudan, is expected at Cairo
                        on Monday from Suakin.</p>
                    <p>Our Luxor Correspondent states that the ex-Empress Engeuie has arrived there
                        on her way back from Khartoum, and will stay at Luxor for a few days before
                        returning to Casio.</p>
                    <p>An interesting story is told by "M.A.P.” of the last visit of the Empress to
                        Egypt:— When she last visited Cairo she was in the enjoy mentally that the
                        world could give, beauty of a rare type, admired by ail, a happy wife, a
                        proud mother, a throne which she gracefully' occupied. It was at Cairo that
                        she heard of a celebrated Dervish, and determined to consult him. Thickly
                        veiled and diqpieed, she went, accompanied by oue ol her ladies in
                        attendance, to see him. On entering his abode the Dervish rose, made a low
                        obeisance, and addressed her thus : “Weloome, you are thrice welcome’ to my
                        humble dwelling, oh, Effipress I* Eugenie, vexed and astonished, replied,
                        "How do you know that I am an Empress, and who told you I was coming here V’
                        The Dervish answered: “The stars and Mohamed know everything. I knew since
                        your arrival in Egypt that you would come to ‘ me, and L have patiently
                        waited every night, for afterwards I am commanded by Allah to make my last
                        journey to Mecoa and die.”</p>
                    <p>The Empress, very frightened, was getting up to leave, for she began to fear
                        this mysterious man, but, summoning courage, she said, in a haughty tone:
                        "It is true that I am * the Empress, though no one knows it but my
                        attendant; tell me what you can'of my future, tell me all, and tell me
                        truly,” at the same time offering him her hand, and showing him the palm to
                        examine ; but the old seer never touched her jewelled fingers. Raising
                        himself to his full height, and dropping his staff, he held his hand aloft
                        as in invocation to Allah. Looking down piteously on the dark figure of the
                        Empress, he murmured slowly, “There is no God but God and Mohamed is His
                        Prophet At yourbirth the stars foretold for you great powe and greater
                        sorrow, for your happiness will only be temporary, but your sorrow will last
                        for ever. You are doomed to lose your throne, your husband, and your son,
                        and, wander alone through the world like a lost star." ,</p>
                    <p>““These events will not happen' at once, for the blow would kill you. To ypu
                        as an Empress it will not be permitted to enter the Land of your husband or
                        son, except by permission of those you despise. You will have to seek a home
                        with strangers, and the dress of woe will never leave your form; your jewels
                        will be but tear drops. I have said.” He had scarcely ceased speaking when
                        the Empress, terrified and angry, threw at his feet a purse of gold, crying
                        out: “You base impostor, take the fruit and reward ot your liea and let me
                        out of your den.’’Then, rushing hurriedly out, she ran swiftly away. This
                        strange and unhappy prediction was made n 1869 ; how literally it has been
                        fulfilled, events have proved.</p>

                                                <p>There is a whisper going round that the reduction

                                                  will be emphasised by the deduction ot Captain

                    <p>Sir,— 1 think that you expect a little too much from our visitors. No doubt
                        those in «ympathy with the objects of the society, and able to subscribe
                        liberally to its funds, make heir contributions at home, and it is hardly to
                        he expected that, in arranging their holiday •>ure, they will take into
                        account subscriptions *» philanthropic objects, in providing the ne pessary
                        funds for their trip to this country.</p>
                    <p>But there is a way in which they may be eached, and I am surprised that it is
                        not mop- reely adopted by the committee of the society in Cairo. Our
                        visitors are hero for pleasure. »nd will no doubt spend their money all tin*
                        •iorc freely if to pleasure can bo added tin- ending thatin enjoying
                        themselvestheyarehelp ng to do good. It is not too late even this sea on to
                        get up one or two entertainments, the >p«fits of which should be given to
                        the S.P.C.A iVould not the company, for instance, who «re riving such an
                        excellent representation ot “The 'irates of Penzance” arrange another
                        perform uce for fo excellent an object ? Probably, if pproached, they would
                        willingly do so.</p>
                    <p>The letter of your correspondent “S.P.C.A. •f A.” has just come under my
                        notice, and I • m surprised to find on enquiry that there s no central
                        committee of the S.P.C.A. actine or the whole of Egypt It seems to me that
                        &lt;uch a central body is absolutely necessary or the proper carrying out of
                        such work as thi- n Egypt Branch committees in all impor tant centres by aU
                        means, but how can the work be thoroughly and efficiently done with nit a
                        central body who are able to provide for the enforcement of the law in every
                        district throughout the country I I fail to see how i-oMted local action,
                        dependent entirely upon mrely voluntary effort on the part of indivi Inals,
                        can be made really efficient, or covei -he whole of the ground that requires
                        atten ion, and most certainly tho advantages that he Cairo committee enjoy

                        community at large.—Iam, etc.,</p>
                    <p>At'ihe annual meeting of the general committee of the Cairo S.P.C.A., held in
                        March. 1904, it was decided that an official request in tho name of
                        thecommittee should be addressed to the Ministry of the Interior, to the
                        eftW that instructions should be issued to the mon- dire, forbidding tho
                        fellaheen to use, when ploughing vifh horses or donkeys, yokes of tho kind
                        employed for buffaloes.</p>
                    <p>The committee have sustained a serious loss in the death of Tigrane Pasha,
                        who took a great interest in the work of the sooiety. Ti grane Pasha was
                        always present at the annual general meetings, and his advice and sympathy
                        were of material assistance in furthering the objects of the society, of
                        which he was such a prominent member.</p>
                    <p>(To be continued).</p>
                    <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                    <p>Dear Sir,—After reading your article, in yesterday’s “Gazette,” on the
                        S.P.C.A., it struck me it would be an excellent plan if boxes for collection
                        were put in each hotel. At present there is simply an open list on
                        notice-board at the hotels requesting donations from visitors, but without
                        stating where such donations can be paid. As a largo number of visitors to
                        this country have only a limited me for sight-seeing, naturally they
                        h&amp;vo no time to spare in making enquiries as to whom donations could be
                        paid, and this, much to the detriment of tho S.P.C.A. fund. By having boxes,
                        with a short uoticq, in promiuent posi tions asking for assistance for the
                        society, 1 feel sure many visitors would be only too happy to drop in small
                        sums for the fnnd, which at the end of season would produce a con. siderable
                        amount for such a deserving society as the S.P.C.A. I would suggest the
                        collecting box be made with opening large enough for letters, as iftany
                        people might prefer enclosing cheque or paper money.—Youre faithfully,</p>
                    <p>P. Black.</p>
                    <p>Cairo, March 10.</p>
                    <p>To the Editor of- the “Eoyptian Gazette.”</p>

                    <p>Amongst the product* of the Sudan which have been looked iorward to as likely
                        to prove of the greatest commercial importance are “rubbers, the demand for
                        which iu the Euro- -p°an market is always on the increase, and especially
                        for those of superior qu-Uity. In Anglo-Egyptian Africa, '"as well as in
                        British Africa, these are furnished, not as in Brazil, Central America, and
                        certain puts of India,by Urge trees, but, as in Milaya, by creeping stout
                        stemmed shrubs, with ornamental llowers and fruit, which mount to the summit
                        of the highest trees, and belong to the natural order “Apocynacea*.” There
                        appear to be at least two or threev of these rubber-!umishing creepers in
                        theSudan, and especially one known to the natives of the Bahr-el-Ghazal
                        Province as “odiloh” (1), but of which the botanical name has not been
                        promulgated ; this produces rubber of a very superior quality. The best of
                        these plants belong to the genus “Lindolphia” ; but little progress has yet
                        been made in the development of the ipdustry, owing to the absence of
                        suitable machinery' for extracting the rubber, and to the dirty processes as
                        yet in vogue for preparing it, which prevent its acceptance in the E6ropean
                        market except at a very Jow rate.</p>
                    <p>We now learn that the Congo Administra tion has succeeded in bringing into
                        the market a species of Landolphia as yet scientifically unnamed ; but which
                        is known familiarly as “Grass rubber/' and has already brought a small
                        fortune to the treasury of the King of the Belgians. From a paper recently
                        read before the Liunean »Society by Mr. Thomas Christy, of the fanSous firm
                        of T. Christy and Co., commercial druggists, London, it appears that this
                        plant is a low growing one-which has the property of throwing ont long
                        shoots, or roots, when only a few feet from the ground, ami it is those
                        roots which furnish the rubber ; it is mostly found amongst grass which has
                        sprung up in a forest clearing after a fire— hence its popular name. The
                        roots contain a white fibrous mass which is, c unpamtively, dry and elastic,
                        and replaces the ordinary milky sap.</p>
                    <p>By bruiring with a machine the skin of these roots, with great care so as not
                        to break up the fibre, the latter is easily separated and rolled into boll*
                        having the appearance of boiug male ^of thick tape The roots contain about
                        18 % of pure rubber fetching from 3s. 9d. to 4a. per lb. and immense
                        quantities from the Congo h ivo already been .disposed of at these prices.
                        This species of rubber plant is abundant in British Africa, and especially
                        in Rhodesia, where it has hitherto beep ignorantly ueglected, but the
                        trading companies, having become suddenly alive to its commercial
                        importance, are now vying with one another in promoting its development Many
                        hundreds of young plants grown from semi have been successfully started in
                        Ceylon. Let us hope that the Sudan Government will lose no time in a search
                        for tho “grais rubber,” and iu obtaining its share in th^ immense profits
                        now beiug realised with it by the Congo Government.*</p>

                    <p>P.S.—Should the concentrationofthe rubber sap into fibre, in the shoots or
                        roots of the Congo plant turn out to be due to the effect of the destructive
                        and wasteful forest fires so frequent in tropical Africa, which thus develop
                        a new habit in life to this species of “Landolphia/’ wo may indeed say,

                    <p>The following figures showing the approzimate increase of trade in the Nahud
                        in the Kordofan Providence may be of interest. Previous to 1903, the returns
                        are not sufficently accurate to be of value, though they were first
                        commenced towards the end of 1901.</p>
                    <p>In the case of Budaa, i.e., cottons, suksuk, sugar &amp;c., the values are
                        those given on the passes. The values for ivory, feathers, &amp;c. are Nuhud
                        values given by merchants there, the wights are taken from the passes issued
                        there. inc all cases, therefore, neither values nor weights are likely to be
                        excessive. </p>
                    <p>The ivory comes from Dar Fertit* Dar Jangé, and small quantities from Darfur
                        ; feathers from Dar Hmnar and Darfur ; Rhino from Dar Fertit ; tobacco all
                        from Darfur, tho cattle from Dor Jangé and Darfur.</p>
                    <p>The decrease in cattle in 1904 is chiefly due to the b id prices at Omdurman.
                        The above figures do not include cattle sent to Dar Jangé, •f which no

                    <p>The merchants anticipate a large increase this year in ivory and some
                        increase in feathers ind cattle, but there will be a largo decrease in
                        tobacco due to tho partial if not complete failure of the now crop in Darfur

                    <head>EGYPT'S IMPORTS OF BUILDING MATERIAL</head>
                    <head>BY STANLEY DORLING.</head>
                    <p>Broadly reviewing this subject, one is, in spite of the relative
                        insignificance of British imports, perhaps less ready than over to
                        sympathise with the Home Manufacturer. Statistics for piat years show a
                        singular scarcity of British imports in connection with the building trade.
                        On the other hand, the increase in Continental importations is particularly
                        conspicuous. If one listens to any exponent of Protectionist views, one
                        hears, that with an opeu field, British trade holds its own. Egypt has no
                        preferential tariff, yet in one item only in connection with this trado,
                        namely sanitary goods, does Great Britain heather Continental neighbours.
                        Steel joists, builders’ ironmongery, Portland cement, tiles, (both roofing
                        and flooring;, plumbing material, glass ; one could almost enumerate the
                        builders’ entire requirements, aud still not find a British production. The
                        reason is not far to seek ; the stock of British manufactured builder’s
                        goods in this oountry is almost nil. Yet in many cases, more particularly in
                        ironmongery, the ^British article, when obtained either direct from the
                        makers, or through London buyers, is better and in many instances cheaper
                        than its American or Continental equivalent. One would naturally assume
                        that, if this be the case, British goods must hold their own or even surpass
                        all competitors. This leads us to consider in whose hunds is the building
                        trade in this country f Who are the consumers of building material ! On
                        every hand one sees buildings in progress, but for one large structure in
                        tho hands of a large firm, there are a dozen small buildings in the hands of
                        small firms. We may, for the moment, grant that tho large contractor kuows
                        where to get the best and cheapest goods ; every w. ek his London and
                        Continental buyers inform him as to relative prices. But take the enormous
                        number of small firms, several Italian, the majority native ; &amp;s their
                        requirements crop up, it is to the local vendor they raws* go. This brings
                        us back to the qu istion of st »cks in the hands of the lo al vendors.
                        Whatever his «tuck of goods may be, they certainly are not British. Once
                        more then we are lod to the old recommendation go often quoted by this
                        Chamber, to British manufacturers, namely, seud capable travellers, push the
                        Briti-h article. In many branches of the trade, were this d >ne, a large
                        amount of businass could be brought to Great Britain. But to go a step
                        further, it eau un hesitatingly be stated that almost tho entire trade of
                        builders’ ironmonger)- could be captur</p>

                    <p>It does not lie within the scope of this short article to give details of
                        requirements, they need careful study on the spot by technical inen.
                        Sufficient to state that conditions are necessarily widely different from
                        those at home The Marseilles productions,- roofing tileq h »’l *w bricks,'
                        «üfcc., enjoy almost a mono i*o!y ii Egypt, suffering only &lt;nme slight
                        com- !*etition from Italy. The English iile or slate is never .«C30 here.
                        Marseilles* tiles delivered on Wf.rks in Alexandria run £5 per thousand. Th
                        ir larger size, however, gives great covering &lt;sapaci:y, a square metre
                        consisting of 16 tiles, which runs out at 15/3 per square (100 ft). It is
                        possible British tile , makers may get down to this price. Moreover, with
                        theft superior and lighter article as compared with the French production,
                        the English tile would allow a roof of lighter scantling to be conducted.
                        This would highly recommend them to architects in a country like Egypt,
                        where timber is dear. English Portland cement is largely imported and used
                        by builders, but a cheap quick-setting quality would always find a market.
                        Flooring tiles are in great demand in E?yptv which is at present met bÿ
                        local manufacturers, who supply a cheap pressed cement tile. The arficle is
                        most inferior, bat it is made .to meet the requirements and sells widely.
                        Rolled steel girders of British make are never seen here. On this subject
                        itis impossible to say anything, but rdther to ask tho managers of British
                        ^rolling mil!» why the British irirders should be 65 % dearer than their
                        Belgian or German fellows of similar section. 'The old reply, of superior
                        quMity counts for nothing, the Continental production is good enough, and
                        consequently sells. Inclosing these few remarks one might perhaps draw’the
                        ntteutio’i of English producers to the fact that of all trades probab'y none
                        has shared in such a large degree the phenomeual prosperity of Egypt during
                        tho last two years as has the building trade. But be that os it may, only
                        those io the trade know how keen is competition, and how the necessity for
                        purchasing the cheapest material is forced on the builders. Hence if home
                        markets arc to supply. this trade, the urgency of producing cheap suitable
                        material cannot be too clearly impressed on those desirous of making a bid
                        for Egyptian business. It can safely be said, that Egypt having once started
                        on her career of prosperity, her progress will not be stationary Each year
                        will show her in the ascendant. Her extraordinary natural resources alone
                        are a guarantee. Therefore a little time and money spent by English
                        producers catering for builders’ requirements here will, we feel sure, find
                        an ample return in the future.</p>

                        looks as if then were a good deal of speculation in the share of the
                        National Bank of Egypt, for as we wnt they are at 27 £ and the other day
                        they wer over 28. This seems an exaggerated price for security receiving?

                        progress will be steady. A the same, we venture to think that 27£ is a
                        extravagant price for an 8 per cent, share A we have already stated, the

                        about the less we can understand. We may devote a lifetime to aualysiug and

                        facts of the most vital importance to the wellbeing of the community, but

                        and all is summed up much in the same way as in the passage whicli concludes
                        Herbert Spencer’s àutvbiography, in which he refers to “—the insoluble
                        questions concerning our owu fate : the evidence seeming so strong that the
                        relations of mind and nervous structure are such that the cessatiou ot the
                        one accompanies the dissolution of the other, while, simultaneously, comes
                        the thought so strange, aud so diÛiuult to realise, that with death there
                        lapses both the consciousness of existence aud the couscious- ness.of having

                        Herbert Spencer confessed his inability to solve the great questiou, not so
                        much of future life as of the life around us, and there are inauy pas>ages
                        in the works of Huxley, Darwin, and other great scientific authorities, that
                        prove that they too recognise as fully as Spencer the impossibility of

                    <p>At the meeting of the Associated Chambers of Commerce held in London last
                        week, Sir Charles Palmer, of Newcastle, brought up the question of the
                        management of the Sue/. Canal and the rates charged for trading steamers. He
                        urged that the managing committee in London ought not to be a self-appointed
                        one, and moved a resolution that the owners of all classes of British
                        shipping 'making use of the canal should be adequately represented on the
                        committee. He said that with the conclusion of the war in the Par East there
                        would be a great development of trado with the East, and the canal would
                        become a great factor to our commercial prosperity. He urged that the Board

                    <head> THE MECCA PILGRIMAGE</head>
                    <p>A graphic, vivacious, accurate, and entertaining account of a pilgrimage to
                        Mecca by Hadji Khan in 1902 has lately been pu blished. Several travellers
                        have already given us descriptions of this Mohamedan function, as well as of
                        the Ka’bab, the sacred shrine of Mecca, but Hiulji Khan, being by birth an
                        Islamite, had more opportunity of observing his co-religionists than men of
                        other denominations who go tho re disguised, and require to be ou their
                        guard to escape detection, while his avowed aguostioism in the matter of
                        belief prevented superstition blindiug his eyes. What he saW’ aud what he
                        heard make one of the most enlightening and captivating books about the East
                        ever written. He does not think much of the highly-paid clergy who have
                        charge of the Ka’bah, for they Are allowing the place to fall into ruin,
                        while they pocket the revenues that ought to be used for its repair; but ho
                        pays just tribute to the enthusiasm of the rank and file of Islamism.While
                        he was passing through the sacred shrine this feeling got the better even of
                        his own agnosticism, and the song, ‘Labbaik Allahomma Labbaik,” describing
                        the oneness of the Almighty, coming from thousands of throats, brought a
                        feeling of awe upon him, and compelled him instinctively to join in its
                        chorus, while, as he says, he rubbed his nose on the floor. Tho fountain of
                        Zem zem is described as “neither sweet nor bitter, neither fresh nor salt,
                        neither scented nor stinking, but appears to be a mixture of all these
                        qualities, from which it would seem that it would make the fortune of any
                        syndicate* of speculators who could get hold of the place to exploit as a
                        chalybeate spriug. Slavery still exists in Arabia, and it is interesting to
                        learn that a woman, if she be young, and “good to behold," costs from £20 to
                        £50, while a man can be got at prices ranging from £15 up to £40.</p>

                    <p>PROBABLY every case of consumption begins with a cold. </p>
                    <p>Consumption is generally classed as a hereditary disease, but consumption is
                        not hereditary. </p>
                    <p>A constitutional weakness is inherited which renders one liable to
                        consumption. </p>
                    <p>Even people who have strong lungs may acquire consumption from a cold. </p>

                    <p>“I have been a user of Peruna for the last twelve years and can truthfully
                        say that there is no better medicine on earth. </p>
                    <p>“A SURE PREVENTATIVE." </p>
                    <p>“With me it is a sure preventative for colds and many other ills. In my home
                        can always be found a bottle of Peruna. Two or three times a year I am
                        troubled with my throat. </p>
                    <p>"I always had to have the services of my physician two or three times in each
                        case. </p>
                    <p>"Although a user of Peruna, I never thought of taking it for my throat until
                        about two years ago.</p>
                    <p> "I tried Peruna to check it, and to my great delight I was not troubled with
                        the smothered and choked feeling and never have since. </p>
                    <p>"I can check it every time with Peruna. </p>

                        writes: </p>
                    <p>"I have been annoyed with a cough for years. </p>
                    <p>"Often it was so bad that I could not sleep half the night. Many people
                        thought I had consumption.</p>
                    <p>CONSUMPTION WAS FEARED.</p>
                    <p>"A woman recommended Peruna to me two years ago. I began to take Peruna and
                        now I am perfectly free from a cough, </p>
                    <p>"I am glad to say that Peruna cured me entirely, I take Peruna occasionally
                        when I do not feel well and I also give it to my children. </p>
                    <p>“Peruna is the best medicine for coughs and colds. I have told many people
                        how much Peruna has helped me.” </p>
                    <p>A neglected cold is a well-worn path to consumption. </p>
                    <p>Many a person catches cold and pays no attention to it. </p>
                    <p>He scarcely recovers from the first cold when he takes the second.</p>
                    <p>Still he gives it no heed, and possibly takes another cold, and so on. </p>
                    <p>He doses himself with bromides, quinine and various expectorants. </p>
                    <p>His case is catarrh, at this stage, and his case should be treated as
                        catarrh. </p>
                    <p>A common cold is acute catarrh. </p>
                    <p>Finally, if the cold is allowed to continue, it becomes chronic catarrh. </p>
                    <p>Mrs, Frances Wilson, 82 Nelson street, Clinton, Mass., writes: </p>
                    <p>“Had you seen me at the time of my illness and now, you would not wonder that
                        1 take delight in sounding the praises of Peruna. </p>
                    <p>“My ailment was a severe cold which attacked the bronchial tubes and lungs. </p>
                    <p>“I followed your special directions and after using six bottles of Peruna I
                        was on my feet again.</p>
                    <p>“I think Peruna a wonderful medicine." </p>
                    <p>All colds, coughs, bronchitis, laryngtis and tonsilitis should be treated as
                        catarrh, as they are in reality catarrh. </p>
                    <p>The success of Peruna in relieving these cases entirely depends upon the fact
                        that Peruna is a catarrh remedy. </p>

                    <p>de XEgyptian Gazette</p>
                    <p>Permettezmoi d’accouipagner de quelques observations l'entrefilet paru dans
                        votre estimable Journal en date du 6 courant et signé Del toner.</p>
                    <p>Il faut avant tout coustiter, pour l’honneur de la vérité, que le jour même
                        (15 Mai 1901,) où grâce à l’amabilité de M. le Professeur Schweinfurth, le
                        fait que l’on est en train de procéder à des démolitions dans le fort Kait
                        bey de votre ville, a été porté à la connaissance du Comité, celui-ci par la
                        voix de son Président a demandé au Ministère de la Querre de faire surseoir
                        à la démolition. Ce qui fut fait Ensuite un accord est intervenu entre les
                        doux Administrations pour les travaux à exécuter, bien entendu, en excluant
                        du programme tout travail de démolition.</p>
                    <p>Il était certes très regrettable de voir tomber sous la pioche des
                        démolisseurs le fort Kait bey qui est le. seul complet et de valeur
                        historique it Alexandrie, et le Comité n’a pas moins regretté de n’avoir pu
                        iutervenir eu sa faveur que lorsque la silhouette si pittoresque do ce fort
                        a été terriblement endommagée.</p>
                    <p>Sur co poiut nous partageons les regrets exprimés par Mi Deltaner, le
                        signataire de l’article, mais nous sommes loin d’être de sou avis en ce qui
                        concerne la Tour dite des Romains.</p>
                    <p>Nous ne comprenons pas pouVquoi en défendant si chaleureusement le fort Kait
                        bey, ou peut montrer tant d’iudiffércuce, pour ne pas dire autro chose, à
                        l’égard de la Tour de Missal lah.</p>
                    <p>Cette tour qui est bien une œuvre de l’art arabe et qui représente le dernier
                        vestige des travaux do fortification de la ville d’Alexandrie du coté de la
                        mer, mérite l’iotérêt du public et toute la protection du Comité. Aussi
                        n’a-t-il jamais été question de la reconstruire mais tout bounemeut de la
                        consolider par une simple maçonnerie afin de la conserver à l’état oh elle
                        se trouve.</p>
                    <p>Si cette tour se trouvait au Caire, qui est beaucoup plu» riche qu’Alexaudrie
                        eu monuments arabes, on n’aurait jamais songé à sa démolition. D'ailleurs
                        d’après une entente intervenue entre le Comité et Tex-Administrateur de la
                        Municipalité d’Alexandrie, la Tour de Miasallah se trouvera un jour placée
                        dans l’un des angles d’un square que l’on doit prochainement créer dans son
                        voisinage, et nous sommes sûre que ce point de la ville ne fera qu’y
                        gagner.</p>
                    <p>Le sort de cette modeste tour est celui de bien d’autres monumonts de tous
                        pays, où après s’être acharné à vouloir les démolir, on finit par les
                        laisser subsister et par la suite on est très heureux de les avoir cou
                        -ervés.</p>
                    <p>Espérons que ce sera encore là le cas de la Tour de Missallah dite des
                        Romains.</p>
