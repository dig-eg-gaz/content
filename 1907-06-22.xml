                    <p>Trains run alongside the steamers on the quay, and passengers can be conveyed
                        to Famagusta, Nicosia, Morphou and intermediate stations. Good hotel
                        accommodation for tourists is provided at Famagusta, at the Savoy Hotel (Mr.
                        Najem Houry proprietor). Olympus Hotel, Mount Troodos, 6000 ft. above the
                        sea. Magnificent Scenery. Perfect climate. Season May to end of October. For
                        information apply to Mr. Najem Houry, Managing Director of Cyprus Hotel Co.,
                        Army Contractor, Limassol, Cyprus. There is a good carriage road from Kopia
                        (on Railway) to Troodos. At Famagusta may be seen the fine old Latin
                        Cathedral (now a mosque) begun in 1300 and finished in 1312, together with
                        other ancient ruins and the Venetian fortifications, the finest in the
                        world. Also the tower or palace, the scene of "Othello'' and of Ford's
                        "Lover's Melancholy.'' The climate of Cyprus in the winter months is
                        delightful and the Island will well repay a visit.</p>

                    <head>MATTERS IN MACEDONIA</head>
                    <p>"If the whole duty of the British public towards Macedonia were to know the
                        worst, it would have no reason to complain of the inaction of the Foreign
                        Office. In the new Turkish Blue Books," says Mr. H.N. Brailsford in the
                        "Daily News," "we have official pessimism in three volumes, accurate,
                        etailed, monotonous. But a diagram with graphs and curves, setting forth the
                        fluctuation month by month in the number of deaths by violence would tell us
                        all we need to know about the state of Macedonia.</p>
                    <p>"The total impression is one of absolute anarchy, recklessness, and cruelty,
                        and it is with difficulty that one remembers that all this is passing in a
                        corner of Europe not quite four days' journey from London, under the eyes of
                        European consuls and European officers, mid an epoch of reform.</p>
                    <p>"Have the European officers, then, who for three years have been
                        'reorganising' the gendarmerie, done nothing to make the life of the
                        Macedonian peasant secure? It is clear that they really have achieved a
                        great deal. The school for gerdarmes has been a brilliant success, and
                        everywhere the new force, regularly paid, well trained, and subject to some
                        sort of discipline, has ceased at least to be a scourge to the country. If
                        there were no bands at large it might even be strong enough to secure
                        relative tranquillity. But the European officers do not commant it; it can
                        be set in motion only by the Turkish functionaries. Their attitude is
                        described in a formal protest from the six Powers as one of continual
                        opposition to the authority of General Degiorgis, to the activity of the
                        foreign officers, and the execution of the reforms.</p>
                    <p>"Throughout these three volumes there is not one single dispatch which
                        suggests that Sir Edward Grey is prepared to take any initiative whatever on
                        behalf of any large or constructive reform. We do, indeed, fid him declaring
                        in January of this year that the reports from Macedonia have been very
                        unsatisfactory... it will be necessary to do something to improve matters
                        this year. Lord Lansdowne led the concert. Sir Edward Grey is content to
                        promise Austria and Russia 'our strong support to any effective proposals
                        for reform.' Lord Lansdowne used to insist strenuously that the two
                        Conservation Empires are not in any exclusive sense 'the interested Powers.'
                        From that position England has apparently receded. </p>
                    <p>"No Foreign Minister in our time has ever enjoyed such general confidence or
                        such worldwide power. He commands a vast majority in Parliament, and wields
                        the whole force of a great network of ententes and alliances abroad. With
                        such opportunities we owe to humanity the obligatin to attempt some
                        disinterested work for a suffering people, some resolute effort to check
                        oppression and terminate massacre.</p>
                    <p>"An international military occupation of a very few debatable districts, the
                        grant of executive powers to the gendarmerie officers, the evolution of the
                        Financial Commission into a supreme European Board of Control, with full
                        powers to command and to punish – any one of these measures would secure the
                        peace of Macedonia in a few weeks."</p>

                        <p>A fresh charge was brought at the British Consulate, Alexandria, against
                            Herbert Clayton, of sterling a toilet case and a purse from Laffargue,
                            of Rond Point Suares, Cairo. Clayton confessed to the truth of these new
                            offences. It appears he went to the shops and ordered a silver toilet
                            case for his wife, giving a cheque. The case was taken from the shop by
                            Clayton, who returned next day and said that it did not please his wife.
                            He then selected a silver gilted purse of the value of 6 pounds and
                            received another 6 pounds as balance of 12 pound for the toilet case
                            which he told the shopkeeper wouldbe sent back later on. He now had 9
                            pound, a toilet case, and a purse. The cheque was not met and the
                            address was a fictitious one. The accused was committed on these fresh
                            charges, which will be reported to the Supreme Consular Court. </p>

                    <p>CASSA IN COURT</p>
                    <p>Although some hopes have been inspired by the fact that Sir Ernest Cassel is
                        taking a great interest in the diffiulties connected with the Cassa, and is
                        to meet a director of the Union Bank in London to discuss the situation, it
                        must be borne in mind that once the doors of the bank have been closer! the
                        difficulties of the task before the would-be organisers has now . immensely
                        increased and it would therefore he unwise to indulge in optimistic hopes as
                        to the outlook.</p>
                    <p>We have received the following telegram from London to-day from our
                        correspondent :</p>
                    <p>I have had an interview with Sir Ernest Cassel, who informed me that one of
                        the administrators of the Union Bank of Vienna has already arrived in London
                        in order to confer with him and others with a view to coming to an
                        arrangement on the subject of the affairs of the Cassa diSconto e di
                        Rispannio.</p>
                    <p>This morning at the Mixed Courts at Alexandria aspecial sitting was held of
                        the Tribunal ties Référés, to consider the application of the Union Bank at
                        Vienna re the Cassa di Sconto e di Rispannio for the appointment of a
                        "séquestre judiciaire." The Union Bank prochose that the Deutsche Orient
                        Bank should be appointed with the power of taking possession of the shares,
                        which had been pledged to the Union Bank in consideration of five and half
                        millions of francs advanced by that bank. The Court was presided over by
                        Justice Heggen The Union Bank were represented by Maîtres Sheridan and
                        Delapommeraye The Cassa was represented by Maîtres Guidotti and Mereinier.
                        The hearing lasted from 10 a.in. to 12.15 p.m.</p>
                    <p>The Cassa objects to the nomination of a "séquestre judiciaire" and alleges
                        that its board of direçtore have to consider the interests of all the
                        creditors now that payment has been suspended and that it would he wrong to
                        withdraw a portion ot the assets to the detriment of the bulk of the
                        creditors for the benefit of the Union Bank alone. The Cassa considers the
                        pledge as null as the Union Bank has left in the hands of its creditors, the
                        Cassa, the objects given as a guarantee of the pledge</p>
                    <p>The advocates of the Union Bank declared that the application tor a
                        "séquestre judiciaire" was .made in the hopes of saving the assets that
                        remain. The advocates representing the Cassa declare that the Union Bank had
                        no right to considered as a privileged credit, hut should take its position
                        among the ranks of the other creditors.</p>
                    <p>The court will pronounce judgment tomorrow.</p>

                        yesterday went on in the usual manner, and they request us to state that
                        there was no run on their bank, as announced by Cairo correspondent in our
                        issue of yesterday's date. Their bank has no business connection whatsoever
                        with the Cassa li, Sconto o di Rispannio and does not possess a single share
                        of that company. We regret that we were misinformed and the information must

                        faith must been have imposed upon.</p>
                    <p>The tactics of Mustapha Pasha Kamel ate to load his ignorant readers to
                        belieye that Lord Cromer is responsible for the present financial crisis.
                        The following example of this policy is from "Al Lewa" : —</p>
                    <p>One of the, results of the present financial crisis or of the policy of Lord
                        Cromer which encouraged speculations on the Bourse, is the financial
                        embarrassment of a large number of the soi-ti'sant stock brokers.</p>
                    <p>These soi-disantstock-brokers are a group of .persons who have gathered from
                        different directions and found that brokerage in the Egypt ian Bourses is in
                        a state of anarchy and it suffices them to'eulogize speculation to any new
                        comer to the market so as to receive their brokerage commission without
                        encountering the least kind of trouble. This sort of brokers has r»o capital
                        hilt tricks and conning. Most of them entered the Bourse in groups and are
                        illiterate.</p>
                    <p>They spread in every direction and were in the habit of endeavouring to get
                        permission to sell or buy some shares. Some of them used to go to the
                        country and try to entrap the poor villagers by eulogizing speculation to
                        tlîém until they swallowed their wealth and left them destitute. This
                        anarchy in carrying out brokerage transactions and telling lies which is
                        considered the chief characteristic of a soi-disantbroker gave rise to the
                        increase of speculation to such an extent that ladies in their quiet homes
                        did not escape its dangers.</p>
                    <p>All this was caused by Lord Cromer who made Egypt a but for every invader and
                        he is also the cause of the financial embarrassment ot these brokers who are
                        now starving.</p>

                    <p>The organ of Mustapha Kamel has recommenced its fanatical attack on the

                        countries "intruders would never have been allowed to live." As Lord Milner
                        noted in "England in Egypt"</p>
                    <p>"The Arabist movement passed with frightful rapidity from a protest against

                        not only upon everything European, but upon everything Christian. The ever-
                        smouldering hatred of Moslem tor Copt had been stirred into flame, and in
                        another month the half-million and upwards of native Christians of Egypt
                        many of its richest and most intelligent inhabitants, would have gone the
                        way of their hated rivals, the Syrians, ami have swelled the list of the
                        proscribed."</p>
                    <p>The following is the text of the article in Mustapha Pasha Kamel's organ
                        :—</p>
                    <p>There is at present an important movement on foot in all classes of Egyptian
                        society against the intruders who are, as we have already stated, Syrians by
                        birth ami who are hated as much by Egypt as they are by Syria.</p>
                    <p>"Al-Lewa" published recently a letter signed by a hundred Egyptians, in which
                        these patriots, who are farmers, merchants and well- to-do citizens, tell
                        all Egyptians that their first, duty is to ignore the intruders, to consider
                        them as non-extant and never to read their press organ. "Al-Minbar" gives
                        the same advice. This advice is being followed every where and it is easy
                        now to determine the utter defeat of the enemies of Egypt</p>
                    <p>The newsiiapers espousing the National cause develop extraordinarily and with
                        astounding rapidity from day to day, whereas those upholding the Occupation
                        die away slowly and fail to attract readers. We even go so far as to defy
                        any millionaire to create, in Egypt anglophile papers of such importance as
                        the organs of the National Movement, bet the "Journal du Caire" — which has
                        sworn to kill the love of F rance in the breastof every Egyptian —then talk
                        to us about the "friends of "Al- Mokattam" !</p>
                    <p>Were one of its sub editors to wander in truly Egyptian quarters, lie would
                        soon discover that Egypt does not. read the jioisoned press of her
                        enemies.</p>
                    <p>In other countries, intruders would never liavo beon allowed to live. In
                        Egypt they are simply the object of scorn, and no one reads them. It is the
                        gentle character of the Egyptians which allows them to breathe the air of
                        Egypt, But, the more powerful Egyptian Nationalism becomes, the greater will
                        be the elimination of the intruders from the national life. For we shall
                        consider them as lieing more harmful than our worst enemies.</p>
                    <p>Egypt's doors are ojien to all ; she is hospitable and charitable. But she
                        can never lie asked to support the intruders who came to her, poor and
                        miserable, and who reward her generosity and her kindness by attacking her
                        day by day, at the same time wishing to falsify her noblest, sentiments and
                        her most legitimate aspirations.</p>

                    <p>Under the above title the Coptic Christian vernacular organ, "Al Watan,"
                        remarks :—</p>
                    <p>It is idle to deny the facts now that the agitators have openly avowed their
                        aim. The opponents of our Government are preaching open insurrection on the
                        lines of the Indian movement without in the least trying to give- their
                        policy a milder tone. They enjoin upon Moliamedans to read only Nationalist
                        papers, to buy from Mohainedans only, to be strong and determined in their
                        opposition to everything not of their camp or their creed. This ought to
                        arouse our Administration to a sense of its duties before it is too late.
                        The Egyptian fellah hears nowadays what he has never heard and finds the
                        present Government phenomenally weak. Will he for ever remain loyal if the
                        revolutionary party is allowed to persist in its plain and dangerous
                        agitation.</p>

                        in the afternoon. Shareholders wore present representing an aggregate number
                        of about 60% of the total shares. The Chairman's speech was read outlining
                        the past ami future work of the Company to emphasize the fact that the
                        present situation of the Company is satisfactory, and that with an increased
                        working capital it can soon establish itself as the largest building company
                        in Egypt but had at present to refuse very good contracts owing to the lack
                        of necessary working capital. The balance sheet and accounts were approved
                        and adopted and a dividend of 7% to 31st March last was declared, such

                    <p>A SECRET HISTORY</p>

                    <p>"Secret History of the English Occupation of Egypt. Being a Personal
                        Narrative of Events." By Wilfrid Scawen Blunt Unwin. 15s. net.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Blunt wrote this book twelve years ago, not for publication then, but as
                        an available document for the history of our times. He has printed it now,
                        because "events have happened which seem to indicate that the moment
                        foreseen in it has at last arrived, when to the public advantage ami without
                        risk of serious indiscretion, as far as individuals are concerned, the whole
                        truth may be given to the world." As there is nothing very shocking in the
                        book, perhaps Mr. Blunt is right in seeing no risk of serious indiscretion.
                        His purpose indeed might have been served equally well if he had refrained
                        from free comment on men yet living ; but that is no doubt his way, and the
                        victims—if so they can he described— ought not to grieve.</p>
                    <p>To our mind, the most interesting things in the volume are the fragments of
                        autobiography ami the material for studying the political activities of Mr.
                        Blunt He confesses that being constitutionally shy in early life, he had
                        shrunk from publicity, and the diplomatic training he hail had (sic) only
                        aggravated his repugnance to being en évidence.So he had reached his
                        fortieth year before he began to take a public part in politics, to make
                        speeches and to write articles. The diplomatic training, by the way, does
                        not appear to have amounted to very much, for "we attachés and junior
                        secretaries were very clearly given to understand . . . that it was not our
                        business to meddle with the Courts to which we were accredited, only to make
                        ourselves agreeable socially, and amuse ourselves, decorously if possible,
                        hut at any rate in the reverse of any serious sense."</p>
                    <p>Mr. Blunt was, therefore, approaching mitldle age when he became interested
                        in the Arabs, whom he met and whose unfettered life he admired «luring
                        certain unconventional travels in the East. In the attraction these people
                        had for him may be found the key to Mr. Blunt's political behaviour from
                        that time onward. He appears to have looked on the Arab with a poet's eye,
                        and to have seen the traditional glories, not the actual drawbacks, of his
                        mode of existence. The Arab roamed the desert at his sweet will, and set Mr.
                        Blunt thinking how fine it would be if the people of Egypt were doing
                        likewise. The dreams of Arabi Pasha—who may or may not have been the
                        pureminded hut. somewhat boneless patriot Mr Blunt thinks him— provided an
                        opportunity for striking a blow for freedom. Byron, with whose family Mr.
                        Blunt was connected by marriage, had upheld the cause of oppressed Greece.
                        Why should not Mr. Blunt uphold the cause ot oppressed Egypt ?</p>
                    <p>He became an unofficial agent for Arabi and the cause Arabi represented, or
                        the cause which Mr. Blunt consnlered Arabi represented. In that capacity he
                        wrote letters and articles, interviewed great men, bothered poor Mr.
                        Gladstone, who was intent on Ireland and really did not want to be worried
                        with Egypt, and watched the progress of Egyptian events with an activity
                        which in itself was worthy of all praise.</p>
                    <p>What became of Arabi we know, and Mr. Blunt informs us how strenuous were his
                        own efforts to rescue the defeated patriot from sudden death :</p>
                    <p>"I have reason to know (he says) that if Arabi had been, captured on the
                        field at Tel- el-Kebir, it was Wolseley's intention to give him the short
                        benefit of a drum-head court martial, which means shooting on the spot, and
                        that it was only the intervention of Sir John Adye, a General much older in
                        years and in length of service than Wolseley, that prevented it later—Adye
                        having represented to Wolseley the disgrace there wouhl lie to the British
                        army if the regular commander of an armed force, whom it had needed 30,000
                        troops to subdue, should not receive the honourable treatment universally
                        accorded to prisoners of war. At home, too, I equally know that Bright, in
                        indignant, protest, gave his mind on the same point personally to Gladstone.
                        It must not, however, at all be supposed that anything but the overwhelming
                        pressure of public opinion brought to bear . . . frustrated the
                        determination of our Government, one way or other, to make Arabi pay forfeit
                        for their own political crime with his life."</p>
                    <p>Then Mr. Blunt goes on to tell us how he toiled, how he employed counsel for
                        Arabi, what intrigues were conducted to rescue the victim. It is an
                        interesting story, but somewhat spoilt in the telling, progress being
                        hampered by insistence on details which do not. matter. The whole book, for
                        that matter, would gain by clarification.</p>
                    <p>There is an agreeable absence of sensation or pose in Mr. Blunt's manner of
                        writing, which tends, however, to obscure the most amazing side of the
                        story. That is, the acceptance of Mr. Blunt in the position of unofficial
                        agent by Government. Unofficial agents are no new features in high politics,
                        but few have had so little of the taint of officialism as Mr. Blunt, and
                        few, surely, have iound so ready an acceptance toi their interference with
                        responsible Ministers.</p>
                    <p>Scattered up anil down these pages are some pretty pictures of politicians.
                        There is, for example, the picture of Mr. Gladstone receiving through Mr.
                        Blunt, certain messages and proposals from Arabi.</p>
                    <p>"As I was going ont I turned and asked him, with a sudden thought, whether I
                        might not send Arabi some message from him in answer to his messages. He
                        thought an instant and said T think not.' And very slowly and deliberately:
                        'But you are at liberty to state your own impression of my sentiments and
                        then in a sort of House of Commons voice, which was in strange contrast with
                        the extremely personal and human tone in which he had been conversing : 'If
                        they wish to judge of these, let them read what we say in Parliament,
                        especially what I say, for I never speak lightly in Parliament. In our
                        public despatches we are much hampered by the opinion of Europe, which we
                        are bound to consider, and this is not favourable to Liberal institutions in
                        Egypt. But they should read our speeches.'"</p>
                    <p>As a contrast, let us quote Mr. Blunt on Lord Rosebery'9 Egyptian views.</p>
                    <p>"Mr. Gladstone was out of town, staying with Lord Rosebery at the Durdans,in
                        my eyes an ominous circumstance. I knew Rosebery's view of the Egyptian
                        question, for a few weeks before I had found him at Downing-street with
                        Hamilton, and had walked with them both by the little garden exit through
                        St. James's Park. On the way I had asked him his views about Egypt, and he
                        had answered very briefly, I have no views at all but those of a
                        bondholder.' He was, in fact, through his wife, a Rothschild, largely
                        interested in the financial asjiect of the case."</p>
                    <p>With regard to General Gordon, who felt, great sympathy with Arabi, the
                        official view of him was, to put it plainly, that his mind was distraught..
                        "He was not clothed in the lightest of minds" is a sentence from a letter
                        received by Mr. Blunt from Downing street.</p>

                    <p>The Hon. L. M. Iddings, U.S. Consul-General in Egypt, reports that the
                        following are the essential points in motor boats constructed for navigation
                        on the Nile : Length 21 ft. to 30 ft.; hull, wood, light ; draft, 2 ft at
                        the very most; motor, capable of developing a speed of six miles an hour
                        against a two-mile current, and taking up as little space as possible.
                        Several motor boats were running on pleasure trips on the Nile last season.
                        In some cases they brought in as much as $21 per day, and I am iuformed that
                        two or three companies here are now in correspondence with manufacturing
                        firms in England for the supply of boats for regular trips to different
                        points up the Nile. There are many rich persons in this country who would
                        doubtess become purchasers if once they understood these boats.</p>

                    <p>Reporting on the use of Artificial Manures in Egypt, the French Consul at
                        Cairo says : —</p>
                    <p>The laud under cultivation in this country is being exterided considerably,
                        owing to the increased irrigation and to the establishment of artesian wells
                        in many parta bordering on the desert, and there is every prospect that
                        Egypt will shortly become an important market for manures, either to be
                        added to the natural fertilizers fised, or for enriohing the lands which are
                        just coming into cultivation. The fellah prefers to employ the mud at the
                        bottom of the canals or of the river at low water, or else stable manures,
                        which consist of rice straw or maize waste mixed with animal matters. This
                        forms an excellent manure, but there is not enough of it A large quantity
                        would be required in the cultivation of cotton and Indian corn, and there is
                        not sufficient cattle to furnish the demand. The Société des Vidanges of
                        Cairo has been producing locally an artificial manure which, however, comes
                        ôut far too dear. Superphosphatesare advantageously used in cotton
                        cultivation, and this is sometimes blended with nitrate of soda or sulphate
                        of ammonia. These fertilizers increase the production by about 40 per cent
                        Prices fluctuate week by week, but average per ton free on rail Alexandria
                        about £13 for sulphate of ammonia ; £12 10s. for nitrate ot soda, and £3 for
                        superphosphate. Imports have been increasing year by year, whereas in 1903
                        they totalled £El6,417, in 1905 they were more than £E56,000, almost the
                        whole of it coming from Belgium, a.small portion being introduced from
                        France, Algeria, and Tunis. Makers of artificial manures would do well to
                        keep an eye on the Egyptian markets.</p>

                    <head>THE CYPRIOT CHURCH</head>
                    <p>The Patriarch of Alexandria may possibly proceed to Cyprus shortly in order
                        to settle the question of a successor to the Archbishop Sophronios, as head
                        of the Autocephalous Orthodox Church of that Island. If the Patriarch does
                        not go himself, a delegate . will he appointed by him. The Metropolitan of
                        Anchialos has left for Cyprus to represent the (Ecumenical Patriarch He is
                        accompanied by the Archbishop of Nablous, who will represent the Patriarch
                        of Jerusalem.</p>
                    <p>Archbishop Sophronios of Cyprus died in May, 1900. As arranged, in the four
                        dioceses, orthodox residents of over 21 years of age elected as their
                        representatives 386,169,240 and 198 persons all over 25 years ; these in
                        turn, elected 10 and 20, 4 and 5, 3 and 9, 8 and 6, clerks and laymen
                        respectively all over 30 years. These 60 with the Holy Synod, were to elect
                        the archbishop. The encyclical (July 25, 1900) signed by four members of the
                        Synod, the bishop of Kition only abstaining, stated that the number of
                        electors apportioned to the several dioceses was based on the census of 1901
                        and conformed to the practice hitherto observed in the choice of
                        Metropolitans.</p>
                    <p>Objections however, were raised to the validity of the election of some of
                        the sixty, and the right of the Synod to adjudicate on the objections was
                        disputed an the ground that the Synod without either an arohbishop or a
                        Bishop of Paphos, was not canonically constituted. After many attempts to
                        settle the difficulty, the parties (one of which claimed a majority among
                        the elector», the other in the Synod) agreed on a reference to the
                        patriarchs of Constantinople, Alexandria, Jerusalem, bat the referees have
                        given no final decision bat have now agreed to settle the question.
                        Meanwhile, the property of the See has been managed by the Arehimandrite and
                        its ecclesiastical affairs by the Synod.</p>

                            that the Government would not capitulate to the soldiery. He asked for a
                            vote of confidence to aid pacification. The Chamber passed the vote by
                            587 against 223. (Havas)</p>

                    <p>Said El-Akkad and Lord Cromer</p>
                    <p>We recently published an excerpt from a lengthy letter addressed to "Al Lewa"
                        by the Cairo native notable, El Said Hassan Musa el- Akkad, wherein that
                        person declared that the present financial crisis has been brought about by
                        the efforts of Lord Cromer and the Occupation Press. A correspondent writes
                        that such ridiculous statements cannot have been made seriously unless they
                        were written by a hopelessly irrational being, and suggests that El Said
                        Hassan Musa el-Akkad only intended it as a humorous satire on native
                        Anglophobe ideas. This is an absolutely erroneous deduction. In the first
                        place this native notable takes himself quite seriously and the long letter
                        from which we quoted is obviously written in an earnest, tone. The writer
                        evidently believes what he says, and it is absurd to consider that he is in
                        fact a stupid person. He holds a high position in native circles in Cairo
                        and is respected for his intelligence. How then can he be guilty of such
                        absurdities? </p>
                    <p>The reason must be looked for deep down in the groundwork of the Egyptian
                        mind, where the reasoning powers are very old and exhibit all the signs of
                        mature senility. The Egyptian mind is in its childhood, but it is its second
                        childhood. The Egyptians began to live before us, and in a climate where
                        there is no strenuous battle to fight with nature have developed racially,
                        as they develop individually, more rapidly than we. The Egyptian was adult,
                        while we were in the caves, and he was living in great cities, when we were
                        setting up shapeless monolitlis on Salisbury Plain. Now they are all very
                        old and cannot put on again their youthful energy, or fall into the ways of
                        a later generation. How seldom do we realize this truth in thought or speech
                        ; It is a common place to regard the Eastern nation as children, to whom we
                        are schoolmasters, India is to be taught Western methods, Egypt set in the
                        path of our own development, Turkey regenerated in our image.</p>
                    <p>Vanity of all vanities ! Here is the sheerest aldiemy ! It is we that are the
                        children of these fathers ; we have learned of them, hut we shall surpass
                        and outlive them, our «level opinent is not just what theirs has been, even
                        as development of second generation is never quite like that of the
                        first.</p>
                    <p>Thus it is that a native notable of Cairo can assert in all seriousness that
                        Lord Cromer has brought about the financial criais and such utterances are
                        believed by his compatriots, and given publicity to in the vernacular Press,
                        although if a European youth made such a statement he would encounter the
                        ridicule of his fellows, as the poet says "the gray barbarian," is "lower
                        than the Christian child. It is therefore no fault of the native mind if
                        criticism of such a type is credited although to us it may savour of sheer
                        insanity. Just as El Said Hassan Musa el Akkad would doubtless ridicule the
                        wisdom of some sage elder of a pithecanthropic tribe of the Meiocene epoch,
                        if he ever came across a sample so would the European youth treat the
                        Egyptian's criticisms of Lord Cromer. Their mentality is on a totally
                        different plane. The distance is too great ever to be bridged For as an
                        acute observer of the East recently remarked, "When we speak of educating
                        India or Egypt we are the modern son who proposes to bring his old father up
                        to date. We are dominant in these lands not for their sake but our own
                        development, and in order to use them as our own stepping stones to higher
                        things, it is possibly not amiss for our own moral nature that we should hug
                        an altruistic illusion at home, and we find little difficulty in doing so ;
                        but it is less easy abroad. No one who has been long in Egypt ever tallcs
                        about the "political education of the Egyptians."</p>

                    <head>THE BATTLE OF ROSETTA.</head>
                    <p>"FROM THE TIMES OF 1807"</p>
                    <p>The following extract from its issue of June 12,1807, appeared in the
                        "'Times" last week : The "Pompée," Sir Sidney Smith, whose arrival from the
                        Mediterranean we announced yesterday, has brought intelligence of a very
                        unpleasant nature. That part of our army, which was detached from Alexandria
                        against llosetta, has been defeated with very great loss. Our readers will
                        recollect, that in our anticipation of the "Hamburgh" Mail on Wednesday, we
                        alluded to this melancholy event. The private information which we then were
                        in possession of, would have justified us in announcing it in a much
                        stronger manner. That we did not, was owing to the peouliar ilelicuey of the
                        circumstance, as well as the difficulty of the situation in which we were
                        placed. The source from which we derived our intelligence, basin no one
                        instance ever misled us, and its communications are entitled to implicit
                        confidence and respect ; but we shrunk from being the first to announce a
                        great public calamity. We, therefore, restricted our communication to
                        hinting at the disaster, and stating the scene of the misfortune, confident
                        that the melancholy corroboration of our intelligence could not be long
                        delayed.</p>
                    <p>The particulars of this unfortunate affair, as well as we have been able to
                        collect them, are these. It is known, though the fact is not stated in
                        General Fraser's dispatch, that immediately after the surrender of
                        Alexandria, a respectable- force was detached by him against Rosetta, the
                        command of which was confided to Major General Wauchope. They advanced
                        against it under an impression that they should meet with no resistance. No
                        force appeared for the purpose oi ohstructiugtheir march) The head of
                        cecohitnn had, however, scarcely entered the town, when it was assailed by a
                        destructive fire from a vast number of Turks and Albanians, who were posted
                        in the houses and different buddings. The contest was unequal, and our
                        troops were under the necessity of retreating. They accordingly evacuated
                        the town, and took the best position they could, under the circumstances;
                        but having, as we are informed, been joined by some reinforcements from
                        Alexandria, they again advanced, and gave battle to an enemy infinitely
                        superior to them in numbers. The result was such as we set out with
                        stating"; they were defeated, with very great loss indeed. In the first
                        affair, the extent of our loss was about 15 1 killed and wounded. In the
                        second, it was up- wards of a thousand. We have not been able to ascertain
                        whether any prisoners were made; but the total loss was probably not much
                        under 1200 men, or half perhaps of the force which was engaged. The remains
                        of this gallant little band made good their retreat to Alexandria, where
                        they remain The Commander of the expedition, Major General Wauchope, fell.
                        Brigadier General Meade, the next in command, was wounded, but, we are happy
                        to hear, not badly. Several other officers were also slightly wounded, who
                        were fast recovering when the dispatches were sent off.</p>

                    <p>ANSWER TO A PRESSING QUESTION</p>
                    <p>Put this question to M. Alphonse Anthoine, of the Louviere, whose portrait we
                        give below. Ask him if he knows a good cure for headache, humming sounds in
                        the ears, poor digestion, insomnia, and weakness. He will reply: "Dr.
                        William' Pink Pills for Pale People." They have, in fact, cured him of all
                        these troubles. "For seven years," he writes, "I often had persistent and
                        annoying sounds in the ears. I had no appetite, and digested very badly. At
                        length I became as tired in the morning when I got up as I was at night. I
                        slept very badly, was always very fatigued, and suffered much. All this gave
                        me gloomy ideas. I took any remedies, and they releived me a little for a
                        short time, but they did not radically and definitely unburden me of my
                        disorders. After a few days my troubles returned. I then decided to see
                        whether Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People, of which everyone at the
                        Louvriere spoke well, would be better than the other medicines I took them,
                        and they have indeed done me an enormous amount of good. I continued the
                        treatment for two months, and was quite cured. It is several months since I
                        completed the cure, and my maladies, I can aver have definitely left me." M.

                    <p>Coton</p>
                    <p>La fermeté tie l'Américain et les pronostics d'une bonne semaine sous le
                        rapport des exportations, ont suffi pour nous valoir une excellente ténue du
                        marché pendant la matinée de Samedi. En clôtyre et après un léger recul tout
                        momentané, le cours" du Novembre est revenu au niveau tie la veille, tandis
                        que le Juillet perdait 1/32 sur la précédente clôture.</p>
                    <p>Le lendemain, c'est-à-dire lundi, à un moment donné, les cours avaient fléchi
                        de 1/8 de tallari pour les deux échéances, mais à la fin de lu séance le
                        recul en question se réduisait, pour l'ancienne et la nouvelle récolte
                        respectivement, à 1 32 et 3 32. Jusques-là, il n'y avait rien
                        d'extraordinaire et le seul fait à remarquer était la tendance qu'avait le
                        Juillet à faiblir, tendance qui s'est accentuée Mardi et qui a fini parse
                        résumerenune nouvelle baisse de 7/82 pour le mois en question, tandis que
                        pour le Novembre elle no dépassait pas 3/32. Cast dans cette journée que
                        pour le Novembre nous vu le prix minimum de la semaine qui a été de 19 13
                        1.</p>
                    <p>Mercredi, sur une reprise de T Américain qui, jur modérée qu'elle ait été,
                        n'en a pas moins constitué un bon motif de soutien, un revirement rapide et
                        soudain s'est produit dans l'allure du marché, lequel, traduit en chiffre,
                        représentait une amélioration de 7.32 pour le Novembre et de 5/32 pour le
                        Juillet, ce qui mettait les deux mois au pair, soit à 20 1/16.</p>
                    <p>Cette amélioration ne n'est toutefois pas maintenue, car hier de nouveau la
                        faiblesse s'est dessinée dès la première heure et cela sur un désir de
                        réalisation du juillet, né on ne sait à la suite dequellecirconstancc, mais
                        qui à chaque instant se faisait plus intense et qui a fini par faire tomber
                        le juillet à 19 25 32, tandis que le novembre se soutenait à 19 31/32.</p>
                    <p>Ce matin, finalement, les choses avaient empiré d'une façon marquée aussi
                        bien au joint de vue de la baisse que sous le rapport de l'écart entre les
                        deux récoltes. Il est vrai qu'à la dernière heure les choses se dont un peu
                        arrangées.- mais cela n'em pèche que dans l'entretemps le juillet avait
                        touché 19 9/16, minimun île la semaine, et que le veport pour novembre
                        s'était élargi jusqu'à 7/2 ce qui a attiré de gros ordres de la part du
                        Commerce d'exportation dont la conséquence été de nous faire finir la
                        semaine sur la cote de 19 29 32 pour le novembre et 19 11/16 pour le
                        juillet.</p>
                    <p>Maintenant, comme résumé de toutes ces fluctuations que nous venons de
                        relater, nous trouvons que le Novembre n'a perdu que 3/32 de tallari sur
                        Vendredi dernier, tandis que le juillet s'inscrit avec 9/16 de moins.</p>
                    <p>La différence dans la marche des deux échéances est vraiment frappante, mais
                        elle s'explique : le Novembre est relativeaient ferme à cause de la demande
                        dont il a^été l'objet, soit sur les rachats du découvert, soit sur ceux de
                        ces spéculateurs qui étaient vendeurs de la nouvelle récolte contre leurs
                        achats passés en Juillet et qui, s'étant débarrassés de ce dernier mois, ont
                        dû racheter l'autre. En somme, il y avait de l'emploi pour le Novembre et
                        cela justifie sa tenue.</p>
                    <p>Par contre, ponr le Juillet il y a la perspective de la première filière dans
                        une dizaine de jours et comme aucun spéculateur n'est à même de recevoir ou
                        d'arrêter cette émission éventuelle, des liquidations s'imposaient et elles
                        ont eu lieu. Seulement, comme avec la réserve de la filature elles ne
                        pouvaient se faire jdar des ventes pures et simples, c'est en recourant aux
                        échanges avec du Novembre que nos exportateurs ont pu alléger la place de ce
                        quitait offert en contrats Juillet,</p>
                    <p>Aussi, le fait apie les «leux récoltés n'ont pas baissé de concert et que le
                        report pour Novembre avait atteint 7/16 de tallari, est-il à consitlérer
                        comme une véritable chance pour notre pluce. Sans cette circonstance qui lui
                        a offert tin avantage réel, le commerce serait resté indifférent au Juillet,
                        ce and aurait bien pu nous valoir une bonne petite débamlade. Enfin, les
                        haussiers ont été assez heureux cette fois et il n'y a plus qu'à souhaiter
                        aux exportateurs une bonne réussite dans leurs tenta fives de placement
                        auprès «le la filature du Juillet qu'ils ont ramassé. 11 est vrai que
                        douverts par le Novembre qu ils ont vendu, ils ne courent pas grand risque,
                        mais l'écoulement de cette marchamlise sera quand même laborieux, car si la
                        consommation anglaise se montre disposée aux achats et continue à acheter
                        plus ou moins toms les jours «piebpie chose, il n'en est pas de même du
                        Continent and pour le moment fait le mort lies gens bien informés prétemlent
                        repeiulant que les besoins existent, apie le Continent cherche tout
                        simplement à joouer au plus fin et que par la force des choses il devra, à
                        bref délai, lui aussi revenir au marché. Espérons-le.</p>
                    <p>Par contre, l'abstention sur la nouvelle récolte est générale à ce qr e l'on
                        affirme et ce n'est pas la réaction actuelle de l'Américain qui pourrait
                        engager la consommation à s'en occuper d'une manière effective : les prix
                        qui régnent sont trop élevés en eux-mêmes et rien ne presse donc le
                        filateur.</p>
                    <p>Ajoutons encore qu'avec la crise financière and sévit sur notre place, la
                        tenue du Novembre doit paraître surprenante à beaucoup de monde. Et elle
                        l'est, enr effet, mais comme nous l'avons dit plus haut, Jé découvert est
                        grand et il va de soi que cela aide énormément. On prétend, il est vrai,que
                        le commerce vend aussi du Novembre contre ses achats dans l'intérieur. Cela
                        est peut-être incontestable ; mais, au fond, est-ce que les affaires faites
                        jusqn'iei sont suffisantes pour peser our la situation ? Nous ne le croyons
                        pas, quoique d'autre part nous partagions l'avis de ceux qui soutiennent que
                        le cultivateur est librement vendeur, le cours de 20 tallaris ne pouvant que
                        l'induire à vendre, surtout que nous sommes à l'époque où généralement ses
                        besoins se font le plus sentir. Si Alexandrie avait été plus large, ou pour
                        mieux dire plus à l'aise soua le rapport de l'argent, quel bon courant
                        d'affaires n'aurions- nous pas eu ?</p>
                    <p>De l'Amérique, la seule nouvelle intéressante de la semaine a été le rapport
                        «le Miss Giles qui nous- ilonno la condition de la planté comme étant de 68
                        1/2 %. Ce n'est pas énorme, mais, on fin de compté, c'est quand même une
                        amélioration de 5 points sur son rapport du 15 Mai et qui ferait présager un
                        rapport favorable aussi de la part du Bureau d'Agriculture, d'autant plus
                        que l'on ne fait due nous dire que le temps est au beau en Amérique.</p>
                    <p>Et cela doit être le cas, autrement il n'y aurait bns eu cet empressement «le
                        la part des haussiers à litpiicier, fait auquel la baisse de l'Américain
                        est. attribuée.</p>
                    <p>Chez nous aussi la récolte marche à souhait et sans qu'il y ait «les dégâts
                        par le ver à signaler.</p>
                    <p>Espérons que cela marchera bien jusqu'au bout.</p>
                    <p>En attendant, dans quelques jours nous aurons le résumé de l'Alexandria
                        General Produce Association qui nous fixera en détail sur la véritable
                        situation actuelle de la récolté.</p>
                    <p>I«e marché du disponible a été peu actif, faute de marchandise en quantité
                        suffisante à la venté, mais sous le rapport des prix, il y a du soutien et
                        si la coté officielle du Mit-Afifi et des provenances Haute-Egypte a bû être
                        réduite de 3/4 de tallari ce n'est qu'à cause des cours «les contrats au

                    <p>La dépression générale, que nous avons signalée vemlretli dender, n'a fait
                        que s'accentuer au cours cette semaine, par suite des difficultés
                        croissantes au milieuTtesquellcs se débat la Cassa di Scoutn e di
                        llisparmio. Cet établissement de crédit, grâce à des avances de lui ont
                        consenties ces jours derniers la National Bank et la Bandue Ottomane a pu
                        tenir jusqu'hier contre l'envahissement d'une clientèle apeurée, mais ce
                        matin il a fermé ses portes et apposé un avis de convocation aux
                        actionnaires en vue de prendre d'urgence les mesures que commande la
                        situation En effet, l'Union Bank de Vienne, à laquelle la Cassa di Seonto
                        s'est adressée depuis quelques jours pour la tirer de ce mauvais pas, n'a
                        pas encore fait connaître ses intentions. C'est dans ce but jue le président
                        du Conseil d'Administration de la banque viennoise est attendu içi lundi
                        prochain. .</p>
                    <p>Comme du fait de la fermeture de la Cassa on craignait une panique à la
                        corbeille des valeurs, l'association des courtiers a aussitôt décidé de
                        suspendre ses séances jusqu'à ce que le calme soit revenu et que la
                        situation de la Cassa di Seonto soit nettement établie. Hâtons-nous de dire
                        que, quelque soit l'avenir de cette banque, les autres établissements de
                        crédit, qui avaient des relations avec elle, ne sont pas compromis, leurs
                        avances étant cou- veites en dépôt de titres de premier ordre.</p>
                    <p>On comprend toutefois qu'en de telles conjonctures, agrémentées d'antres
                        complications financières, la cote ait subi une nouvelle dépréciation
                        générale pour les valeurs traitées. Certaines d'entre elles, que leurs
                        détenteurs gardaient pour ne pas en précipiter la baisse et doot le prix
                        était par conséquent nominal, ont soudain fléchi sous le poids d'ordres . de
                        vente nécessités par la crise. De ce nombre sont les Nungovich Hotels qui
                        s'inscrivent à 14, en" perte de 4 livres sur le prix de vendredi dernier. La
                        National Bank recule Je 19 15/16 à 18 pour des motifs analogues. En baisse
                        également la Banque d'Athènes de 7 fr. 50 à 116 1/2, la Land Banket

                        pourra consulter la cote, l'espace nous faisant défaut pour nous étendre
                        davantage. En ce qui concerne la Cassa di Seonto e di Risparmio, les prix

                    <head>L'AVENIR</head>
                    <p>Telle est brièvement la situation des valeurs égyptiennes, tant en
                        Europequ'ici. La tendance est au surplus franchement mauvaise. Tous les
                        morceaux de littérature servis depuis quelque temps par certains organes
                        locaux dans le but fort louable de relever le marché égyptien ont en un
                        résultat tout opposé à celui que se proposaient leurs divers auteurs. C'est
                        que le public, surtout dans une crise comme celle qui sévit actuellement, ne
                        veut pas être payé de mots ; il demande, à juste titre, non pas à être
                        dorloté d'assurances aussitôt démenties par les faits, mais à être éclairé
                        sur la véritable situation du marché. Les articles sans nombre publiés à
                        tort et à travers, sans aucun souci de la vérité et pour complaire à des
                        coteries n'ont servi qu'à compliquer la crise d'une méfiance invétérée qu'il
                        faudra longtemps pour faire disparaître. Au lieu de toutes ces affirmations
                        faites à la légère, combien il vaudrait mieux exposer les faits tels qu'ils
                        sont, et dévoiler le mal aussitôt qu'il est soupçonné. Pour notre part, noos
                        ne dessimnlerons pas que l'a- nenirse présente gros d'incertitude. Pour de
                        longs mois encore nous aurons à subir les conséquences des émissions donton
                        a inondé notre place ainsi que de la spéculation folle dont elles ont été
                        l'objet. Il faudra longtemps encore pour éliminer l'ivraie du bon grain, les
                        bonnes valeurs des mauvaises, pour rétablir l'équilibre entre le prix des
                        titres et leur revenu. Jus- pies-là la crise sévira.</p>
                    <p>Nous devons à la vérité de dire que la prospérité du pays n'est pas
                        compromise par la crise actuelle. Seuls les valeurs surfaites et ceux qui
                        ont eu l'imprudence de s'y engager en supporteront les frais. Cela est si
                        vrai que le coton, qui forme comme la base de la prospérité égyptienne, se
                        maintient à des prix élevés. On a déjà vendu en Europe un quart de la
                        prochaine récolte an prix moyen de 19 tallaris. Cette vente assure «fores et
                        déjà à l'Egypte une rentrée d'or pour octobre et novembre de 6 millions de
                        livres sterling.</p>
                    <p>De plus, aux termes d'un accord survenu entre le Crédit Foncier Egyptien et
                        le Gouvernement égyptien, celui-ci laisse à la disposition du Crédit Foncier
                        les 600.0(H) livres sterling qui devaient lui être versées par cette
                        société. Cette somme sera remboursée en 6 annuités et portera intérêt à
                        raison de 4%. Ce sont 600,000 livres de plus qui restent en circulation dans
                        le pays.</p>
                    <p>Veut-on voir maintenant si le numéraire, «pie certains disent raréfié en
                        Egypte, a augmenté ou diminué 1 Pour cela il nous suffira de consulter les
                        statistiques des douanes sur l'importation et l'exportation de l'or : sur 9
                        millions de livres environ importées en 1906, environ 3 millions seulement
                        ont été exportées. C'est donc un solde de 6 millions de livres environ en
                        faveur de l'Egypte. Depuis 1897 il a été importé 49.385.767 livres, soit une
                        moyenne pour ces dix dernières années de 4.938.576 livres. Sur cette somme,
                        le Crédit Lyonnais figure à lui seul pour 24 759.291 livres, soit une
                        moyenne de 2.475.929 livres pour ces dix dernières années. On voit par là
                        que le Crédit Lyonnais a importé à lui seul depuis 10 ans la moitié de tout
                        l'or importé eu ,'pte.</p>
                    <p>1 y a donc de l'or dans le pays, autant et plus que l'année passée à pareille
                        époque, mais il est entré en possession de propriétaires fonciers qui n'ont
                        pas hâte de le faire fructifier. Beaucoup de capitalistes, qui ont également
                        de fortes sommes disponibles, attendent pour les engager sur les valeurs une
                        période plus calme. Ils ont, en effet, d'amples motifs pour s'abstenir en
                        présence de la crise qui ne fait que s'acoen- tuer. Si d'autre part la
                        moins-value des titres, qui esten moyenne de 30 à 40 %, porte une forte
                        atteinte à ceux qui les détiennent, ceux qui par contre pourront les garder
                        ne perdront rien, au moins sur les valeurs de premier ordre. Les acquéreurs
                        nouveaux réaliseront même un bénéfice important. Il y a cependant une perte
                        sèche qui ne sera jamais couverte, c'est celle resultant des valeurs de pure
                        speculation quiont ete poussees a des prix tout a fait injustifies. Sous cee
                        rapport, la revanche actuelle du bon sens sur la folie speculative est
                        terrible: nous esperons qu'elle servire de lecon pour l'avenir.</p>

                        régulièrement fonctionné hier et ils nous prient de dire qu'il n'y il pas eu
                        de panique parmi leur clientèle, contrairement à ce que nous avait téléphoné
                        hier notre correspondant du Caire. Leur banque n'a aucune relation
                        d'affaires avec la Cassa di Sconto e di Rispannio et ne possède aucun titre
                        de cette société.</p>

                    <p>Le Caire, Lundi 17 Juni.</p>
                    <p>Le taux de l'escompte libre a Londres, que</p>
                    <p>nous avions laisse it 3 3/4, s'est eleve successivement veudredi passte a 3
                        7/8 et samedi a 4 pour cent, soit en hausse de 1,4.</p>
                    <p>Au Stock Exchange, le Consolide anglais a baisse avant-hier de 1/8 83 7/8.
                        L'Unifiee</p>
                    <p>est remontee de 1/4 a 104 1/4. La National Bank a encore perdu 1/4 de livre a
                        19 1/2, de meme que laDai'ra Sanieh a 13 1/4. L'Agricole a regagne 1/4 a 7
                        3/4. La Delta Light a ega- lement repris 3/8 a 9 1/2.</p>
                    <p>A Paris, le Credit Foncier Egyptien a en­core recute de 5 francs a 684 et la
                        Banque d'A- thenes de 6 francs a 116.</p>
                    <p>Ici, le marche a repris, ce matin, une phy- sionomie convenable, sinon tout a
                        fait regnliere. La seance a bien encore ete ouvertepar un discours, mais
                        court et nullement dans le genre de ceux qui avaient marque lesjouritees de
                        jeudi et vendredi derniers. De plus, ce speech a officiel, prononce par le
                        president interimaire de l'honorable Corporation des agents de change. Stir
                        un ton onctuenx et pa­terae, M. Paul Oziol a engage ces messieurs de la
                        corbeille a ne pas se laisser influencer par les nouvelles pessimistes
                        repandues par les bais- siers sur le compte d'une seciete fonciere et d'un
                        etablissement de banque, nouvelles qne le president de la Corporation a
                        declarees po- sitivement fausses. M. Paul Oziol a termine sa harangue par
                        quelques bonnes paroles prechant la concorde etl'union, voire la "
                        cooperation a l'ceuvre commune. "</p>
                    <p>Nous allions oublier de dire que, d'ordre du Comite, la duree des seances a
                        ete fixee a une heure, au lieu d'une demie. Toutes les opera- rations
                        pratiquees sont de nouveau enregis- trdes. Les teneurs de carnet ont ete
                        finalement exclus de la corbeille jusqu'a nouvel ordre,</p>
                    <p>etc., etc.</p>
                    <p>Toutes ces decisions sont diversement com­mentees. Reconnaissons qu'elles
                        n'.emeuvent profondement personne, par suite de leur ca- ractfcre febrile.
                        L'opinion prevaut, d'ailleurs, que le Comite prend decidement trop de
                        mesures hatives. Le calme et la circonspection ne sauraient nuire a aucun
                        interet, pas meme a ceux de la respectable Corporation. Il faudrait autant
                        que possible s'attacher a ne pas res- treindro la liberty des transactions,
                        a ne pas tomber dans l'arbitraire et laisser les choses suivre leur cours
                        naturel, d'autantplus que le fond de baisse est presque attaint et qn'en
                        outre la crise ne frappe plus uniqueroent les Bourses du Caire et
                        d'Alexandrie, mais s'dtend a tous les marches Strangers.</p>
                    <p>Le nombre des transactions en registries a ete de 64. La National Bank a
                        cloture a 19 1/2-9/16 apres avoir fait 19 5/8. L'Agricole s'est tenue a 7
                        5,-8-11/16. La Cassa di Sconto a ramenee a 100 Faction ancienne et 110 la
                        nouvelle, la Banque d'Athenes a 122, la Banque d'Orient a 120.</p>
                    <p>Le Credit Foncier a ete delaisse a 700; les obligations a lots anciennes sont
                        revenues a 320 et les nouvelles a 268-269. La Daira a re­trograde a 14 et
                        I'Union Fonetere /t 4 1/2.</p>
                    <p>Dans le groupe des valeurs hotelires, les Nungovich ont ete cotes 15
                        ex-coupon. Les Egyptian ont fini it 5 1/16 apres avoir ete traites au-dessus
                        de 5 5/16. Les Excelsior sont tomb?s a2 1/4></p>
                    <p>La Delta Land a ete bien tenue a 2. Les Estates ont cloture a £ 1. Les
                        Constructions sont revenues a 0 7/16 et lesOnsis a 0 7,16-1/2.</p>
                    <p>Nous detachons d'une correspondance de Londres, en date du 9 Juin, le passage
                        suivant :</p>
                    <p>" La situation du marche monetaire n est pas satisfnisante. On remarque trop
                        d'exporta- tions d'or, et l'argent au lendemain est cher et difficile. Les
                        Banques " ramassent '',a Paris surtout, par suite de la toumure inquietante
                        que prennent de Russie.</p>
                    <p>" Au Stock Exchange, les transactions sont presque nulles en presence de la
                        chert? de l'argent. Les capitalistes en quite de place­ments continuent a
                        rester a l'ecart; seuls les baissiere sont en plein dans leur ?l?ment.
                        L'inquietude et le malaise sont partout ; on s'attend a une bien mauvaise
                        liquidation et a des chutes provoquees par les r?centes fail- lites. "</p>

                    <p>This is a condition (or disease) to which doctors give many names, but which
                        few of them really understand. It is simply weakness – a break-down,
                        asitwere, of the vital forces that sustain the system. No matter what may be
                        its causes (for they are almost numberless), its symptoms are much the same
                        ; the more prominent being sleeplessness, sense of prostration or weariness,
                        depression of spirits and want of energy for all the ordinary affairs of
                        life. Now, what alone is absolutely essential in all such cases is increased
                        vitality - vigour – </p>
                    <p>VITAL STRENGTH &amp; ENERGY</p>
                    <p>to throw off these morbid feelings, and experiences proves that as night
                        succeeds the day this may be more certainly secured by a course of the
                        celebrated life-reviving tonic.</p>

                        in accordance with the printed directions accompanying it; will the

                        place of what had so lately seemed worn-out, "used up" and valueless. This

                        never-failing recuperative essence, which is destined to cast into oblivion
                        everything that had preceded it for this wide-spread and numerous class of
                        human ailments.</p>
