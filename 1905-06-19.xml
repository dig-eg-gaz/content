                            RhOne a number of model workmen’s dwellings. The houses are of two
                            storeys, with a small garden, and let at from twelve to seventeen francs
                            per month. Every modern improvement has been applied in their

                            are covered with linoleum. Every dwelling was let as soon as it was

                    <p>London, June 18. The Khedive who. will be among the guests at the Royal
                        wedding, arrived in London last evening, having crossed from Calais to Dover
                        in the afternoon, and travelled to Victoria Station by special South-Eastern
                        and Chatham train, which reached the terminus at a quarter-past seven
                        o’clook. The train was ran into the departure side of the station, so that
                        the Royal Waiting Room and Wilton-road exist were available for the Khedive
                        and the distinguished company assembled to receive him. A portion of the
                        platform was reserved and carpeted. Among those awaiting his Highness were
                        the Duke of Connaught, Prince Arthur of Connaught, General Sir Godfrey
                        Clerk, attached on behalf of King Edward ; Sir Eldon Gorst, Principal Under
                        Secretary at the Foreign Office; Sir Eric Barrington, Principal Private
                        Secretary to Lord Lansdowne; the Swedish Minister in London and the
                        personnel of the Swedish Legation ; Count Stenbock, Sir Rennell Rodd, Lady
                        Garvagh, the Hon. Leopold Canning, Mr. Bax-Ironside and Mrs. Bax-Ironside ;
                        Colonel Egerton and Major Murray, in attendance on the Duke of Connaught;
                        Captain Walter Campbell, Groom-in-Waiting to the King ; and Captain
                        Yarde-Buller, attached on behalf on the King. The Khedive was most cordially
                        greeted by the Duke of Connaught, who presented in turn Prince Arthur, Sir
                        Godfrey Clerk, Captain Yarde-Buller, Colonel Egerton, Major Murray, Sir
                        Eldon. Gorst, Sir Eric Barrington, Sir Rennell Rodd, and others, with all of
                        whom his Highness shook hands heartily. He in turn presented the principal
                        members of his suite, and afterwards, attended by Sir Godfrey Clerk and
                        Captain Yarde-Boller, drove to Claridge’s Hotel. By order of the King, Royal
                        carriages were sent from Buckingham Palace for the use of his Highness and
                        suite. The Khedive will leave Paddington for Windsor Castle at twenty
                        minutes past twelve o’clock today on a visit to the King and Queen, and will
                        remain until after the wedding.</p>
                    <p>Describing the arrival of Prince Gustavus Adolphus at Victoria station, on
                        Monday last, the London correspondent of the “New York Herald” (Paris) says
                        :—Just before the Prince came the Khedive of Egypt had arrived at Victoria
                        from Paris. The Duke of Connaught and Prince Arthur had received him also,
                        and seen him off to Claridge’s Hotel, whence he will go down to Windsor
                        to-day. The short, square figure of Egypt’s ruler, in a top-hat and frock
                        coat, was hardly recognised by the crowd, but everyone is talking of his
                        gift to the bride, the high diamond tiara with its design of marguerites ,
                        which is one of Princess Margaret's most magnificent presents. </p>
                    <p>The Khedive’s present to the Princess Margaret of Connaught on the occasion
                        of her marriage was a high diamond tiara, convertible into a necklace, in a
                        conventional design of marguerites.</p>
                    <p>Our Constantinople Correspondent states that during his sojourn at Vienna the
                        Khedive received the visit of H. R. H. the Prince of Montenegro. The Prince
                        remained with his Highness for one hour.</p>

                    <p>During the week ending June 16, 4 cases of plague were notified in Egypt,
                        namely, 1 European at Alexandria and 3 natives at Damanhour, two of which
                        ended fatally.</p>
                    <p>Since the beginning of the year there have been 77 cases of plague, of which
                        55 have died and 22 have recovered. There are now 6 cases under treatment,
                        as follows :—</p>
                    <p>Alexandria, 1 European ; Menouf, 2 natives; Mit Ghamr, 1 European ; Zifta, 1
                        European ; Damanhour, 1 native.</p>
                    <p>Yesterday’s bulletin records a fresh case at Alexandria and another at Port
                        Said. The patient at Alexandria is a native bowab of Haret Balaktarieh,

                    <head>ALEXANDRIA'S NEW QUAY. DISPOSAL OF LANDS.</head>
                    <p>The Alexandria Municipality does not intend to sell the new quay and other
                        estates until next October, when, it is hoped, all the local capitalists
                        will have returned from Europe.</p>
                    <p>No arrangements as to the order of the sales have yet been made. Altogether,
                        without counting the roads, the total superficies of land to be disposed of
                        by the Municipality is 150,000 square metres. But of this the Egyptian
                        Government has taken a certain quantity as compensation for the present site
                        of the Alexandria Gouvernorat, the Pallone barracks, etc. Then sites are to
                        be taken over by the Alexandria Municipality to afford access to the quay.
                        No decision has as yet been arrived at as to the date when these important
                        works are to be undertaken.</p>
                    <p>The summer habitation of the Egyptian Government will in future be no longer
                        at the San Stefano Hotel-Casino, as the Ministerial offices are to be housed
                        on the new quay.</p>
                    <p>The Alexandria Municipal buildings will remain on their existing site, as
                        there are no funds available for building an edifice on the new quay.</p>

                    <p>A serious affray is stated to have taken place yesterday in the Moharrem Bey
                        quarter of Alexandria between Greeks and Arabs, and at one time the
                        disturbance threatened to assume serious dimensions. The Alexandria police
                        refuse to give any details to the Press, and on enquiry this morning at the
                        Moharrem Bey caracol all official information was categorically refused. It
                        is stated that blood flowed freely, and that the dispute originated an
                        altercation between a Greek and a cabman. The cabman was assisted by many
                        natives and the quarrel became general. Many Europeans were insulted. As no
                        official information is vouchsafed, we must hold over full details until
                        tomorrow’s issue.</p>

                    <head>SERVICES ON TRINITY SUNDAY.</head>
                    <p>All who were present at the services yesterday would much appreciate the
                        efforts put forth by the members of the choir to make the choral part of the
                        services a real help to the congregation. Tours’ Te Deum was well sung, and
                        Bunnett’s well-known setting for the Magnificat and Nunc Dimittis was joined
                        in heartily by the congregation. The words of the anthem were taken from
                        Isaiah LXV. 17, 18, Revelation XXI. 1, 2, set to music by A. R. Gaul as an
                        air and choral sanctus in the “Holy City.” The solo was taken by Mr. W. F.
                        Sarjeant, who sang the beautiful words with much feeling ; every word could
                        be heard distinctly throughout the church. The chorus, which was the Ter
                        Sanctus, was sung by the whole choir very effectively with care and
                        reverence.</p>

                    <p>The Nile valley has experienced remarkable climatic changes since the

                        been electrical storms of a character hitherto unknown to the country,
                        daring one of which the Khephren pyramid was struck by lightning, an
                        occurrence that has never before been recorded.</p>
                    <p>Aside from its meteorological importance, the event is of particular interest
                        to Philadelphians, as it may result in the complete equipping of the

                        by J. C. Hendrique, who is semi-officially attached to the Egyptian service,
                        about the price and construction of lightning rods turned out by local
                        manufacturers.</p>
                    <p>A lightning rod system for the pyramids would be a pretty big undertaking but
                        eventually it may turn out that the ancient piles will bear superimposed

                        Exploration Fund is still very short of money, and has not yet quite
                        recovered from the depression of a few years ago, remarks : “This is very
                        unfortunate at a moment when every other nation is striving its utmost to
                        ransack Egypt for treasures. England is nominally in occupation of Egypt,
                        but her position there in regard to antiquities is highly unsatisfactory.
                        The Anglo-French Agreement has handed over the Antiquities Department to the
                        control of the French, and there are not likely to be many Englishmen left
                        in that department a few years hence. We have still some very active
                        diggers, but the prizes are going to other races. Dr. Reissner is digging up
                        the Pyramids’ plateau for the Californians, the Italians are at work in the
                        Valley of the Queens, the latest tomb in the Valley of the Kings was dug out
                        by an American, the Germans have built a new house, blessed by the Emperor,
                        close to Thebes and only the English researches lag for want of funds. It is
                        an old cry. </p>

                        Children and parents are abandoning themselves to some months of delicious
                        freedom from work. However, the brain most always be employed ; if not, the
                        mind soon loses its accustomed vigour. Practical people therefore increase
                        their literary collections and perfect themselves in some foreign language,
                        or learn a new one at the Berlitz School at Cairo, 1, Sharia Hamel, or at
                        the Alexandria school 26, Rue de l'Eglise Copte. It is a very profitable
                        distraction. [Advt]</p>

                    <p>The premises of Mr. J. B. Caffari, the Army contractor, forwarding agent,
                        etc, in Ramleh-boulevard and at the corner of rue de l’Eglise Debbane, were
                        burgled last night. The thieves entered the premises by breaking through the
                        double doors of the office. They prised open the safe and emptied it of its
                        contents. It is believed that the safe contained over £100 in gold and small
                        change. The robbers also made away with a Credit Fonoier lottery bond from
                        the safe (No. 887,701), and a large quantity of silver plate, etc., from the
                        shop. No suspicion attaches to anybody.</p>
                    <p>It is strange that the thieves effected their entry and exit without
                        observation, as there are passers-by at all times of the night, and the
                        situation of the premises is very prominent. Mr. Caffari also pays the
                        Alexandria Gouvernorat for the services of a ghaffir, who is supposed to be
                        on duty all night!</p>

                    <p>The work of exploration in Northern Khargeh progresses most satisfactorily.
                        The exploring party has located several extensive sub-terranean water
                        conduits connected by lines of manholes conveying water over a large area,
                        besides other remains of irrigation works, among them a stone-faced well 10
                        feet in diameter giving so copious a supply of water that the means at the
                        command of the exploring party did not permit them to clear it beyond 15
                        feet Trial surface wells have been sunk starting from Ain el Ghazal at Ain
                        Karam Mohamed (where no well (has existed for many years), Kasr Gip, and two
                        other intermediate places. Copious water supplies have been found everywhere
                        at depths never exceeding fifteen feet, while in many places the water which
                        is apparently percolating from the ancient irrigation channels is only one
                        or two feet below the surface. The soil is of the very finest quality and
                        has been highly cultivated in Roman times. The area over which the water
                        supply is thus proved (up to the present) is about 10 square miles.
                        Gardening operations and cultivation at the Deir and No. 1 borehole are
                        progressing satisfactorily, and the chemist to the corporation has now
                        completed the preparation of bulk samples of alums, etc., for despatch to

                    <p>The “Philadelphia Press” remarks : With a desire to indulge in singular
                        effects in costumes and house furnishings, so many women have gone to the
                        Japanese for the styles that the term “singular” no longer applies. Japanese
                        rooms in New York houses and Jap robes for indoor wear have become common.
                        But Mrs. Clarence Mackay has gone in a different geographical direction for
                        a suggestion for a gown. She has designed a costume that might have been
                        worn by a daughter of one of the Pharaohs. Its colors are brown and white
                        and it is embroidered heavily with silver. The skirt is doable. The under
                        one is of brown chiffon, worked in a design often seen in Egyptian
                        decorations and finished with a band of white cloth. The overskirt is of
                        heavy lace. The bodice also is of lace with embroidered shoulder straps. The
                        sleeves are tull and flowing. With this costume Mrs. Mackay wears a necklace
                        of carnelians in quaint settings.</p>
