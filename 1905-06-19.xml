                        arrangements of the Franco-English treaty. Will she prove equally
                        intractable in respect of Egypt? It is true she has no particular interests
                        in Egypt, but it was not hitherto suspected that she had any in

                        his brains out with a revolver about 2 a.m. yesterday. The man had embarked
                        at Algiers and appeared to be in full possession of his senses. When his
                        corpse was discovered yesterday morning, the revolver was clutched in his
                        hand and it was impossible to remove it. He wrote five letters before doing
                        away with himself, one being to his mother, one to his brother, one to the
                        captain of the vessel one to the French Consul, and the other to the Police
                        Commandant. He was found to have £70 in his possession. His body was handed
                        over to the French consular authorities for interment.</p>
                    <p>An Example for Alexandria.—Nothing is ever heard now about the Alexandria
                        Tenants Commission, and the scheme for housing European artizans in model
                        dwellings appears to have been forgotten. Meanwhile an instruc tive example
                        of what can be done comes from Lyons. The Lyons Savings Bank has built in
                        certain overcrowded and insanitary industrial districts in the department of
                        the RhOne a number of model workmen’s dwellings. The houses are of two
                        storeys, with a small garden, and let at from twelve to seventeen francs per
                        month. Every modern improvement has been applied in their construction. Very
                        little timber has been used, and the boarded floors are covered with
                        linoleum. Every dwelling was let as soon as it was ready for occupation, and
                        it is intended to continue the experiment on a larger scale.</p>

                        to-day. The short, square figure of Egypt’s ruler, in a top-hat and frock
                        coat, was hardly recognised by the crowd, but everyone is talking of his
                        gift to the bride, the high diamond tiara with its design of marguerites ,
                        which is one of Princess Margaret's most magnificent presents. </p>

                    <head>DISPOSAL OF LANDS.</head>
                    <p>The Alexandria Municipality does not intend to sell the new quay and other
                        estates until next October, when, it is hoped, all the local capitalists
                        will have returned from Europe.</p>
                    <p>No arrangements as to the order of the sales have yet been made. Altogether,
                        without counting the roads, the total superficies of land to be disposed of
                        by the Municipality is 150,000 square metres. But of this the Egyptian
                        Government has taken a certain quantity as compensation for the present site
                        of the Alexandria Gouvernorat, the Pallone barracks, etc. Then sites are to
                        be taken over by the Alexandria Municipality to afford access to the quay.
                        No decision has as yet been arrived at as to the date when these important
                        works are to be undertaken.</p>

                        at the San Stefano Hotel-Casino, as the Ministerial offices are to be housed
                        on the new quay.</p>
                    <p>The Alexandria Municipal buildings will remain on their existing site, as
                        there are no funds available for building an edifice on the new quay.</p>

                        disturbance threatened to assume serious dimensions. The Alexandria police
                        refuse to give any details to the Press, and on enquiry this morning at the
                        Moharrem Bey caracol all official information was categorically refused. It
                        is stated that blood flowed freely, and that the dispute originated an
                        altercation between a Greek and a cabman. The cabman was assisted by many
                        natives and the quarrel became general. Many Europeans were insulted. As no
                        official information is vouchsafed, we must hold over full details until

                        Bunnett’s well-known setting for the Magnificat and Nunc Dimittis was joined
                        in heartily by the congregation. The words of the anthem were taken from
                        Isaiah LXV. 17, 18, Revelation XXI. 1, 2, set to music by A. R. Gaul as an
                        air and choral sanctus in the “Holy City.” The solo was taken by Mr. W. F.
                        Sarjeant, who sang the beautiful words with much feeling ; every word could
                        be heard distinctly throughout the church. The chorus, which was the Ter
                        Sanctus, was sung by the whole choir very effectively with care and
                        reverence.</p>

                        ransack Egypt for treasures. England is nominally in occupation of Egypt,
                        but her position there in regard to antiquities is highly unsatisfactory.
                        The Anglo-French Agreement has handed over the Antiquities Department to the
                        control of the French, and there are not likely to be many Englishmen left
                        in that department a few years hence. We have still some very active
                        diggers, but the prizes are going to other races. Dr. Reissner is digging up
                        the Pyramids’ plateau for the Californians, the Italians are at work in the
                        Valley of the Queens, the latest tomb in the Valley of the Kings was dug out

                    <head>CAFFARI’S STORES FORCED OPEN.</head>
                    <p>The premises of Mr. J. B. Caffari, the Army contractor, forwarding agent,
                        etc, in Ramleh-boulevard and at the corner of rue de l’Eglise Debbane, were
                        burgled last night. The thieves entered the premises by breaking through the
                        double doors of the office. They prised open the safe and emptied it of its
                        contents. It is believed that the safe contained over £100 in gold and small
                        change. The robbers also made away with a Credit Fonoier lottery bond from
                        the safe (No. 887,701), and a large quantity of silver plate, etc., from the
                        shop. No suspicion attaches to anybody.</p>
                    <p>It is strange that the thieves effected their entry and exit without
                        observation, as there are passers-by at all times of the night, and the
                        situation of the premises is very prominent. Mr. Caffari also pays the
                        Alexandria Gouvernorat for the services of a ghaffir, who is supposed to be
                        on duty all night!</p>

                        they will be hurried to the Yemen, where the war news is still unfavorable

                    <p>The work of exploration in Northern Khargeh progresses most satisfactorily.
                        The exploring party has located several extensive sub-terranean water
                        conduits connected by lines of manholes conveying water over a large area,
                        besides other remains of irrigation works, among them a stone-faced well 10
                        feet in diameter giving so copious a supply of water that the means at the
                        command of the exploring party did not permit them to clear it beyond 15
                        feet Trial surface wells have been sunk starting from Ain el Ghazal at Ain
                        Karam Mohamed (where no well (has existed for many years), Kasr Gip, and two
                        other intermediate places. Copious water supplies have been found everywhere
                        at depths never exceeding fifteen feet, while in many places the water which
                        is apparently percolating from the ancient irrigation channels is only one
                        or two feet below the surface. The soil is of the very finest quality and
                        has been highly cultivated in Roman times. The area over which the water
                        supply is thus proved (up to the present) is about 10 square miles.
                        Gardening operations and cultivation at the Deir and No. 1 borehole are
                        progressing satisfactorily, and the chemist to the corporation has now
                        completed the preparation of bulk samples of alums, etc., for despatch to
                        England.</p>

                    <p>The “Philadelphia Press” remarks : With a desire to indulge in singular
                        effects in costumes and house furnishings, so many women have gone to the
                        Japanese for the styles that the term “singular” no longer applies. Japanese
                        rooms in New York houses and Jap robes for indoor wear have become common.
                        But Mrs. Clarence Mackay has gone in a different geographical direction for
                        a suggestion for a gown. She has designed a costume that might have been
                        worn by a daughter of one of the Pharaohs. Its colors are brown and white
                        and it is embroidered heavily with silver. The skirt is doable. The under
                        one is of brown chiffon, worked in a design often seen in Egyptian
                        decorations and finished with a band of white cloth. The overskirt is of
                        heavy lace. The bodice also is of lace with embroidered shoulder straps. The
                        sleeves are tull and flowing. With this costume Mrs. Mackay wears a necklace
                        of carnelians in quaint settings.</p>
