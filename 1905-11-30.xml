                    <head>GERMANY AND THE NAVY.</head>
                    <p>The German papers do not hesitate to con- sider (say Reuter to-day) that the
                        Emperor William's words in his speech at the opening of the Reichstag were
                        aimed at Great Britain and France. It is, unfortunately, a fixed idea with a
                        considerable proportion of the German people, and especially with those who
                        have taken to heart their Kaiser's declaration that the future of Germany
                        lies upon the water, that England means to destroy the German Fleet before
                        it has become too powerful. Any man who seriously belives that England would
                        ever enter upon a war of aggression for that end is profoundly ignorant of
                        the temper of the British nation. We desire peace with all the world, and
                        with Germany at least as much as with any other Power, for this simple
                        reason- that, apart from the temporary set-back to her commercial activity,
                        Germahy would have 'no' spoils to surrender to a victorious England. The
                        game, in short, would not be worth the candle, because Germany posesses
                        nothing that we could take from her which would be worth the taking. But has
                        England nothing that Germany envies, nothing would be a rish prize for her?
                        The question, surely, an- swers itself. There is the British Empire, which,
                        as German Professors are never weary to tell- ing us, is bound, sooner or
                        later, to go the way of all other Empires in history. "This is the heir;
                        come, let us kill him, and the inheritance shall be ours." That, briefly, is
                        the view of that section of German opinion, official and unofficial, which
                        is responsible for the growth of the German Navy. If any one doubt that, let
                        him recall the attitude of the German Press and public towards England
                        during the Boer War. Nay, the actual preamble of the Navy Act of 1900 proves
                        that the increase of the German Navy is specially directed against England.
                        It says:- "Germany must have a fleet of such strength that a war against the
                        mightiest Power would involve risks threaten- ing the supremacy of that
                        Power." In the face of that declaration, and of the plain teaching of German
                        and Prussian policy in the past, it is the obvious duty of the British
                        Government so to order the distribution of the British Navy as to be
                        prepared for all contin- gencies. That does not mean that we ought to, or
                        that we shall, attack Germany for the deli- berate purpose of destroying her
                        fleet before it becomes too strong; but it does mean that we shall take care
                        that she shall not serve us as she served Austria in 1866 and France in
                        1870. If Germany distructs our intentions is it because she is concious that
                        we have good reason to distruct hers. She knows- she must known- that we
                        cannot choose but regard her with suspicion, because she herself, for years
                        past, has made no secret of her belief that she is pre-destined to be the
                        World Power of the Twentiath Century as England has been of the
                        Nineteenth.</p>

                        <p>There is a panic at the Bourse owning to the heavy fall in prices.
                            Communications with Moscow are interupted, the telegraphists at that
                            city having struck.</p>
                        <p>Two hundred and thirty soldiers of the Military School of Electricity
                            have been arrest- ed and incarcerated in a fortress by four
                            battalions.</p>

                            comprising a historical survey of the dowry and some of its regulations
                            and terms in the old Greek and Roman time, and its modern rules under
                            French law, supplemented by some details of the Mohamedan law concern-
                            ing the "Mahr." The little book appears to be useful to people
                            interested in the subject of which it treats. The author concludes with
                            the following remarks: "Young people can be seen everywhere seeking
                            their fortunes through marriage, and many people prefer to remain
                            bachelors with bright hopes of obtaining for- tunes of dowries, rather
                            than marry a poor or little-moneyed girl, albeit she is pretty, polite,
                            and well-educated. The young man who, in the course of searching for his
                            better half, finds a beautiful, well-dowered, refined, and agreeable
                            wife is one of the happiest of human beings."</p>

                    <p>Sherriff Davidson in Glasgow issued an im- portant judgment on the 21st
                        inst., in an action against the Khedive, who was sued for £2,000 by Mr. A.
                        M. Gordon, naval architect and engineer, of Baltic Chamberg
                        Wellington-street, Glasgow.</p>
                    <p>The action concerns the Khedive's steam yacht Mahrousse, the plaintiff
                        averring that he was employed by the defendant in connection with certain
                        alterations to be made on the yacht, and that he was to be paid £2,000 for
                        preparing plans and seeing the work carried through.</p>
                    <p>Defendant states there were certain dealings between plaintif and the captain
                        of the yacht, but he denied that plaintiff was employed to do the work.</p>
                    <p>An interesting point in connection with the case was that the yacht was
                        arrested in the yard of Messrs. Inglis, Pointhouse, Glasgow.</p>
                    <p>Plaintiss submitted an application asking the court to apply to the Secretary
                        of State for Foreign Affairs for a certificate to the effect that his
                        Highness the Khedive was not an independent Sovereign, and was, therefore,
                        subject to the jurisdiction of the court.</p>
                    <p>The Sheriff refused this application, but closed the record, and allowed a
                        proof as to plaintiff's averment that he has arrested the property of the
                        defendant to find jurisdiction.</p>

                    <head>BANKING IN EGYPT. ANGLO-EGYPTIAN MEEETING.</head>
                    <p>The nineteenth ordinary general meeting of the Englo-Egyptian Bank (limited)
                        was held yesterday week at 27, Clement's lane, E.C., Mr. Thomas Usborne
                        presiding.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman said the total net profit exceeding £100,000. Although that
                        constituted a record, he warned the shareholders that those records could
                        not go on forever. For the last fifteen years or so banking in Egypt had
                        been few, and no bad debts whatever had been made on loans secured by
                        Egyptian real pro- perty. It was almost difficult to make bad debts in a
                        country where the land and other real property were always rising in value
                        and the bulk of the people were getting daily richer, but that position of
                        affairs would reach its zenith one day, and although he would not have them
                        attach too much importance to his opinion, he though the zenith had been
                        reach- ed, and that the value of property was now too high. There were now
                        ten banks, the majority of them important, at work in Egypt, and the
                        directors heard of another- an English one- the prospectus of which would be
                        issued very shortly. The reserve fund was equal to the paid-up capital,
                        £500,000, there were other small reserve funds amounting to £40,000, and
                        they were carrying forward £36,000. With the consent of the shareholders the
                        board intended contributing £50,000 to a proposed pension fund, and to add
                        to it each year until it amounted to £100,000, when they expected the
                        interest would meet the pensions. He concluded by moving the adoption of the
                        report, which was seconded by Mr. H.A. Richardson, and carried
                        unanimously.</p>

                    <p>In the London Bankruptcy Court this day week, before Mr. E.S. Grey, Official
                        Receiver, the first meeting of creditors was held under the failure of
                        Shrager Bros., merchants, of 4 Lloyd's avennue, E.C.</p>
                    <p>The chairman repoted that the firm had carried on business at Calcutta,
                        Colombo, Singapore, Alexandria, and Broome, West Australia. The business was
                        established in 1888 and the turnover had amounted to three of four millions
                        of pounds a year. Proofs amounting to £57,809 had been sent in, but he (the
                        Official Receiver) was unable to state the exact amount of the indebtedness
                        or assets until accounts had been received from the various foreign branches
                        of the business. The London house acted as buying and selling agents for the
                        other branches, the principal lines of business being in jute, gunnies,
                        castor oil, rice, bone-meal, and shellac. The failure was caused by the
                        apparent excellence of this year's jute crop. The London house received
                        large orders from Calcutta to sell for an expected fall in prices; but early
                        in October last, owing to floods in the Goalando district and the
                        disorganisation of railway traffic, Calcutta could not get delivery of jute,
                        and prices rose everywhere. The Official Assignee of Bengal was in
                        possession fo the Indian estate, and it was for the creditors to consider
                        the expediency of having a single adminis- tration.</p>
                    <p>After some discussion, a resolution was unanimously carried in favor of this
                        course being adopted, and Mr. C.J. March, chartered accountant, was
                        appointed trustee.</p>

                    <p>Two native women and six girls were engaged in gathering snails on Tuesday
                        after- noon in Gabbari Gardens, when they were horrified to find the dead
                        body of a man lying on the ground. The man had evidently been strangled. His
                        hands were tied behind his back, and a blue silk handkerchief was firmly
                        fastened round his neck.</p>
                    <p>At the sight of the body, one of the girls promptly ran home and informed her
                        brother of the lugubrious discovery. The latter hasten- ed to apprise the
                        police, who were soon on the spot and opened an enquiry.</p>
                    <p>The murdered man has been identified as Andria Boryas, an Ottoman subject, 35
                        years of age, and a cook by profession. He arrived at Alexandria last
                        Thursday from Turkey. A sum of about 30 dollars was found on his body by the
                        police.</p>
                    <p>Several arrests on suspicion have been made, but no definite clue to the
                        crime has been discovered. It is not known either whether the murder was
                        committed at the spot where the dead man's body had been brought there from
                        the scene of the tragedy.</p>
                    <p>The police are actively pursuing their investigation.</p>

                        <p>Three days ago four men servants who are employed on the Um Rus were
                            assaulted by a band of robbers as they were taking baggage, papers,
                            etc., laden on four camels, to the mine in the mountains. After a fight
                            the attacking party succeeded in obtaining possession of the property
                            and camels, and the men in charge returned and informed the police of
                            the occurrence.</p>
                        <p>Steps were immediately taken for the arrest of the thieves, and men were
                            stationed at every outlet from the mountain. After two days search three
                            of the robbers were arrested with the property and two of the camels in
                            their possession, the other two having been killed. Search is going on
                            for a fourth man, who was the leader of the gang. The men in custody
                            will be brought to Keneh to-day, and an enquiry opened in the
                            affair.</p>

                    <head>ALEXANDRIA CONSERVATOIRE.</head>
                    <p>The third pupil concert of the Alexandria Conservatoire took place last
                        Thursday night and surpassed in excellence the two previous ones. The result
                        was most satisfactory in proving the efficiency of the teaching. The
                        appreciating of the immense audience which thronged the concert hall and
                        vestibule must have greatly delighted Professor Colella and his hard-worked
                        staff. Work want on inces- santly all through the hot, damp summer and
                        autumn, and great credit is due to both pro- fessors and pupils for the
                        successful issue of their arduous studies. When one considers the small
                        pittance received by the masters per month, and the miserably small, stuffy
                        rooms at their disposal (which do not even belong to them but are kindly
                        lent by the University committee), we can but feel astonished at the amount
                        of courage and patience that must have been expended to attain such a result
                        The programme was replete with excellent and interesting numbers, vocal and
                        instrumental, and the selections from Mozart's 'Requiem" and Wagner's
                        'Apostle's Supper' were quite surprisingly well given. The Financial Ad-
                        viser's note, which appeared on the after- noon of the concert, was most
                        opportune, and gave great encouragement to the com- mittee, Professor
                        Colella, and his devoted staff of professors, as also to the small band of
                        50 adherents. There are "better days coming" for the Conservatoire, and all
                        honor is due to those who have manfully stuck to their guns in the days of
                        distress and opposition.</p>

                        <byline>(FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT).</byline>
                        <dateline>Port Sudan, November 19.</dateline>
                        <p>We have to chronicle a triplet of First Events. The quiet and peaceful
                            existence at Port Sudan has been broken. We have had a 7,000- ton ship
                            at anchor in our quickly improv- ing harbour, we have actually had a
                            concert, and, miabile dictu, prepared for a real cricket match. It is
                            true that some few days back, we had an epidemic of bruglaries whcih
                            upset the monotony of life somewhat, and the chance of capturing some
                            enterprising burglar sent one to the heated couch, with subdued
                            excitement and apprehension of all sorts of contingencies, but Fielden
                            Bey issued an edict to the effect that after 9 p.m. (or curfew hour) all
                            people out in the highway and byeways were to carry lamps, or suffer
                            such fines and penalties as he, the High Official aforesaid, might
                            impose, and Allah is God, and Kismet is Fate. Lo__ the Faith- ful no
                            longer lose their property, and the Feringhi High or unimportant, can
                            once more sleep the sleep of the hard worked and just. Actually, the
                            very room of the Majesty of law and order (civil and military) was
                            entered, and a whole trunk of kit removed. Luckily, the Inspector woke
                            up, and the enemy fled, pursued by a good six feet six of solid English
                            wrath, not to mention a rear rank of a very angry Bey and sundry other
                            Government officers woken up from their dreams of cool winds or English
                            snows. So, robberies having ceased, the arrival of a band on the S.S.
                            Afghanistan (Capt. Moore) was promptly made use of, and an engagement as
                            promptly followed, and on the evening of the 15th inst. Fielded Bey and
                            the members of the engineers' mess at Government House asked for the
                            pleasure of the company of some fifty of the residents, at a concert to
                            be held on that date (carriages at 10.30 p.m. might have been added, but
                            our first cariolet and swarthy Jehu have yet to arrive) and The
                            Residence was very prettily decorated by the aid of many flags known and
                            unknown to students of these national trophies, and kudos goes to
                            Messrs. Barry and Campbell, the artists concerned. The orchestra, which
                            deserves mention, was quite a pleasant surprise, for not only did they
                            tackle a programme of distinct class, but played the numbers with
                            well-drilled ensemble and evident respect to the baton of their chef
                            d'orchestre. Of a long programme, the intermezzo of Cavalleria Rusti-
                            cana was delightfully played and well merited the encore. Due
                            appreciation of difference between forte and piano was shown, and the
                            crescendos were distinctly not only weel done but played with artistic
                            enjoyment; other successes were the rarely heard ballet music from
                            Gounod's Faust, Braga's Serenata (for violincello and piano), an
                            excellent violin solo, and the pretty Salut d'Armour." The concert
                            terminated with the good old British songs "The old Folks at Home" and
                            "The Song that Reached my Heart," arranged by the conductor, the oboe
                            and clarinet taking the solos, and the pizzicato accompaniments being
                            dainty and effective. At the conclusion, Fielden Bey was seen to
                            congratulate Mr. Coke on the work of his men. And they deserved it. The
                            audience of over 50 was enthusiastic, even the placud Mohamedans waking
                            up to applaud each item. I ought to mention that the orchestra is going
                            out to play at Bombay, at the new Taj Mahal Hotel there- a treat for its
                            patrons.</p>
                        <p>The harbour works are progressing, and in due time the quays will be
                            ready to receive some ten steamers alongside of them. New houses, too,
                            are springing up on all sides, albeit there is no ground tenure as yet.
                            Until we get an hotel, and electric light, we shall nto be happy.</p>
                        <p>A great disappointment occurred on the 18th inst. The town had challenged
                            the S.S. Afghanistan to play the first game of cricket ever known here.
                            Every preparation was made, a nice tent, iced drinks galore, and
                            hospitality in every shape were, at the hands of our Sports Club,
                            conspicuous. At the last moment the captain of our opponents, Mr. Coke,
                            who is an old school and county player, we heard, turned up to say that
                            the ship was due to sail at mid-day. The law of a ship captain is like
                            unto that of the Medes and Persians, so we could but stand the musical
                            cricketer a cold doch an dorris and wish him every luck in the Farther
                            East.</p>
                        <p>A new firm has arrived, but this time it is not a Greek one. The new
                            arrival, Mr. Warren, is an experienced African traveller, and he is a
                            genial fellow and full of anecdote, who should cut out some of the Greek
                            merchants. We have room for more english commerical enter- prise. I
                            ought to add that as there are some 300 out-of-works- all Greeks or
                            Italians- no one can land and stay here without a passport.</p>

                    <p>There has been a poor demand for Egyptian cotton this week. Quotations,

                    <p><hi rend="italic">American Futures.</hi>- The market this week has
                        experienced remarkable fluctuations, a decline of 20 points was followed by
                        a rise of 50 points, of which subsequently about 12 points were lost upon
                        considerable realisations, but regained later this afternoon. To-day's
                        closing values are generally about 30 points higher than those of last
                        Thursday. A very extensive business has been transacted daily. The decline
                        was due to bear manipulation, upon rumours that the ginners' report would
                        give the quantity ginned to the 14thinst. as 8,000,000 bales or even more,
                        whereas the official estimate published on Tuesday was only 7,500,000 bales.
                        This produced a wild excitement, and an advance as stated above. As
                        apparently a Ginners Report is more or less optional, many may have
                        abstained from making any return; it does not therefore commend itself as
                        reliable information, but the market will await now, with more anxiety than
                        usual, the Bureau report of the 3rd proximo, which estimates the total yield
                        in Lint.</p>

                        <p>Owing to the accidental failure of an irriga- tion bank a railway bridge
                            south of Ghizeh is endangered. Until the water level subsides, which may
                            not be for two or three days, it is impossible to ascertain the extent
                            of the damage: but meanwhile all goods traffic south of Cairo is
                            suspended, and passengers have to walk from one train to another across
                            the bridge.</p>
                        <p>The usual passenger service is working, but trains are delayed about 2
                            hours. Passengers leaving Cairo by the evening train to south do not
                            reach the dining car until about 10 p.m.</p>
                        <p>It is hoped that normal working may be re-established on Saturday, but
                            this is un- certain.</p>
                        <p>Goods from Stations north of Abou El Numros to Stations south of it or
                            vice versa cannot be accented until further notice.</p>

                        <p>While on the one hand news from Russia is less pessimistic, we have now a
                            new feature in the situation in the possible immediate dissolution of
                            the Government. There is no real reason why such an event should alter
                            valuations except in so far as it interferes to some slight extent with
                            industrial affaires. It certainly would seem as if Mr. Balfour's
                            half-measures are unpalatable to the bulk of the party, who have mostly
                            made up their minds yea or nay as to the policy of a fiscal change. As
                            the Liberal party, is successful, are practically pledged to carry on
                            the foreign policy of the present Government, there would not appear to
                            be anything in the outlook to disturb the financial equilibrium.</p>

                            invest in France is reflected in the fact that of the new Japanese loan
                            £12,000,000 will go to Paris, as against £6,500,000 to London, and half
                            of the latter sum to Berlin. This continued investment by the French
                            people in Japanese securities is very interesting and significant.

                        <p>The prices of Home rails have not materially altered, and they are not
                            likely to show any depreciation until the dividends which most of them
                            carry are taken off. Even then, the trade of the country being heavy,
                            the prospect is towards higher rather than lower prices.</p>

                        <p>Following on good trade advices, the American railway market has shown a
                            firmer tone with higher prices prevailing. Copper stocks, particularly
                            Anaconda, are a feature in the rise.</p>

                        <p>The chief feature of the market in Egyptian securities has been the issue
                            of the report of the New Egyptian Company, which was exceptionally
                            favorable, but the general tone of Egyptians has been decidedly weak and
                            flat. Predictions of a slump were not wanting, but no important fail has
                            occurred. A careful review of the various securities which are offered
                            in this market does no appear to give any scope for a very large fall in
                            any of them. Many of these are undoubtedly undervalued. The position of
                            Salt and Soda, in view of the new arrangements with the Government as
                            regards the salt monopoly, may be doubtful,but, so far as we can larn,
                            where the new investment companies have put out their capital, they do
                            not seem to have made any great mistake up to the present, though the
                            securities mostly stand at a discount, apparently without good cause.
                            The successful deal made by the Estates Co. seems not to have had its
                            proper effect upon the shares in this market yet. Abyssinian Bank shares
                            have shown some strength, and it is realised that if profit may not be
                            large at first, they have a very fine concession, which in years to come
                            should prove highly profitable. As there is no free market in so many of
                            these shares, it is necessary to consider the intrinsic position of
                            each, and it certainly would not appear as if they were very much
                            overvalued.</p>
                        <p>We shall be surprised if National Bank of Egypt shares at 25 1/8 do not
                            prove a remunerative investment. Agricultural Banks leave off to-night
                            at 8 3/8, a fall on last week of ½.</p>

                        <p>In the mining market, South Africans, which exhibited a firm tone in the
                            early part of the week, have fallen away again, and were yesterday
                            decidedly weaker, due, it is suggested, to the rumours of an early
                            dissolution of Parliament.</p>
                        <p>There is nothing new to report regarding the Egyptian section. There has
                            been little doing in these shares since our last. Nile Valley, which
                            were quoted last week at ¾, are now odwon to 11/16, but Block "E" are
                            rather better at 5/8. Nile Goldfield are 1/16 lower at ½, and Egyptian
                            Mines have receded to 11s. 9d. United African Exploration, on the other
                            hand, are higher at 1 5/8.</p>

                            fairly rapid, seeing that it is only twenty years since he got his first

                            occasions better results have been obtained. It is reported that the

                            the mouth of the Mississippi to New York, a distance of 1,200 miles, by
                            means of the De Forst system of wireless telegraph. If that can be
                            accomplished it would mean that British warships could nearly always be

                    <p>The report of the directors of the North Nile Valley, Ltd., to the <date
                            when="1905-09-30">30th September</date> last, presented at the meeting
                        of the 27th instant, states that development work has been carried on
                        energetically, and a mining lease of 80 acres at Haimur, at a rental of £E2
                        per acre per annum has been applied for and granted to this company by the
                        Egyptian Government for thirty years as from <date when="1904-10-01">1st
                            October, 1904</date> Up to the present time gold to the value of £3,875
                        has been won from the mine, and, in addition, there is the avaible ore
                        estimated by the engineers, in connection with which it is suggested that
                        arrangements be made with the parent company to crush at their battery. the
                        results obtained by last season's operations were not of a satisfactory
                        character, but the directors believe that the information, which should be
                        obtainable from the developments now being carried out by the Nile Valley
                        Company, will form reliable data upon which to base future policy. In the
                        report of Messrs. Lake and Currie, the engineers, it is stated that the
                        season's work has shown that the ore bodies, although of expectional
                        richness, of small extent, and while it has failed to bring to light any
                        further rich deposits, the vein cut in the bottom of winze N. adit No. 3,
                        gives distinct promise of improvement, as compared with ground immediately
                        above it. The nature of the deposits, however, is such that, situated at a
                        distance from communications, only the richer ore will at present pay to
                        work. Although this rich ore does not occur in sufficient quatities to
                        justify the erection of even a small battery, it will, nevertheless, make
                        good returns if crushed at the Nile Valley Company's mill, distance some
                        eight miles. Messrs. Lake and Curries recommend a limited amount of
                        development of the main working and shaft No. 2 in depth. At the same time
                        the payable ore existing underground should be stoped, and this, together
                        with the rich stone at surface, crushed in the parent company's battery at
                        Um Garaiart. This will necessitate a working arrangement with the Nile
                        Valley Company, which they trust the company may find it possible to effect.
                        The past season's work, although carried out as energetically as possible
                        under the circumstances, has been somewhat handicapped by a shortage of
                        labour, and it has thus not been possible to carry out the full programme of
                        work laid down at the commencement of the season.</p>

                        <p>ST. ANDREW F.C. v. E.T.C. F.C.</p>
                        <p>More than usual interest attached to this match, which was played on the
                            ground of St. Andrew F.C. on Saturday last. There was a fair turn-out of
                            spectators to witness the game, and the supporters of both sides were in
                            evidence. The game created interest because of the fact that the
                            Telegraph team had not yet met with a single reverse during the present
                            season, while the St. Andrew team had still to register their first
                            victory for the season. Both clubs were strongly represented.</p>
                        <p>Jones won the toss, and elected to kick with the sun behind. Byrne kicked
                            off, and the opening stages of the game were confined to midfield. The
                            Telegraph were the first to attack, but play was soon transferred to
                            their territory. Clark for the homesters was troubling the Telegraph
                            defence, and his placing to the wing men was beautifully timed. Lees and
                            Wilmot were steady, however, and cleared again and again. McLean was
                            getting a lot of attention from Byrne little chance to shoot. Blythmen
                            spoiled a lovely chance by lying yards offside. From the free kick Lark
                            got possession, and he and Tullocj took the ball well down toward
                            Dowson. Tulloch drew both upon him, then, parting with the ball to
                            centre. Clark took up the pass and netting the first goal of the match.
                            A few minutes later Clark had the goal again at his mercy when he was
                            rather nastily brought down by Lees. The visitors now got away, and
                            McLean looked well for for scoring when Hopkins intercepted. Byrne then
                            had a try at Curtis's charge, but Davis got in the way, and play was
                            again transferred. Jones and Rofe were doing good work on the Saints'
                            left, and Dawson had difficultly in clearing Rofe's effort. Clark was
                            again fouled by Lees, who seemed to have him very carefully marked. The
                            Telegraph forwards were combining very well, and some clever play was
                            witnessed. Their passing was very accurate, but they had the fault of
                            hanging too long on the ball, and time after time the Saints' halves
                            were beaten, the backs were never found wanting, and at no time in the
                            first half were the visitors really dangerous at goal. An accident to
                            Lark caused a brief stoppage. Half time arrived with the ball in
                            midfield and with no alteration to the score.</p>
                        <p>The teams re-started after the usual interval and the Telegraph
                            immediately assumed the aggressive. Lark was unable to resume play, and
                            Incleton kindly granted permission for the inclusion of the Saints'
                            reserve man to fill the vacancy. The Telegraph for some time had the
                            better of matters, but the forwards seldom had a chance of shooting.
                            What did come Curtis's way was handled in clever fashion, but the
                            Telegraph had hard lines when Blythman rushed upon Curtis while the
                            custodian was clearing, intercepting the kick, the ball rebounding just
                            over the bar. Later McLean put one well across from the wing which
                            Curtis cleared smartly. Byrne then sent in a rocket, which hit the bar.
                            Lees, in his anxiety to assist his team, was lying between his halves
                            and forwards, a circumstance which necessitated the Saints' forwards
                            keeping well back in order to avoid being ruled offside. Lark was missed
                            in the front line too, and in consequence the homesters could seldom get
                            away. Clark made one or two efforts to rally the front line, but was too
                            carefully watched to make much headway. When he did break away, Lees was
                            not over particular as</p>
                        <cb n="4"/>
                        <p>to the manner in which he pulled him up. The Saints forced a corner,
                            which was well placed by Rofe, but Milmott cleared. Later a foul against
                            Lees for pushing looked dangerous. Davis took the kick, but it proved
                            fruitless. With 10 minutes to go, Curtis met with an accident which
                            caused a brief stoppage. The Telegraph continued to press, but the
                            Saints' defence was more than equal to the visitors' attack, and the
                            game ended leaving St. Andrew's winner by one goal to nil.</p>
                        <p>Few forward lines would have made much more impression on the Saints'
                            back division of last Saturday, and tehre is no necessity for the E.T.C.
                            to take a despondent view of the failure of their front rank to get a
                            goal. Cowie's breaking up of the Telegraph combination fif a power of
                            good for his side. He tackled with unfailing accuracy and made numerous
                            praiseworthy efforts to get his forwards going toward the Telegraph
                            goal.</p>
                        <p>The Telegraph front rank all did well, and it would be unwise to single
                            out any individual member of the quintette for special mention. Townsend
                            was their best half, and Wilmot played a very good game at back. Dowson
                            was not greatly tested.</p>
                        <p>The Saints' halves were seen to best advantage in the initial portion of
                            the game, and again later stages of the second half. Forward the Saints
                            showed a decided improvement on any of their past performances, but they
                            were unfortunate to be deprived of the services of Lark during the
                            second half of the game. Clark at cestre played a dashing game, and
                            rather smartly clinched the goal that won the match. Rofe and Jones
                            combined very well on the laft and but for the fouling tactics of Lees,
                            might have made better headway. In Hopkins, Davis, and Curtis, the
                            Saints have a defence that it will be hard to beat, and all three played
                            a cool, confident game throughout.</p>
