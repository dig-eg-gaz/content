                    <head>SUDAN TRADE AND TRADE ROUTES </head>
                    <p>Some interesting reflections are suggested by the article on Sudan trade in
                        another column of today's issue. In any arrangements for the development of
                        trade, railways most always take a prominent place, and so much has
                        beenhbeard of the Red Sea-Nile Railway that it may perhaps not be
                        inopportune to enquire into the relative advantages offered by this route as
                        against the present means of communication via Alexandria, Port Said, and
                        Suez. We do not intend to touch upon the Political aspect of the question,
                        other than to say that both the harbour and railway works are a natural
                        consquence of a settled and far- scing administration, and that similarly to
                        the building of the line from Haifa to Khar- toum, so will the completion of
                        this project remain a tribute to the prompter and to the executors concerned
                        in the undertaking.</p>
                    <p>Looking, however, to immediate results, say for the five years following on
                        the opening of the line, it promises no commercial advan- tages over the
                        existing route. On the contrary, the freight will be higher and the duration
                        of the journey longer. Liverpool and London steamers ask 15s. more per ton
                        to Sualin than to Alexandria and stipulate transhipment at the latter port
                        Antwerp lines demand 55 frs per ton in addition to the ordinary rate to
                        Alexandria. The Austrian Lloyd hand their goods for Suakin over to the
                        Khedivial Line at Port Said, the Khedivial vary naturally retaining
                        two-thirds of the total rate from Trieste to Suakin. Only vessels
                        occasionally carrying full Government cargo, perhaps also the
                        Florio-Rubattino Line, will call direct at Suakin, and it will be years
                        before inland trade and commerce will be remune- rative enough to render
                        Sheikh Barghoot a regular port of call. It is expected that some of the
                        Abyssinian trade miy be diverted towards Suakin, but apparently the Austrian
                        Lloyd do not share this opinion, as they are making arrangements to develop
                        Abyssinian traffic via Tadjurs Bay and to establish a regular line through
                        that channel. Nor in the matter of the export of gum can Suakin compete with
                        Sues in facilities. At the latter port all homeward-bound vessels have to
                        call for provisions, to land and embark passengers, and to unload their
                        heavy cargoes for distribution all over Egypt In order to replete their
                        holds, they practically take in gum at ballast rates and for all
                        destinations. It is, further, not to be overlooked that fully half of this
                        staple product is taken up by Cairo dealers, who as- sort and otherwise
                        handle the gum at Cairo before reshipment.</p>
                    <p>In a spirit of competition, Nile navigation companies can always afford to
                        further lower their rates for gum as well as for general merchandise via
                        Alexandria and Halfa, and the Egyptian Railways Administration may also see
                        its way to make a reduction rather than forego the business altogether. The
                        remark has been thrown out that the railway rate between the junction at
                        Damer or Berber to Halfa could be increased, but one can hardly credit the
                        authorities as being keen on such an artificial measure, which would be more
                        productive of harm than good, and little likely to attain the object
                        desired.</p>
                    <p>As for tourists, Suakin is of no consequences, unless some travellers from
                        India care to "do" the Sudan and Egypt from that point; but few firat-class
                        steamers could afford to call unless they carried a fair number of
                        passengers booked in that direction, and that is very questionable. The
                        risks generally, to both passengers and freight, are greater via Suakin than
                        by the Nile route, and the journey is rougher and longer. Cotton exports,
                        too, can be rele- gated for consideration beyond the tens of our review.
                        There will be nothing of any magnitude for another five years at least For
                        the Public Works, however, the new line should prove both convenient and
                        economical, as also for the import of heavy and bulky mater- ials of all
                        descriptions. A great impetus will necessarily be given to the conveyance
                        and introduction of Bengal coal. The fuel question, in fact, appears to be
                        an argent matter, but that again is primarily for Government re- quirements.
                        This is of no momentary interest to the public at large, nor will it be till
                        the time when there is a free supply of water for irrigation purposes. The
                        main feature therefore of the Suakin harbour and railway is concentrated in
                        the fact of their being the earnest commencement of a network of public
                        works in the country, of which this will famish a most important link.</p>

                    <p>We are glad to be able to announce that the excitement which prevailed
                        yesterday among the "abonnes" of the Alexandria and Ramlah Railway has in a
                        great measure subsided, and the various sentiments, ranging from wild
                        defiance to passive but indignant submission, have now given way to a
                        conviction that we are within measurable distance of a peaceful settlement
                        of the question. The public is awaiting with great interest the results of
                        this afternoon's deliberations of the board of direc- tors of the company,
                        which will meet at 4 o'clock, when a decision will be arrived at in regard
                        to the establishment of a definite tarif which will satisfy the legitimate
                        demands of the public. Boghos Pasha Nubar, the chairman of the company, is
                        now on his way from Cairo to attend this afternoon's meeting.</p>

                    <head>THE POLICE AND THB PUBLIC</head>
                    <p>Throughout yesterday morning a posse of the Alexandria City Police remained
                        at the Alexandria terminus of the line and a large number of "proces
                        verbaux" were drawn up against recalcitrant Ramlehites who insisted on
                        travelling without paying their fares. A climax was reached shortly after
                        noon, when a scene of considerable excitement ensued, as large numbers of
                        the Ramlehites were flocking to the terminus in order to get home to their
                        mid- day meal. Some of them showed signs of defiance and tried to pass
                        through the gates without tickets in spite of the efforts of the police.
                        They forced the police cordon and made for the cars with a rush. They
                        succeeded in boarding the cars and triumphantly got off to Ramleh without
                        having to submit to the exactions of the company.</p>

                    <head>THE TENSION IS RELIEVED.</head>
                    <p>At 2 p.m. the company, seeing that the presence of the police appeared to
                        aggravate the exasperated feelings of the Ramlahites, asked the Commandant,
                        Miralai Hopkinson Bey, to withdraw his men from the station. This was done
                        and the wise step appeared to greatly relieve the feeling of extreme
                        tension. Immediately afterwards the delegates of the Ramlehites distributed

                    <head>PEACE IN SIGHT.</head>
                    <p>After the publication of this manifesto, it was felt that the most acute
                        stage of the crisis had been passed, and the excitement that had hitherto
                        prevailed began to gradually fizzle away, to be replaced by more calm
                        feelings. We are happy to state that the attitude of both is becoming more
                        and more conciliatory and the feeling appears to be gradually gaining ground
                        that some modus vivendi will be ulti- mately discovered, for there is no
                        doubt that the new tarif cannot be maintained. A a sign of the improvement
                        in the outlook, we may mention that the company did not make any application
                        for extra police this morning at the Alexandria terminus, which has resumed
                        its wonted peaceful ap- pearance.</p>

                    <p>Le service de traction entre Alexandrie et Ramleh fut assume par l'A &amp;
                        R.R. Co. Ld, en date du 28 Juin 1883 et ensuite un nouveau contrat fut paste

                    <p>Quand la concession initiale fut accordee en 1860, Ramleh etait presque on
                        desert et il est concevable que l'on ne se soit pas preoccupe d'imposer a la
                        Compagnie un Cahier des Charges.</p>
                    <p>Aujourd'hui Ramleh a pris un developpe- ment considerable et il est de toute
                        necessite que ce Cahier des Charges soit impose a une Compagnie faisant un
                        service publiq de cette importance.</p>

                        longuemeut souf- fert par suite de ce manque d'un Cahier des Charges et nous
                        nous limitons a enumerer a V.E. les privileges exorbitants dont jouit la
                        Compagnie.</p>

                    <p>La seule enumeration de ces privileges, ajoutes au droit de menopole,
                        demontrers a V.E. qu'il est urgent, en presence des reclama- tions unanimes
                        d'une population irritee, de prendre les mesures necessaires pour mettre un

                        dividendes.</p>
                    <p>Il resulte de ces privileges que la Compagnie peut d'un trait de plume faire
                        hauseer ou baisser les prix des terrains et des maisons de Ramleh et de
                        l'Ibrahimieh, qu'elle peut ruiner des quartiers populeux; quelle peut

                        annee.</p>
                    <p>Elle a etabli que les abonnees de 1re Classe qui payaient P.T. 950 par an

                        de 3me Classe qui payaient P.T. 570 par an paieront P.T. 1100.</p>
                    <p>Ce tarif est prohibitif pour la classe la plus nombreuse d'abonnes dont
                        beaucoup devront renoncer a habiter Ramleh tout en y ayant des
                        proprietes.</p>

                        Alexandria. Mr. P. Llewellyn, formerly manager of the French Bank of Brazil

                        the necessary preparations and will assume the management of the branch

                        was very good, and the supper arrangements and buffet were up to the
                        standard set by all the other accessories. The decora- tions, toilettes, and
                        uniforms made a very striking picture, and the dancing was as ani- mated as
                        it could be, while the Bracale or- chestra played in period time. Of course,
                        the cotillon was the event of the evening and was led by Mme. Adolphe

                    <p>The Stock Markets are so closely associated with political matters that we
                        most crave indulgence if from time to time we refer to the latter. Those who
                        look ahead are not at all happy as to the outcome of the finan- cial
                        position in Russia. Another loan for £25,000,000 is on the eve of being
                        launched, report says on the 12th January-this time in Berlin—4 1/2 per
                        cent. Bonds at 95. This will materially increase the weight of the prodi-
                        gious "Baby'' now resting on "Dame Europe's" lap. France, and her neighbor
                        are so heavily involved that they cannot afford to let the issue be anything
                        but a so-called success. If it were not for this we do not suppose Russia
                        would be able to obtain within 20 or 30 points of this price for the issue.
                        The cost of the war to Russia has so far been estimated at 100 millions, but
                        we know from sad experience that these estimates are well below the mark,
                        and that the real figure is generally nearly double. With the internal
                        troubles increasing throughout the country, the Russian Govern- ment will be
                        having its hands full at home as well as abroad. The peace negotiations are
                        for the moment going slow—so that altogether one is not surprised if the old
                        posesores in the financial world are inclined to shake their grey beads in
                        an ominous fashion. The general tone of the market is wonderfully firm,
                        exceptionally so far the end of the year. South Africans look like opening
                        the New Year with higher prices. All the leading pro- perties good and hold
                        their prices well although business is small at present. The Continent has
                        been a persistent buyer of Gold- fields. The break in cotton which has
                        resulted from over-production in America caused a sharp set-back in Egyptian
                        Stocks yesterday, Bank shares especially drop- ping back nearly a point from
                        Wednesday's closing prices, Agriculturals opening 9, and Nationals 22. There
                        was some support at these prices and a consequent recovery of about 1/2 in
                        both cases which is fully maintained. Delta Lands, in spite of the
                        forthcoming increase of capital by £150,000, keep their price well at 2 1/2,
                        and Dairy Sugar remain firm and are likely to go higher. There has been some
                        demand for Nile Land and Agricultural Co.'s shares which stand at about 8,
                        but there is little or no free market in them at present. Corporation of
                        Western Egypt shares are being quoted at a premium, but sotive deal- ings
                        cannot be looked for until the turn of the New Year. Egyptian Mines are a
                        shade steadier, although Nile Valley shares are rather dull in tendency, doe
                        to the fact that the jobbers did not consider the annual meet- ing as
                        satisfactory as it might been. Americans are firm again. Consols are dis-
                        tinctly good, and investment stocks are all firmer, the chief factor being
                        cheap money.</p>

                        mon eminent confrere et ami, M. Loatfi bey Ayrout, a exprim4 un desir qui

                        population de l'Egypte. On ne saurait trop insister sur le bien fonde de la
                        theorie qu'il a soulevee.</p>
                    <p>Il est interessant de remonter a ce propos a l'origine des Tribonaux de la
                        reforme. Dans son projet de 1867, adresse aux puissances, Nubar Pacha
                        demandait pour lee nouveaux Tribunaux le droit de connaitre de toutes les
                        infractions commises par les Europeans, quelle que soit leur nature; il
                        demandait, en principe, l'abrogation complete des capitulations.</p>
                    <p>La commission qui sieges a Paris du 8 Novembre au 3 Decembre 1867 reconnut,
                        dans sa decision, la necessite d'obtenir en Egypte l'unitfe de legislation
                        et de juridiction; elle approuva l'etabllisement des tribunaux mixtes, mais
                        elle refuse une competence aussi etendue que celle proposee dans le rapport
                        de Nubar. Neanmoins, celui-ci ne se decourages pas et en Nfianmoins,
                        oelnl-ci ne se dfioouragea pas ettrn 1869 obtint la reunion au Cairo d'une

                    <head>SUDAN TRADE. AN INTERESTING REPORT.</head>
                    <p>It is interesting to oompore the state of the Sudan trade as it is today,
                        with the conditions existing 20 yean ago, before the Mahdi'a rebellion. The
                        latest report dealing with those former times is that dated 1888, written by
                        Col. Stewart, who accompanied <persName>General Gordon</persName> on his
                        last expedition to the <placeName>Sudan</placeName>, and who was afterward*
                        murdered while attempting to meet the British forces sent to relieve Khar-
                        toum. In this report Col. Stewart gives the revenue for the year 1882 as
                        L.E. 508,000, and the expenditure as LR 600,000, making a deficit of nearly
                        LB. 100,000. In 1903 the revenue was LB. 462,000 and the expenditure LB.
                        618,000, leaving a deficit of LB.156,000.</p>
                    <p><persName>CoL Stewart</persName> describes the trade of the Sudan as being
                        considerable, and, under normal conditions, with a tendency to increase, but
                        greatly bamporod by the slave, trade, which necessitated the closing of the
                        White Nile to all traders for some years, thereby making a sort of
                        Government monopoly of the Eqoato- rial trade. Other roads had also to be
                        ooba- tionally closed in order to prevent the export of slaves. The
                        difficulty of communications was also extremely great at this period, so
                        much so that in the excellent oorn-growing district between the White and
                        Blue Nile the grain was often allowed to rot in the ground, though it might
                        be selling at famine prioes in other districts.</p>
                    <p>Cotton was grown in sufficient quantities for local consumption, in the
                            <placeName>Berber</placeName>, <placeName>Kassels</placeName>, and
                            <placeName>Ghedaref </placeName>districts ; and tobacco was reported os
                        doing well in Senaar. At one time large quantities of salt and nitre were
                        exported to Egypt from the Western dfstriota, but the salt trade was
                        suppressed by the Egyptian Govern- ment, as it interfered with tho salt
                        monopoly. The only manufacture was a light ootton cloth mado at Longola and
                        callod "Tamur."</p>
                    <p><persName>Col. Stewart</persName> gives tables of tho import and export trado
                        of the Sudan for the yean 1879, 1880, and 1881, which give a fair idea of
                        the conditions at that time, though the figures are probably neither quite
                        accurate nor oompleto. Unfortunately the imports and exports are, with a few
                        exceptions, expressed in quantity,' not in value, and the measure is of a
                        varying nature ; cantors, ardobs, rotla, okes, pieces, and bundles, all
                        appearing on the list, and making a general comparison with the trade of
                        today extremely difficult</p>
                    <p>The products of the Sudan wore import- ed and exported either from Suakin, or
                        by the Nile Valley, chiefly by the formpr route; and at the time CoL Stewart
                        drew up his report, trade was already declining, owing to tho unsettled
                        state of the ooun- try. Very few figures are given at all for 1882, tho
                        latent complete year boing 1881.</p>
                    <p>To begin with the exports : By far the largest item of tho export tptdo, then
                        as now, was gum, 138,000 cantors having been export- ed from
                            <placeName>Suakin</placeName> in 1881, and over 120,000 cantors through
                            <placeName>Korosko</placeName>, making a total ex- port of nearly
                        151,000 cantors. Ten years later, in 1901, the trade had recovered itself,
                        and 171,000 cantors wore again exported, in 1902 it reached 220,000 cantors
                        ; (but it fell ofT a little in 1903, which is said to be due to a bad
                        harvest in Kordofan, and also to the European markets being
                        overstocked).</p>
                    <p>The next most important export was ivory, of which 1874 cantors were sent
                        from tho Bahr el Ghaialand Equatorial Provinces in 1881. Fortunately Col.
                        Stewart has, in- this care, given us tho money value, which amounts to LB.
                        63,485. The prices given in different districts in different years vary from
                        LB. 17 to LE. 35 per cantor, and are probably quite arbitrary. Tho
                        total-quantity of ivory export- ed from Egyptduriog 1903 was 41,641 kilos
                        and was valued by the Customs at LE. 26,242, which works out roughly at
                        about LE. 28 per cantor.</p>
                    <p>86 cantors of gutto pereba from the Bahr el Ghaial Province in 1881 are
                        estimated at LE. 693, or less than LB. 7 per cantor, which seems an
                        extraordinarily low value.</p>
                    <p>Ostrich feathers are valued at over LB 4 per rotl (rather less than our lb,),
                        and as Col. Stewart gives the total export from Korosko as 57 cantors, this
                        item alone (if the figures are oorroct,) should have been worth over LB
                        22,000. The export from 8uaki only amounted to 84 rotla. The 11,895 kilos of
                        ostrich feathers exported from Egypt in 1903 were estimated atLB 24,449, so
                        the value ha considerably decreased in the last ten years. Betides the
                        above-mentioned articles (and in addition to the ootton referred to in a
                        previous number of our journal) a certain amount of Senna, tobacco, bides of
                        various sorts, rhino ceros horns, and hippopotami teeth were ex- ported,
                        also a considerable quantity of mother- of pearl shells (given as 357,171
                        "piaoes"), and 18,000 okes of beeswax obtained from Abyssi- nia. Another
                        article that figure* largely in earlier years is butter; only 1,726 okes are
                        recorded for 1881, but in 1879 50,000 okes were sent away horn Suakin.</p>
                    <p>To tarn to the imports; the figures for the year 1881 do not give a fair idea
                        of the trade before the rebellion, there being a mark'd falling off from the
                        level of the two previous yeara, in a considerable number of articles. The
                        local disturbances appear to have affect* d the import trade at an earlier
                        period, and more injuriously than the exports.</p>
                    <p>Probably the most interesting item* are the ootton and woollen goods. The
                        former amounted to over 26,000 cantors in 1881, against 20,000 in 1879 ; the
                        woollen goods to 380, an advance on both the previous years. The linen and
                        silk good* were very trifling in quantity. 21,000 pieoes of clothing are
                        recorded, but this is too vague to be instructive. There are various arti-
                        cles of attire which stand at a high figure, no toblyj 16,000 pairs of boot*

                    <p>In 1879, 6,000 cantors of petroleum were imported, also 1,750 canton of

                        <p>Dear Sir,—1 happened to read the reprint in the Gazette of a report from
                            the Daily Mail, concerning Berlin, and especially Rixdorf. 1 may tell
                            yon that the honorable Mr. Alderson, who was in Rixdorf, has very well
                            observed, but unfortunately some details hare escaped him. We beg to
                            report them to your readers supplementary. If Mr. A should have oome to
                            the Rixdorf palaces half-an-hour later and stayed for dinner, he would
                            no doubt have seen on overy table 'tunle soup and venidoo with a golden
                            spoon."</p>
                        <p>Tha provision store of Borehardt, purveyor to his Majesty, furnishes the
                            working people with these dainties. Of late a decline of price of this
                            merchandise has taken plaoe because the people grew tired of it and
                            preferred tar a time porridgs and potatoes. The house of Gertan's,
                            purveyors to his Ma- jesty, provides the people with the hangings and
                            the staff Mr. A so greatly admired, and having so largely profited by
                            the working class- es a Smyrna oarpst has been given as a Christmas
                            present to every family and a seal cape to every grandmother, for old
                            people al- ways fael odd. How glad Mr. A. would foal if he oould but see
                            it.</p>
                        <p>Every Rixdorf workman smokes cigars from Book's or Upmanls and every one
                            of them has a safe in the Bank of Germany. Your Mr. A. is a sharp
                            observer; as long a* tho world goes there sre but two his equals,
                            Munchausen and Jules Verne. Wishing you a happy New Year.</p>

                            ulikelyloarousethoangerol the learned world against not only the
                            Alexandria Archioo- logical Society, the authorities of the Alexandria
                            Muscumandtbeowner uttbe temple's site, but also against the Department
                            of Antiquities of tho Egyptian Government, for having been so remiss in
                            its duties towards one of the most interesting temples of the Ptolemaio
                            epoch. Early in the summer, inspired by the announce- ment which 1 road
                            in your columns of the disoovery of this temple, 1 paid a visit to
                            Aboukir during a short stay at Alexandria, and at once came to the
                            oonolusion that the ruins were those of the temple erected Jo the
                            deified sister-wife ot Ptolemy Philodelphus by Callicrates on tho
                            Zephyrian forelaud, half-way be- tween tho Pharos of Alexandria and the
                            Canopio month of the 'Nile, as is recorded in a Greek epigram from a
                            papyrus. From* com- parison of tho description of the site as given by
                            Strabo and Stephanos Byzantios with the epigram from the Fimin-Didot
                            papyrus, it is clear that this is the temple, renowned for the romantic
                            offering of the looks of Berenioe, which inspired the oelebratod poem of
                            Calli- machus, that has survived through the trans- lation of Catalina
                            There is a tragic irony ot a twofold character to the praaent plight of
                            this once famous tone. The poem whereby the templo become renowned in
                            literature is described by Professor Robinson Rllis as "a scientific not
                            less than a poetical tribute paid by learning to the founders and
                            supporters of the Museum" of Alexandria. Yettheauthorities of tho
                            present Museum of Alexandria have allowed the remains of tho temple to
                            be irre- trievably rained by their indifference. Another touch of irony
                            is seen in the fact that the site of the temple is now in the possession
                            of a Prince of os Macedonian an origin,as wcrePlrila- delphus and
                            Euergetes. It is amazing that the Egyptian Government should be so
                            engrossed in its efforts to increase the more material interests of the
                            country, that it neglects to preserve the prioeleaa relios of the past.
                            Por my part I do not think wo should aoeuw Alexandrians or their
                            Archcologioal Society. It is surprising that snob a materially-minded
                            city should possess even the rudiments of snob an institution. But it is
                            the authorities at Cairo who are to be blamed, for having failed, when
                            the temple was discovered in the spring, to at once take all the
                            necessary precau- tions lot safeguarding tho remains and expro- priating
                            the land. Yours truly, Cairo, January 8,</p>
