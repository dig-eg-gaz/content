The services of the Chamber are always at the disposal of any member desiring information on trade matters generally, including the question of appointing suitable agents. As no fee is charged for such advice, it is obviously in the interests of all British traders here to become members, especially when it is remembered that the annual subscription is merely the nominal one of £1. The latter payment also includes a copy of the monthly Journal issued by the Chamber. Homo enquirers can obtain further particulars from our London office, 36, New Broad-street, which acts as agents to the Chamber.</p>

                        <p>Some time ago, on the transfer of the Daira Sanieh lands to the Daira Sanieh Company, the inhabitants of four villages comprised in the above teftish sent a petition to the former administration protesting against the sale of their lands, alleging that these belonged to them by right and that they had been unjustly deprived of them some sixty years ago by the Viceroy Mohamed Ali, and that later the lands were incorporated with those of The Daira Sanieh of the Khedive Ismail. The administration granted the petitioners’ request by leasing the lands in perpetuity to the inhabitants at a very low rental, equivalent to the Government tax. Oar Cairo Correspondent states that the authorities have now decided upon returning the lands in question to the rightful owners, the conditions being that they pay half the estimated cost in 20 yearly instalments with interest at 5 per cent, plus the usual tax. The of the properties in question is 12.000 feddans. and their present value is estimated ₤50 the feddan.</p>
                        <p>Oar Correspondent adds that it is probable that the Government will ask the Agricultural Bank or the National Bank to undertake the sale of these lands, and The collection of the annuities as they become due. Some of the native papers express their approval of the settlement of this long-standing dispute, and praise the Government for the equitable way in which it has arranged matters.</p>

                        <head>INTERESTING INTERVIEW.</head>
                        <p>Mr. W. McMillan, the well-known American explorer, who arrived in Cairo last week from England with bis party, is leaving there tomorrow for Port 8aid to join the P. &amp; Q. steamer Persia, by which the expedition proceeds to Aden, and thence by British India steamer to Mombasa, and from the latter port by rail to their destination. The other members of the party are Messrs. Bulpett, Jessen, Bayliss, Kay, Marlow, and Towell.</p>
                        <p>In an interview with one of these gentlemen on Saturday, our Cairo correspondent elicited some interesting particulars of a country still very little known to the outside world.</p>
                        <p>Last year Mr. McMillan paid a visit to this same oountry, and was so struck with it that he is now returning to take ap a tract of land 15,000 acres in extent, which he and two others of The party have purchased from the Protectorate of British East Africa with the intention of introducing ostrich farming on an extensive scale. This part of the country is admirably adapted to ostrich farming, and also farming in general, as a great portion of it consists of lands naturally fertile, and resembles some of the most beautiful districts of southern England in its picturesqueness. The property acquired is situated 35 miles to the north east of Nairobi, the capital of the Protectorate, and 330 miles distant from the coast,on the Attir plains, close to the Donyo-Sabuk mountain ranges which is 1,500 feet above the plain, the mountain itself being 5,000 feet above sea level. The rainy season Lasts for three months in these districts, from the beginning of April to the end of June, and daring this period the rainfall is about 25 metres. The rest of the year the climate may be described as almost perfect, the nights being cold and the thermometer falling about 35° Fahrenheit Nairobi is 30 hours distant from Mombasa by the Uganda railway. Mr. Mc Millan intends raising his first stock of ostriches by incubation; the eggs of the wild birds will be gathered by trained natives and placed under incubators, of which a large munber are being taken out by the party, and in this way it is hoped to get in time a fine race of ostriches, equalling in plumage and value those of South Africa. He is of opinion that most parts of British Bast Africa are most suitable for European colonisation, and thinks that the Zionists made a great mistake in declining the generous offer made them by the British Government lately of a free grant of a large tract of country.<p>
                        <p>We wish the adventurous American explorer and his party every success in this their first attempt at colonisation, and the opening up of an almost unknown district to civilisation.<p>

                        <p>The inquest touching the death of Tom, Peter,who committed suicide at the San Stefano Casino at 8 p.m. on Friday, took place at the Deaconesses’ Hospital on Saturday.</p>
                        <p>The jurors were Messrs. Douglas Allen, H. S. Martin and Otho. S. Constantino. After the body had been viewed by the jurors it was identified by The manager of the San Stefano Casino as that of a man he bad seen at 8.9 p.m. lying dead on the beach in front of the between the gentlemen’s and the ladies’ bathing place, with a revolver containing three undischarged and two empty cartridge cases beside him.</p>
                        <p>One bullet was sticking in the forehead of the deceased, the other had penetrated his heart. From the medical evidence it appeared that the deceased had died of a self inflicted wound. He was presumably of about 85 years of age and had P.S. tattooed on one of his arms. In his pockets were found a registered postal packet addressed to Mrs. Schablousky of Arnold Street, Liverpool, and some postal odrders made out to Joanna Shcablousky, also of Liverpool. The deceased has been given at Paris a passport to travel in Russia, which had been visaed by the Russian consularauthorities, on the strength of a passport from Christiania., He is described in the Paris passport as a British subject named Tom Peter, resident in Ceylon, and a Christian by religion. As some doubt was fait whether the deceased was really a British subject it was decided to adjourn the inquest sine die pending farther enquiries.</p>
