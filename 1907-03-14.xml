              Trains run alongside the steamers on the quay, and passengers can be conveyed to
              Famagusta, Nicosia, Morphou and intermediate stations. Good hotel accommodation
              for tourists is provided at Famagusta, at the Savoy Hotel (Mr. Najem Houry
              proprietor). Olympus Hotel, Mount Troodos, 6000 ft. above the sea. Magnificent
              Scenery. Perfect climate. Season May to end of October. For information apply to
              Mr. Najem Houry, Managing Director of Cyprus Hotel Co., Army Contractor,
              Limassol, Cyprus. There is a good carriage road from Kopia (on Railway) to
              Troodos. At Famagusta may be seen the fine old Latin Cathedral (now a mosque)
              begun in 1300 and finished in 1312, together with other ancient ruins and the
              Venetian fortifications, the finest in the world. Also the tower or palace, the
              scene of “Othello'' and of Ford's “Lover's Melancholy.'' The climate of Cyprus
              in the winter months is delightful and the Island will well repay a visit.

              <p>EGYPTIAN PROGRESS AND RADICAL CRITICS.</p>
              <p> Mr. J. M. Robertson, M.P., is contributing • series of articles to one of the newspapers in bis constituency on 
                the British control of Egypt. The first of this series of articles will be found in another column of to-day's 
                issue After enunciating a number of truisms about che Government of this country interspersed with due tributes 
                to Lord Cromer 8 work he binds up with the conclusion that, inasmuch as the material prosperity and financial 
                solvency of the country have not been accompanied by moral and intellectual progress, therefore there is something
                rotten in the state of Egypt. This Radical critic of Anglo-Egyptian admi: nistrative methods falls into the common 
                error of all his political kith and kin Their enthusiasms are generous but dangerous because they are based on

                because Egypt prefers its old ethos, despite the fact that externally and financially all is changed, therefore there is something very wrong in Anglo-Egyptian methods. The truth is that we have been forced by circumstances to introduce western methods and ought not to expect immediate results. If we have been obliged to force the pace of external reform, it does not follow that the country ought necessary. arily to show a similar degree of progress, intellectual and ethical.

              <p>know the influence of climate, and that, too
                may have had its share in differentiating the Ftwo racoa. The true reason, the elemental
                factor of the everlasting unchangeableness of Egypt, may be probably sought in the circumg
                the distance that she possesses one single source o Jo.. life, to which every living thing must conform
                or vanish. The Nile is the only lord and give life to Egypt. The eternal type, in which the Great River has moulded the land and everything in it, must be implicitly.obeyed
                and all and every recalcitrant featuré must ets. either assimilate or succumb.
                | An instructive example of this was invention ed some time ago in one of the Balletins of the Khedivial Geographical Society, where it was remarked that some fine breed of Euro pean cattle, after being transplanted into Egypt for a few years, began to assume beladi characteristics. What is true of the stockyard is true also in history, Of al the many and mighty laces that have sojourned in the land not a single physical trace remains, and the influence of the centuries of Ptolemaic sovereignty are as much obliterated as the hundreds of years of Roman rule. There is a more modern case of this strange power of assimilation. For six hundred years during the Mamluk era there was a steady annual
                'drafting of Circussian men and women into ERU Egypt ; yet there has never been a colony of
                pure Circassian race domiciled in Egypt. No · race can for long, withstand the racial and
                climatic influences of "a land where all things always seem the same.” Lord Cromer in his Report on Egypt in 1903 drew attention to the fact that the conditions of life in ancient Egypt, as revealed by the Oxyrhynchus Papyri, point "to the conclusion that when, in recent years, Egyptian reform was taken seriously in hand, the reformers had, in many cases, to deal with practices which had existed, without undergoing any very material change, for at least 1,800 years." The game words probably were used 3,300 years ago by Rekhmara to Thothmes III. in an era of Egyptian prosperity as great as the present, when that statesman. of thirty-three centuries ago drew his sovereign's attention to the rapid progress Egypt has made of late years.
                We are engaged in Egypt in an attempt to crowd the revolutions in fact and in idea, which in Europe have been the slow growth of centuries, into as many decades, without even halting to assure ourselves that things which owe their initiative to the genius of Europe, and are the ripening fruits of her maturity, are equally suited to the genius of the East. Even in the case of European civilisation; "while the advances made by objective science and its industrial applications are palpable and undeniable, it is a matter of doubt and dispute if our social and moral advance towards happiness and virtue has been great or any." So said a well-known English thinker; but to apply such reflections to modern Egypt might by some be considered to savour of heresy. That such a "point of view should be held here. tical is very natural, for it is a generally
                received fallacy of the present day that man, - as he exists, whether Oriental or European, is
                capable of net progress. We are always under an illusion of progress in Egypt, because wherever we are conscious of an evil we remedy it, and therefore always seem to ourselves to be progressing, forgetting that most of the evils we see are the effects, finally become acute, of long-unnoticed retrogressions, and that our compromising remedies seldom fully recover the lost ground. This is the illusion of illusions, whereby we judge that the follah, inasmuch as he is developing from a vegetarian to a carnivorous animal, sleeps in a bedstead, and uses the telegraph to gamble on the Alexandria Bourse in futures, is a more excellent person than his grandsire, who never ate nothing but "ful” and whose highest ideal of happiness was to escape the corvée. Why should we not think so ? Is oot the chauffeur, who drives a motor-car from Paris to Berlin, a more highly evolved man than the charioteer of Achilles ? Is not the modern Prime Minister a more enlightened ruler than Cæsar because he rides &amp; tricycle and writes his despatches by electric light? Whilst man remains what he is, there can be no progress beyond the point already attained and fallen headlong from at every attempt at civilisation; and since even that point is but a pinnacle to which a few people cling in giddy terror above an abyss of squalor, mere progress should no longer charm us. The progress fallacy is widespread but very simple. We read of the old unregenerate Egypt and we conclude that the abuses of those days are quite things of the past. The curve is abolished, public education is made into a system, sanitary by-laws are multiplied, the Alexandria Municipality is founded, the octroi is done away with, irrigation is improved, the effendi wears tweed suits, the Bey drives motor-cars. All these and such-like changes produce an illusion of bustling progress, and it is inferred that the abuses of a generation ago no longer exist" except as interesting pages in Lady Duff Gordon's Letters from Egypt. But the moment we look for a reform due to the character of the people themselves we are disillusioned ; instead, we find that as they become more prosperous their criminality increases. This is no new conclusion. The
                lespair of institutions, and the inexorable "'ye must be born again," with Mrs. Poyser's stipulation, "and horn - different,” recurs in every generation ; for man, as he is, never vill, nor can, add a cubit to his stature by any of the quackeries of progress Plus
                a change plus c'est la même chose, will ever me true of Egypt.</p></div>

            at The "Times" in its leading article on the General Assembly alludes to His Excellency's to | tactics in the following terms –The resolution requesting us to abdicate our rights and duties in Egypt in favour of an Egyptian Parliament was moved by Sheikh Aly Youssef, the editor of the Nationalist organ, "El Moayad,” who, we are told, has • supplanted Mustapha Kamel in the good graces of the Court. He was assisted in putting pressure upon the members by Ibrahim Pasha Neguib,
            who actually holds office in the Government - as Under-Secretary of State for the Interior.
            It is significant of the state of mind of the members that the adopted these révolutionary proposals with little or no criticism. They voted them like sheep at the end of a sitting. | The wisest and most experienced Legi-latures
            in Europe would spend weeks on the consideration of projects involving consequences far less

            Dr. Rutherford asked Sir Edward Grey whether, seeing that,apart from the £34,000,000 of the share capital of the Suez Canal Company owned by his Majesty's Government, there were three British directors representing his Majesty's Government and seven British directors representing British shipping inter. rests on the board, as well as in view of the probable . adhesion of the Government of the French Republic, in which i the bulk of the company's share capital waste | owned, his Majesty's Government would en-se deavour to introduce regulations for the purpose of minimising the danger to the canal, to shipping, 'and to the lives of passengers from carrying explosives through the canal.
            Sir E Grey : I have nothing to add to the reply which I made on Nov. 22 last. It is obvious that it is to the interest of the company to take proper precautions, and that they are in the best position to judge what precautions are necessary.

            sulmans and Christians alike, was arming, but e that the Vali was afraid to take energetic

              <p>ANNUAL DRILL DISPLAY.</p>
              <p>In spite of other attractions, many ladies e found their way to the Sanieh Girls' School on
                Wednesday afternoon, when the annual drill display and sale of work was in progress. From the road outside no one could have any idea of the brightness and charm of the big.airy build
                ing which, with its wide verandahs and corridors, is built around the square garden within.
                It was a gala day for the big crowd of happy looking children who in dainty white frocks with sashes and hair-knots of various colours thronged the verandahs all ready for the afternoon's performances. Miss Johnstone and her staff stood ready to receive guests, and soon after Lady Cromer's arrival the serious business of the afternoon commenced. The students of the Training College were the first to March across the paved path across the garden sand give a short display of dumbbell exercises. t They were promptly followed by a bevy of the o younger scholars, their Boy white frocks relieved with sashes, etc., of belivtr pe, and
                they performed their Swedial exercises with a tpre-ision and briskness that spöke volumes for
                the training that had been bestowed upon them. They in their turn were followed by a delightful crowd of kindergarten babies who trotted placidly to their place and spoke their little recitations with delightful naiveté ; "The three little kittens” being recited with much expression and evident enjoyment. The children of the preparatory class armed with scarlet scarves and sashes did their scarf drill, and others with touches of pink about them performed pretty evolutions with small hoops covered also in pink. Then there were other recitations and pole exercises hy a class whose dresses were relieved by touches of green in various shades, and finally a maypole dance was performed by eight tiny tots with great aplomb and much holding out of little skirts
                and pointing of baby toes. The entire display, with its happy-looking bạnds of juvenile perco formers, was in every way a most credible d performance and compared very well with ve those other displays of a like nature in England. It was delightful, too, to watch the same -- children in the great big playground after y wards, fitting about in their pretty frocks and osashes, busily employed in games, swinging,
                etc., and as thoroughly enjoying life as any t, English children on an extra half-holiday. 8 In another building the sale of work was h in progress, the elder girls taking charge of the
                - various stalls. There were some beautiful v examples of needle.craft on exhibition, drawn
                linen work, needle lace, and embroidery, which h it would be hard to/beat So much were all us these pretty articles in request that by the - end of the afternoon there was scarcely en
                article which did not bear the magio ticket 1, "Sold" upon it.
                Tea was served upon the verandah, the children acting as excellent hosts and attendants ; their politeness and pretty manners being fitting complements to their bright faces and dainty frocks. | Most of the classrooms and dormitories were thrown open for inspection ; and school life under such ideal conditions would be shorn of half its horrors The best of school.
                room fitments are in requisition : the latest | patterned desks and all the usual paraphernalia n to which we are accustomed to at home. The
                elder students who are being trained especially | for teachers have their own separate classrooms and the work they do therein redounds much to their credit. Some 25% of the pupils (there are over 200 on the rolls) are boarders, and their dormitories are bright, airy apart
                ments furnished with the same attention to detail as all the rest of the school.
                Miss Johnson may well be proud of her - school and her big flock of pupils : for accus| tomed as we are to such entertainments among
                girls' schools at home, we have never witnessed anything better arranged or more satisfactory than this annual display at the Sanieh School. We hope at some future date to be able to give a further and more detailed account of this school and of the excellent training it is

              <p>We learn that M. Grandmoulin, who is accused of wilful murder and what not by the *Egyptian Standard,” was carrying his gun in one hand just before the accident at Warrak and with the other holding his bicycle. He was just about to take his gun to pieces when e he heard a boy who was with him cry out and turned sharply to see what was the matter. The gun exploded and the charge struck another boy who had come up unnoticed by M. Grandmoulin and killed him. The story that M. Grandmoulin had an altercation with the boy is absolutely false : he had not seen him before the gun went off.
                Such is the lamentable event out of which “Al Lewa"and its European gladiators are attempting to make capital. M. Grandmoulin is an eminent jurist of 60 years of age, the last man ia the world to shoot a child in cold blood, but probabilities are nothing to the "Lewa," and the fact that M. Grandmoulin was director of the School of Law at the time of the students' strike has doubtless contributed to the bitterLess with which he has been attacked. But the real motive of the attack we realise too fally: incitation against the European-despite the grandiloquent device anent freedom a d Hospitality which . decorates the “Egyptian Standard." It is part of the game played before the Alexandria riots, played during the Akaba incident, played during the past summer. Some-day these incitations will lead to bloodshed, and the miserable dupes of Mustapha Pasha and his followers perforce atcne for the deliberate and studied incitations of their leaders.
                The French Consulate at Cairo is holding an enquiry into the matter.
                We understand that M. Grandmoulin contemplates bringing an action against "L'Etendard Egyptien."</p>

              <p>The White Star Line steamer Arabic, as |duly announced, arrived in port yesterday
                morning early bringing a large number of Amee rican tourists who were speedily landed and
                Tsent off by special train to Cairo. Some of them will remain in the capital for a few days and some will continue their journey to Luxor and
                Issouan. The lunding of these passengers was el conducted in a manner reflecting a great deal
                of praise on the management of the F. C. Clark Company as everything seemed to work very
                smoothly. The monotony of the journey from e ship to shore had been carefully considered, - and in order to relieve that, monotony the F. Jo. Clark Company had thoughtfully provided la native band and a few Sudanese dancers.
                To people coming to Egypt for the first time this feature will have no doubt 1 appealed very forcibly, but to the old stager
                it will appeal with redoubled force, especially - Considering that this thoughtful provision will
                not only have saved time in rendering a visit
                to the native bazaar a work of supererogation e but will at the same time have saved money
                'The F. C. Clark Company is to be congratulated on having got ahead of the other tourist agencies in this respect. The music and dancing were very much appreciated, judging by the
                amount of backsheesh received by the per- formers.</p></div>

          <head>BRITISH CONTROL OF EGYPT.</head>
        <div type="item">
          <head>THE CONSULAR AUTOCRACY.</head>
          <p>
            Mr. JM Robertson writes as follows in the "North Mail” of Newcastle. We have dealt with the article in our leader :
            "Never, I think, has such a political situation occurred in British history as that which now exists in Egypt ; indeed, it would be difficult to match it in any European history whatever. In many records we meet with governors of.. colonies and dependencies who are allowed a pretty free hand, whether by constitutional or unconstitutional governments. But a governor who is allowed more power than a nominally! absolute ruler ; a governor whom bis "home" 11 Government never dreams of "instructing":, a governor so privileged that no one ever seeks to overrule him, his only difficulties being those inseparable from his task-such a potentate is hard to find in history before Lord Cromer.
            In naming that distinguished man, I desire to say that any ensuing criticism of mine is directed first and last against the system of: which he is the ‘no adethat all against the man as man. Some people assume that all that is needed to secure the proper government of Egypt is to recall the present Consul General and heads of departments, and appoint others in their place. And, indeed, this simple theory of things is countenanced by Lord Cromer himself, who is fond of quoting Talleyrand to the effect that the secret of good government | consists in finding the right men for the different posts. On that view, serious miscarriage means merely that there should be a change of men.
          </p>
          <div type="article">
          <p>THE SYSTEM, NOT THE MAN. </p>
          <p>
            I take leave to challenge such a view, in Lord Cronier's own interest. Under his 11 supremacy, some branches of Egyptian administration have gone far wrong ; but, looking at the administration as a whole, one is bound to admit that in other regards we might go further and fare worse. As regards finance in particular, no one disputes the wisdom of Lord Cromer's management. Another man might easily set up a much better educational policy, for instance, and a much worse financial.
            The question, then, is not one of men but one of systems ; not one of administrative, errors, but of rigl t or wrong conditious of administration. And the general case against the present system is that it is in its essentials a negation of every regulative principle on which the government of the British Empire has been, and is, carried on in any other quarter of the world. India and the Crown Colonies are, in comparison, constitutionally governed. Colonial governors can initiate nothing save under approval of the Colonial Office. The Viceroy of India consults with bis Council, and the whole machine is subject to the control of the Secretary of State in London, who is advised by his Council.
            Over Egypt there is hardly a semblance of control ; of reality there is none. In reply to a question in the last Parliament it was officially avowed that the Ministers of the Khedive must do what the British ConsulGeneral insists upon. That is to say, the British Army of Occupation in Egypt will, if necessary, enforce his orders. The ConsulGeneral, on his part, has declared in one of his reports that, far from being a "benevolent despot,” he is under the orders of the Foreign Secretary, who is responsible to the British Parliament. That is the theory of the situation, so far as any theory can be said to exist. But the actual fact is that the Foreign Secretary takes no cognisance of anything done in the Egyptian Administration save when it is forced on his notice ; that he seeks to exercise no control ; and that be deprecates, directly or indirectly, any request that he should overrule the policy of the Consul-General at Cairo.
            In saying this I am not criticising personally Sir Edward Grey any more than Lord Cromer. The present Foreign Secretary did not create the anomaly of the present British control in Egypt, any more than did his predecessor. Entering into the heritage of that anomaly, he seeks to get along with as little friction as possible. To impose an effective home control on the Consul-General at Cairo would involve something like the establishment of a new Government Department in London.- Sir Edward may legitimately argue that for the Foreign Office to undertake to supervise the entire government of Egypt would merely be to set up an anomaly.
            ABSOLUTISM. But the mere official wish for official peace and quietness cannot fitly be allowed to deter.. mine the policy of democracy in this country as regards Egypt The present system is one which could never have been contemplated, save as a momentary arrangement, by any British Government. Neither Liberals not Tories could ever have planned that for an indefinite term of years, possibly for generations, a series of British Consuls-General should exercise a practical autocracy in Egypt. No amount of esteem for any one Consul-General could reconcile rational statesmen to the thought of making the office of Consul-General in any country one of practically irresponsible power. The situation is admittedly one which has grown up fortuitously, as the outcome of a series of reluctant and opportunist interventions ; and it is more than time that so irregular and so indefensible an, arrangement should be thoroughly reconsidered
            That it has been allowed to exist so far is: unquestionably due to the general British opinion that Lord Cromer has managed Egyptian affairs very well, inasmuch as he has put the finances on a sound footing, met all the charges of the national debt, and so dealt with irrigation that the material prosperity of the count.

          <cb n="6"/>
          
          <p>try has visibly advanced. On the financial pore, foreign States have acquiesced because the claims of their subjects holding Egyptian bonds have been steadily satisfied.</p>
          <p>The first requisite, however, for a jnat judgment of the Egyptian situation is a full reógnition of the fact that mere material prosperity and financial solvency would not be regarded in any European country of high civilization as an ideal state of things, if accompanied by moral and intellectual protest ; nay, would, in the latter case, be regarded almost as a dangerous symptom. and that the moral and intellectual results of the past quarter of a century of British domination in Egypt have been seriously unsatisfactory, I propose to show in subsequent articles. That they should be unsatisfactory night, I think, be seen by thoughtful politicians o be inevitable. But I propose to show as much, in detail, to those who decline to take I for granted.</p>

            House of Commons.-A recriminatory debate took place . yesterday evening on the Colonial Vote. The Opposition. taunted the Government with sanctioning in the New Hebrides worse conditions than those of the Chinese labour in the Transvaal. They charged them with gerrymandering the Transvaal in the interest of the Boers, who have now proved themselves in no wise hostile towards Chinese labour..
            Mr. Winston Churchill and Sir E. Grey warmly responded, upholding the New Hebri. dos Convention and rebutting the accusation · of favouring the Boers.
            Sir E. Grey strongly deprecated making the Chinese labour question the cause of friction between the Transvaal and Imperial Governments.

            <head>THE SULTAN AS KHALIFA.</head>
          <p>
            TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE” Sir, - The widely divergent views expressed by several correspondents in the "Gazette' reflect truly the conflicting opinions held ir
            Islam on the position of the Sultan as Khalifa | Indeed, ever since the death of the prophet - Mohamed, nol question has arisen in the Moslem world which has caused so much trouble and division amongst the faithful as that of the Imamate or Khalifate.
            "Verily there is no prophet (to come) after me, and the time is near when there will be after me a great many Khalifas," said Mohamed but he took no steps towards appointing any person to the post, and this, undoubtedly, foi the reason that he wished the office to be an elective one, and to give his followers full liberty of choice. For a time the will of the people prevailed, but later on the post became the prey of the strong man and it has remained so to this day in so far as it has existed as an office, though it is true the Sultan of Turkey on ascending the throne is formally elected Khalifa by the College of Ulema at Constantinople.
            The necessity for such a head was not that of religion or law, but of administration. The law, both spiritual and temporal, as given in the Koran, was final and still remains above the office of Sultan or Imám : but an administration requires &amp; head, and as long as the
            world of Islam formed one state, one leader - sufficed. When, however, in the course of time
            Islam was divided into independent states, each state required its own Sovereign, and here came the parting of the ways in Islam between spiritual and political interests, and out of thi: arises the difficulty of dealing with Moslem affairs from the inside as well as from the outside.
            The idealist in the Pan-Islamic movement seeks to bring about greater unity among Moslems on spiritual lines only; the Egyptian Nationalist declares that he has no wish to submit himself and his country to Turkish maladministration ; both agree in looking for light and leading to Constantinople. But to differentiate between spiritual and temporal interests is to militate against the primitive conception and fundargental characteristics of Islam. To set up a spiritual authority pure and simple is without precedent and has the whole weight and force of history against it. An exception to this might be cited in the case of the so-called second dynasty of the Abbassides (not generally accepted by Moslems as true Khalifas) who, from 1258 to 1517 of the common era, enjoyed only a nominal religious authority under the Mamelukes in Egypt. It is often the boast of the Moslem that "Islam has no priesthood”; it can therefore have no high-priest. On the other hand it is quite certain that the average Muslem cannot conceive of a Khalifa except as an absolute leader in all things, nor does he value the importance of any subject, especially in his dealings with the "infidel," except in so far as it relates to the faith
            Now according to the Ashariya, or orthodox school, every candidate for the office of Imam must be of the tribe of the Quraish and be duly elected by the consent of the people. In neither of these points is the Sultan of Turkey qualified, and so the quotation given by your correspondent, Mr. Cheetham, “the Sultan cannot be regarded as the true Khalifa;" taken (literally, is correct. But there is another principle well recognised in Islam, which is, that when the Imamate has been usurped by a per-on not possessing all the necessary quali fications, if his rule be just and in accordance with the teachings of the Koran and the traditions, it is better to acquiesce and submit. Moreover, the Sultan, holding as he does the positions of ruler of the only Moslem state of first class importance and of protector of the holy places, and having in his hands the appointment of the Sherif of Mecca (the most Bacred post in Islam), can claim to be de facto the only possible Khalifa and defender of the faith.
            Such then to-day is the chaotic state of I thought and belief in the Moslem world on the question of the Khalifate. Whether the idealists can ever succeed in spiritualising the deep sense of brotherhood in Islam : whether the masses can ever rise above that feeling of the necessity of a titular head (the same sense which created the Pope and made him infallible), and whether such a leader, once possessed of the full confidence of the followers of the, faith would rest content with spiritual authority only,are deep questions and form tuo big a subject to be discussed in a letter of this Vind. They are however full of interest and of no little importance.--Yours, etc.

            The money market remains in very much the same condition, with a bright outlook, but with no lower rates or prospect of a change 1 in the Bank rate for some time. Things in America are in the seething pot for the present, and everybody is acting, in money as in stocks; on the safe side. This is as it should be, and will no doubt be productive of greater ease in the spring, which is the most important time of the year, when some considerTable flotations are likely to take place.
            The demands of the London County Council will be very considerable, but with the more', conservative administration it is probable &amp; there will be no difficulty in arranging for their requirements on satisfactory terms. 1 Surprise is still expressed that larger amounts of gold do not come from Egypt, and there is much speculation as to the quantity you will be able to retain of the eight to nine millions i you have received from this side. | The Bank return is again somewhat colouriess. The stock of gold and bullion is lower by £641,000, notwithstanding that only £99,000|1 on balance went abroad, this shrinkage being 1 due to the usual outflow of currency incidental to the turn of the month. The note circulation | has expanded, by £244,000, and the total reserve is' £885,000 lower at £26,408,000, 1: which compares with £26,054,000 last year. The ratio of reserve to liabilities has fallen 25 to 447 per cent., which is 2 percent below the ratio twelve months ago.

            The frenzied finance which has been characteristic of Wall Street during the past week has not merely demoralised the stock markets there, but has also been the dominating adverse | factor on the Stock Exchange here. The disorganisation which the scare has caused in 1
            Throgmorton St. gives a somewhat misleading idea of the extent to which London dealers are committed in American stocks and shares.As a matter of fact the American speculatives position here was very considerably reduced d. ring the shake-out recently, but in the pre-11 sent nervous state of most markets, the | wild operations in New York have naturally 11 had the effect of emphasising the weakest spoty. The final result of this will, of course, be salutary as regards future operations, but brokers are finding it difficult to view the present situation from this philosophical standpoint.
            The chief feature of interest for the moments is the Japanese new conversion Five per cent. luan, which is to be issued to-night at 994 This would appear to be absurdly cheap iu view of the present price of the Four-and-a-la Half per cents. which, even in the face of it still stand at 939. Of course the price of the latter are being artificially. sustained during th the period of issue of the new loan They lo will no doubt fall to the proportionate level as soon as the latest issue is all taken up. Til The quotation for the new loan is only 1 percent premium, which would make the 45 percent. worth only about 90, | The overwhelming defeat of the Progressives at the County Council elections has 16 been received with great satisfaction on the Stock Exchange. The extravagant policy of that party had caused grave uneasiness in financial circles for a long time past, and it is confidently anticipated that the saner policy to which the new majority have committed themselves will do much to revive many enterprises which have suffered much from oppressive legislation and continually increasing taxation
            Markets have continued depressed to-day, and.quotations are again generally lower.

            The gilt-edged market has displayed considerable weakness, and notwithstanding renewed purchases by the Government broker,
            have continued to follow a downward course. Yesterday they fell to the lowest point of the year. They leave off to day at 86 to, d. for the account, a further fall to day of Foreign Bonds.
            The Japanese new loan is attracting much attention in the foreign market. The new issue is for twenty three millions, which will be chiefly devoted to the conversion of the present six per cents. It is expected that holders of the six per cent. Customs Bonds will be offered in exchange for their existing scrip a £100 new Five per cent. bond, fully paid, and entitled to 15 a half year's dividend in October, besides a one per cent. cash bonus. A large portion of the issue will be placed in Paris | In view of the new loan, the old issues have been offered, the Fours being very flat. All the stocks show declines of 1/8 to 1/4 to-day.
            Russians were firm at the beginning of the 3 week, but have since eased off, the Fives shedding 1/4 and the Fours 1/8 yesterday. The Fives have further declined 1/8 to 85 1/2 to-day.

          <p>The home railway market started buoyantly enough, the result of the County Council contest being regarded as a very favourable point, but for the greater part of the week, the tone has teen anything but satisfactory. The changes are in nearly every case adverse The Caledonian and North British dividends have been received with much disappointment. The Caledonian declaration is at the rate of 31 per cent on the Ordinary stock, as against 4per cent. last year, while the carry-forward at £20,500 is practically unchanged. The Deferred stock receives per cent. for the year. The North British result is even worse. This is at the rate of per ognt, with $10,500 forward.</p>
          <cb n="4"/>
          <p>
            The Caledonian announcement was followed by a fall of a full point in the Deferred stook and in the Preference, while other Soottish, stocks were affected, North British Deferred dropping , and Glasgow and South Western Deferred t. The following day there was some recovery, but the North British declaration yesterday gave the market another cold douche, and British Deferred slumped 7/8 to 32 7/8, and the Preferred were marked down a fall point. Caledonian Preference gave way 1/2. Yesterday Brighton “A” were the only bright spot, these registering a gain of 1/2 .
            There has been continued liquidation in this market to-day. Brighton “A” have relapsed 1, Great Western 1, North Western and South Eastern "A" 3/4, and Caledonian Preferred 1/2.

            The enormous realisations in New York, which amounted in one day alone to 2,357,000 shares, have caused prices here to fluctuate violently, and in several cases very low levels have been touched. Indeed, the declines in values have been so serious, that there is much misgiving as to the ultimate result of the settlement next week. The sharp advance in Readings which followed the large purchases of the shares by the Harriman clique, who were reported to be desirous of securing control of the line, gave some strength to the market for a time, but this has been followed by further extensive liquidation.
            Americans have again been heavily sold to day. Lo isville have shed 4, Aitchison 3, Chesapeake 33,Reading 24, Unions -25, and Southern Preference 2.

          <p>The Egyptian market has been quiet, and in several cases shares have been offered, but there are few buyers about. This of course applies to the speculative group only. National Bank of Egypt fell from 287 to 27 sellers, and Agricultural Bank from 9) (ex-dividend of 9/ per share) to 88, but the latter are now firmer at 9 to. The 81 % Debentures keep steady at 90-1. Daira Sanieh Ordinary have been very flat, and have been offered down from 165 ex dividend to 15 . before finding a buyer. The Deferred are nominally 90, but it is difficult to get a bid. Egyptian Estates are dull at 2 , while Delta Land &amp; Investment are nominally 31-4. New Egyptian are quoted 1-5, but there are only sellers at 24/g. United Egyptian Lands are to premium, and the Deferred about 9. Khedivial Mail are supposed to be 17d, and Union Foncière are 54-68 without any market. Land Bank of Egypt leave off at 85-95, and Bank of Abyssinia 14 dis. count. Delta Preference (Bearer) at 11+ are fairly steady, considering the fall in other shares.

            Business in the mining market has been on a very reduced scale. A few specialities have received attention, and for the most part the tone has been steady, but the shares generally have been affected by the depression ruling in other sections of the House Dealers are dig. posed to reduce their commitments in view of the differences which have to be met at the forthcoming settlement.
            Yesterday Kaffirs, after being dull during the day, took a sharp turn for the better in the Street, and Rand Mines recovered from 67 to Gid, while East Rands and Goldfields were in demand at 4 de and 4. :
            The tone in Kaffirs to-day has been rather more favourable. Raud Mines and Gold Fields are each to better.
            Egyptian mining shares have again had a very quiet week, and the changes are confined to a fall of 3d. in the Nile Valley to 4/8.
            Egyptian Mines Exploration are steady at 3, 8., and Egyptian at 1 1/16

            The fault of the Blood -- that is the direct cause of Rheumatism in every form; and as the disease proceeds from the blood the only way to a cure is by renewing the blood supply That is why Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People are so eminently successful in Rheumatism and other blood disorders, because they actually make strong red blood that cleanses
            the system of positions and builds up health k anew with full relief from pain.
            1. " All my joints were inflamed with Rheu tematism four years ago," said Mrs. Burdin, ol 7 50, Archdeacon-lane, Leicester, when interview ned recently, "and from a strong active woman I dwindled away to a pitiable wreck
            <hi rend="bold">THESE WERE </hi> unable to do anything in the <hi rend="bold">HER SYMPTOMS</hi>. house. What I suffered will be partly understood when I tell you that agonising pains flew through my back and limb | as though my muscles were gripped by pincers, while an icy feeling crept down my spine. My flesh and bones became sore, and I felt as though I had been beaten all over. "Every change in the weather set up fresh attacks and increased my pain. Sometimes I could hardly drag one foot after the other, and " in time I became quite a cripple. Then rheumatic fever developed, and I had to take to
            my bed, where for fourteen weeks I lay in Jagony, Every movement of my body caused
            excruciating pains to shoot through me ; my body twitched with agony, for it seemed as though I was being stabbed with red-hot needles.
            |“My fingers became knotted and my skin
            puffed ; also, my flesh was so tender that I I could not bear the weight of the bed clothes,
            and I had to have supports to save them from touching me. My breathing became short and sharp, and my heart palpitated. I grew as weak and helpless as a child, and terribly emaciated, with my nerves in such a bad state that I could not stand the daylight, and the room was kept darkened. "In spite of all the clever treatment of doctors I seemed to get worse ; the medicine
            they gave me produced nausea, without relieving my agony.
            " But at this time my husband was strongly advised to give me Dr. Williams Pink Pills for Pale People, and though-I fully believed I was beyond cure, I consented to try the pills. After a steady course of the pills I was pleased to notice a decided improvement: I continued, and the pains began surely to diminish ; before long I could move my hands.
            *This encouraged me so much that I persevered with Dr. Williams' Pink Pills; then my strength returned until I was able to sit up in bed ; I began to put on flesh; I gradually regained the use of my limbs, and was able to venture out of bed.
            ** From the time I began Dr. Williams' Pink Pills I never looked back; they alone restored me from a hopeless cripple to the strong, healthy woman you now see. I am quite free from all pains of Rheumatism and well able to attend to my domestic duties. Dr. Williams' Pink Pills are truly a wonderful medicine, and I cannot praise them too much, for I consider they saved my life.” By supplying Red, Good Blood that fortifies the system and drives out all the poisons | that set up Rheumatism, innumerable cures  have been achieved by Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People, which have also cured Anemia, Indigestion, Eczema, Sciatica, St. Vitus Dance, Neuralgia, Nervous Disorders, Paralysis, and Locomotor Ataxy.

              Telles sont le fluctuations les plus intéressantes. Si l'on ajoute que les prix inscrits sur la côte sont généralement surfaits, on aura une idée de la situation. D'un optimisme exag on est tombé sans transition au plus complet découragement. Ce qui le prouve c'est la r duction du prix des reports. On ne reporte plu on liquide. Tant mieux.
