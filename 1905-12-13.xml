                    <p>EGYPT AS A DUMPING GROUND.</p>
                    <p>For a long time past we have noticed with regret a decided increase of
                        European pauperism in our streets. The causes are not far to seek; they do
                        not arise from local circumstances. The following case, for example, is an
                        instance which is one of many. On Saturday last a large Russian steamer
                        arrived from Odessa. Her forward decks were crowded with third class
                        passengers, who appearance did not for the most part give one the idea that
                        they possessed any adequate means for their future support. No one deplores
                        more than we do the dreadful state to which a large part of the Russian
                        population is reduced, and we can quite understand and sympathise with the
                        anxiety of many of these poor people to find a happier home ; but this is a
                        country in which there is no work fitted for them, and but little hope of
                        anything beyond being a burden to their compatriots or co-religionists. </p>
                    <p>We do not think that anyone has ever reproached the European inhabitants of
                        Egypt with lack of charity : they do a great deal for those members of their
                        communities the last favored by fortune ; but such efforts have limits.
                        Charity is so noble a quality, that it seems ungracious to say anything
                        which might be interpreted as a wish to restrain it, still it seems possible
                        that exaggerated reports of the prosperity of Egypt, and of the facilities
                        which the charitable institutions of its colonies afford, might be, and are
                        becoming, an undue attraction to hundreds and thousands of people to come to
                        this country. It is not only from Russia that they come ; Syria, Turkey,
                        Greece, and several other countries all send more than are required here.
                        Most other countries have in self-defence put some limits to such an
                        invasion, and surely it is time that the Egyptian Government bethought
                        itself of the duty of putting some restrictions on its unbounded
                        hospitality, and of not allowing this country to become the dumping ground
                        of all that is most undesirable in Southern Europe. </p>
                    <p>We are of course very far from urging indiscriminate llegislation against
                        immigration into Egypt. That would be the height of absurdity. Egypt owes
                        everything to immigrants, and from the earliest ages it has been a land
                        "flowing with milk and honey" in the imagination of the Near East. But
                        nowadays a considerable majority of those who come from abroad to reside in
                        Alexandria and Cairo are not only impecunious, but undesirable from every
                        other point of view. Physically enfeebled and morally degenerate, they add
                        largely to the already appalling amount of disease and crime which are the
                        despair of the authorities. Indeed, it is the increasing stringency of
                        legislation on this subject in other lands which is causing the question to
                        become so urgent with ourselves. The conditions have altogether changed
                        within the last few years. The United States, which till recently welcomed
                        all and any immigrants to its vast territories, has now closed its doors to
                        large numbers of those whom it formerly encouraged to land on its shores,
                        while it permits no one to settle in its midst who cannot fulfil the various
                        and stringent conditions set forth in its immigration laws. Australia is
                        preparing to follow the American example, and England will probably soon do
                        the same. As the most undesirable immigrants come from Southern Russia and
                        Turkey and Southern Europe, Egypt must necessarily attract more and more of
                        this class of people. Unless the Egyptian Government takes some measures to
                        prevent the country becoming the dumping-ground of the scum of European and
                        Asiatic countries, the state of the centres of European population in Egypt
                        will grow from bad to worse. </p>

                    <p>The King has signed a decree for the formal prorogation of Parliament to the

                    <p>After the speech of Lord Rosebery, Mr. Rufus Isaacs declared that the

                        the Cabinet was a guarantee that the Government’s policy would not be one
                        leading op to Home Rule but would simply be one of governmental reform.</p>
                    <p>Sir E. Grey and the others named by Mr. Isaacs attended the reception of the
                        Liberal League in the evening, thus apparently endorsing his

                        The work ought to be brought to a completion within a couple of years or
                        even within eighteen months from now.</p>

                    <head>POPULAR EXCITEMENT. INCIDENT AT ALEXANDRIA.</head>
                    <p>Another incident took place in the neighbourhood of the Labbane Caracol
                        yesterday. From the early morning the headquarters of the Alexandria City
                        Police in the Labbane quarter had been the gathering-place of a crowd of
                        natives of - the lowest class from the Ghanyna, who came thither to watch
                        the transport of the prisoners, arrested for having participated in the
                        unfortunate disturbances of last Sunday afternoon. The “Black Maria” vans of
                        the Alexandria City Police were continually coming and going. Each van was
                        carefully guarded by a mounted police escort, and the authorities had taken
                        the utmost precautions to avoid any attempt to rescue the prisoners.</p>
                    <p>A large number of detectives in plain clothes, under the command of the
                        mamour, were placed about the vicinity of the caracol and up to 3 p.m. the
                        police had been most success-ful in keeping the crowd from indulging in any
                        disorderly manifestations, and not a single breach of the peace had
                        occurred. However, about 3 o’clock three police vans drew up at the caracol
                        in order to take the prisoners in batches to Hadra gaol. The crowd of
                        onlookers had by that time considerably increased since the morning. At that
                        moment a dispute arose between some natives and a Greek baker. The natives
                        hit him and felled him to the ground. In his fall his head collided with the
                        edge of the pavement and he was injured. The man was conveyed to the Labbane
                        Caracol, where medical attendance was forthcoming.</p>
                    <p>This incident provoked great excitement, and the European inhabitants in the
                        neighbourhood were seized with panic. Shop shutters were at once put up,
                        doors bolted, and the crowd rushed hither and thither in an excited state,
                        while alarming rumours were bruited with lightening velocity all over the
                        town about the murder of a Greek by natives.</p>
                    <p>The police have arrested the men who assaulted the baker.</p>

                            Miralai Hopkinson Bey, Commandant of the Alexandria City Police, made a
                            careful inspection of the Bedouins in the Ramleh district and found no
                            signs of unrest among them. The Ramleh Police have taken away hundreds

                            on Sunday afternoon. The native population and the Europeans alike
                            regret the disturbance , and it is felt that strong measures should be
                            taken against any persons, European or native, firing revolvers or
                            displaying them in public exceptin the exercise of legitimate

                    <head>EXAMPLE FROM BEYROUT. USE OF THE BASTINADO.</head>
                    <p>A correspondent writes:—Not many months ago a state of unrest, vary similar
                        to that which prevails in Alexandria at the present moment and which found
                        expression in the riot of last Sunday afternoon, existed in Beyrout, where
                        foreigners were daily molested by the Hooligan portion of the Moslem
                        population and some were actually attacked. These troubles led to the
                        removal of the Governor, and a new man was sent to replace him. The first
                        act of this new Vali was to send for all the instigators of the troubles and
                        administer to each a good dose of the stick.The effect was instantaneous and
                        in 48 hours those Moslem Hooligans who had escaped the bastinado were doing
                        all fa their power to show themselves to be on the best of terms with their
                        Christian neighbours and the town was safer and quieter than it had been for
                        years. The dread of the stick was so marked that many of the worst
                        characters left the district and have never ventured to return. I suggest
                        that if the same treatment were meted out to some of the 500 roughs whom the
                        police have arretted for last Sunday’s riot we should hear no more of unrest
                        in Alexandria. This is the only punishment which these men understand and
                        appreciate, and its moral effect is marvellous. It has been evident to most
                        people that for a long time past the natives here have been growing
                        insolent, and as anything approaching a serious riot would do incalculable
                        injury to the com-mmercial and financial interests of the country I trust
                        that the authorities will make up their minds to deal with the matter in the
                        manner which has proved so very effective in other parts of the East.</p>

                        other night to hear steps hurrying from his room. On making investigations
                        he found that £2 in gold and P.T. 35 in silver, a pair of gold-rimmed
                        pince-nez, some gold studs, several pocket handkerchiefs, and other trifles
                        had disappeared. Armed with a hockey stick he made his way to the bedroom of
                        a friend and the two commenced a search which proved fruitless. Early
                        morning brought their landlady face to face with the unpleasant discovery
                        that much of her cutlery had followed the £2 and the links. The bowab, who
                        is suspected of connivance, if not of the actual theft, was arrested in the
                        morning. His house was searched and the exact sum of P.T. 35 was found

                    <head>VISIT OF NEW ZEALANDERS. PROBABILITY OF MATCH.</head>
                    <byline>(From Our Correspondent.)</byline>
                    <dateline>Port Said, Monday.</dateline>
                    <p>An effort is being made to induce the New Zealand representative Rugby
                        footballers to give an exhibition game in the event of their return by the
                        Canal. Should the "All Blacks" agree to open the new Sports Club grounds at
                        Port Said it would be easy to find a few odd men to make up the two
                        fifteens. The Maorilanders number, all told, twenty-eight. It has been
                        suggested that a good team to represent Egypt might be selected from Cairo
                        and Alexandria. But probably this would only be giving the colonials another
                        opportunity of adding to their huge score and unbeaten record.</p>
                    <p>In football circles there seems to be a healthy rivalry. On Saturday last the
                        Maltese eleven went down to the Arab school to the tune of one to
                        nothing.</p>
                    <p>Next week the English Club play a return match with the school eleven. The
                        Arab boys show great promise as footballers. With a little teaching they
                        would be bad to beat and their passing and combination is better than that
                        of other local teams.</p>
                    <p>The international ball to be held on the 16th inst. promises to be a great
                        success, four hundred people having already promised to attend.</p>
                    <p>To still further add to the funds required for the inauguration of the
                        International Sports Club it has been proposed to hold a second fancy dress
                        ball early next year.</p>
                    <p>The meetings at the tennis court are very popular, and give an opportunity
                        for British residents at Port Said meeting at least once a week
                        socially.</p>
                    <p>The effort to unite the two English Clubs has received active support and it
                        is probable that this hardy annual may next season blossom into something
                        more than more discussions and suggestions.</p>
                    <p>Arrivals of Touriste.</p>
                    <p>The tourist companies, Cook's and the Anglo-American, seem to be up to their
                        eyes in work. Every liner brings a larger number of people for Cairo and the
                        Nile.</p>
                    <p>The hotels seem to be doing well. The Savoy has made extensive alterations
                        and enlargements, including a café-bar on the ground floor overlooking the
                        harbour.</p>
                    <p>The Eastern Exchange has opened an ornamental garden at the back of the hotel
                        and thus provided an open space at the rear.</p>
                    <p>Last week Princess Louise of Schleswig Holstein en passant visited the
                        British Hospital.</p>
                    <p>Building operations are progressing on all sides. The new Bank of Egypt will
                        add considerably to the appearance of the main street.</p>
                    <p>Lake Mwnxaleh Service.</p>
                    <p>The trial trips of the new steamers on Lake Menzaleh have been very
                        successful. Probably next year a regular service will be opened to
                        Damietta.</p>
                    <p>Lake Menzaleh is swarming with fish, as was noticed during the trial trips of
                        the new barges and paddle boats. If more up-to-date methods of fishing were
                        adopted an even larger harvest would be obtained.</p>
                    <p>The idea of a Municipality for Port Said has been mooted of late. But the
                        majority of the people would object to anything likely to add to the present
                        price paid for the luxury of living in Port Said.</p>
                    <p>Cost of Living.</p>
                    <p>During the blockage of the canal by the Chatham the prices in the bazaar were
                        put up and have not yet been lowered. The Arab traders seem to have formed a
                        ring to keep up the price of such commodities as eggs, milk, vegetables,
                        fruit, fish, etc. The cost of living in Port Said has increased of late
                        years. More especially is this noticeable in engaging domestic servants.
                        Whereas a few years ago one could obtain a cook for twenty or thirty francs
                        a month, now many of them ask three or four pounds.</p>
                    <p>The nuisance of street vendors molesting passengers and the annoyance of
                        unauthorised touts and unlicensed boatmen and hawkers which used to be so
                        noticeable at Port Said has lessened considerably of late, since the police
                        began to suppress the worst offenders.</p>
                    <p>More Dwellings Wanted.</p>
                    <p>There is a demand for more dwelling houses in Port Said. The tendency seems
                        to be for the English people to migrate towards the beach.</p>
                    <p>It is hoped that next year the nuisance caused by not regulating the bathing
                        berths, especially from a sanitary point of view, will not detract from the
                        pleasures of a dip in the sea.</p>
                    <p>The idea of building a Casino on the beach seems to have been nipped in the
                        bud.</p>
                    <p>That there is some means of amusement required for people in Port Said is
                        abundantly evident, as the environment is not such as to encourage the
                        people to go far outside the town.</p>
                    <p>There is abundant evidence of past progress, however, to show that soon the
                        late George Steevens' description of the town as "a black island of coal,
                        jabbering island of tents, and c., shut in by sea, swamp and sand, not more
                        entertaining in the season than out of season," will certainly be as
                        undeserved as it was originally perhaps a little exaggerated.</p>

                    <dateline>Suakin, Dec. 6.</dateline>
                    <p>Archdeacon Gwynne arrived here from Khartoum last week in order to establish
                        an English Church at Suakin, and succeeded so far that a room in Government
                        House was given up for the purpose of being turned into a chapel, and a
                        committee was formed under the presidency of H.E. the Governor, Hawker Bey,
                        to arrange for the furnishing of the church. The sum of £13 had been
                        collected previously by Mr. Mackenzie, Superintendent, Eastern Telegraph Co.
                        here, during the services held in his house, and this amount was handed over
                        to the committee. </p>
                    <p>Regular fortnightly services have been arranged and a chaplain will come down
                        every alternate Sunday from Khartoum or elsewhere to hold these services. On
                        other Sundays the services will be taken either by Mr. Mackenzie or some
                        other English gentleman.</p>
                    <p>First Baptism.</p>
                    <p>A Church of England baptism took place in the new chapel on the 3rd inst. The
                        three children of Mr. Warne, chief engineer of the railway condensers, and
                        Mrs. Warne, were baptised by Archdeacon Gwynne. This is the first English
                        baptism on record in the Lower Sudan. After the christening Archdeacon
                        Gwynne held the eveniong service. The chapel was crowded with
                        Britishers.</p>
                    <p>Archdeacon Gwynne left for Khartoum yesterday, via the Atbara. He will
                        accompany a missions party to the Upper Sudan from Khartoum.</p>
                    <p>The British S.S. Sahara, of Glasgow, arrived here on the 4th inst. from
                        Australia with about 54,000 Yarrah wood sleepers for the Sudan Railways.</p>
                    <p>Port Sudan Line.</p>
                    <p>The Port Sudan line is being hurriedly pushed on and it is expected that it
                        will be completed by the 15th January, 1906. Over 2,000 labourers from Egypt
                        and the Sudan, besides men of the Railway Battalion, are employed on the
                        permanent way, under the supervision of Kaimakam Sowerby Bey and Bimbashi
                        Newcombe, R.E.</p>
                    <p>Another condenser for the Suakin Railways was completed and started running
                        to-day. One of the two condensers will soon be pulled down to be erected at
                        Port Sudan for the railway and town.</p>
                    <p>Kaimakam Longfield Bey, R.E., Assistant Director of Railways, and Mr.
                        Hodgson, Loco. and Stores Superintendent, Sudan Railways, arrived by special
                        train yesterday from Atbara.</p>
                    <p>Miralai Macauley Bey, R.E., Director of Sudan Railways, is at present busily
                        engaged making out the establishment rolls of each department, which will
                        take effect from the New Year, for those who remain on the permanent list
                        and who were formerly employed on the construction of the Suakin-Atbara
                        line.</p>
                    <p>It is now rumoured that the grant of the gratuity which was to have been
                        given to the men employed on the Suakin-Atbara line on completion of the
                        line, is postponed until the Port Sudan line is completed.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Garger, English Secretary to the Director of Sudan Railways, returned
                        here by the Khedivial Mail steamer Mahallah on the 3rd inst. from his leave
                        of absence.</p>

                    <p>Sir-The disturbances on Sunday afternoon at Alexandria and the general
                        popular fermant throughout the country should be taken to heart by those
                        foolish people in England, who, for the sake of their friends the Armenians,
                        and other persons of that sort, clamour for a forward policy against Turkey.
                        I read the sensible letter of "An Eye Witness" in the "Gazette" of yesterday
                        and soon after I read the recent letter of Syed Abdul Majid, of the
                        Pan-Islamic Society, in the "Morning Post." Are we to consider that the mob
                        was only out for a lark on Sunday? Was it merely an aimless demonstration of
                        as little import as the recent "rag" at Cambridge? Is the fermentation only
                        the excitement of rowdy shoeblacks? </p>
                    <p>Sayed Abdul Majid writes:--"Is the attitude of England in concert with the
                        European Powers towards Turkey a wise one concerning the millions of
                        Mussulmans whom she numbers as her subjects? It cannot fail to shock every
                        Mussulman. The Ottoman Empire, as the seat of their religious head, is dear
                        to every Muslim heart, despite little differences among them. The downfall
                        of Turkey is tantamount to a universal war between the Christians and the
                        Muslims, as every Muslim is bound to fly to the banner of the promised Mahdi
                        who, according to the traditions, will manifest himself when Constantinople
                        will be in danger (see Sale's Koran, Prelim. Disc.), with a consequence
                        which must be deplored by every lover of humanity. The issues of war are
                        uncertain, and no one can foretell that they would be like that of the
                        battle of Omdurman. Nor is this all that should stay at the impolitic hand
                        of England. There is yet another consideration. She will have to suffer
                        most. Heaven forbid if such a cruel war were to be proclaimed. The millions
                        of loyal Muslims who, without the least exaggeration, form the bulwark of
                        the British Empire in India and otherwhere, will with great sorrow bid
                        farewell to their hearth and home for the sake of their religion. The Holy
                        War in the holy cause of religion every Muslim is bound to take part in. The
                        horrors of the Indian Mutiny ought to teach us to be very cautious wherever
                        the religious prejudices of the Asiatics are concerned. There is no
                        justification whatever for the dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire. The
                        Turkish Provinces which have been granted autonomy under the so-called
                        intervention of the Powers are worse governed now than they were before.
                        Whatever may be said with "duty and humanity"--terms which furnish nations
                        with pretexts to guide their sinister policies as Oppenheim, one of the most
                        recent writers on International Law, has shown-the Powers are committing a
                        flagrant breach of good faith. In accordance with the pernicious methods
                        adopted by Russia in 1877 the agitation in Macedonia was directly or
                        indirectly encouraged by the Powers, and the effect was so outrageous that
                        even our present Premier recognised the "balance of criminality to lie on
                        the side of the insurgents." Is this, then, a rightful cause for a united
                        action?" </p>
                    <p>His words are supported in a letter which appeared in the "Times" a few days
                        aho from Judge Ameer Ali, who concludes it with the following warning:--"I
                        know that nothing that any Mohamedan can say will alter for a moment the
                        decision of the Powers, but the occasion must not be allowed to pass without
                        a protest in the name or humanity and common justice against a policy which
                        is likely to engulf Eastern Europe and religious war, the effects of which
                        will be felt far beyond the limits of the Turkish Empire."</p>
                    <p>Both these gentlemen are Moslems, so it may be considered that their opinions
                        are not impartial. But Mr. Archibald Colquhoun in the "Morning Post" sounds
                        the same note of warning. He says:--"Those who do not believe in the power
                        of Pan-=Islam ask : Where are their arms? Where are their leaders? But it is
                        not so much a great open crusade that must be feared as the simultaneous
                        outbreak in different parts of the world of that spirit of fanaticism
                        manifested in outbreaks and risings of which we have already witnessed
                        serious examples. France, with a precarious hold over wild, untameable
                        Kabyle tribes, among whom the Senoussi have been at work, is in an
                        especially dangerous position, and England, with seventy millions of
                        Mussulman subjects (over a fourth of the whole world of Islam), cannot for a
                        moment afford to be blind to the possible attitude of those subjects in a
                        matter which touches the dignity of their chosen head -- the representative
                        of their Prophet."</p>
                    <p>Are not these extracts sufficient to warn the European Powers of the danger
                        of attempting to meddle with the "Sick Man of the Near East."--I am,
                        etc.,</p>

                    <p>Describing her experience while on tour to a representative of the "Indian
                        Daily News" at Calcutta, Miss Georgie Corlass, the leading lady of
                        Randmann's Opera Company, thus expresses herself regarding the Khedivial
                        Opera House at Cairo :...and Malts, and then Cairo--the best of the lot! The
                        Khedivial Opera House is a huge place, and one felt quite lost on the
                        enormous stage and wondered whether the audience would hear one!"</p>
                    <p>"It is supposed to be the best playhouse out of London or Paris," the
                        pressman ventured.</p>
                    <p>"A beautiful theatre," said Miss Corlass, "and like everything else in Cairo
                        absolutely up-to-date in all its appointments and surroundings.</p>
                    <p>Friends of Mr. Bandmann in Egypt will be interested to hear that that
                        enterprising impresario has taken a leave of the Opera House, Calcutta,
                        where his company judging by press reports to hand, is meeting with enormous
                        success. It is not improbable that Mr. Bandmann's opera company will pay a
                        visit to Egypt in the early part of the next year, when it is replaced in
                        Calcutta by his comely company, which is now being recruited in England.</p>

                    <head>FUTURE OF THE ROYAL MARINES.</head>
                    <p>The future of the Royal Marines, the "sea" regiment as it has been aptly
                        called, has been somewhat prematurely declared to mean the withdrawal of the
                        military contingent from warships afloat. It has been said that the Royal
                        Marines will be utilised in garrison duty at Naval stations at home and
                        abroad, a measure which the Admiralty has never cordially approved.
                        Naturally, it will dissent from the payment of troops raised primarily for
                        service at sea, if they are employed as land forces. But the publication of
                        the Naval programme yesterday contains no reference to the transfer of the
                        Royal Marines to exclusive garrison duty. It is distinctly stated that there
                        will be no permanent specialisation of marine officers, and that while
                        military duties will be allocated to some, all will continue to be
                        interchangeable throughout their career. "The Royal Marines will not in
                        future possess a staff of officers entirely distinct from the officers of
                        the Royal Navy." But those employed in military duties will be more closely
                        associated in every rank with the sea service. There must be a section of
                        the ship's company corresponding with the Marines, men who will assist in
                        fighting but without the possessing special nautical or engineering skill.
                        These soldiers, combatants, most always be usefully retained ; they are the
                        most efficient class for operations on shore on the many occasions when a
                        force must necessarily be landed.</p>

                    <p>"Egypt is one of the countries which for one reason or another has not proved
                        particularly attractive to American exporters. Pherhaps it is because of the
                        peculiar trade methods common among the Egyptians, or the absence of
                        suitable banking and shipping connections, but, whatever the cause may be,
                        Americans have taken advantage of only a few of the trade opportunities open

                    <p>A curious adventure befell a cat on an Orient Liner in the Red Sea recently.
                        Soon after the Liner left Sydney, one of the ship's cats was missed, and it
                        was supposed that it must have been left behind. Thirty-two days later, when
                        the steamer was in the Red Sea, somebody heard a faint mewing from the
                        refrigerating chamber. The room was opened, and the poor cat was found in a
                        fearfully emaciated condition. One of its ears and a portion of its nose had
                        been bitten off by the icy atmosphere of the chamber. The fur had grown to
                        great length, but portions of it fell off when the cat was touched or
                        stroked. It had also changed colour from black to white. The cat has now
                        resumed regular duty on the ship.</p>

                    <head>IRRIGATION ENGINEERING.</head>
                    <p>By Sir Hanbury Brown, K.C.M.G., late Inspector General of Irrigation in Lower
                        Egypt, and formerly in Upper Egypt.</p>
                    <p>XI.</p>
                    <p>The problem of the economical distribution of water is made more difficult
                        wherever rice cultivation has to be taken into account. Rice is not liable
                        to suffer from being overwatered in the way that cotton and other summer
                        crops are. Consequently the rice grower has no inducement to be economical
                        with the water supply, and will use as much water as he can get, short of
                        drowning the crop. In addition to this, rice cannot exist with such long
                        intervals between waterings as those allowed in the case of cotton. If
                        deprived of water for more than five or six days, the rice plant, at any
                        rate while young, is liable to suffer. Therefore, for canals from which rice
                        is irrigated, a two-section arrangement is adopted, each section working for
                        four days and stopping for five. The day when neither section works comes
                        after the working of the upper section, and is utilised for filling the
                        channels of the lower section before water is drawn off from them. As the
                        rice full period of rotation of nine days, a cultivator may, if he likes,
                        raise cotton, or rice or both. Supposing he has an area of 200 acres to put
                        under crop, he can sow it all with rice, and irrigate it once every nine
                        days ; or he can plant it all with cotton, and irrigate 100 acres during one
                        turn and the other hundred during the next, so that one watering in eighteen
                        days is given to it all. Or, again, he may put 100 acres under rice and 100
                        under cotton. In this case, he would irrigate all the rice and 50 acres of
                        cotton during one period of nine days, and all the rice again, and the other
                        50 acres of cotton during the next nine-day period ; so that, in every case,
                        the rice would get a watering in nine days and the cotton in eighteen days.
                        The cultivator is thus free to plant what, in his own judgement, is best for
                        his interests under the conditions imposed by the programme of rotations
                        enforced. </p>
                    <p>In these articles nothing has been written about inland navigation, river
                        training, flood banks and reclamation of land further than to refer to them
                        as matters with which the irrigation engineer may have to deal. The
                        importance of inland navigation will, it is hoped, not long hence receive
                        practical recognition in England. It is too large a subject to discuss
                        within the limits of these articles.</p>
                    <p>The methods of river training depend so much on varying conditions, that
                        general principles, applicable to all cases, have not yet been enunciated,
                        other than that by some means the channel must be brought to an uniform
                        corss-section, adapted to the river discharges, so that there may be no
                        silting or scouring ; and it must be induced to form itself along the most
                        favorable alignment possible. For a certain class of river work the
                        experience gained on the Mississippi will be found most valuable. But as so
                        much of river training work depends for its success on the ingenuity
                        displayed in details, and on the nature of materials to hand, the best thing
                        to do, if one is entrusted with such work, is to study the reports of
                        previous work carried out under conditions similar to those which prevail in
                        the river to be operated on. The forms of spurs and groynes, for instance,
                        vary according to the resources of the locality. In Egypt they are now made
                        of limestone rubble, as the fittest to survive of all the materials
                        experimented with.</p>
                    <p>In the four largest canals in Egypt, which flow with considerable depth, it
                        has been found necessary to protect the sides from erosion by pairs of
                        opposing spurs placed at intervals of about 300 yards from pair to pair.
                        These not only prevent the canal alignment from becoming irregular under the
                        process by which a river becomes winding, but they also prevent the bed from
                        shoaling in consequence of erosion of the banks. Since these spurs were made
                        there has been a most satisfactory diminution in the amount of silt deposit
                        that has to be annually dredged from the canals.</p>
                    <p>Concerning Nile banks, there is not much to be said. Provided they are kept
                        in repair, they do not breach from weakness, but from being undermined by
                        the cutting action of the river. To guard against this they should be set
                        back fifty yards or more from the river's edge, and any nearer advance upon
                        them by the river be prevented by spurs and rivetments to protect those
                        points or lengths where cutting action is detected. Culverts for the
                        irrigation of land behind the banks should, by preference, be absolutely
                        forbidden ; but if they are allowed, they should be built to such a design
                        and in such a manner as not to constitute points of weakness in the
                        bank.</p>
                    <p>Finally, a few words about land reclamation. This, in some of its aspects, is
                        more an agricultural than an irrigation question. In his paper on
                        "Irrigation in the United States," read at St. Louis before the
                        International Engineering Congress of 1904, Mr. Elwood Mead remarks on the
                        tendency to magnify the construction side of irrigation, and adds :-- "While
                        we may not give too much attention to problems connected with dam and canal
                        building, we fail to give enough to those connected with the agricultural
                        and economic side. It is the work of the farmer which, after all, determines
                        the value of irrigation properties. In irrigation, construction problems
                        come first, agricultural and economic ones later, but they are the problems
                        of enduring importance."</p>

                    <p>No one on Monday night had anything but praise for the performance. It is
                        perhaps one of the hardest of all plays to achieve with credit ; its length,
                        the staging, the many parts, and for all the actors the endless
                        juxtaposition of passion and pathos, with a sudden disconcerting word of wit
                        clinching a line or a passage ; for sheer technique in verse and rhyme it is
                        surely Rostand's highest work, whatever one may think of it from other
                        points of view. One has to admit that in the actual performance only three
                        actors shone-or could shine for that matter : for really there are only
                        three parts, Le Duc, Flambeau, and Metternich. Metternich was admirably done
                        by M. Monteux, though perhaps one would object to the vehemence in the
                        mirror scene : for the rest, he struck and held the right note of subtlety
                        and dignity. Flambeau (M. Daragon) showed a real capacity and filled the
                        part in every way. He and, of course, Mme Moreno are evidently far ahead of
                        their colleagues, and it is reassuring to have two such players, the lack of
                        whom would certainly have marred such a play completely. Mme Moreno could
                        not have played the Duo de Reichstadt better. We have already mentioned her
                        admirable diction, voice, gesture, glances, all the detail which only a real
                        artist cultivates and shows, and all these were at their height. One can
                        hardly criticise scene by scene or act by act, but we feel most inclined to
                        commemorate the last act of all. More than one actress is capable of great
                        things in a passionate scene, but it is only given to a few to make all that
                        can be made in the more delicate and difficult parts ; and in these she
                        never failed for an instant. In a word, her acting and that of M. Daragon
                        made memorable a performance which would have otherwise been excellent, but
                        no more. </p>

                    <p>Se basant sur ces motifs, le tribunal a déclaré que la demande de preuve par
                        l’interrogatoire sur faits et artioles de S. Tawil n’est ni pertinente ni
                        admissible.</p>

                        l’acceptation de csa comptei, alors surtout qu’eu l'espèce les demandes en
                        paiement de son débit adressées" par 8- Tawil à Wadieh Cordahi devenaient de
                        plus en plus pressantes.</p>
                    <p>"Attendu qu’il y a lieu de eonai .’érer que la vérification des comptes
                        demandée par Wadieh Cardahi constitue de sa part un moyen dilatoire."</p>
                    <p>Par ces motifs le tribunal condamne George, et Wadieh Cordahi solidairement à
                        payer à Selim Tawil la somme de P.T. 105.589 avec l’intéiôt à 9 % à partir

                    <p>Paris, December 5.</p>
                    <p>Not so long ago no Parisian journal would have dreamt of publishing a series
                        of articles drawing comparisons between the French and German armies in the
                        eventuality of war between the two nations. But all that has been changed,
                        and this evening General Langlois, while refuting in the "Temps" M de
                        Lanessan's very pessimistic arguments, prefaces his remarks by giving the
                        explanation. The Emperor William's striking war trumpet call has, he points
                        out, very happily revived the instinct of self-preservation-the idea of a
                        terrible war to the knife which it does not seek, but which may be imposed
                        on it-in the mind of the French nation. This is frank language from so high
                        a authority, and it is true. The general has little difficulty in showing
                        that things are not as M. de Lanessan represents them. The infantry along
                        the eastern frontier is not greatly inferior to the German as regards
                        numbers, while the cavalry and artillery are quite as strong, as the
                        corresponding arms across the border. In nearly all the mobilisation
                        operations France is on a par with Germany, and it is a mistake to affirm
                        that the work of concentration would be hampered. "It suffices to throw a
                        glance on our network of railways to perceive at once the flagrant
                        exaggeration of the former Minister of Marine." France's real inferiority
                        chiefly consists in the lowness of her birth rate as compared with prolific
                        German. The German army can always be superior in numbers to the French,
                        which, however, can compensate for this drawback by suppleness. General
                        Langlois will discuss the "fortification crisis" in a subsequent article. </p>
                    <p>Will the Russian internal situation improve? It seems more than doubtful.
                        Much more likely is a long continued Jacquerie. The Russian peasant is slow
                        to move ; but he is harder to stop when once moved. We may expect that the
                        rising will be much more serious than in France in the Fourteenth Century. I
                        put this question to a financier this afternoon : 'Would you, as a sensible
                        man, buy Russian Four per Cents at this moment, considering what their price
                        is?" He replied : "I would not touch them with a long pole." I believe that
                        this view would be endorsed by all responsible men at this moment if their
                        interests were not the other way. No money is coming into the Russian
                        Treasury, because the taxes are not being paid. No money, unless secret
                        sources exist, is available for paying the exterior debt, because no loans
                        are being floated, which, hitherto, has been the method of paying the
                        coupons. An attempt was made recently to fix another few millions on the
                        shoulders of the French public, but they refused to take it. Therefore, the
                        logical outcome of the situation is this-the repudiation of the coupons, or,
                        at least, their non-payment. These are not light words to write. In plain
                        language, it means the ruin of France. It is hardly possible that this
                        country could recover from so stupendous a blow as that involved by a real
                        panic on the Russian market. The figures have touched to their yet lowest
                        point in Russia ; there will be some sort of response here. If the stock
                        were not artificially propped, it would be quoted at thirty to-day. One has
                        only to remember the Spanish Exterior that fell to twenty-five during the
                        war, and to-day is at ninety. It dropped five or six points in a single
                        day.</p>
                    <p>The terrible scenes in Russia have their echo in the Latin Quarter. There is
                        a large number of Russian students in a destitute and deplorable condition.
                        In some cases their parents, upon whom they relied for remittances, have
                        been ruined by the troubles and are no longer in a position to help ; in all
                        cases the breakdown in the postal arrangements has led to embarrassment.
                        There are really some tragic cases of poverty amongst these young men and
                        women. During the recent severe weather, two young girl students were
                        discovered by a benefactress in an attic without a fire, endeavouring to
                        study out of the same book. In normal times even the lot of many of these
                        students is a very hard one. They are passing rich on eighty francs a month.
                        The student who receives a hundred francs is a plutocrat.</p>
                    <p>Most of these interesting young persons are drawn from the small shop-keeping
                        class in Russia, and they come to France to attend the classes of the
                        Sorboune in an effort to improve their positions in the world. To this end
                        they are prepared to make extraordinary sacrifices of comfort and almost of
                        the bare necessities of life. It goes without saying that the major part of
                        this colony is not on calling terms with its country's Embassy. The student,
                        certainly the Russian student, is by nature a revolutionary, if not "par le
                        fait," at least by sympathy. These hard times, therefore, have brought him
                        no assistance from the representatives of his Government of Paris. A rich
                        Russian general living in the quarter of the Etoile was asked to help, but
                        he replied : "I am a patriot ; the others are not. I decline to assist
                        them." Others, whose conception of patriotism is somewhat different, have
                        not been content to leave a body of young persons wholly devoted to learning
                        in a state of destitution.</p>
                    <p>Now that the prisoners are acquitted by the verdict of the jury of the Assize
                        Court of the Seine, some unpublished facts may be given with regard to the
                        attempt on the life of Alfonso XIII. and M. Loubet. The plot was known to
                        several persons of the official world of Paris a few days before the
                        commission of the outrage. A personage prominently connected with the Opera
                        received a warning from a man whom he had befriended in earlier years. This
                        informant, realising his perilous position in face of the Anarchist society
                        to which he belonged, asked his benefactor to meet him at a certain spot on
                        the Boulevards a few mornings before the day on which the attempt was to be
                        made.</p>
                    <p>"I shall be sitting on a bench," said the communication, "and you will take
                        no particular notice of me." The high official who had received this
                        intimation repaired to the rendezvous indicated. He espied his quondam
                        protégé sitting on a bench. Near by was a kiosque, to which the official
                        went, and bought a newspaper. At that moment the man sidled up, and rapidly
                        conveyed his information. The attempt on the life of the King would be made,
                        he said, in the Opéra itself, during the progress of the gala performance.
                        The man then disappeared. Twenty-four hours afterwards he was found in a bar
                        on the outer Boulevards with two bullets in his body. It was the vengeance
                        of the secret society against whom he has committed an act of treason. The
                        police made no arrest in connection with this deed, knowing the utter
                        impossibility of finding the instrument of Anarchist vendetta.</p>
                    <p>M. Cronier was evidently a man who had a more exquisite sense of art than he
                        had of financial morality, as the sufferers in Egypt by the Sucreries crash
                        should be aware. The "Parisian" event of the week has been the sale of the
                        Cronier art collection at the Galerie George Petit. The crowd of would-be
                        purchasers or the merely curious was so great that all could not enter the
                        auction-room, but many stood in a compact squad along the pavements of the
                        Rue de Sèze. It is to be feared that in their zeal to limit overcrowding,
                        the police have prevented some having a serious intention to buy from
                        entering, in favor of the early bird who is merely attracted by a free
                        spectacle.</p>
                    <p>Never of recent years have pictures of such value belonging to the French and
                        English eighteenth century schools come into the Paris market. Gainsborough
                        is represented by a portrait, presumed to be that of Sir John Campbell ; a
                        study for the famous "Squire Hamlet and his Wife," and "Meditation," a
                        delightful figure of a young girl in a toilette of yellow silk. There is a
                        portrait of "Miss Day," by Sir Thomas Lawrence, and an admirable Sir Joshua
                        in the figure of a man in green uniform. "Lady Stanhope" is a brilliant
                        sketch for a portrait in the Reynolds manner. "The Young Dairymaid" is
                        Romney's portrait of Emma Hart, later Lady Hamilton. "Emily, Duchess of
                        Leinster," is also by Romney, and comes from the Witkins collection. A
                        picture in the French school to make a sensation is Watteau's "Lovers
                        Asleep." It is a little masterpiece in colour and composition. "Le Billet
                        Doux" is a delicious example of the master, a perfect evocation of beauty
                        and youth. Of the later painters there is Fragonard, whose genius and
                        perfect freedom from conventionality stand revealed in "La Liseuse." No very
                        important bibelots were included in this sale, but some of the choicest
                        tapestries of the Goberins and of Beauvais were submitted to public
                        judgement this afternoon. Evidently a man of great taste, M. Cronier.</p>
                    <p>More than six months ago, I was invited with several of my confrères to take
                        part in a trial run on a Gardner-Serpollet auto-omnibus, and I was assured
                        then that before long the auto-omnibus would be a familiar sight in the
                        streets of the capital, but weeks and months went on, and now we are
                        informed that Paris will not see the auto-omnibus running regularly before
                        the month of May. When we remember that Paris is the cradle of the motor car
                        industry, we are surprised to find that London should have so far
                        outstripped her in the popular developments of the automobile, and that long
                        before this city has come to a decision on the subject London has offered
                        the advantages of the motor omnibus to its inhabitants. Cost, we are
                        informed, has played a large part in the delay, and, that being so, I am not
                        surprised that Paris should lag behind, for wherever there is any risk of a
                        financial kind involved it will usually be found that an Englishman will
                        venture his money before a Frenchman. How the Frenchman reasons is shown in
                        an interview with the director of the workshops of the Paris General Omnibus
                        Company, published by a contemporary, "It would never do for us," said the
                        director, "to launch into a speculation of that kind"-the motor
                        omnibus-"until we had made the most complete tests, and had assured
                        ourselves that our profits would not be diminished by the change." One of
                        the reasons given for the delay in adopting the new method of locomotion is
                        the difference in the price of petrol. In London it is sold at 18 francs the
                        100 litres. In Paris it costs 48fr. 50c., which means that with 300
                        omnibuses working at the same rates as in London the expenses in Paris for
                        petrol alone would be £100,000 more per annum. The reason of the excessive
                        cost of petrol in this city is that the State claims a duty of 10fr. on
                        every 100 litres, and the municipality exacts another 20fr. on every 100
                        litres coming into the city. Then there is the item of rubber for the tyres.
                        Rubber is only a fraction higher in this country than in England, but there
                        is much more wood paving in London than in Paris, and the difference in
                        expenditure involved by hundreds of heavy vehicles running over the well
                        kept streets of London and inferiorly paved thoroughfares of Paris would, we
                        are assured, be very considerable.</p>
                    <p>Some morbid persons declare that the "beaux jours" of French cooking are
                        over. One of these, I remember, was the famous chef, Joseph, at the Maison
                        d'Or, alas, now nothing but a café like any other. "People do not dine any
                        more," he said in the bitterness of his soul ; "they just eat." It is sad to
                        reflect how many of the great restaurants have gone the way of all flesh.
                        The disappearance of Tortoni's and the Maison d'Or are but instances of the
                        growing taste for dinners at "prix fixe" instead of the stately repast-and
                        the stately bill-of other times.</p>
                    <p>But there is one place, at least, where they dine well in Paris-though I am
                        not saying that the banner of the "cuisine francaise" is not worthily upheld
                        by the clubs-and that is at the Elysée. Have not the Presidential dinners
                        played a large part in the creation of that pleasant atmosphere of entente
                        with which France is at this moment surrounded? If that is conceded, then M.
                        Loubet's cook is a very important personage. He has promoted the harmony of
                        the nations, whilst raising the culinary art to a high pitch. His name is
                        Tesch. He is a master of the mysteries of roasting ; he excels, likewise, in
                        the preparation of M. Loubet's favorite dish, the seasoned chicken. These
                        young and tender fowls are reared specially for the President's table. One
                        of the glories of M. Tesch's menu is his ragout of woodcock. When M. Witte
                        was the guest, recently, of the President at his country chateau of La
                        Bégude ae Mazenc, he tasted this traditional dish. Nevertheless, human
                        ingratitude is such that even the memory of such a triumph did not prevent
                        him from conspiring against France-or, at least, so it is said-in his
                        interview at <placeName>Potsdam</placeName>.</p>
                    <p>It is not often that the theory of a man's death being as his life receives
                        an illustration so dramatic as has just been given at Ville-en-Blasois, in
                        the Loiret Departnment. There lived in the town a Monsieur Adam, of good
                        fortune and standing, whose one weakness was wine, and he rode his hobby to
                        death. Becoming tired of life, but not of liquor, he resolved that even his
                        end should be an act of devotion to his only attachment. So getting a cask
                        of wine upright, and having the end taken out, he literally dived into
                        nectar, and, as he doubtless hoped, into elysium. Whether he also took one
                        last long draught history will never record. When found, he was
                        dead-literally over head and ears, and shoulders, too-in love.</p>

                        PINK PILLS AND WORKERS.</head>
                    <p>No employer can afford to engage a man whose movements are languid, whose
                        eyes are dull, and who visibly lacks energy. The man who is strong, active,
                        full of energy, and pleases at first sight always has the preference.
                        Unfortunately, men of real value to employers are often the victims of
                        overwork, and their breakdown is a serious matter in business and at home.
                        To such men Dr. Wlliams' Pink Pills are valuable above all other medicines,
                        for these pills restore strrength and nervous force, and enable breadwinners
                        to undertake work that was once beyond their physical strength.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Thomas Luce, whose home is at 6 Dennett-Road, Waddon Marsh-lane, Croydon,
                        found himself at the age of 38 in a most serious state of health.</p>
                    <p>"I first complained of pain in my legs," he stated, "and was treated for
                        Rheumatism. In spite of medicine I felt no better and would tremble all over
                        at times. A doctor then stated my disease had developed, and ordered me into
                        hospital, where I learned that my trouble was paralysis. After skillful
                        treatment I was finally brought away from hospital quite helpless, unable to
                        eat but morsels, a shadow of my former self, in constant pain and unable to
                        sleep.</p>
                    <p>"One day, at the request of a friend, I purchased a box of Dr. Williams' Pink
                        Pills for Pale People. That one box made a difference in me. I gained
                        courage, and as I continued the pills my health improved and helplessness
                        passed off. Before long I could eat well, became more vigorous, and soon
                        felt entirely cured and ready for work again."</p>
                    <p>Dr. Wlliams' Pink Pills arrest loss of strength in workers ; they fortify the
                        nervous and muscular systems, and give zest for business as well as
                        recreation. They are a perfect blood builder and nerve tonic, and have cured

                    <p>London, Dec. 5.</p>
                    <p>The absence of a cavalry regiment from Cairo is apparently a great drawback
                        to that garrison in more ways than one, judging by the lamentations which
                        periodically come therefrom. I am afraid, that in the present rage for
                        economy, there is little hope of a cavalry regiment going to Egypt. If, as
                        is expected, a Liberal Government succeed the present Conservative one,
                        there is every prospect of the necessity of a cavalry regiment, as Liberal
                        administrations have usually been characterised by troubles in the
                        Sudan.</p>
                    <p>Next June Brevet-Colonel S.G. Bird, D.S.O., Royal Dublin Fusiliers, will
                        vacate the command of the 1st Battalion which recently went from Malta to
                        Egypt, under the four-years' rule. In the usual course the command should go
                        to Brevet-Lieutenant Colonel A. W. Gordon, second in command of the 2nd
                        Battalion at Buttevant.</p>
                    <p>Judging from the report to hand, the Rifle Club of the Depot Royal Berkshire
                        Regiment made a fine record in the past year. The team made the good account
                        of 19 wins out of 25 matches. The ranges were 200 and 600 yards, and the
                        average score was 83.35 per match. This was a fine performance when we take
                        into calculation the calibre of some of their opponents-the Royal Horse
                        Guards (Blues), Reading and District Rifle Club, and 1st V. B. Royal Berks
                        staff. The Walton Cup, presented by Captain Walton of the 3rd Battalion, was
                        annexed by Colour Sergeant W. Cox. The latter's score for the 25 matches was
                        89.61.</p>
                    <p>The Army Council have had under their consideration the present condition of
                        the labour market, and the difficulty which appears to exist in finding
                        employment. With a view to enabling soldiers about to be transferred to the
                        Reserve or discharged to obtain information as to the state of the labour
                        market in the towns where they are contemplating taking up their residence,
                        officers in charge of Records are requested to forward monthly to the
                        several units with which they are connected, whether at home or abroad, a
                        statement of the condition of the labour maket, in the different centres in
                        their area. In addition, information should be given as to the number of
                        ex-soldiers in the district whose names are on the register of employment,
                        what prospects exist as to being able to provide this number with
                        employment, and whether, if any further increase in the number registering
                        is made, there is a reasonable hope that additional employment will be
                        forthcoming.</p>
                    <p>Captain C. F. Thursby, who commissioned the cruiser Encounter the other day,
                        will not take that ship out to the Australian Station, as he has been
                        appointed to the command of the cruiser King Alfred. The Encounter will be
                        taken out by Captain H.V.W. Elliott, who recently commanded the sloop Beagle
                        in the now defunct Atlantic Squadron. Captain Elliott has spent over 33
                        years in the Royal Navy, attaining his present rank in the June of last
                        year. He served in the expedition against an East African potentate named
                        M'buruk, June, 1895-whilst commanding the gunboat Magpie-and was present at
                        the storming and capture of his stronghold ; was in Sir Harry Rawson's
                        expedition to the Benin, 1897, resulting in the capture of the "City of
                        Blood" (mentioned in despatches, promoted commander, medal with clasp), and
                        during the South African War he landed guns for the defence of that
                        Mossell's Bay, which had been threatened by a Boer force.</p>
                    <p>Early in February the cruiser Berwick will return home from the Mediterranean
                        for recommissioning. The challenge shield which the people of Berwickshire
                        have subscribed for as a gunnery competition trophy will be presented to the
                        cruiser on her return.</p>
                    <p>The first-class cruiser Duke of Edinburgh will be completed for sea in about
                        six weeks time. She is destined for service on the China Station, where the
                        cruisers are to be strength-need by the addition of the latest type.</p>

                    <p>A BROKEN-DOWN SYSTEM.</p>
                    <p>This is a condition (or disease) to which doctors give many names, but which
                        few of them really understand. It it simply weakness—a break-down, as it
                        were, of the vital forces that sustain the system. No matter what may be its
                        causes (for they are almost numberless), its symptoms are much the same; the
                        more prominent being sleeplessness, sense of prostration or weariness,
                        depression of spirits and want of energy for all the ordinary affairs of
                        life. Now, what alone is absolutely essential in all such cases is increased
                        vitality—vigour--</p>
                    <p>VITAL STRENGTH &amp; ENERGY</p>
                    <p>to throw off these morbid feelings, and experience proves that as night
                        succeeds the day this may be more certainly secured by a course of the
                        celebrated life-reviving tonic</p>

                        "used up,” and valueless. This wonderful medicament is purely vegetable and
                        innocuous, is agreeable to the taste —suitable for all constitutions and
                        conditions, in either sex; and it is difficult to imagine a case of disease
                        or derangement, whose main features are those of debility, that will not be
                        speedily and permanently benefited by this never-failing recuperative
                        essence, which is destined to cast into oblivion everything that had
                        preceded it for this wide-spread and numerous class of human ailments.</p>
