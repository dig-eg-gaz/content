    <p>EGYPT AS A DUMPING GROUND.</p>
    <p>For a long time past we have noticed with regret a decided increase of European pauperism in our streets. The causes are not far to seek; they do not arise from local circumstances. The following case, for example, is an instance which is one of many. On Saturday last a large Russian steamer arrived from Odessa. Her forward decks were crowded with third class passengers, who appearance did not for the most part give one the idea that they possessed any adequate means for their future support. No one deplores more than we do the dreadful state to which a large part of the Russian population is reduced, and we can quite understand and sympathise with the anxiety of many of these poor people to find a happier home ; but this is a country in which there is no work fitted for them, and but little hope of anything beyond being a burden to their compatriots or co-religionists. </p>
    <p>We do not think that anyone has ever reproached the European inhabitants of Egypt with lack of charity : they do a great deal for those members of their communities the last favored by fortune ; but such efforts have limits. Charity is so noble a quality, that it seems ungracious to say anything which might be interpreted as a wish to restrain it, still it seems possible that exaggerated reports of the prosperity of Egypt, and of the facilities which the charitable institutions of its colonies afford, might be, and are becoming, an undue attraction to hundreds and thousands of people to come to this country. It is not only from Russia that they come ; Syria, Turkey, Greece, and several other countries all send more than are required here. Most other countries have in self-defence put some limits to such an invasion, and surely it is time that the Egyptian Government bethought itself of the duty of putting some restrictions on its unbounded hospitality, and of not allowing this country to become the dumping ground of all that is most undesirable in Southern Europe. </p>
    <p>We are of course very far from urging indiscriminate llegislation against immigration into Egypt. That would be the height of absurdity. Egypt owes everything to immigrants, and from the earliest ages it has been a land "flowing with milk and honey" in the imagination of the Near East. But nowadays a considerable majority of those who come from abroad to reside in Alexandria and Cairo are not only impecunious, but undesirable from every other point of view. Physically enfeebled and morally degenerate, they add largely to the already appalling amount of disease and crime which are the despair of the authorities. Indeed, it is the increasing stringency of legislation on this subject in other lands which is causing the question to become so urgent with ourselves. The conditions have altogether changed within the last few years. The United States, which till recently welcomed all and any immigrants to its vast territories, has now closed its doors to large numbers of those whom it formerly encouraged to land on its shores, while it permits no one to settle in its midst who cannot fulfil the various and stringent conditions set forth in its immigration laws. Australia is preparing to follow the American example, and England will probably soon do the same. As the most undesirable immigrants come from Southern Russia and Turkey and Southern Europe, Egypt must necessarily attract more and more of this class of people. Unless the Egyptian Government takes some measures to prevent the country becoming the dumping-ground of the scum of European and Asiatic countries, the state of the centres of European population in Egypt will grow from bad to worse.  </p>

                    <p>London, December 12.</p>
                    <p>The King has signed a decree for the formal prorogation of Parliament to the 15th January, but dissolution will probably take place on the 10th January.</p>
                    <p>The "Daily Chronicle” is enabled to announce the following appointments: Mr. Robert Spencer, Lord Chamberlain; the Marquis of Bute, Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs; Mr. Lawson Walton, Attorney General ; Mr. Thomas Shaw, Lord Advocate. Mr. Winston Churchill will probably be Under Secretary of State for the Colonies.</p>
                    <p>After the speech of Lord Rosebery, Mr. Rufus Isaacs declared that the inclusion of Sir E. Grey and of Mr. Fowler, Mr. Asquith and Mr. Haldane in the Cabinet was a guarantee that the Government’s policy would not be one leading op to Home Rule but would simply be one of governmental reform.</p>
                    <p>Sir E. Grey and the others named by Mr. Isaacs attended the reception of the Liberal League in the evening, thus apparently endorsing his declarations.</p> 	<p>(Reuter)</p>

                    <p>The officers appear to have had great difficulty  in preventing the crew from taking possession of the ship, though it is hard to say what they would have effected had they imitated the exploit of the crew of the Knias Potemkin.</p>

                    <p>Progress in the work of dredging the new pass to Alexandria is very satisfactory. The dredger began work last June and they have done more during the past six months than the contractors for the former pass did in three years. In the latter case, however, there was only one dredger and it could not be compared as regards its efficiency and strength with the present two huge powerful dredgers which are now at work on the new pass. The work ought to be brought to a completion within a couple of years or even within eighteen months from now.</p>
                    <p>The dredgers are at work night and day, but owing to the extraordinarily hard character of the rock, repairs have continually to be made on one or other of the dredgers, so it may be reckoned that really only one dredger is continuously  engaged.</p>

                    <head>POPULAR EXCITEMENT.</head>
                    <head>INCIDENT AT ALEXANDRIA.</head>
                    <p>Another incident took place in the neighbourhood of the Labbane Caracol yesterday. From the early morning the headquarters of the Alexandria City Police in the Labbane quarter had been the gathering-place of a crowd of natives of - the lowest class from the Ghanyna, who came thither to watch the transport of the prisoners, arrested for having participated in the unfortunate disturbances of last Sunday afternoon. The “Black Maria” vans of the Alexandria City Police were continually coming and going. Each van was carefully guarded by a mounted police escort, and the authorities had taken the utmost precautions to avoid any attempt to rescue the prisoners.</p>
                    <p>A large number of detectives in plain clothes, under the command of the mamour, were placed about the vicinity of the caracol and up to 3 p.m. the police had been most success-ful in keeping the crowd from indulging in any disorderly manifestations, and not a single breach of the peace had occurred. However, about 3 o’clock three police vans drew up at the caracol in order to take the prisoners in batches to Hadra gaol. The crowd of onlookers had by that time considerably increased since
                        the morning. At that moment a dispute arose between some natives and a Greek baker. The natives hit him and felled him to the ground. In his fall his head collided with the edge of the pavement and he was injured. The man was conveyed to the Labbane Caracol, where medical attendance was forthcoming.</p>
                    <p>This incident provoked great excitement, and the European inhabitants in the neighbourhood were seized with panic. Shop shutters were at once put up, doors bolted, and the crowd rushed hither and thither in an excited state, while alarming rumours were bruited with lightening velocity all over the town about the murder of a Greek by natives.</p>
                    <p>The police have arrested the men who assaulted the baker.</p>
                    <p>TRIAL OF RIOTERS.</p>
                    <p>The trial of the rioters, accused of having taken part in the disturbance on Sunday, will begin on Sunday next, when a hundred will be tried. On the following Monday a farther batch of 80 will be tried, and 40 on Tuesday. The others, who hare been arrested, will be let off.</p>
                    <p>PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES</p>
                    <p>H.M.S. Carnarvon, which was to have left Alexandria yesterday, will now stay here until further orders.</p>
                    <p>The Alexandria City Police has been reinforced from the provinces by 60 foot and 15 mounted men. In the Hamamil quarter and all that neighbourhood the beats have been doubled. Mounted police patrol the dangerous quarters of the city by night and by day.</p>
                    <p>The mamoura of the various kisms of Alex-andria yesterday received instructions as to what steps they should be prepared to take in case of any general disturbance.</p>
                    <p>The general state of tranquillity throughout the city has been very satisfactory during the past two days, and cases of disorder have been very rare.</p>
                    <p>THE BEDOUINS.</p>
                    <p>Various rumours have been current as to the threatening attitude of the Bedouin population in the neighbourhood of Alexandria, but nothing tends to show that these people are in a disturbed state. Yesterday afternoon Miralai Hopkinson Bey, Commandant of the Alexandria City Police, made a careful inspection of the Bedouins in the Ramleh district and found no signs of unrest among them. The Ramleh Police have taken away hundreds of nabouts from the Ramleh Bedouins.</p>
                    <p>FEELING IN CAIRO.</p>
                    <p>Cairo opinion on the recent riot is calm, though it is felt that the “season” will suffer from any repetition of the scenes that took place on Sunday afternoon. The native population and the Europeans alike regret the disturbance , and it is felt that strong measures should be taken against any persons, European or native, firing revolvers or displaying them in public exceptin the exercise of legitimate self-defence . The native Press expresses its great regret at the occurrences. “Al Watan” has seised the opportunity for an attaok on Mustapha Pasha Kamel, in which it reiterates the state ment that the Nationalist editor’s articles have helped to bring about the disorders of Sunday.</p>
                    <p>We understand that all the necessary mea-sures have been taken by the Government to prevent any recurrence of these troubles, but that much will depend on the attitude of the Europeans and natives of Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>THE NATIVE PRESS.</p>
                    <p>"Al Mokattam” remarks that had it not been for the Capitulations, Sunday's outbreak would not have occurred.</p>
                    <p>“A1 Moayad” declares that the disturbances originated with the Greeks, and points out that they should he prohibited from carrying arms, in the same way as the natives are Unless these hot-tempered people are kept under control by the Government in this respect, says our vernacular contemporary, a dangerous state of feeling may be  engendered throughout the country.</p>

                    <head>EXAMPLE FROM BEYROUT</head>
                    <head>USE OF THE BASTINADO.</head>
                    <p>A correspondent writes:—Not many months ago a state of unrest, vary similar to that which prevails in Alexandria at the present moment and which found expression in the riot of last Sunday afternoon, existed in Beyrout, where foreigners were daily molested by the Hooligan portion of the Moslem population and some were actually attacked. These troubles led to the removal of the Governor, and a new man was sent to replace him. The first act of this new Vali was to send for all the instigators of the troubles and administer to each a good dose of the stick.The effect was instantaneous and in 48 hours those Moslem Hooligans who had escaped the bastinado were doing all fa their power to show themselves to be on the best of terms with their Christian neighbours and the town was safer and quieter than it had been for years. The dread of the stick was so marked that many of the worst characters left the district and have never ventured to return. I suggest that if the same treatment were meted out to some of the 500 roughs whom the police have arretted for last Sunday’s riot we should hear no more of unrest in Alexandria. This is the only punishment which these men understand and appreciate, and its moral effect is marvellous. It has been evident to most people that for a long time past the natives here have been growing insolent, and as anything approaching a serious riot would do incalculable injury to the com-mmercial and financial interests of the country I trust that the authorities will make up their minds to deal with the matter in the manner which has proved so very effective in other parts of the East.</p>

                    <p>A British official who is residing in the Mai-son Tedeschi, Cairo, awoke the other night to hear steps hurrying from his room. On making investigations he found that £2 in gold and P.T. 35 in silver, a pair of gold-rimmed pince-nez, some gold studs, several pocket handkerchiefs, and other trifles had disappeared. Armed with a hockey stick he made his way to the bedroom of a friend and the two commenced a search which proved fruitless. Early morning brought their landlady face to face with the unpleasant discovery that much of her cutlery had followed the £2 and the links. The bowab, who is suspected of connivance, if not of the actual theft, was arrested in the morning. His house was searched and the exact sum of P.T. 35 was found there, but no further evidence, as far as is known, has yet been produced against him.</p>
