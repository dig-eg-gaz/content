    <p>EGYPT AS A DUMPING GROUND.</p>
    <p>For a long time past we have noticed with regret a decided increase of European pauperism in our streets. The causes are not far to seek; they do not arise from local circumstances. The following case, for example, is an instance which is one of many. On Saturday last a large Russian steamer arrived from Odessa. Her forward decks were crowded with third class passengers, who appearance did not for the most part give one the idea that they possessed any adequate means for their future support. No one deplores more than we do the dreadful state to which a large part of the Russian population is reduced, and we can quite understand and sympathise with the anxiety of many of these poor people to find a happier home ; but this is a country in which there is no work fitted for them, and but little hope of anything beyond being a burden to their compatriots or co-religionists. </p>
    <p>We do not think that anyone has ever reproached the European inhabitants of Egypt with lack of charity : they do a great deal for those members of their communities the last favored by fortune ; but such efforts have limits. Charity is so noble a quality, that it seems ungracious to say anything which might be interpreted as a wish to restrain it, still it seems possible that exaggerated reports of the prosperity of Egypt, and of the facilities which the charitable institutions of its colonies afford, might be, and are becoming, an undue attraction to hundreds and thousands of people to come to this country. It is not only from Russia that they come ; Syria, Turkey, Greece, and several other countries all send more than are required here. Most other countries have in self-defence put some limits to such an invasion, and surely it is time that the Egyptian Government bethought itself of the duty of putting some restrictions on its unbounded hospitality, and of not allowing this country to become the dumping ground of all that is most undesirable in Southern Europe. </p>
    <p>We are of course very far from urging indiscriminate llegislation against immigration into Egypt. That would be the height of absurdity. Egypt owes everything to immigrants, and from the earliest ages it has been a land "flowing with milk and honey" in the imagination of the Near East. But nowadays a considerable majority of those who come from abroad to reside in Alexandria and Cairo are not only impecunious, but undesirable from every other point of view. Physically enfeebled and morally degenerate, they add largely to the already appalling amount of disease and crime which are the despair of the authorities. Indeed, it is the increasing stringency of legislation on this subject in other lands which is causing the question to become so urgent with ourselves. The conditions have altogether changed within the last few years. The United States, which till recently welcomed all and any immigrants to its vast territories, has now closed its doors to large numbers of those whom it formerly encouraged to land on its shores, while it permits no one to settle in its midst who cannot fulfil the various and stringent conditions set forth in its immigration laws. Australia is preparing to follow the American example, and England will probably soon do the same. As the most undesirable immigrants come from Southern Russia and Turkey and Southern Europe, Egypt must necessarily attract more and more of this class of people. Unless the Egyptian Government takes some measures to prevent the country becoming the dumping-ground of the scum of European and Asiatic countries, the state of the centres of European population in Egypt will grow from bad to worse.  </p>

                    <p>The King has signed a decree for the formal prorogation of Parliament to the 15th January, but dissolution will probably take place on the 10th January.</p>

Mr. Winston Churchill will probably be Under Secretary of State for the Colonies.</p>
                    <p>After the speech of Lord Rosebery, Mr. Rufus Isaacs declared that the inclusion of Sir E. Grey and of Mr. Fowler, Mr. Asquith and Mr. Haldane in the Cabinet was a guarantee that the Government’s policy would not be one leading op to Home Rule but would simply be one of governmental reform.</p>
                    <p>Sir E. Grey and the others named by Mr. Isaacs attended the reception of the Liberal League in the evening, thus apparently endorsing his declarations.</p> 	<p>(Reuter)</p>

                    <p>Reports from Port Said state that the crew of the Russian cruiser Diana, which recently passed through the Canal, were fa a state bordering on mutiny. Among other manifestations reported was the removal of the ship’s figure-head bearing the Imperial arms.</p>
                    <p>The officers appear to have had great difficulty  in preventing the crew from taking possession of the ship, though it is hard to say what they would have effected had they imitated the exploit of the crew of the Knias Potemkin.</p>
                    <p>The Diana, which displaces about 6,000 tons and carries 8 6 inch and 20 twelve-pounder quick-firers, took part in the action off Round Island on August 10, 1904. After the battle,in which she did not sustain great damage, she escaped to Saigon and was interned there for the remainder of the war.</p>

                    <p>Progress in the work of dredging the new pass to Alexandria is very satisfactory. The dredger began work last June and they have done more during the past six months than the contractors for the former pass did in three years. In the latter case, however, there was only one dredger and it could not be compared as regards its efficiency and strength with the present two huge powerful dredgers which are now at work on the new pass. The work ought to be brought to a completion within a couple of years or even within eighteen months from now.</p>
                    <p>The dredgers are at work night and day, but owing to the extraordinarily hard character of the rock, repairs have continually to be made on one or other of the dredgers, so it may be reckoned that really only one dredger is continuously  engaged.</p>

                    <head>POPULAR EXCITEMENT.</head>
                    <head>INCIDENT AT ALEXANDRIA.</head>
                    <p>Another incident took place in the neighbourhood of the Labbane Caracol yesterday. From the early morning the headquarters of the Alexandria City Police in the Labbane quarter had been the gathering-place of a crowd of natives of - the lowest class from the Ghanyna, who came thither to watch the transport of the prisoners, arrested for having participated in the unfortunate disturbances of last Sunday afternoon. The “Black Maria” vans of the Alexandria City Police were continually coming and going. Each van was carefully guarded by a mounted police escort, and the authorities had taken the utmost precautions to avoid any attempt to rescue the prisoners.</p>
                    <p>A large number of detectives in plain clothes, under the command of the mamour, were placed about the vicinity of the caracol and up to 3 p.m. the police had been most success-ful in keeping the crowd from indulging in any disorderly manifestations, and not a single breach of the peace had occurred. However, about 3 o’clock three police vans drew up at the caracol in order to take the prisoners in batches to Hadra gaol. The crowd of onlookers had by that time considerably increased since
                        the morning. At that moment a dispute arose between some natives and a Greek baker. The natives hit him and felled him to the ground. In his fall his head collided with the edge of the pavement and he was injured. The man was conveyed to the Labbane Caracol, where medical attendance was forthcoming.</p>
                    <p>This incident provoked great excitement, and the European inhabitants in the neighbourhood were seized with panic. Shop shutters were at once put up, doors bolted, and the crowd rushed hither and thither in an excited state, while alarming rumours were bruited with lightening velocity all over the town about the murder of a Greek by natives.</p>
                    <p>The police have arrested the men who assaulted the baker.</p>
                    <p>TRIAL OF RIOTERS.</p>
                    <p>The trial of the rioters, accused of having taken part in the disturbance on Sunday, will begin on Sunday next, when a hundred will be tried. On the following Monday a farther batch of 80 will be tried, and 40 on Tuesday. The others, who hare been arrested, will be let off.</p>
                    <p>PRECAUTIONARY MEASURES</p>
                    <p>H.M.S. Carnarvon, which was to have left Alexandria yesterday, will now stay here until further orders.</p>
                    <p>The Alexandria City Police has been reinforced from the provinces by 60 foot and 15 mounted men. In the Hamamil quarter and all that neighbourhood the beats have been doubled. Mounted police patrol the dangerous quarters of the city by night and by day.</p>
                    <p>The mamoura of the various kisms of Alex-andria yesterday received instructions as to what steps they should be prepared to take in case of any general disturbance.</p>
                    <p>The general state of tranquillity throughout the city has been very satisfactory during the past two days, and cases of disorder have been very rare.</p>
                    <p>THE BEDOUINS.</p>
                    <p>Various rumours have been current as to the threatening attitude of the Bedouin population in the neighbourhood of Alexandria, but nothing tends to show that these people are in a disturbed state. Yesterday afternoon Miralai Hopkinson Bey, Commandant of the Alexandria City Police, made a careful inspection of the Bedouins in the Ramleh district and found no signs of unrest among them. The Ramleh Police have taken away hundreds of nabouts from the Ramleh Bedouins.</p>
                    <p>FEELING IN CAIRO.</p>
                    <p>Cairo opinion on the recent riot is calm, though it is felt that the “season” will suffer from any repetition of the scenes that took place on Sunday afternoon. The native population and the Europeans alike regret the disturbance , and it is felt that strong measures should be taken against any persons, European or native, firing revolvers or displaying them in public exceptin the exercise of legitimate self-defence . The native Press expresses its great regret at the occurrences. “Al Watan” has seised the opportunity for an attaok on Mustapha Pasha Kamel, in which it reiterates the state ment that the Nationalist editor’s articles have helped to bring about the disorders of Sunday.</p>
                    <p>We understand that all the necessary mea-sures have been taken by the Government to prevent any recurrence of these troubles, but that much will depend on the attitude of the Europeans and natives of Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>THE NATIVE PRESS.</p>
                    <p>"Al Mokattam” remarks that had it not been for the Capitulations, Sunday's outbreak would not have occurred.</p>
                    <p>“A1 Moayad” declares that the disturbances originated with the Greeks, and points out that they should he prohibited from carrying arms, in the same way as the natives are Unless these hot-tempered people are kept under control by the Government in this respect, says our vernacular contemporary, a dangerous state of feeling may be  engendered throughout the country.</p>

                    <head>EXAMPLE FROM BEYROUT</head>
                    <head>USE OF THE BASTINADO.</head>
                    <p>A correspondent writes:—Not many months ago a state of unrest, vary similar to that which prevails in Alexandria at the present moment and which found expression in the riot of last Sunday afternoon, existed in Beyrout, where foreigners were daily molested by the Hooligan portion of the Moslem population and some were actually attacked. These troubles led to the removal of the Governor, and a new man was sent to replace him. The first act of this new Vali was to send for all the instigators of the troubles and administer to each a good dose of the stick.The effect was instantaneous and in 48 hours those Moslem Hooligans who had escaped the bastinado were doing all fa their power to show themselves to be on the best of terms with their Christian neighbours and the town was safer and quieter than it had been for years. The dread of the stick was so marked that many of the worst characters left the district and have never ventured to return. I suggest that if the same treatment were meted out to some of the 500 roughs whom the police have arretted for last Sunday’s riot we should hear no more of unrest in Alexandria. This is the only punishment which these men understand and appreciate, and its moral effect is marvellous. It has been evident to most people that for a long time past the natives here have been growing insolent, and as anything approaching a serious riot would do incalculable injury to the com-mmercial and financial interests of the country I trust that the authorities will make up their minds to deal with the matter in the manner which has proved so very effective in other parts of the East.</p>

                    <p>A British official who is residing in the Mai-son Tedeschi, Cairo, awoke the other night to hear steps hurrying from his room. On making investigations he found that £2 in gold and P.T. 35 in silver, a pair of gold-rimmed pince-nez, some gold studs, several pocket handkerchiefs, and other trifles had disappeared. Armed with a hockey stick he made his way to the bedroom of a friend and the two commenced a search which proved fruitless. Early morning brought their landlady face to face with the unpleasant discovery that much of her cutlery had followed the £2 and the links. The bowab, who is suspected of connivance, if not of the actual theft, was arrested in the morning. His house was searched and the exact sum of P.T. 35 was found there, but no further evidence, as far as is known, has yet been produced against him.</p>

                    <head>NOTES FROM PORT SAID.
                        VISIT OF NEW ZEALANDERS.
                        PROBABILITY OF MATCH.</head>
                    <p>(From Our Correspondent.)</p>
                    <p>Port Said, Monday.</p>
                    <p>An effort is being made to induce the New Zealand representative Rugby footballers to give an exhibition game in the event of their return by the Canal. Should the "All Blacks" agree to open the new Sports Club grounds at Port Said it would be easy to find a few odd men to make up the two fifteens. The Maorilanders number, all told, twenty-eight. It has been suggested that a good team to represent Egypt might be selected from Cairo and Alexandria. But probably this would only be giving the colonials another opportunity of adding to their huge score and unbeaten record.</p>
                    <p>In football circles there seems to be a healthy rivalry. On Saturday last the Maltese eleven went down to the Arab school to the tune of one to nothing.</p>
                    <p>Next week the English Club play a return match with the school eleven. The Arab boys show great promise as footballers. With a little teaching they would be bad to beat and their passing and combination is better than that of other local teams.</p>
                    <p>The international ball to be held on the 16th inst. promises to be a great success, four hundred people having already promised to attend.</p>
                    <p>To still further add to the funds required for the inauguration of the International Sports Club it has been proposed to hold a second fancy dress ball early next year.</p>
                    <p>The meetings at the tennis court are very popular, and give an opportunity for British residents at Port Said meeting at least once a week socially.</p>
                    <p>The effort to unite the two English Clubs has received active support and it is probable that this hardy annual may next season blossom into something more than more discussions and suggestions.</p>
                    <p>Arrivals of Touriste.</p>
                    <p>The tourist companies, Cook's and the Anglo-American, seem to be up to their eyes in work. Every liner brings a larger number of people for Cairo and the Nile.</p>
                    <p>The hotels seem to be doing well. The Savoy has made extensive alterations and enlargements, including a café-bar on the ground floor overlooking the harbour.</p>
                    <p>The Eastern Exchange has opened an ornamental garden at the back of the hotel and thus provided an open space at the rear.</p>
                    <p>Last week Princess Louise of Schleswig Holstein en passant visited the British Hospital.</p>
                    <p>Building operations are progressing on all sides. The new Bank of Egypt will add considerably to the appearance of the main street.</p>
                    <p>Lake Mwnxaleh Service.</p>
                    <p>The trial trips of the new steamers on Lake Menzaleh have been very successful. Probably next year a regular service will be opened to Damietta.</p>
                    <p>Lake Menzaleh is swarming with fish, as was noticed during the trial trips of the new barges and paddle boats. If more up-to-date methods of fishing were adopted an even larger harvest would be obtained.</p>
                    <p>The idea of a Municipality for Port Said has been mooted of late. But the majority of the people would object to anything likely to add to the present price paid for the luxury of living in Port Said.</p>
                    <p>Cost of Living.</p>
                    <p>During the blockage of the canal by the Chatham the prices in the bazaar were put up and have not yet been lowered. The Arab traders seem to have formed a ring to keep up the price of such commodities as eggs, milk, vegetables, fruit, fish, etc. The cost of living in Port Said has increased of late years. More especially is this noticeable in engaging domestic servants. Whereas a few years ago one could obtain a cook for twenty or thirty francs a month, now many of them ask three or four pounds.</p>
                    <p>The nuisance of street vendors molesting passengers and the annoyance of unauthorised touts and unlicensed boatmen and hawkers which used to be so noticeable at Port Said has lessened considerably of late, since the police began to suppress the worst offenders.</p>
                    <p>More Dwellings Wanted.</p>
                    <p>There is a demand for more dwelling houses in Port Said. The tendency seems to be for the English people to migrate towards the beach.</p>
                    <p>It is hoped that next year the nuisance caused by not regulating the bathing berths, especially from a sanitary point of view, will not detract from the pleasures of a dip in the sea.</p>
                    <p>The idea of building a Casino on the beach seems to have been nipped in the bud.</p>
                    <p>That there is some means of amusement required for people in Port Said is abundantly evident, as the environment is not such as to encourage the people to go far outside the town.</p>
                    <p>There is abundant evidence of past progress, however, to show that soon the late George Steevens' description of the town as "a black island of coal, jabbering island of tents, and c., shut in by sea, swamp and sand, not more entertaining in the season than out of season," will certainly be as undeserved as it was originally perhaps a little exaggerated.</p>

                    <head>NOTES FROM SUAKIN.
                        ENGLISH CHURCH SERVICES.</head>
                    <p>(From our Correspondent).</p>
                    <p>Suakin, Dec. 6.</p>
                    <p>Archdeacon Gwynne arrived here from Khartoum last week in order to establish an English Church at Suakin, and succeeded so far that a room in Government House was given up for the purpose of being turned into a chapel, and a committee was formed under the presidency of H.E. the Governor, Hawker Bey, to arrange for the furnishing of the church. The sum of £13 had been collected previously by Mr. Mackenzie, Superintendent, Eastern Telegraph Co. here, during the services held in his house, and this amount was handed over to the committee. </p>
                    <p>Regular fortnightly services have been arranged and a chaplain will come down every alternate Sunday from Khartoum or elsewhere to hold these services. On other Sundays the services will be taken either by Mr. Mackenzie or some other English gentleman.</p>
                    <p>First Baptism.</p>
                    <p>A Church of England baptism took place in the new chapel on the 3rd inst. The three children of Mr. Warne, chief engineer of the railway condensers, and Mrs. Warne, were baptised by Archdeacon Gwynne. This is the first English baptism on record in the Lower Sudan. After the christening Archdeacon Gwynne held the eveniong service. The chapel was crowded with Britishers.</p>
                    <p>Archdeacon Gwynne left for Khartoum yesterday, via the Atbara. He will accompany a missions party to the Upper Sudan from Khartoum.</p>
                    <p>The British S.S. Sahara, of Glasgow, arrived here on the 4th inst. from Australia with about 54,000 Yarrah wood sleepers for the Sudan Railways.</p>
                    <p>Port Sudan Line.</p>
                    <p>The Port Sudan line is being hurriedly pushed on and it is expected that it will be completed by the 15th January, 1906. Over 2,000 labourers from Egypt and the Sudan, besides men of the Railway Battalion, are employed on the permanent way, under the supervision of Kaimakam Sowerby Bey and Bimbashi Newcombe, R.E.</p>
                    <p>Another condenser for the Suakin Railways was completed and started running to-day. One of the two condensers will soon be pulled down to be erected at Port Sudan for the railway and town.</p>
                    <p>Kaimakam Longfield Bey, R.E., Assistant Director of Railways, and Mr. Hodgson, Loco. and Stores Superintendent, Sudan Railways, arrived by special train yesterday from Atbara.</p>
                    <p>Miralai Macauley Bey, R.E., Director of Sudan Railways, is at present busily engaged making out the establishment rolls of each department, which will take effect from the New Year, for those who remain on the permanent list and who were formerly employed on the construction of the Suakin-Atbara line.</p>
                    <p>It is now rumoured that the grant of the gratuity which was to have been given to the men employed on the Suakin-Atbara line on completion of the line, is postponed until the Port Sudan line is completed.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Garger, English Secretary to the Director of Sudan Railways, returned here by the Khedivial Mail steamer Mahallah on the 3rd inst. from his leave of absence.</p>

                    <head>THE QUESTION OF THE DAY.
                        POINTS FOR REFLECTION.</head>
                    <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                    <p>Sir-The disturbances on Sunday afternoon at Alexandria and the general popular fermant throughout the country should be taken to heart by those foolish people in England, who, for the sake of their friends the Armenians, and other persons of that sort, clamour for a forward policy against Turkey. I read the sensible letter of "An Eye Witness" in the "Gazette" of yesterday and soon after I read the recent letter of Syed Abdul Majid, of the Pan-Islamic Society, in the "Morning Post." Are we to consider that the mob was only out for a lark on Sunday? Was it merely an aimless demonstration of as little import as the recent "rag" at Cambridge? Is the fermentation only the excitement of rowdy shoeblacks? </p>
                    <p>Sayed Abdul Majid writes:--"Is the attitude of England in concert with the European Powers towards Turkey a wise one concerning the millions of Mussulmans whom she numbers as her subjects? It cannot fail to shock every Mussulman. The Ottoman Empire, as the seat of their religious head, is dear to every Muslim heart, despite little differences among them. The downfall of Turkey is tantamount to a universal war between the Christians and the Muslims, as every Muslim is bound to fly to the banner of the promised Mahdi who, according to the traditions, will manifest himself when Constantinople will be in danger (see Sale's Koran, Prelim. Disc.), with a consequence which must be deplored by every lover of humanity. The issues of war are uncertain, and no one can foretell that they would be like that of the battle of Omdurman. Nor is this all that should stay at the impolitic hand of England. There is yet another consideration. She will have to suffer most. Heaven forbid if such a cruel war were to be proclaimed. The millions of loyal Muslims who, without the least exaggeration, form the bulwark of the British Empire in India and otherwhere, will with great sorrow bid farewell to their hearth and home for the sake of their religion. The Holy War in the holy cause of religion every Muslim is bound to take part in. The horrors of the Indian Mutiny ought to teach us to be very cautious wherever the religious prejudices of the Asiatics are concerned. There is no justification whatever for the dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire. The Turkish Provinces which have been granted autonomy under the so-called intervention of the Powers are worse governed now than they were before. Whatever may be said with "duty and humanity"--terms which furnish nations with pretexts to guide their sinister policies as Oppenheim, one of the most recent writers on International Law, has shown-the Powers are committing a flagrant breach of good faith. In accordance with the pernicious methods adopted by Russia in 1877 the agitation in Macedonia was directly or indirectly encouraged by the Powers, and the effect was so outrageous that even our present Premier recognised the "balance of criminality to lie on the side of the insurgents." Is this, then, a rightful cause for a united action?"  </p>
                    <p>His words are supported in a letter which appeared in the "Times" a few days aho from Judge Ameer Ali, who concludes it with the following warning:--"I know that nothing that any Mohamedan can say will alter for a moment the decision of the Powers, but the occasion must not be allowed to pass without a protest in the name or humanity and common justice against a policy which is likely to engulf Eastern Europe and religious war, the effects of which will be felt far beyond the limits of the Turkish Empire."</p>
                    <p>Both these gentlemen are Moslems, so it may be considered that their opinions are not impartial. But Mr. Archibald Colquhoun in the "Morning Post" sounds the same note of warning. He says:--"Those who do not believe in the power of Pan-=Islam ask : Where are their arms? Where are their leaders? But it is not so much a great open crusade that must be feared as the simultaneous outbreak in different parts of the world of that spirit of fanaticism manifested in outbreaks and risings of which we have already witnessed serious examples. France, with a precarious hold over wild, untameable Kabyle tribes, among whom the Senoussi have been at work, is in an especially dangerous position, and England, with seventy millions of Mussulman subjects (over a fourth of the whole world of Islam), cannot for a moment afford to be blind to the possible attitude of those subjects in a matter which touches the dignity of their chosen head -- the representative of their Prophet."</p>
                    <p>Are not these extracts sufficient to warn the European Powers of the danger of attempting to meddle with the "Sick Man of the Near East."--I am, etc.,</p>

                        VISIT TO EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>Describing her experience while on tour to a representative of the "Indian Daily News" at Calcutta, Miss Georgie Corlass, the leading lady of Randmann's Opera Company, thus expresses herself regarding the Khedivial Opera House at Cairo :...and Malts, and then Cairo--the best of the lot! The Khedivial Opera House is a huge place, and one felt quite lost on the enormous stage and wondered whether the audience would hear one!"</p>
                    <p>"It is supposed to be the best playhouse out of London or Paris," the pressman ventured.</p>
                    <p>"A beautiful theatre," said Miss Corlass, "and like everything else in Cairo absolutely up-to-date in all its appointments and surroundings.</p>
                    <p>Friends of Mr. Bandmann in Egypt will be interested to hear that that enterprising impresario has taken a leave of the Opera House, Calcutta, where his company judging by press reports to hand, is meeting with enormous success. It is not improbable that Mr. Bandmann's opera company will pay a visit to Egypt in the early part of the next year, when it is replaced in Calcutta by his comely company, which is now being recruited in England.</p>

                    <p>The "Daily Telegraph" in the financial article of the 2nd inst. remarks:--</p>
                    <p>As regards money, it is expected that Egypt will soon begin to return some of the gold which we have had to send, and reports from that country make such an event the more probable as the banks are wisely curtailing facilities in order to check the excessive speculation that has taken place.</p>

                    <head>FUTURE OF THE ROYAL MARINES.</head>
                    <p>The future of the Royal Marines, the "sea" regiment as it has been aptly called, has been somewhat prematurely declared to mean the withdrawal of the military contingent from warships afloat. It has been said that the Royal Marines will be utilised in garrison duty at Naval stations at home and abroad, a measure which the Admiralty has never cordially approved. Naturally, it will dissent from the payment of troops raised primarily for service at sea, if they are employed as land forces. But the publication of the Naval programme yesterday contains no reference to the transfer of the Royal Marines to exclusive garrison duty. It is distinctly stated that there will be no permanent specialisation of marine officers, and that while military duties will be allocated to some, all will continue to be interchangeable throughout their career. "The Royal Marines will not in future possess a staff of officers entirely distinct from the officers of the Royal Navy." But those employed in military duties will be more closely associated in every rank with the sea service. There must be a section of the ship's company corresponding with the Marines, men who will assist in fighting but without the possessing special nautical or engineering skill. These soldiers, combatants, most always be usefully retained ; they are the most efficient class for operations on shore on the many occasions when a force must necessarily be landed.</p>

                    <p>The "New York Comnmercial" remarks :--</p>
                    <p>"Egypt is one of the countries which for one reason or another has not proved particularly attractive to American exporters. Pherhaps it is because of the peculiar trade methods common among the Egyptians, or the absence of suitable banking and shipping connections, but, whatever the cause may be, Americans have taken advantage of only a few of the trade opportunities open to foreing manufacturers." The New York newspaper makes long extracts from the reports of the British Chamber of Commerce of Egypt.</p>

                    <head>A RED SEA INCIDENT.</head>
                    <p>A curious adventure befell a cat on an Orient Liner in the Red Sea recently. Soon after the Liner left Sydney, one of the ship's cats was missed, and it was supposed that it must have been left behind. Thirty-two days later, when the steamer was in the Red Sea, somebody heard a faint mewing from the refrigerating chamber. The room was opened, and the poor cat was found in a fearfully emaciated condition. One of its ears and a portion of its nose had been bitten off by the icy atmosphere of the chamber. The fur had grown to great length, but portions of it fell off when the cat was touched or stroked. It had also changed colour from black to white. The cat has now resumed regular duty on the ship.</p>

                    <head>IRRIGATION ENGINEERING.</head>
                    <p>By Sir Hanbury Brown, K.C.M.G., late Inspector General of Irrigation in Lower Egypt, and formerly in Upper Egypt.</p>
                    <p>XI.</p>
                    <p>The problem of the economical distribution of water is made more difficult wherever rice cultivation has to be taken into account. Rice is not liable to suffer from being overwatered in the way that cotton and other summer crops are. Consequently the rice grower has no inducement to be economical with the water supply, and will use as much water as he can get, short of drowning the crop. In addition to this, rice cannot exist with such long intervals between waterings as those allowed in the case of cotton. If deprived of water for more than five or six days, the rice plant, at any rate while young, is liable to suffer. Therefore, for canals from which rice is irrigated, a two-section arrangement is adopted, each section working for four days and stopping for five. The day when neither section works comes after the working of the upper section, and is utilised for filling the channels of the lower section before water is drawn off from them. As the rice full period of rotation of nine days, a cultivator may, if he likes, raise cotton, or rice or both. Supposing he has an area of 200 acres to put under crop, he can sow it all with rice, and irrigate it once every nine days ; or he can plant it all with cotton, and irrigate 100 acres during one turn and the other hundred during the next, so that one watering in eighteen days is given to it all. Or, again, he may put 100 acres under rice and 100 under cotton. In this case, he would irrigate all the rice and 50 acres of cotton during one period of nine days, and all the rice again, and the other 50 acres of cotton during the next nine-day period ; so that, in every case, the rice would get a watering in nine days and the cotton in eighteen days. The cultivator is thus free to plant what, in his own judgement, is best for his interests under the conditions imposed by the programme of rotations enforced.  </p>
                    <p>In these articles nothing has been written about inland navigation, river training, flood banks and reclamation of land further than to refer to them as matters with which the irrigation engineer may have to deal. The importance of inland navigation will, it is hoped, not long hence receive practical recognition in England. It is too large a subject to discuss within the limits of these articles.</p>
                    <p>The methods of river training depend so much on varying conditions, that general principles, applicable to all cases, have not yet been enunciated, other than that by some means the channel must be brought to an uniform corss-section, adapted to the river discharges, so that there may be no silting or scouring ; and it must be induced to form itself along the most favorable alignment possible. For a certain class of river work the experience gained on the Mississippi will be found most valuable. But as so much of river training work depends for its success on the ingenuity displayed in details, and on the nature of materials to hand, the best thing to do, if one is entrusted with such work, is to study the reports of previous work carried out under conditions similar to those which prevail in the river to be operated on. The forms of spurs and groynes, for instance, vary according to the resources of the locality. In Egypt they are now made of limestone rubble, as the fittest to survive of all the materials experimented with.</p>
                    <p>In the four largest canals in Egypt, which flow with considerable depth, it has been found necessary to protect the sides from erosion by pairs of opposing spurs placed at intervals of about 300 yards from pair to pair. These not only prevent the canal alignment from becoming irregular under the process by which a river becomes winding, but they also prevent the bed from shoaling in consequence of erosion of the banks. Since these spurs were made there has been a most satisfactory diminution in the amount of silt deposit that has to be annually dredged from the canals.</p>
                    <p>Concerning Nile banks, there is not much to be said. Provided they are kept in repair, they do not breach from weakness, but from being undermined by the cutting action of the river. To guard against this they should be set back fifty yards or more from the river's edge, and any nearer advance upon them by the river be prevented by spurs and rivetments to protect those points or lengths where cutting action is detected. Culverts for the irrigation of land behind the banks should, by preference, be absolutely forbidden ; but if they are allowed, they should be built to such a design and in such a manner as not to constitute points of weakness in the bank.</p>
                    <p>Finally, a few words about land reclamation. This, in some of its aspects, is more an agricultural than an irrigation question. In his paper on "Irrigation in the United States," read at St. Louis before the International Engineering Congress of 1904, Mr. Elwood Mead remarks on the tendency to magnify the construction side of irrigation, and adds :-- "While we may not give too much attention to problems connected with dam and canal building, we fail to give enough to those connected with the agricultural and economic side. It is the work of the farmer which, after all, determines the value of irrigation properties. In irrigation, construction problems come first, agricultural and economic ones later, but they are the problems of enduring importance."</p>

                        L'AIGLON.</head>
                    <p>No one on Monday night had anything but praise for the performance. It is perhaps one of the hardest of all plays to achieve with credit ; its length, the staging, the many parts, and for all the actors the endless juxtaposition of passion and pathos, with a sudden disconcerting word of wit clinching a line or a passage ; for sheer technique in verse and rhyme it is surely Rostand's highest work, whatever one may think of it from other points of view. One has to admit that in the actual performance only three actors shone-or could shine for that matter : for really there are only three parts, Le Duc, Flambeau, and Metternich. Metternich was admirably done by M. Monteux, though perhaps one would object to the vehemence in the mirror scene : for the rest, he struck and held the right note of subtlety and dignity. Flambeau (M. Daragon) showed a real capacity and filled the part in every way. He and, of course, Mme Moreno are evidently far ahead of their colleagues, and it is reassuring to have two such players, the lack of whom would certainly have marred such a play completely. Mme Moreno could not have played the Duo de Reichstadt better. We have already mentioned her admirable diction, voice, gesture, glances, all the detail which only a real artist cultivates and shows, and all these were at their height. One can hardly criticise scene by scene or act by act, but we feel most inclined to commemorate the last act of all. More than one actress is capable of great things in a passionate scene, but it is only given to a few to make all that can be made in the more delicate and difficult parts ; and in these she never failed for an instant. In a word, her acting and that of M. Daragon made memorable a performance which would have otherwise been excellent, but no more.  </p>

    TRIBUNAL DE COMMERCE
    La Liquidation S. Tawil.</head>
    <p>MM. L. Qom, O. Debbaoe et F. Sofio, Hqoi-datears de la maison de commerce 3. Tawil, ont actionné Georges et Wadieh Cordabi en ' paiemoat solidaire de P.T. V S,698 avec les intérêts oonvenos oaloolés à raison de 9i% Van.</p>
    <p>Cette demande est basée sor l’ouvertare d’un crédit fait depnia 1899 par Sélim Tawil à U maison G. Cordabi de Tantab.gérée par Wadie’i Cordabi en vertu d’une lettre en date du lj septembre 1899,rédigéeeri oes termesïSîë'vonâ autorise k faire un crédit de L.E 1,000 k ms maison de Tantàh sous la signature de mon frère Wadieh Cordabi qui signera pour moi."</p>
    <p>Les défendeurs allèguent qu'à la suite d’un désaocord survenu entre eux en 1900 Wadieh Cordahi resta seul intéressé dans la maison de Tantab. Georges Cardabi oppose, en outr-, pour sa défense personnelle qu’avant la saison cotonuière de l’année 1900-1901 il avait signifié à Selim Tawil son intention de clôturer son compte de Tantab et que Tawil loi aurait répondu que le compte se balançait et qu’il entendait à l’avenir continuer à ses propres risques et périls à travaijler aveo Wadieh seul, ce que G. Cardabi demande à établir par on interrogatoire détaillé, déféré à Sulim Tawil;
        d’autre part,Wadieh Cordahi oppose, loi aussi, pour sa défense personnelle qu'en vérifiant les comptes à lui envoyés par Sebm Tawil, il avait relevé une inexactitude au sujet des prix de 16 balles faoturées à P.T. 16(1, tàndis qu'elles auraient été vendues à P.T. 175 à G. Cordahi lui môme et demande, en s'appuyant sur cette passation, la vénfica ion de tous les oompt-.s par la production des livres de Séliiç Tawil.</p>
    <p>Mais les faits allégué) par G. Cordahi,dit le juge, sont inexaota et démentis par les productions au procès, puisqu'on moment de la prétendue déclaration faite par 8. Tawil que les comptes se balançaient, la maison Cordahi de ~Tantah était débitrice de plus de 400 L. U n’est pas vrai nonplus queGeorgesCordahiavaitcessé son oommerœ aveo son frère, puisque celui-ci continuait à signer pour lui par procuration et que le monde commercial n’avait pas été informé que cette procuration eut été enlevée à Wadieh.</p>
    <p>Se basant sur ces motifs, le tribunal a déclaré que la demande de preuve par l’interrogatoire sur faits et artioles de S. Tawil n’est ni pertinente ni admissible.</p>
    <p>"Attendu qu’il est aujourd’hui de jurisprudence constante que le retard d’un - négociant à donner sur tous les oomptes le ^bien fondé” -équivaut à l’acceptation de csa comptei, alors surtout qu’eu l'espèce les demandes en paiement de son débit adressées" par 8- Tawil à Wadieh Cordahi devenaient de plus en plus pressantes.</p>
    <p>"Attendu qu’il y a lieu de eonai .’érer que la vérification des comptes demandée par Wadieh Cardahi constitue de sa part un moyen dilatoire."</p>
    <p>Par ces motifs le tribunal condamne George, et Wadieh Cordahi solidairement à payer à Selim Tawil la somme de P.T. 105.589 avec l’intéiôt à 9 % à partir de la demande en justioe.</p>

                    <head>OUR PARIS LETTER.</head>
                    <p>(From our Correspondent).</p>
                    <p>Paris, December 5.</p>
                    <p>Not so long ago no Parisian journal would have dreamt of publishing a series of articles drawing comparisons between the French and German armies in the eventuality of war between the two nations. But all that has been changed, and this evening General Langlois, while refuting in the "Temps" M de Lanessan's very pessimistic arguments, prefaces his remarks by giving the explanation. The Emperor William's striking war trumpet call has, he points out, very happily revived the instinct of self-preservation-the idea of a terrible war to the knife which it does not seek, but which may be imposed on it-in the mind of the French nation. This is frank language from so high a authority, and it is true. The general has little difficulty in showing that things are not as M. de Lanessan represents them. The infantry along the eastern frontier is not greatly inferior to the German as regards numbers, while the cavalry and artillery are quite as strong, as the corresponding arms across the border. In nearly all the mobilisation operations France is on a par with Germany, and it is a mistake to affirm that the work of concentration would be hampered. "It suffices to throw a glance on our network of railways to perceive at once the flagrant exaggeration of the former Minister of Marine." France's real inferiority chiefly consists in the lowness of her birth rate as compared with prolific German. The German army can always be superior in numbers to the French, which, however, can compensate for this drawback by suppleness. General Langlois will discuss the "fortification crisis" in a subsequent article. </p>
                    <p>Will the Russian internal situation improve? It seems more than doubtful. Much more likely is a long continued Jacquerie. The Russian peasant is slow to move ; but he is harder to stop when once moved. We may expect that the rising will be much more serious than in France in the Fourteenth Century. I put this question to a financier this afternoon : 'Would you, as a sensible man, buy Russian Four per Cents at this moment, considering what their price is?" He replied : "I would not touch them with a long pole." I believe that this view would be endorsed by all responsible men at this moment if their interests were not the other way. No money is coming into the Russian Treasury, because the taxes are not being paid. No money, unless secret sources exist, is available for paying the exterior debt, because no loans are being floated, which, hitherto, has been the method of paying the coupons. An attempt was made recently to fix another few millions on the shoulders of the French public, but they refused to take it. Therefore, the logical outcome of the situation is this-the repudiation of the coupons, or, at least, their non-payment. These are not light words to write. In plain language, it means the ruin of France. It is hardly possible that this country could recover from so stupendous a blow as that involved by a real panic on the Russian market. The figures have touched to their yet lowest point in Russia ; there will be some sort of response here. If the stock were not artificially propped, it would be quoted at thirty to-day. One has only to remember the Spanish Exterior that fell to twenty-five during the war, and to-day is at ninety. It dropped five or six points in a single day.</p>
                    <p>The terrible scenes in Russia have their echo in the Latin Quarter. There is a large number of Russian students in a destitute and deplorable condition. In some cases their parents, upon whom they relied for remittances, have been ruined by the troubles and are no longer in a position to help ; in all cases the breakdown in the postal arrangements has led to embarrassment. There are really some tragic cases of poverty amongst these young men and women. During the recent severe weather, two young  girl students were discovered by a benefactress in an attic without a fire, endeavouring to study out of the same book. In normal times even the lot of many of these students is a very hard one. They are passing rich on eighty francs a month. The student who receives a hundred francs is a plutocrat.</p>
                    <p>Most of these interesting young persons are drawn from the small shop-keeping class in Russia, and they come to France to attend the classes of the Sorboune in an effort to improve their positions in the world. To this end they are prepared to make extraordinary sacrifices of comfort and almost of the bare necessities of life. It goes without saying that the major part of this colony is not on calling terms with its country's Embassy. The student, certainly the Russian student, is by nature a revolutionary, if not "par le fait," at least by sympathy. These hard times, therefore, have brought him no assistance from the representatives of his Government of Paris. A rich Russian general living in the quarter of the Etoile was asked to help, but he replied : "I am a patriot ; the others are not. I decline to assist them." Others, whose conception of patriotism is somewhat different, have not been content to leave a body of young persons wholly devoted to learning in a state of destitution.</p>
                    <p>Now that the prisoners are acquitted by the verdict of the jury of the Assize Court of the Seine, some unpublished facts may be given with regard to the attempt on the life of Alfonso XIII. and M. Loubet. The plot was known to several persons of the official world of Paris a few days before the commission of the outrage. A personage prominently connected with the Opera received a warning from a man whom he had befriended in earlier years. This informant, realising his perilous position in face of the Anarchist society to which he belonged, asked his benefactor to meet him at a certain spot on the Boulevards a few mornings before the day on which the attempt was to be made.</p>
                    <p>"I shall be sitting on a bench," said the communication, "and you will take no particular notice of me." The high official who had received this intimation repaired to the rendezvous indicated. He espied his quondam protégé sitting on a bench. Near by was a kiosque, to which the official went, and bought a newspaper. At that moment the man sidled up, and rapidly conveyed his information. The attempt on the life of the King would be made, he said, in the Opéra itself, during the progress of the gala performance. The man then disappeared. Twenty-four hours afterwards he was found in a bar on the outer Boulevards with two bullets in his body. It was the vengeance of the secret society against whom he has committed an act of treason. The police made no arrest in connection with this deed, knowing the utter impossibility of finding the instrument of Anarchist vendetta.</p>
                    <p>M. Cronier was evidently a man who had a more exquisite sense of art than he had of financial morality, as the sufferers in Egypt by the Sucreries crash should be aware. The "Parisian" event of the week has been the sale of the Cronier art collection at the Galerie George Petit. The crowd of would-be purchasers or the merely curious was so great that all could not enter the auction-room, but many stood in a compact squad along the pavements of the Rue de Sèze. It is to be feared that in their zeal to limit overcrowding, the police have prevented some having a serious intention to buy from entering, in favor of the early bird who is merely attracted by a free spectacle.</p>
                    <p>Never of recent years have pictures of such value belonging to the French and English eighteenth century schools come into the Paris market. Gainsborough is represented by a portrait, presumed to be that of Sir John Campbell ; a study for the famous "Squire Hamlet and his Wife," and "Meditation," a delightful figure of a young girl in a toilette of yellow silk. There is a portrait of "Miss Day," by Sir Thomas Lawrence, and an admirable Sir Joshua in the figure of a man in green uniform. "Lady Stanhope" is a brilliant sketch for a portrait in the Reynolds manner. "The Young Dairymaid" is Romney's portrait of Emma Hart, later Lady Hamilton. "Emily, Duchess of Leinster," is also by Romney, and comes from the Witkins collection. A picture in the French school to make a sensation is Watteau's "Lovers Asleep." It is a little masterpiece in colour and composition. "Le Billet Doux" is a delicious example of the master, a perfect evocation of beauty and youth. Of the later painters there is Fragonard, whose genius and perfect freedom from conventionality stand revealed in "La Liseuse." No very important bibelots were included in this sale, but some of the choicest tapestries of the Goberins and of Beauvais were submitted to public judgement this afternoon. Evidently a man of great taste, M. Cronier.</p>
                    <p>More than six months ago, I was invited with several of my confrères to take part in a trial run on a Gardner-Serpollet auto-omnibus, and I was assured then that before long the auto-omnibus would be a familiar sight in the streets of the capital, but weeks and months went on, and now we are informed that Paris will not see the auto-omnibus running regularly before the month of May. When we remember that Paris is the cradle of the motor car industry, we are surprised to find that London should have so far outstripped her in the popular developments of the automobile, and that long before this city has come to a decision on the subject London has offered the advantages of the motor omnibus to its inhabitants. Cost, we are informed, has played a large part in the delay, and, that being so, I am not surprised that Paris should lag behind, for wherever there is any risk of a financial kind involved it will usually be found that an Englishman will venture his money before a Frenchman. How the Frenchman reasons is shown in an interview with the director of the workshops of the Paris General Omnibus Company, published by a contemporary, "It would never do for us," said the director, "to launch into a speculation of that kind"-the motor omnibus-"until we had made the most complete tests, and had assured ourselves that our profits would not be diminished by the change." One of the reasons given for the delay in adopting the new method of locomotion is the difference in the price of petrol. In London it is sold at 18 francs the 100 litres. In Paris it costs 48fr. 50c., which means that with 300 omnibuses working at the same rates as in London the expenses in Paris for petrol alone would be £100,000 more per annum. The reason of the excessive cost of petrol in this city is that the State claims a duty of 10fr. on every 100 litres, and the municipality exacts another 20fr. on every 100 litres coming into the city. Then there is the item of rubber for the tyres. Rubber is only a fraction higher in this country than in England, but there is much more wood paving in London than in Paris, and the difference in expenditure involved by hundreds of heavy vehicles running over the well kept streets of London and inferiorly paved thoroughfares of Paris would, we are assured, be very considerable.</p>
                    <p>Some morbid persons declare that the "beaux jours" of French cooking are over. One of these, I remember, was the famous chef, Joseph, at the Maison d'Or, alas, now nothing but a café like any other. "People do not dine any more," he said in the bitterness of his soul ; "they just eat." It is sad to reflect how many of the great restaurants have gone the way of all flesh. The disappearance of Tortoni's and the Maison d'Or are but instances of the growing taste for dinners at "prix fixe" instead of the stately repast-and the stately bill-of other times.</p>
                    <p>But there is one place, at least, where they dine well in Paris-though I am not saying that the banner of the "cuisine francaise" is not worthily upheld by the clubs-and that is at the Elysée. Have not the Presidential dinners played a large part in the creation of that pleasant atmosphere of entente with which France is at this moment surrounded? If that is conceded, then M. Loubet's cook is a very important personage. He has promoted the harmony of the nations, whilst raising the culinary art to a high pitch. His name is Tesch. He is a master of the mysteries of roasting ; he excels, likewise, in the preparation of M. Loubet's favorite dish, the seasoned chicken. These young and tender fowls are reared specially for the President's table. One of the glories of M. Tesch's menu is his ragout of woodcock. When M. Witte was the guest, recently, of the President at his country chateau of La Bégude ae Mazenc, he tasted this traditional dish. Nevertheless, human ingratitude is such that even the memory of such a triumph did not prevent him from conspiring against France-or, at least, so it is said-in his interview at <placeName>Potsdam</placeName>.</p>
                    <p>It is not often that the theory of a man's death being as his life receives an illustration so dramatic as has just been given at Ville-en-Blasois, in the Loiret Departnment. There lived in the town a Monsieur Adam, of good fortune and standing, whose one weakness was wine, and he rode his hobby to death. Becoming tired of life, but not of liquor, he resolved that even his end should be an act of devotion to his only attachment. So getting a cask of wine upright, and having the end taken out, he literally dived into nectar, and, as he doubtless hoped, into elysium. Whether he also took one last long draught history will never record. When found, he was dead-literally over head and ears, and shoulders, too-in love.</p>

                        NO ROOM IN BUSINESS FOR THE WEAK.
                        DR. WILLIAMS' PINK PILLS AND WORKERS.</head>
                    <p>No employer can afford to engage a man whose movements are languid, whose eyes are dull, and who visibly lacks energy. The man who is strong, active, full of energy, and pleases at first sight always has the preference. Unfortunately, men of real value to employers are often the victims of overwork, and their breakdown is a serious matter in business and at home. To such men Dr. Wlliams' Pink Pills are valuable above all other medicines, for these pills restore strrength and nervous force, and enable breadwinners to undertake work that was once beyond their physical strength.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Thomas Luce, whose home is at 6 Dennett-Road, Waddon Marsh-lane, Croydon, found himself at the age of 38 in a most serious state of health.</p>
                    <p>"I first complained of pain in my legs," he stated, "and was treated for Rheumatism. In spite of medicine I felt no better and would tremble all over at times. A doctor then stated my disease had developed, and ordered me into hospital, where I learned that my trouble was paralysis. After skillful treatment I was finally brought away from hospital quite helpless, unable to eat but morsels, a shadow of my former self, in constant pain and unable to sleep.</p>
                    <p>"One day, at the request of a friend, I purchased a box of Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People. That one box made a difference in me. I gained courage, and as I continued the pills my health improved and helplessness passed off. Before long I could eat well, became more vigorous, and soon felt entirely cured and ready for work again."</p>
                    <p>Dr. Wlliams' Pink Pills arrest loss of strength in workers ; they fortify the nervous and muscular systems, and give zest for business as well as recreation. They are a perfect blood builder and nerve tonic, and have cured in thousands of cases anemia, indigestion, consumption, early decline, eczema, St. Vitus' dance, rheumatism, sciatics, paralysis, locomotor ataxy, neuralgia, results of overwork, and in ladies the ailments of their sex. Sold by dealers, or direct from Dr. Wlliams' Medicine Co., Holborn-Viaduct, London, post free at 2s. 9d a box, or for six boxes 13s. 9d.</p>
                    <p>Sold in Egypt by all chemists at P.T. 13 per box or P.T. 70 per 6 boxes. Can be bought at the general depot : Max Fischer, Cairo, Hotel du Nil St. (1st floor), and Alexandria, Rue Stamboul, No. 8.</p>

                    <p>(From our Correspondent).</p>
                    <p>London, Dec. 5.</p>
                    <p>The absence of a cavalry regiment from Cairo is apparently a great drawback to that garrison in more ways than one, judging by the lamentations which periodically come therefrom. I am afraid, that in the present rage for economy, there is little hope of a cavalry regiment going to Egypt. If, as is expected, a Liberal Government succeed the present Conservative one, there is every prospect of the necessity of a cavalry regiment, as Liberal administrations have usually been characterised by troubles in the Sudan.</p>
                    <p>Next June Brevet-Colonel S.G. Bird, D.S.O., Royal Dublin Fusiliers, will vacate the command of the 1st Battalion which recently went from Malta to Egypt, under the four-years' rule. In the usual course the command should go to Brevet-Lieutenant Colonel A. W. Gordon, second in command of the 2nd Battalion at Buttevant.</p>
                    <p>Judging from the report to hand, the Rifle Club of the Depot Royal Berkshire Regiment made a fine record in the past year. The team made the good account of 19 wins out of 25 matches. The ranges were 200 and 600 yards, and the average score was 83.35 per match. This was a fine performance when we take into calculation the calibre of some of their opponents-the Royal Horse Guards (Blues), Reading and District Rifle Club, and 1st V. B. Royal Berks staff. The Walton Cup, presented by Captain Walton of the 3rd Battalion, was annexed by Colour Sergeant W. Cox. The latter's score for the 25 matches was 89.61.</p>
                    <p>The Army Council have had under their consideration the present condition of the labour market, and the difficulty which appears to exist in finding employment. With a view to enabling soldiers about to be transferred to the Reserve or discharged to obtain information as to the state of the labour market in the towns where they are contemplating taking up their residence, officers in charge of Records are requested to forward monthly to the several units with which they are connected, whether at home or abroad, a statement of the condition of the labour maket, in the different centres in their area. In addition, information should be given as to the number of ex-soldiers in the district whose names are on the register of employment, what prospects exist as to being able to provide this number with employment, and whether, if any further increase in the number registering is made, there is a reasonable hope that additional employment will be forthcoming.</p>
                    <p>Captain C. F. Thursby, who commissioned the cruiser Encounter the other day, will not take that ship out to the Australian Station, as he has been appointed to the command of the cruiser King Alfred. The Encounter will be taken out by Captain H.V.W. Elliott, who recently commanded the sloop Beagle in the now defunct Atlantic Squadron. Captain Elliott has spent over 33 years in the Royal Navy, attaining his present rank in the June of last year. He served in the expedition against an East African potentate named M'buruk, June, 1895-whilst commanding the gunboat Magpie-and was present at the storming and capture of his stronghold ; was in Sir Harry Rawson's expedition to the Benin, 1897, resulting in the capture of the "City of Blood" (mentioned in despatches, promoted commander, medal with clasp), and during the South African War he landed guns for the defence of that Mossell's Bay, which had been threatened by a Boer force.</p>
                    <p>Early in February the cruiser Berwick will return home from the Mediterranean for recommissioning. The challenge shield which the people of Berwickshire have subscribed for as a gunnery competition trophy will be presented to the cruiser on her return.</p>
                    <p>The first-class cruiser Duke of Edinburgh will be completed for sea in about six weeks time. She is destined for service on the China Station, where the cruisers are to be strength-need by the addition of the latest type.</p>

    <p>A BROKEN-DOWN SYSTEM.</p>
    <p>This is a condition (or disease) to which doctors give many names, but which few
        of them really understand. It it simply weakness—a break-down, as it were, of
        the vital forces that sustain the system. No matter what may be its causes (for
        they are almost numberless), its symptoms are much the same; the more prominent
        being sleeplessness, sense of prostration or weariness, depression of spirits
        and want of energy for all the ordinary affairs of life. Now, what alone is
        absolutely essential in all such cases is increased vitality—vigour--</p>
    <p>VITAL STRENGTH &amp; ENERGY</p>
    <p>to throw off these morbid feelings, and experience proves that as night succeeds
        the day this may be more certainly secured by a course of the celebrated
        life-reviving tonic</p>
    <p>THERAPION No.3</p>
    <p>than by any other known combination. So surely as it is taken in accordance with
        the printed directions accompanying it, will the shattered health be
        restored,</p>
    <p>THE EXPIRING LAMP OF LIFE LIGHTED UP AFRESH,</p>
    <p>and a new existence imparted in place of what had so lately seemed worn-out,
        "used up,” and valueless. This wonderful medicament is purely vegetable and
        innocuous, is agreeable to the taste —suitable for all constitutions and
        conditions, in either sex; and it is difficult to imagine a case of disease or
        derangement, whose main features are those of debility, that will not be
        speedily and permanently benefited by this never-failing recuperative essence,
        which is destined to cast into oblivion everything that had preceded it for this
        wide-spread and numerous class of human ailments.</p>
    <p>THERAPION</p>
    <p>is sold by the principal Chemists throughout the world. Price in England, 2 9
        and 4/6. Purchasers should see that the word 'THERAPION' appears on British
        Government Stamp (in white letters on a red ground) affixed to every package
        by order of His Majesty’s Hon. Commissioners, and without which it is a
        forgery.</p>
