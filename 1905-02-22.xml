                    <head>THE RAILWAY REPORT</head>
                    <p>In yesterday's issue we published a letter from an Alexandrian man of
                        business in which he expressed his surprise that only portions of the repor
                        of the Railway Commission were to be given to the public. We fail to see
                        that there is any grounds for surprise at all. On the contrary, we should
                        have been greatly astonished if the Egyptian Government had dared to set
                        before the public an unexpurgated edition of the work. Official
                        susceptibilities have to be considered, and it is only natural that where
                        they clash with the public interest, the later shuld take second place. The
                        Egyptian Government invited three carefully selected specialists in railway
                        matters to come to Egypt and study the working of the existing railway
                        system. After the expenditure of a large sum of public money these gentlemen
                        obtained a sufficient insight into the administration of the Egyptian State
                        Railways to be in a position to make a careful report on the whole system.
                        It is almost needless to point out that the experts in question, Lord
                        Farrer, Major Le Breton, and Mr. Bury, were absolutely unprejudiced, and
                        their report must necessarily be an elaborate and dispassionate statemen on
                        a matter of supreme importance to the inhabitatns of Egypt. The report
                        should tell us if the working of railways is in safe hands, if the
                        conditions and conveniences are sufficienly good, whether they are
                        understaffed or efficiently staffed, whether employes are adequately paid,
                        and give us a grea deal of other information on many points on which we have
                        good reason to require it. In fact, all prima facie considerations tend to
                        show that it would be in the interest of the country that the fullest
                        publictiy shouldbe accorded to the views and decisions of the members of the
                        Railway Commission. It might also be pleaded that the publication of an
                        unbowdlerised edition of the report would be to the interst of the officails
                        of the Railway Administration, as the withholding of portions of the report
                        from the public at once places them under grave suspicion, whereas it is
                        probably not so unsatisfactory as the action of the Government must lead
                        everyone to infer. It was originally given out that the report would be
                        published. Why, then, after many weeks of delay, should a few copies be
                        printed with the utmost secrecy and the type distributed. The expurgated
                        edition will be received with as much respect as are the official reports of
                        the proceedings at the meetings of the Alexandria Municipality, from which
                        the Press and the public are rigorously excluded. We would not for one
                        moment suggest that the ungarbled report of the Railway Commissioners would
                        reveal such a state of corruption as was exhibited when, three years ago,
                        the light of publicity was for once allowed to penetrate into the inner
                        workings of the Alexandria Municipality. But it is impossible to accept the
                        portions of the report, which are to be given to the public, without strong
                        suspicion as to the reasons for keeping back an unexpurgated ediion, and the
                        only conclusion that we can come to is that the Government has had to
                        suppress the essential part of the report, because it finds itself face to
                        face with a colossal task of reorganization and has no idea where or how to
                        begin. The action of the Government is an indirect but very high compliment,
                        therefore, to the thoroughness with which the commissioners have performed
                        their task, and we must congratulate Lord Farrer, Major Le Breton, and Mr.
                        Bury on having been so outspoken that only portions of their report are to
                        be allowed to reach the public.</p>
