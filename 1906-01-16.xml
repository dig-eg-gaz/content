                    <p>The opponents of compulsory military training in the British Islands base
                        their arguments in the main on the so called evils of lon8oription in
                        Germany and the other States of Western Europe They assert that the system
                        takes op the beat years of a young man’s life, that the association of all
                        elapse in barracks has frequently a demoralizing effect, levelling down
                        instead of levelling up, that the oval element is compelled to play a
                        subsidiary part compared to the role played by the military in the national
                        life, am finally that civil liberty most be endangered by the existence of a
                        large standing army offered by the richer classes and able by reason of its
                        cohesion and discipline to bt the dominant factor in the State should it
                        ever be tempted to throw its weight into the political balance. </p>
                    <p>Assuming that conscription on the German model were introduced into the
                        United Kingdom, would it injure the productivity of the nation ? In Germany
                        the reverse has happened, and General Bronsart von Schellendorf who defended
                        the system at the Hague conference, stated the German Empire owed its
                        industrial success to the coarse of compulsory training which every healthy
                        male had to pass through and which inculcated habits of discipline, order,
                        command, cleanliness, and obedience to the calls of duty in every class from
                        the highest to the lowest No one who has lived in Germany for any length of
                        time can fail to be struck by the physical improvement effected by the two
                        years’ barrack training. The average German who has completed his service
                        with the colors boasts a deep host and a good pair of shoulders. He is, no
                        doubt, less athletic and limber than the young Englishman who has devoted a
                        large portion of his time to sport and games, but the Englishman represents
                        a leiuir- ed class, the German, the manhood of a nation. It is the average
                        that tells is the steuggle for efficiency between nations : can it
                        maintained that oar average man is better disciplined and fitted for
                        concerted effort than the German, more patriotic and enduring than the
                        Japanese ? Does he even equal the average product of these two empires?
                        Again, is it true that barrack-lite contaminates in more than an
                        infinitesimal number of casees? Is it not far more likely to give the
                        various classes that corns under the drill sergeant’s care a greater
                        knowledge of, and sympathy with, one another? In Austria the army is the one
                        unifying influence in an empire composed of a dozen different races. There
                        Parliamentarians quarrel, German and Czech, Magyar and Croat, hot the
                        officers and soldiers oi the many mixed regiment] of the Austro-Hungarian
                        army have long ago learned to live and let live. The young man who goes to
                        the bad after his year or two in barracks would probably have gone to the
                        bid as rapidly had he been freed from the obligation of serving the State,
                        and for one soldier who is ruined by barrack life how many are strengthened
                        and improved ? Because a boy now and again is expelled for misconduct and
                        comes in the end to utter grief, are we to demand the instant abolition of
                        the public school system. Should it be urged that universal military
                        training will end in militarism and the rule of the sabre, the answer is
                        simple enough. The United Kingdom is s free and constitutional country and
                        its forces cannot be used to do the behests of an autocrat or of a class. In
                        France the fact that the leaders of the army were at one time rather
                        inclined to interfere in the political straggles of the nation was due to an
                        unfortunate tradition which does not obtain in England. Napoleon III. was
                        able to debunk a professional long-service army by baying some of its chiefs
                        and regaling the rank and file with champagne after reviews, bat his efforts
                        would have failed to induce any conscript army to turn their arms against
                        the State. In any case the analogy of France, which has experienced a
                        variety of Governments and has only recently settled down to a Republican
                        regime, cannot hold good in the case of a nation that can point to a long
                        tradition of orderly and constitutional progress. Conscription does not
                        obliterate and never will obliterate national characteristics, otherwise one
                        might assume that British soldiers recruited under a compulsory system would
                        treat Hyde Park demonstrators as the Cossacks have recently been treating
                        Russian Liberals. Universal military training is certainly most unlikely to
                        brutalize oar people, and the man in the streets who clamors for war on
                        every possible occasion is not likely to be very vocal when he knows that he
                        may have to pay his debt to the State with his person. Can any of the
                        conscript peoples of Western Europe, by any stretch of the imagination, be
                        termed warlike at the present day?</p>
                    <p>We require numbers and organization to win battles and to insure ourselves
                        not only against defeat bat against an indecisive war. A regular
                        professional army is required for the defense of India and certain of our
                        colonies, and to serve as a nucleus for a great national force in the event
                        of a struggle. The formation of rifle clubs has been suggested as the
                        panacea for one military ills, and publicists who take themselves seriously
                        dream of the creation of commandoes rivalling those of the Transvaal in
                        marksmanship and far exceeding them in numbers who are to repel
                        problematical invaders. We might produce men equal to the Boers, not only in
                        marksmanship, but in endurance, horse mastership, and the faculty for aging
                        every inch of ground to advantage if we are tamed to the conditions that
                        prevailed in the Middle Ages. The Welsh marchers and the Scotch Borderers
                        would make terrible adversaries, if we could resuscitate the conditions that
                        created them, but we cannot, nor would if we could, and to-day it is folly
                        to imagine that farm laborers and bank clerks with a little knowledge of
                        shooting could cause more than the minimum of annoyance to an invader or
                        effect anything if landed on a hostile shore. No ; we require an army, not a
                        mob of men with rifles, and the only way to make our forces adequate to the
                        tasks that may be imposed on them is to train our youth to drill, to shoot,
                        and to march. The details are of little importance beside the main
                        principle. We may fellow the German system, we may fellow the Swiss, but we
                        must create an organization that will render otter forces capable of
                        indefinite expansion in case of war. Otherwise we cannot intervene
                        effectively on behalf of our allies’ or of our own interests on the
                        continents of Europe or Asia, and must sooner or later give place to
                        worthier competitors for the first place under the sun. To rely on our
                        allies for the defense of India, France to guard us against continental
                        dangers, is as undignified as it is businesslike We must first sharpen our
                        own swords. The strong can always find an ally.</p>

                    <p>The fact that the Government is making a clean sweep, thus ensuring for them
                        an overwhelming majority at the polls, is not only leaving them independent
                        of the I-ish vote but also subject the support of large numbers of the
                        supporters of the former Government. The general opinion as to the upshot of
                        the elections is satisfactory, for the new Government will receive no
                        special mandate from the people unless it be a negative one and dictated by
                        a desire for economy.</p>

                    <p>On Sunday evening, between 5 and 6 p.m., the Syrian colony of Cairo offered a
                        tea in the salons of the Continental Hotel in honour of their distinguished
                        countryman Mr. Chekri Ghanem, the author of Antar. Most of the prominent»t
                        Syrian notables and many of their native and foreign friends availed
                        themselves of this opportunity to show their appreciation of Mr. Chekri
                        Ghanem’s work, which obtained such a well deserved success this seasonn at

                        were on this occasion in the minority, but made up by their beauty and

                    <p>It would take us too long to reproduce the speeches of the many brilliant
                        speakers; most of them used the French language with such extraordinary
                        fluency, that before long we ceased to be astonished at the fact of a work
                        like Antar having been written by an Oriental : well may they call French
                        "notre seconde langue maternelle.” We wish to quote one phrase only of the
                        opening speech pronounced by the president of the committee, J. Chakour
                        Pacha, expressing a true spirit of fraternity between the different races
                        who own Egypt as their country. His Excellency said: “Not only has Antar
                        aroused the enthusiasm of its admirers by its beautiful “verses, but, more
                        than that, the poet’s generous inspirations, his profound sympathy "with the
                        destiny of the Arabian nations, "and his warm appreciation of the chivalrous
                        "qualities of his Arab brethren have moved "the hearts of all true
                        Egyptians.”</p>
                    <p>The load and prolonged applause which greeted those words showed that the
                        president had echoed the feelings of the meeting, feelings which we cannot
                        but approve and encourage.</p>

                    <head>THE EGYPTIAN QUESTION.</head>
                    <p>A very noticeable feature of the native Press of late has been the
                        extraordinary prominence given to the Egyptian Question, which for some time
                        past has been allowed to slumber. The vernacular Moslem newspapers appear to
                        have suddenly revived the question with a new and zealous enthusiasm. The
                        Anglo-French Agreement had considerably damped the ardor of the opponents of
                        the British Occupation, and this sudden revival of the question may possibly
                        be due to two causes, viz., the recent moral victory of the Sultan over the
                        Powers on the Macedonian Question, and the ad- ent of a new Liberal
                        Government in England. It is also noticeable what a large share of attention
                        the recently published book, entitled "The Emancipation of Egypt,” has
                        obtained in the Native Press. This interesting work, which was reviewed at
                        length in our columns, has been translated into French. In a recent issue of
                        “Al Zabar” that paper remarks that in consequence of the publicity it has
                        given to this book, it has received many enquiries from its readers as to
                        where it is to be obtained. It is stated that the book has attracted
                        considerable attention on the continent and the German supposition is, on
                        prima facie evidence, that it was written by one of the principal European
                        diplomats.</p>

                    <head>CONFLICT WITH MINISTRY.</head>
                    <head>WORK AT MEHKEMEH SUSPENDED.</head>
                    <p>A serious difference has recently arisen between the Ministry of Justice and
                        the Mehkemeh Sharieh, in regard to the alterations which have been
                        introduced by the former in the Mehkemeh daring Sheikh Yehia’s absence. The
                        Grand Cadi more particularly objects to the transfer of his private
                        secretary, Mohamed Eff. El Abassiri, to the Mehkemeh Conrt of Tantah.</p>
                    <p>Sheikh Yelia considers that he alone should have power to deal with his
                        secretary, while the Ministry, on the other hand, considers that he comes
                        within the scope of affairs of Administration. The Grand Cadi has asked that
                        his private secretary be reinstated in hiw service, and the Ministry has
                        replied that he may select some other secretary from among either the
                        Ministry or the Mehkemeh employes; but the Grand Cadi refuses to do so.</p>
                    <p>Sheikh Yehia also says that Sheikh Mohamed Bekhit should return to the
                        membership of the Mehkemeh as he does not approve of the appointment of one
                        of the present members. Consequently, the Grand Cadi has ordered the admit
                        L'retivo work of the Mehkemeh to be suspended for the time being, and did
                        not him' elf attend the Mehkemeh yesterday.</p>

                    <head>FINANCIAL ADVISER'S REPORT.</head>
                    <p>Dr. J. K. Gabril (Fayoum) writes :—Those gentlemen who contradict the
                        Financial Adviser’s statements seem to me to know very little ahout the
                        country, especially as regards the lands and the fellah, I am living amongst
                        the fellaheen and have practical knowledge of the peasantry and their life
                        and lands. I agree with the Financial Adviser that the present price of land
                        is not permanent. In 1900 you could have bought one feddan here for £5, now
                        yon cannot have it for £40, so rapidly has the value gone up, and it must
                        come down with equal rapidity and so all the shares of the banks, which
                        depend on the fellah, will fall as well. It is true the Egyptian peasant
                        does not know of anything else to do and has no other desire but to buy and
                        own land, but unfortunately very few fellaheen know how to save money. When
                        he has any surplus cash he either takes onto himself a new wife or goes for
                        a trip to Mecca. So those people who speculate with lands and hope to sell
                        it in the future for a high price to the fellah are, I believe, making a
                        miscalculation.</p>

                    <head>THE PRICE OF MEAT.</head>
                    <head>WHY IS IT SO DEAR?</head>
                    <head>COLD STORAGE TO THE RESCUE.</head>
                    <p>It is very strange that Alexandria and Ramleh have not yet received any
                        attention from any cold storage concern. This city and its suburbs would
                        afford a far more profitable locality than Cairo, which after all, is only a
                        winter resort, while Alexandria and its suburbs are fall all the year round
                        and are in fact becoming more and more the summer resort for Cairenes and
                        provincials, who do not go to Europe in the hot season.</p>
                    <p>The need for cold storage here is especially obvious at the present time
                        owing to the proceedings of the Meat Trust, which now absolutely controls
                        the price of meat here. The price of prime beef at the Alexandria
                        slaughterhouse is P.T. 6 per oke. The medium quality of meat is sold there
                        at P.T. 5 per oke. But in town the minimum price for first class meat is
                        from P T. 9 to P.T. 10 per oke, minimum price, while the medium quality is
                        disposed of at an identical rate. The third quality of meat is sold at from
                        P.T. 3 to P.T. 4 per oke at the slaughterhouse, and is retailed in town at
                        from P.T. 5 to P.T. 8 the oke. The botchers are making immense profits and
                        have formed a kind of trust to keep np the price.</p>
                    <p>As we recently pointed out, the price of meat ought to have considerably
                        decreased here as the Quarantine Board does not allow any catt;e arriving
                        here from Asia Minor and Syria to he sent inland and to Cairo. All the
                        cattle are killed here and a great reduction in price should have ensued,
                        but the butchers have seen their opportunity mid have combined to keep up
                        the rates for retailing.</p>
                    <p>In regard to the above remarks, we understand the state of things at Cairo is
                        very little better than that now prevailing at Alexandria. The butchers in
                        the Capital form a very dose ring and do their best to keep up prices and
                        boycott frozen meat The only source from which this commodity is procurable
                        is from the Nile Cold Storage Company, the only other similar concern having
                        still refrained from embarking in retail enterprise. The Army of Occupation
                        at Alexandria has indeed for the last fortnight been supplied with frozen
                        meat and the results have been so far quite satisfactory. Bat it remains to
                        be seen whether this first step will lead to the permanent establishment in
                        Alexandria of a cold storage depot, where meat can be obtained at fair
                        prices. Of course it must be remembered that frozen can never be imported
                        here at as low a rate as Syrian meat, but even taking that into
                        consideration cold storage meat could he retailed at a much lower rate than
                        the inferior stuff retailed here from Syria.</p>

                    <p>On Saturday night we had Fedora again. Signora Bellincioni was good, the rest
                        fair, and the orchestra highly satisfactory. Sig. Polese confirmed the
                        favourable opinion expressed after Thursday’s performance, but taking it all
                        in all we cannot quite understand why Fedora was given first and indeed why
                        it is given at all. It is not a bad opera, and a company with a large
                        repertoire playing for four or five months together might be excused for
                        giving it, but the Cairo opera season is so short and the repertoire of the
                        opera company so restricted that the public has a right to ask for the best
                        operas and nothing bat the best.</p>

                        favorably received. He looked forward to its inauguration at no distant
                        date. On his onward trip his fellow-passengers all signed a petition in
                        favour of penny postage, and it was presented at Egypt, which, he was glad
                        to say, had now adopted penny postage. Two other countries had agreed to
                        accept, but for the present he would not mention their names until he had
                        brought the matter before the Postmaster- General and the necessary
                        arrangements had been completed.</p>

                        likely to do all that he can to bring it about. Mr. Wanamaker is a very
                        close friend of President Roosevelt, and with such influence at work I am
                        very hopeful that penny postage will before very long be adopte by America.
                        At the next Postal Union Congress, in Rome, a resolution in favour of it
                        will be moved by Sir J. G. Ward, Postmaster General of New Zealand.”</p>

                        <p>REMARKABLE INCREASE OF VOTES.</p>
                        <p>London, January 15. The Conservative papers do not seek to minimize the
                            significance of the pollings. Liberals are enthusiastic, especially in
                            view of the fact that only two supporters of Mr. Chamberlain have been
                            returned. The analysis of voting shows a remarkable increase of
                            Socialist and Labour votes, namely 63,692, compared with 20,731 in the
                            same constituencies in 1900. (Reutor)</p>
                        <p>London, January 15. The “Times’’ and “Standard” consider the success of
                            the Labour candidates as most significant, the latter remarking that
                            Liberalism is annihilated, lying absorbed by labour. Hitherto there have
                            been returned 76 Liberals, 13 Labourites, and 29 Unionists. Ministerial
                            gains 49. The Unionists gained a seat at Hastings. Speaking at
                            Waterford, Mr. Redmond said he would take care that the Government’s
                            sympathy for Ireland was translated into action. (Reuter)</p>

                        <p>London, January 15. The “Times” states that a new Irish organisation has
                            sprung up. This organisation is uncompromisingly opposed to Mr.
                            Redmond’s parliamentary policy. It proclaims a boycott on British
                            imports, the prohibition to enlist in the army and navy, and the
                            discouragement of the English language. (Reuter)</p>

                    <p>(FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT.)</p>
                    <p>LONDON, JANUARY 5.</p>
                    <p>Major C. R Heastey, who has just retired on retired pay from the 2nd
                        Battalion Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, Cairo, served over nineteen years in
                        the regiment, having got his first commission in November, 1886. He was
                        promoted captain in 1896, and major in 1914. He served with the 2nd
                        Battalion in the North West Frontier campaign, 1897-98 (medal with clasp).
                        The vacant majority has been filled by the promotion of Captain E. J.
                        Buckley, who is specially employed on the General Staff at th9 War Office.
                        Major Buckley has served in the Inniskillings for over eighteen years, got
                        his company in 1897, and was with the 1st Battalion in the South African
                        War, including the battle of Colenso, where he was severely wounded
                        (mentioned in despatches, medal with two clasps). When the late Queen
                        Victoria last visited Ireland in April, 1900, Major Book- ley commanded the
                        special guard of honour furnished by the details of the Inniskillings at
                        Dublin.</p>
                    <p>Major L. F. Philips, King’s Royal Rifle Corps, on restoration to the
                        establishment, has been posted to the 3rd Battalion at Ranikhet, Bengal, and
                        embarks on the 3rd prox. in charge of a draft for the 1st Battalion West
                        Yorkshire Regiment at Meen Meear, Punjab.</p>
                    <p>Captain W. F. G. Wyndham, 4th Battalion King’s Royal Rifle Corps, serving
                        with the Rifle Depot, Winchester, has been selected to accompany Prince
                        Arthur of Connaught on his mission to Tokyo to invest the Mikado with his
                        new distinction.</p>
                    <p>Lieutenant R. G. B. Jeffreys, Royal Dublin Fusiliers, the new adjutant of the
                        1st Battalion in Egypt, is the senior subaltern of the gallant “Debs,” which
                        he joined in the February of 1899, a few months before Paul Kruger commenced
                        to “stagger humanity.” Mr. Jeffreys was with the 1st Battalion in the hard
                        fighting into Ladysmith and the campaign afterward' in the Transvaal and
                        Orange River Colony.</p>
                    <p>Lieutenant David Mathers, 1st Battalion Royal Scots, is about to be specially
                        promoted captain into the Royal Inniskillings Fusiliers. Lieutenant Mathers
                        has had a fine military career. He enlisted in the Gordon Highlanders, and
                        as a non-commissioned officer served in the Chitral Relief Expedition (medal
                        with clasp); Tochi Expedition, 1897-98; Tirah Expedition (mentioned in
                        despatches, Distinguished Conduct Medal, clasp); South African War,
                        including the advance on Kimberley. actions of Magersfontein, Poplar Grove,
                        Driefontein, Hontnek, Vet River, Zand River, Johannesburg, Pretoria,
                        Belfast, Lydenburg and many minor affairs (medal with five clasps). He
                        received his commission from sergeant in the Gordons in July, 1901, and
                        shortly afterwards joined the West African Frontier Force, and whilst
                        attached to the Southern Nigeria Regiment served in the Aro Expedition, and
                        the Kano-Sokoto Expedition, 1902 (medal with clasp).</p>
                    <p>The King has been pleased to approve of the following members composing the
                        Army Council, on change of administration : Rt. Hon. R. B. Haldane,
                        Secretary of State for War; Lieutenant General Sir N. G. Lyttleton, K.C.B.,
                        Chief of the General Staff (First Military Member) ; Lie tenant General C.
                        W. H. Douglas, O.B., Adjutant General to the Forces (Second Military
                        Member); Lieutenant General Sir William Nicholson, K.C.B Quarter-master
                        General to the Forces (Third Military Member); Major General Sir J. W.
                        Murray, K.C.B., Master General of Ordnance (Fourth Military Member) ; Earl
                        of Portsmouth, Parliamentary Under Secretary for War, and Mr. T. R. Buchanan
                        (Financial Member).</p>
                    <p>It is hardly necessary to say that the arrest of several non-commissioned
                        officers in connection with the South African War scandals has caused a
                        considerable sensation. At the same time nobody takes in that the non-coms
                        ware all to blame for the bribery alleged to have gone on during the war.
                        Anyone who knows anything about military matters is aware that the
                        non-commissioned officers’ chances of peculation are on a very small scale,
                        and that they are not likely to be in a position to perpetrate a big “job.”
                        There is a shrewd opinion expressed that bigger wigs than staff sergeants
                        will be involved in the mess.</p>
                    <p>The report of the Royal Commission now investigating the losses incurred over
                        stores in South Africa will show the necessity for a fully equipped supply
                        branch to deal with every form of army requirement. In the Transvaal war
                        supply and store duties often fell to the lot of inexperienced officers,
                        soldiers, and civilians Owing to the lack of an adequate expert staff to do
                        the work, some millions sterling were wasted by this want of system. The
                        entire question of supplies and stores in the field will be overhauled when
                        the Commission’s report is made.</p>
                    <p>In all probability an expert supply officer will be given charge of supplies
                        at the War Office, with general’s rank. Under the present system it is
                        proved that there is too much divided responsibility and much overlapping,
                        wastage, and faulty administration. The expert handlers of stores are too
                        few for war purposes to secure economy and efficiency, and much of the work
                        is indifferently performed, casually superintended, and sometimes not
                        overlooked at all.</p>
                    <p>There are, it is shown, too many depots and branches for supplies in the
                        field. A corps draws its bread at one place, picketting pegs at another, and
                        transport somewhere else; while the water supply is arranged as a thing
                        apart. Fuel and light are supplied by the Army Service Corps and electricity
                        by the Royal Engineers. Searchlighting is an Engineer service, uat
                        mechanical transport is not. All this leads to complication. Presently the
                        question of heavy gun haulage will arise, and the Royal Artillery will claim
                        first right to control this traction.</p>
                    <p>A consolidation of all the avenues of supply is held to be necessary, with a
                        general depot from which everything would be issued, and with a staff,
                        including buyers, able to control supplies in every part of the field and
                        oat of it, after the manner of successful trading stores.</p>
                    <p>It is proposed to transform the various companies of the Royal Engineers into
                        a series of battalions, complete with every requisite for an army, after the
                        manner of the Japanese. At present all the services for an army are
                        scattered about in separate companies. The Engineer battalions will form a
                        comprehensive organization, covering bridging, telephones, telegraphs,
                        ballooning, and electric lighting, each carried out by trained units of the
                        Corps. These battalions will not form part of the mobilized forces for home
                        defense, but will be prepared essentially for war, and ready to embark with
                        any expeditionary force.</p>
                    <p>The Army Council has just made a decision which will be learned of with joy
                        by many a junior sergeant of the Royal Garrison Artillery at home and
                        abroad, and that is, that all noncommissioned officers of the RG.A., who
                        have been permitted to extend their service beyond 21 years, and who hiving
                        reached the age of forty, and completed 25 years’ service, will go on
                        pension tour months from the 1st January. Owing to the number of N.C.O.’s
                        who were allowed to extend their service many sergeants have had to go to
                        foreign service within two years of their previous tour abroad, and the
                        reduction of several companies further blocked promotion. This new ruling
                        will dear out the senior sergeants and cause a healthy run of promotion
                        amongst the lower ranks. The rule applies to non-coms, on the staff of the
                        Militia and Volunteer forces The four months’ notice is a concession from
                        the usual one in month. A very large number of staff sergeants will be hit
                        by it.</p>
                    <p>The 6th of February has been provisionally fixed for the launching of the
                        huge battleship Dreadnought at Portsmouth. This monster, which will have a
                        displacement of 18,000 tons, will be the largest battleship afloat when
                        completed. She has been got ready for launching in exactly four months,
                        which in itself is a record. One of the many improvements in the battleship,
                        making for the comfort of her handymen, is a well equipped bakery. This
                        improvement is also to be carried out in other ships so that the days of
                        “hard tack,” as well as those of “salt horse,” are numbered.</p>

                        <p>THE COPE WHITEHOUSE CLAIM.</p>
                        <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette. Sir,—In your ia.sae of 20th
                            December last you published a letter from Mr. Cope White house in which
                            the following statement appeared : — “I had spent many days with Sir
                            Hanbury Brown, and given him my pamphlets and maps, before I learned,
                            through the inadvertent admission of his brother, that he intended to
                            write a book, which I regarded as premature.’ Mr. Cope Whitehouse knew
                            from me of my intention to write when the idea first came to me, and I
                            asked him to lend me what documents he had, for the purpose of working
                            up the subject-. The paragraph quoted above is manifestly intended to
                            convey the impression that my intention was deliberately concealed from
                            him. To support my denial of this statement, I quote from letters of his
                            in my possession. Extract from letter dated 29th May, 1893 : "When I
                            gave you leave to make use of my researches and of my plates for your
                            book it was on the implied understanding that the volume would deal
                            fairly by me.” Extract from letter dated 28 .h Nov. 1892 : ‘ Your
                            comments were perfectly fair and I so considered them.” Extract from
                            letter dated 13th Dec. 1832 : “Further, your conclusions are your own,
                            made so by your independent examination of the evidence.” The difference
                            in tone between the earlier and later letters was due to Mr.
                            Whitehouse’s resentment with some of the reviews of the book which were
                            not as complimentary to him as he would have liked, notably the review
                            in the “Times” asserting that I had “enlivened” my volume with “a
                            post-mortem examination of the Cope Whitehouse theory” ; for which he
                            seemed to hold me in some way responsible. Hanbury Brown. Newlands,
                            Crawley Down, England, 5th January, 1906.</p>

                    <p>SOME MORE EXTRACTS.</p>
                    <p>Mr. A. B. de Gaerville, who, by the way, arrived at Alexandria yesterday by
                        the North German Lloyd steamer, went into every section of society in Egypt
                        and naturally came into contact with some of the members of the Khedivial
                        Family, and some very interesting interviews are given. Prince Mohamed Aly
                        Pacha was among the Princes whom our author met, and his Highness expressed
                        himself in the following outspoken fashion on the way Anglo Egyptians
                        neglect the adage that “Manners makyeth the Man.” ‘ Prince," I said, “you do
                        not seem to be particularly fond of the English ?” “Well.” he replied, ‘ I
                        can like them in their own homes, but not here. When I was in England I met
                        many charming people, who treated me with perfect courtesy. It made me ask
                        myself continually, can these people, with such charming manners and so well
                        bred, be the same brutes as we have in Egypt ? Why are they so perfect at
                        home and so ill mannered with us ? And, take my word for it, they are making
                        a great mistake. It is because of their bad manners that they are not liked.
                        A little, more consideration and politeness towards us Egyptians would gain
                        for them many friendships and much devotion, but what we cannot stand is
                        their boorishness, their lack of talk, and their coarseness. We believe that
                        these remarks of the Prince are not altogether beside the point. The
                        Egyptian ''standpoint to the English often resembles that of the young
                        Harrovian towards the late Dr. Temple,: “He is a beast, but a just
                        beast.”</p>
                    <p>Princess Nazil's Opinions.</p>
                    <p>In a talk with Princess Nazli Hanem our author asks.” “Then, Princess, it is
                        clear that the Eygptians are not yet fit to govern themselves ?” To which
                        her Highness-replied: “Govern ourselves But, my dear sir, we are children
                        still, babes in bible unable to stand, no, we cannot be left alone. Here
                        Cromer does everything. Without him we should have to return to the
                        guardianship of the Powers. Cromer is a great man, and Egypt owes him
                        everything but in the last two years he has become too lenient, too kind. I
                        should like to see him smother all these speculators to-day who are the
                        plague of Egypt. In all the capitals of Europe there is a huge building on
                        which is written Stock Exchange. Here the whole country is one vast Stock
                        Exchange, which saps its civilization at the roots.”</p>
                    <p>Female Tourists' Ugliness.</p>
                    <p>Of the ugliness of the female tourist on the Nile steamers our author says :—
                        Alas! there is nothing on board to admire, and we have come to the
                        conclusion that nine-tenths of the ladies who travel are ugly. It is really
                        remarkable the number of plain-looking women in the world. 1 know that all
                        men are not beautiful, but who minds that?</p>
                    <p>The Need of a Maid.</p>
                    <p>On his trip up the Nile he consoles himself in listening to the lamentations
                        of a lady on board who is complaining of the want of a maid. "And it is
                        terrible for me,” she said, “because all my dresses button, hook or lace
                        down the back. I can’t do it myself so of course I’ve got to call the Arab,
                        and his cold clammy finger wanders continually all over my back, and gives
                        me the most horrible feelings!” Poor lady, I know these Arabs by reputation
                        and I can understand.</p>
                    <p>A Word of Warning.</p>
                    <p>The author indulges in some reflections on the unwise familiarity which often
                        ensues in the tourist season between tourists and natives, suggested by this
                        scene at Abou Simbel :— In the evening the crew don large overcoats with
                        hoods, giving them the appearance of monks Naturally they are Arabs, and we
                        have on board certain elderly females.... and yet, when I think of it not so
                        very elderly, who conduct themselves with them in a very extraordinary
                        fashion. Yesterday evening two of them, each with an Arab for company, left
                        the boat, and in the moonlight set off to explore.. the unknown. From the
                        deck we watched them disappear. If the white women who conduct themselves
                        thus with the Arabs would think for a moment of the harm which they are
                        doing to the work of civilization throughout Egypt they might perhaps
                        hesitate They do not seem to realize that the native, convinced that all
                        foreign women are in the same manner as these fools, despises them
                        profoundly, saying to himself, “If that is the result of a Christian
                        education, of their Western civilization, of the emancipation of women—no
                        thanks! better be as we are. and keep our women safely shut up in the
                        harem.”</p>
                    <p>A Flippant Passage</p>
                    <p>Sometimes Mr de Guerville is rather too flippant, as the following passage
                        shows: “I am certain that that is just as it was in the time of oar Savior.”
                        This exclamation, uttered a few paces off, came from an elderly American
                        lady, very bigoted, who since we started, had been diligently study Egypt as
                        described in the Bible. Suddenly her eyes fell, on my pajamas, when she gave
                        me one look, shocked and angry, which I am sure our Lord would not have
                        approved of, but which, making me realize the somewhat scanty nature of my
                        attire, drove me to seek the friendly shelter of my cabin. “An hour later wo
                        passed a large dehabieh, stranded on a sandbank. The whole of the crew,
                        completely naked, were directing all their efforts to refloat her, whilst my
                        American friend put on her glasses to get a better view. The doctor of the
                        Rameses turned to me laughing and said, “My dear fellow, your sin this
                        morning was appearing in pyjamas ; if you had had nothing on, she would
                        probably have honored you with a second look through her glasses.</p>
                    <p>On Chemists.</p>
                    <p>He is hard on chemists :— Among the shopkeepers, the palm undoubtedly must go
                        to the chemists. Their name is legion, and they grow fat in robbing a
                        patient public with a most charming grace. Their cynicism surpasses belief,
                        and their business in life may be summed up as stealing always and poisoning
                        often. This criticism is rather severe and we are glad to be able to state
                        that there are exceptions.</p>
                    <p>A Notable Criticism.</p>
                    <p>One of the most valuable portions of "New Egypt” are the two notes by the
                        late Grand Mufti of Egypt, Sheikh Mohamed Abdou, on public instruction and
                        administration and justice. These notes are the deliberate statements of one
                        of the most respected of modern Egyptian", ‘whose death was regretted by all
                        classes We publish the second of the Grand Mufti’s notes, on administration
                        and justice. It contains a good deal of sound criticism, as every
                        Anglo-Egyptian official will acknowledge: ‘Tin Egyptian Administration has
                        no Deed of great reforms in its organization. Nevertheless it leaves much to
                        be desired. Its principal fault lies in the unsatisfactory choice of its
                        officials. As a rule one thing alone is exacted in a candidate, and that is
                        that he should possess a nature entirety passive. A man in the smaller
                        degree independent will not be admitted, or if by mistake he should be, he
                        will not remain long. Why is it so ? Simply because the English mistrust too
                        much, and without reason, men of independent thought. They find officials
                        ready to do all that is asked of them, and even more if by doing so they can
                        gain favour with their superiors, and they seem to be satisfied with this
                        condition of things. Unfortunately, the result is that those in charge of
                        our affairs are seldom well informed of the men and affairs of the
                        Administration. The Egyptian officials dare not tell them the truth, they
                        take no initiative, approve all that is wanted, and never oppose any
                        measure. One example from a thousand : An Egyptian Moudir in a province is
                        assisted- by an English inspector. Normally the Moudir should administer,
                        and the inspector contra his work. Bat it is not so. The Moudir takes no
                        responsibility, he submits everything, however insignificant, to the
                        Inspector and awaits his orders, which he is ready to carry out. The more he
                        effaces himself, the more he does, so he believes, to please his inspector.
                        If the latter should commit an error, he will allow it to pass rather than
                        offer an observation which might be badly received. And so it is all over.
                        It is notorious that the English will not put up with an Egyptian official
                        unless he is willing to play the part of dummy. 'The country is in this way
                        deprived of the services of those of its children who have an opinion on her
                        reel needs, and who have the courage to express that opinion. In the
                        Department of Justice the same fault exists, with the aggravating
                        circumstance that with an Egyptian Judge of a passive disposition easily
                        influenced by his English colleague, the danger may arise that he will not
                        give an opinion according to his conscience. This danger is very great, and
                        the evil a very serious one. “Another danger is the ease with which the law
                        of the country is made. Each Englishman constitutes himself a legislator,
                        and attempts to modify the law as it suits him. He submits his work to the
                        ministerial council, which, as every one knows, is an assembly of mutes, who
                        sign whatever is put before them. The only control exercised is by the
                        Legislative Council. But this assembly has only a consultative power, and
                        the members of it who are up to their work are very few. “What is required
                        is a kind of State Council, before which would come all proposals in regard
                        to the law. There they would receive serious consideration. The good would
                        pass, the bad would be rejected.” The extracts we have made will give the
                        reader s some idea of this entertaining book and we hope that M. de
                        Guerville will take the opportunity of his present visit to Egypt to find
                        materials for another work on modem Egypt for there is still plenty of
                        subject matter for his sprightly pen.</p>

                    <head>THE OPENING UP OF THE HOLY LAND.</head>
                    <p>The interior of Palestine and Syria, which until recently could only be
                        visited under great difficulties and with serious sacrifice of time and
                        money, has at last, thanks to the efforts of the Hamburg American Line, been
                        made accessible to the travelling public. A considerable improvement in the
                        means of transport in Palestine and Syria has been noticeable since the trip
                        of the German Emperor to Jerusalem in 1898, and the continued interest he
                        still shows in their advance has induced the Turkish .authorities to remove
                        some of the more objectionable inconveniences and to urge forward the
                        construction' of the railways that had been so long projected. The great
                        Mecca Railway, stretching from Damascus to the edge of the Arabian desert,
                        became a real fact; and a connecting length starting at Haifa, crossing over
                        Galilee and along the southern end of the Lake of Gennesaret, links together
                        the fruitful district of the Hauran with the coast. In Syria, the Aleppo
                        Railway forms a connection between Baalbek and the line running from Beyrout
                        to Damascus; in addition to this, many of the roads that were in a terrible
                        condition or practically nonexistent have been thrown a little into shape. A
                        few months ago an overland tour into the interior of Palestine, such as from
                        Jerusalem via Nazareth and Tiberias to Damascus, was one of great
                        difficulty, danger and expense. To carry out a trip of this nature
                        necessitated fitting up an expedition, the equipment and execution of which
                        hid to be entirely in the hands of a dragoman, who, by imposing upon the
                        tourists, robbed the journey to the Holy Land of all its pleasure. Bat the
                        worst of all was that, apart from the houses of the inhabitants, which, in
                        reality, teem with vermin, not a house was to be found on the whole three
                        days journey from Jerusalem to Nazareth and travelers were forced to bring
                        with them, not only cooking apparatus and provisions, but also tents, the
                        inconveniences of which were, on the whole, decidedly unpleasant. But oh!
                        how beautiful is just this part of Palestine. What delightful scene, what
                        effectual pictures, and what precious remembrances the journey via Bethel
                        and Jacob’s Well to Nabulus and then through Samaria, the bountiful fields
                        of the Plain of Jezreel, and Nazareth has in store for us. How many tourists
                        to the Holy Land have been deeply aggrieved, however, that their health or
                        their purse strings have compelled them to abandon a visit to this
                        little-known but highly charming and historical district, and forced them to
                        make their pilgrimage along the over-ran routes to Jerusalem, Jericho,
                        Damascus or Baalbek! My first visit to Palestine included only these latter.
                        How great was my surprise how j ever when, on my second trip, in which I
                        took in Galilee, I was able to compare the fertile j fields of the Plain of
                        Esdraelon with its delight- holm-oak forests; the incomparable harmonious
                        scenery of the Lake of Gennesaret with the barren, mountainous deserts of
                        Judea. Whoever wishes to get a deep and lasting impression of the Holy Land
                        must not confine himself to the visit of such places as the ordinary tourist
                        flocks to in thousands, bat rather plunge into the little known interior.
                        Now that this has been made so easy, every friend of Palestine will
                        certainly feel inwardly thankful to those men who, through unwearied
                        efforts, have succeeded in removing the difficulties and opened up the
                        interior of the land. As mentioned above, the chief impediment to a tour
                        from Jerusalem to Nazareth lay in the complete lack of accommodation. In
                        order to remedy this, the tourist office of the Hamburg American Line has
                        erected hotels at Nabulus and Jenin fitted up in the most modern improved
                        manner and conducted by German managers, hotels where 30 to 40 persons can
                        find sure and comfortable accommodation at moderate charges. The German
                        hotels in Nazareth and Tiberias have, on the advice and with the help of the
                        Line, been modernized and enlarged ; now, whoever desires to make the
                        overland tour need only call at any office of the Tourist Department of the
                        Line, and without any preparations whatever, he or she will be conducted in
                        the cheapest and most comfortable manner. The journey from Jerusalem to
                        Damascus can be made in six days, and this too without the trouble of
                        looking after dragomans, servants and tents, without danger of life or
                        health and above all, for the comparatively small charge of £2.10.0 per day,
                        which is reduced by about one half where several persons club together. On
                        the longest journeys little riding is necessary, the greater part being
                        covered by carriage. On the Lake of Gennesaret the Hamburg American Line has
                        its own little steamer, and from Semak on the southern end of the Lake, the
                        Railway will be used for the journey to Damascus. Not alone here, but in the
                        country east of Jordan, and even down in stony Arabia, a visit to which
                        formerly was coupled with stupendous trials and difficulties, the Hamburg
                        American Line has extended its ramifications and these lands can, under
                        their auspice", be visited without any exertion and with moderate outlay.
                        The magnificent ruins at Jerash, Amman and Petra, ruins of which only rare
                        accounts were brought to light by hardy travelers are now within the reach
                        of every tourist.</p>

                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe. This
                        depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in January
                        may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so warm as Sicily,
                        but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm than many
                        other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt fur too early in the year,
                        for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest place to
                        go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily. Some will want to take into consideration
                        the number of days to be spent at sea, and we therefore subjoin a list
                        showing the time occupied on each of the various routes between Egypt and
                        the Continent of Europe.</p>
                    <p>They are as follows The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to
                        Plymouth, Southampton, London or Liverpool—occupy about 14 days. The short
                        ones ore us follows;— Port Said or Alexandria to Brindisi 3 days Alexandria
                        to Messina 3 „ Port Said or Alexandria to Marseilles 5 „ Alexandria to
                        Venice and Trieste... 4 „ Alexandria to Naples 3 „ Port Said to Genoa 5 „
                        Port Said to Naples 4 „ Alexandria to Constantinople ... 4 „ Alexandria to
                        l’ineus 2 „ Port Said to Gibraltar 7 „</p>
                    <p>The steamers, of the P. and 0. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageries
                        Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines are
                        also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by travellers to
                        Egypt. As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to
                        Alexandria, without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made
                        without change in 4 1/2 hours. The least expensive way to England is by the
                        Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to
                        Liverpool. The German Levant line has also good steamers from Alexandria to
                        Hamburg.</p>

                    <p>mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay. These small but comfortable
                        ships have enormously powerful engines, and attain a very high rate of
                        speed. They are called the “Perry boats,” having been specially built to
                        carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi. If you are going straight
                        through to England you will find the train waiting at .Brindisi which will
                        take you to Calais without changing. It has complete arrangements for j
                        sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in London on the fifth
                        day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.’s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMINA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is thc
                        station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful,
                        occupying about one hour. In and around the town is much to interest the
                        visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but restored under the Romans.
                        CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of Etna and here also is a fine
                        Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all over
                        the island, are an endless sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting
                        history, having been a Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C.
                        413, and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb
                        is to be seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                        about 300,000 inhabitants is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                        delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The
                        Palazzo Beale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S.
                        Giovanni degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral,
                        Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also worth a visit.

                        1 during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 8 days. NAPLES is also
                        reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.’s steamers,
                        which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without wishing to
                        explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                        bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento
                        [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri. From Naples to ROME is a
                        train journey of but five hours. All who can will devote at least one week
                        to visiting the many historical and interesting portions of the Eternal
                        City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known to need comment hero.
                        Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                        City of Flowers arid its surrounding country. In Florence itself the !
                        churches and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local
                        promenades and excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most
                        attractive and fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei
                        Colli, one of the finest walks m Europe, opened 85 years ago, goes winding
                        up through the hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion
                        outside Florence is that te Vallombrosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above
                        the sea level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St.
                        Ellero, thence by cog-wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of
                        oaks takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view. PISA
                        is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ;here there is a fine
                        Cathedral jand the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should If
                        possible be made, in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at sunset.
                        VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near
                        Pisa and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient
                        half-way house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable ;
                        and the air and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                    <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most I picturesque and interesting city in Italy,
                        with the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European
                        cities and a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and deliciously
                        cool breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in
                        summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy’s most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travelers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail. MILAN is a good
                        centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the. Lakes. The
                        Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit. Between Bologna and Milan and only an j

                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea-port.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills
                        behind, no stretches rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above the
                        horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage out
                        of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian lakes.
                        COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza : Boats leave Como frequently for the other
                        towns on the lake, which is very beautiful, and the scenery on either side
                        going up the lakeis most enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come
                        Tremzzp, Cadenabbia, and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of
                        Bellaggio opposite. The walk from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to
                        Menaggio is most enjoyable. A steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on
                        Lake Lugano in three-quarters of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in
                        two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                        charmingly situated on the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery.
                        Around it rise M. San Salvatore, M. de Caprino and M. Generoso. LOCARNO may
                        be reached by rail from Bellinzona in forty minutes. This pretty town,
                        situated at the top of Lake Maggiore, has a mild climate, and is an
                        excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Basso, situated above the

                        by Ciseri, and "The Flight into Egypt.” by Bramantion. LUCERNE.—A striking
                        picture on the Lake of Lucerne facing the Rigi and Pilatus and the snowclad
                        Alps. In and around the town the walks are charming, and the excursions to
                        be made from Lucerne by boat, rail, etc., are very numerous. The Lite of
                        Lucerne abounds in delightful excursions, those to the Rigi, Pilatus,
                        Burgenstock and Sonnenberg needing a special visit each. Other excursions on

                        from Lucerns to Fluelen is a source of delight to the lover of nature.
                        BRUNNEN, charmingly situated on the most beautiful part of the Lake of
                        Lucerne, commands magnificent views of lake and mountain scenery. Along the
