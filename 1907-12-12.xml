                    <p>In regard to drink nothing but the best should be taken. It costs no more
                        than the indifferent quality, if people would only ask for what they know is
                        the best Old Scotch Whisky is the most wholesome beverage yet known Mackie's
                        Scotch Whisky gives an undoubted guarantee to those who are not judges of

                    <p>I hereby certify that I have taken samples of every vatting of Mackie's White
                        Horse Cellar Blend of Scotch Whisky used in bottling during the month of
                        September, and the results of my analyses indicate that it conforms to the
                        standard for Pot Still Scotch Whisky set up in the London case. I am also of
                        opinion that it is an old Whisky of excellent quality and flavour, which has
                        been well matured in wood.</p>

                    <head>LIFE ON MARS PROVED.</head>
                    <p>The "Century Magazine" for December is an historical document of the first
                        order, for it contains a wonderful series of photographs of Mars taken on
                        the Andes in July last by Mr. E. C. Slipher who was photographer to the
                        expedition organised by Prof Todd and Dr. Percival Lowell, the director of
                        the Lowell Observatory, and an article by Prof Lowell on the meaning of
                        those photographs.</p>
                    <p>The photographs when developed "proved little less than astounding Not only
                        were canals and oases evidently there, but these showed with a delicacy of
                        delineation which spoke for the steadiness of the air through which they had
                        been taken."</p>
                    <p>"The importance of these little round discs, doubt-killing bullets from the
                        planet of war, is that they reveal to laymen and astronomers alike that
                        markings exist on Mars which cannot be explained on any other supposition
                        than that lite able to fashion them is present there at this very moment,"
                        says Prof. Lowell. "For to an acute eye they are manifestly straight lines.
                        Now, straight lines are not natural products on any such scale as to be
                        visible from one body to another across forty millions of miles of
                        intervening space. Undertaken with a view to their educational value in
                        setting scepticism at rest, these photographs have proved the death of even
                        more doubt than the operators thought possible.</p>
                    <p>"One thing he who scans these circles must understand, or he will miss the
                        fall measure of the wonder they contain. His brain must be open to them ;
                        not his eye alone. For what is before him is no meaningless articulation of
                        black and white, but the portrait in its entity of another world, imprinted
                        there by that world itself. Sharp set against the black of space this
                        circlet of light displays to him an earth, comparable in grandeur and
                        self-containment with that on which he dwells. Small to the sight, in the
                        brain it takes on its true dimensions, and to the mind's eye becomes the
                        globe it really is, which, could he find himself transported thither, would
                        seem the essential sum and centre of the universe, as now to most men our
                        own world comprises all they know.</p>
                    <p>"The trained observer will find in the markings in chiaroscuro
                        representations of the really coloured topography of that other world.
                        Glistening snows around the poles are the white spots that catch his eye at
                        top and bottom ; blue-green areas of vegetation as large as Europe, the dark
                        ones he sees below; vast rose-ochre stretches of Saharan desert, the light
                        regions that compose its greater portion. And then, at last, trained to
                        looking, he will distinguish, the threads that interlace them and bind them
                        all into a communicated whole.</p>
                    <p>"These little lines are the canals which for their strange directness and yet
                        stranger articulation were for long denied existence, and even now find a
                        world slow to credit the story they have to tell. For it wounds man's
                        dignity to believe it. But to the camera no evasion of the fact avails. They
                        are there, and the film refuses to report them other than they are. They
                        speak of life to him who ponders on their meaning, reviewing with open mind
                        all the evidence they detail - life working to definite self-supporting end.
                        And his mind must be dulled indeed who does not lose him. self in
                        contemplation of the wonder of the mental vision these little balls call
                        up.</p>
                    <p>"That lite is there is founded on no assumption, but on massed evidence that
                        is conclusive, and the reader should realise that opposition to the idea
                        that we now have proof of life on Mars is not based on reason, but on
                        emotion, however speciously cloaked. All scientific objections have been met
                        and shown untenable as tv temperature, snow, etc., but human prejudice, as
                        with the Copernican system or the origin of species, time alone can
                        dispel."</p>

                            housed. The steady progress made by this well known business house has
                            necessitated several extensions of premises during the last few years,
                            and it is in order to meet this growing demand for more room, that the
                            whole property has been secured on a permanent lease. As the contracts
                            of those holding shops on the ground floor expire, the "Au De Rouge"

                        <p>Yet another petition, which is only one of many which have been presented
                            to the Government from time to time on the same subject, has recently
                            been handed to Sir Eldon Gorst praying for the extension of the existing
                            tramway through Old Cairo to the district of Sahel, but though this
                            extension would be of benefit to some hundreds of people, we have every
                            reason to fear that there is but little hope of the Tramway Company
                            undertaking the work for we understand that they have definitely decided
                            to shelve the project of extending their lines beyond their present
                            terminus.</p>
                        <p>A decree was issued by the Government as early as in August 1905, by
                            which the company were empowered to lay the two extra kilometres
                            required in order to bring Sahel within easy communication of the town,
                            but since that time, and despite repeated attention having been drawn to
                            the matter both by private individuals and by the Press, nothing further
                            has been dorie in the matter, and no notice whatever has been taken of
                            the repeated petitions of the native residents of the quarter. It seems
                            that the company, having once obtained the power of construction, are
                            content to let the matter rest there, and there is every possibility of
                            the district being left in its present state of isolation for an
                            indefinite period.</p>
                        <p>Sahel is a place of some importance, as it acts as a port for a very
                            considerable amount of Nile shipping during the year The Tramway Company
                            would therefore be fairly certain of a quick return to their financial
                            outlay, could they be brought to take the matter seriously in band, and
                            so much is the question one of public interest that we consider that
                            reasonable pressure should be brought to bear in order to secure the
                            accomplishment of the work.</p>
                        <p>The Government would certainly never have granted permission for the
                            desired construction, had it not been considered in the first place that
                            it would be to the advantage of the general public, and in the second
                            that such permission once granted would be acted upon within a
                            reasonable period of time.</p>

                            Judge in formed the counsel for the appellant that he would give his
                            decision, reserving the jurisdiction to the British Consular Courts, but

                        <p>We recently announced that an exhibition of the maps, etc., prepared by
                            the Survey Department would shortly be held, and an announcement has now
                            been made that the exhibition will open on the 9th of January next for a
                            period of nine days and will be held at the Géological Museum in the
                            garden of the Ministry of Public Works. It will be remembered that the
                            Prime Minister on the occasion of his recent visit to the Survey
                            Department, expressed his regret that a greater interest was not
                            displayed in the work of this Department, and it is in order to afford
                            the public an opportunity of seeing the various kinds of. maps, produced
                            by the Department that the exhibition has been arranged. It will include
                            exhibits of the instruments used in surveying and also those necessary
                            to the reproduction of maps. A series illustrative of the various stages
                            through which the maps pass before they are ready for publication will
                            also be shewn, together with examples of the photographic and
                            lithographic methods employed. Cadastral, topographical and geological
                            maps of the different provinces of Egypt will be included among the
                            exhibits, while a series of specimens will exemplify the use of maps for
                            scholastic and other purposes. The exhibition promises to be of much
                            interest to all. Geographical knowledge is a first step to that
                            expansion of ideas which is so necessary to a growing country, and the
                            brightest scholars are almost invariably to be found among those whose
                            interest has first been attracted by the larger world which lies outside
                            the immediate vicinity of their own particular village. The exhibition
                            will be open to members of the Press on January the 9th. prox.</p>

                        <p>"Hérodiade" was a test—hardly a fair test—of the possibilities of the
                            weightier side of the company, "Carmen" is an analogous test of its
                            lighter side. Carmen herself must be Italian or Spanish or gifted—the
                            Toreador must be a singularly self sacrificing person who is willing to
                            go through a whole four act opera for the sake of one song. Don Jose has
                            a song in the second act, some acting in the third and fourth but
                            otherwise little enough. Micaëla has two chances, and two only. The
                            music is, of course, charming and rather unique. The performance at the
                            Khedivial Theatre was adequate, but no more. Carmen herself (Mile
                            Talbert) was inclined to exaggerate and over accentuate the acting, and
                            she did not do justice to the singing. The latter should be purely
                            dramatic, and the former subtle. M. Gorius was forcible and effective in
                            the Toreador song, and he appreciated such drama as was involved in the
                            rest of the part. M. Flachat has a most attractive voice, but had little
                            enough chance to display it, and he could not escape from his mannerisms
                            until he was well into the third act.</p>
                        <p>The chorus ænd orchestra were correct and adequate, but the latter lacked
                            enthusiasm. The opera is full of contrast and effects, and done of these
                            were accentuated sufficiently : that was, in fact, the keynote of the
                            performance as a whole : but we may well hope that judging from the
                            voices, orchestra, and chorus, the light side of the company may show
                            what they can do when they have a real chance; certainly the promise is
                            far better than the performances of last year.</p>

                        <p>Why not a Civil Service, Co-operative Society? It would take years before
                            all the subscribers were placed in possession of houses or the funds
                            wherewith to build and the sab: scriptions (which in other words would
                            be an addition to present rentals,) would not provide funds for a dozen
                            houses per annum, while the problem before us is one calling for an
                            immediate solution. In one suburb of Cairo along, saying that only five
                            per cent of those who bought building sites did so with the intention of
                            building their own house, two hundred houses are called for. Allowing an
                            average of L.E. 400 per bungalow or cottage, a capital of L.E. 80,000 is
                            required, and the government employes could not raise this sum amongst
                            themselves.</p>
                        <p>Why not submit the scheme to one of the existing companies? This has been
                            done, but none are prepared to build houses on the defer. red payment
                            system except upon their own land and which they are very desirous of
                            disposing of nor can it be expected that they could favourably entertain
                            a scheme which to a lesser or greater extent would clash with their own
                            interests. Let me repeat that the suggestion is to build houses on the
                            building society principle on land "already owned by the Government
                            employes."</p>
                        <p>Why not ask the Government to advance the capital? There is most
                            certainly lying dormant in the hands of rich and influential people, all
                            the capital that is required, and here is an opportunity for them to
                            make good use of their money in a sound and safe investment; the scheme
                            is not speenlative enough for many, but I have an idea that most people
                            have had their lesson over wild cat schernes and gambling in speculative
                            shares.</p>
                        <p>A company with shares? Naturally a company would be formed with a share
                            capital, but what is wanted for the moment is the formation of such a
                            group as I have indicated who would take up the matter as
                            underwriters-but| foregoing the underwriting commissions. This is not
                            unreasonable as the scheme is not a speculative one in the ordinary
                            sense of the term, and as already pointed out, capital would only be
                            called up as required for building, and. interest on that capital is
                            immediately forthcoming.</p>
                        <p>Why not call a meeting? This is a matter for the Government employés to
                            organize amongst themselves, but they should have thoroughly debated the
                            whole matter beforehand and come to a general understanding on the lines
                            to be laid down before asking any high official or prominent resident to
                            take the chair ; in other words they should simply meet for the purpose
                            of approving publicly of the scheme, and registering their names as
                            intending shareholders.</p>

                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE."</p>
                        <p>Sir,-- In your article of the 7th inst, in the suppression of the
                            Egyptian Mining Department you say with justice that, so far as gold is
                            concerned, the results have been somewhat disappointing. May 1, however,
                            point out that so far there is no evidence whatever that this
                            disappointment is due to gold not existing in the country in sufficient
                            quantity. It has been mainly if not entirely due to the undertaking of
                            too great enterprises with insufficient capital.</p>
                        <p>Want of confidence in the first instance induced speculation to strive
                            for great concessions, and to unduly water their capital. Want of
                            capital has brought about the suspension of operations before the mines
                            have come to the producing stage. Of course there have been special
                            cases of bad luck, it is not necessary to discuss them, but there is
                            reason to believe that nearly all not immediately interested are
                            entirely at fault as to the present state of at least the central group
                            of Egyptian mines.</p>
                        <p>What the result of the reconstruction of the Egyptian Mines Exploration
                            Co., will be cannot yet be determined, very much will depend on the
                            courage of the shareholders, It may however be pointed out as regards
                            one at least of this central group -- the At Allah mine that a mine with
                            practically £80,000 worth of gold in sight to be extracted for an
                            estimated expenditure of £10,000, and with a probable £50.000 more
                            obtainable by moderate development, is a very different proposition when
                            burdened by a nominal £100,000 ot capital, and when most of that burden
                            is removed. And the Semna mine though such rapid returns could not he
                            looked for from small expenditure is probably a better mine still. The
                            original excessive capitals are almost certain to disappear before very
                            long, and the mines will probably then well repay those who work them.
                            The Egyptian mines are going through the stages through which most
                            ancient mines have to pass when reopened. They are not less promising
                            now than were the Mysore mines 25 years ago.</p>

                        <p>Although so far as Egypt is concerned, England is quite out of the trade
                            in the finished article, she supplies Austria with a very large part of
                            the raw material such as serge, black alpaca, tennis flannel, and the
                            cloths for the very cheapest class of goods. Practically the whole of
                            the khaki used by Austria comes from England. A propos of khaki, a
                            prominent firm here recently estimated that the Egyptian Government
                            takes about one million yards of it per annum, in connection with the
                            uniforms for the army, police, coast guards, railways and so forth.
                            Although some of the contracts go to Austria, the whole of the raw
                            material is supplied by England.</p>
                        <p>FRANCE.—The principal imports are the more expensive clothes for ladies.
                            France also sends us the very cheapest form of workmen's clothing, such
                            as smocks etc.</p>
                        <p>GREAT BRITAIN.-It is difficult to say how England's L.E.50,000 is made
                            up, but we think we are not far short of the mark in saying that the
                            bulk of her business is with the Government for uniforms. We hope next
                            month to give the figures relating to the ready made clothing ordered by
                            certain of the Government Departments during 1906. At the moment of
                            going to press, we have not all the necessary details by us, and
                            therefore, propose dealing with the same in our November issue.</p>
                        <p>GERMANY. -- Germany has made sundry attempts to secure a share of the
                            trade here but without much result. She does a little through commission
                            agents, but she cannot compete with the cheap Austrian labour.</p>
                        <p>TURKEY. -- The cheapest imported goods, made without much regard for cut,
                            workmanship and materials employed, come from Turkey, the chief centres
                            being Smyrna &amp; Constantinople. It is stated that the cloth used for
                            the goods in question is mainly supplied by England, but the fact
                            remains that clothes can be sent to Egypt at such a price that even
                            Austria cannot compete on point of actual £. s. D.</p>
                        <p>LOCAL. -- The remarks last made apply with even greater force to the
                            goods turned out by the numerous small tailors who abound in Alexandria
                            &amp; Cairo. These men, for example, can turn out a full length overcoat
                            at about 8/- and sell it in their shops for 10/-. The account works out
                            thus : 24 2 1/2 yards of English material at</p>
                        <p>1/10 &amp; yard 4/7</p>
                        <p>Linings &amp; buttons 1/5</p>
                        <p>Workmen 2/-</p>
                        <p>8/-</p>
                        <p>GENERAL.-- At the present time the double breasted coats having two or
                            three buttons, are the ones mainly in vogue here amongst purhasers of
                            ready mades.</p>
                        <p>The coats have two inside pockets but no breast ones. The goods are made
                            in all colours with patterns. A single colour cloth with no design on it
                            is not much good to the Arabs, who are the largest buyers. The sizes are
                            in centimetres, those generally stocked being 42, 44, 46, 48, and so on
                            up to as large as 60 centimetre round the chest. (British Chamber of
                            Commerce Bulletin.)</p>

                    <p>Comme tendance de l'ensemble c'est tou. jours le Jourdeur qui prévaut. Les

                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>Mardi a eu lieu la réunion des créanciers de la maison Khalifa Naggar et
                        fils. Elle a abouti au yote du concordat préventif. On dit que MM. Khalifa
                        Naggar et fils se sont engagés à payer intégralement leurs créanciers en
                        l'espace de trois ans avec intérêts à raison de 3 % l'an. La réunion au
                        tribunal mixte pour l'homologation du concordat aura lieu le 18 décembre. Il
                        est très probable que ce seront MM. Ch. Me nasce et Barocas qui seront
                        nommés liquidateurs ; ce dernier a d'ailleurs déjà donné son acceptation. En
                        outre, une commission de contrôle de 5 membres sera nommée dont feront très
                        probablement partie M. Attilio Alessandrini, l'actif et sympathique
                        liquidateur de la Cassa di Sconto, et M. S. Benlassim. Nous félicitons
                        sincèrement la maison Khalifa Naggar de cette liquidation si honorable d'une
                        situation extrêmement difficile. La inéthode scrupuleuse que cette maison
                        apporte au désintéressement de ses créanciers apportera à la place, que
                        cette faillite oppressait, un véritable soulagement et un réconfort pour la
                        reprise des affaires.</p>

                        <p>The Vorspoed trouble bas been settled. It was a local affair due to the
                            arrest of a native. The police have brought in the mob to Kronstad where
                            the majority of them have been fined with the alternative of
                            imprisonment (Reuter)</p>

                        <head>The Money Market.</head>
                        <p>In some quarters, in the early part of the week there was a persistent
                            tendency to regard the American crisis as practically at an end; the
                            reduction of the premium on currency and the facts that the Bank was
                            able to secure a large sum in gold from the Cape Tent strength to this
                            view. Talk of an immediate easing of the monetary situation, and a
                            probable lowering of the Bank rate yesterday was pretty general.</p>
                        <p>Conservative financiers, however, regarded this optimism as somewhat
                            overdone, and unjustified by the best information Consequently they were
                            by no means surprised later when it was announced that the premium on
                            currency in New York bad been increased to 2 per cent, and that over
                            £300,000 in coin had been taken from the Bank for that quarter. The news
                            of the failure of the National Bank of Commerce at Kansas, to hand
                            to-day, serves as a further reminder that America is as yet by no means
                            "out of the wood." Wednesday was the day fixed for the renewal of
                            payments in cash, and the course of events during the next few days will
                            be watched with much interest and no little anxiety. Meanwhile our Bank
                            rate remains at 7 percent and no change is likely to be made until there
                            is more definite assurance than we have had so far that America's
                            demands for the precious metal are yet satisfied.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Roosevelt's message to Congress is as usual a very lengthy document,
                            but those who looked for some drastic suggestions for remedying the
                            present currency evils in the States will be disappointed. He recommends
                            the provision of an emergency issue, based on adequate securities
                            approved by Government, but the question of a national bank, America's
                            most pressing need, is entirely ignored, and not even a suggestion of a
                            commission of enquiry is made. It is evidently a case of "sufficient
                            unto the day is the evil thereof. " The Americans have proved by
                            experience that in times of stress they can obtain gold from Europe--the
                            question of the effect upon the world's trade not entering into their
                            consideration hence they are not over-anxious to place their currency on
                            a sound basis.</p>
                        <p>The Bank return this week shows that a further £123,587 has been added to
                            the reserve. The imports of gold amounted to about one and a quarter
                            millions, but, on the other<cb n="3"/>hand, the cash requirements at
                            home incidental to the end of the month absorbed half a million, and the
                            note circulation has expanded to the extent of £390,225. This week's
                            addition brings the reserve up to £21,909,190, as against £21,667,305 a
                            year ago The proportion to liabilities is 1.19 per cent. higher on the
                            week at 44 02 per cent, which compares with 44.84 per cent. in 1906. </p>
                        <p>At the beginning of the week the price of bar gold fell to 77/10 ⅛ , but
                            has again advanced to 77/11 ½ .</p>
                        <p>Money has been in fairly plentiful supply, and loans have been done from
                            41 to 5 per cent. The discount market had firmed up, and three months'
                            bank paper has realised up to 5 ⅞ per cent.</p>

                        <p>The improvement in the tone of the stock markets has been continued
                            during the past week, and is evidence of the growing confidence in an
                            early clearing of the monetary horizon. During the first few days,
                            shares were quite buoyant, the Stock Exchange thus accurately reflecting
                            the optimism prevailing if Lombard Street, and a large business was done
                            in most sections. It is probably the case that a fair proportion of this
                            was of a speculative character, due to the belief in an early re|duction
                            in the Bank rate and a return to easier money conditions generally, but
                            at the same time there has been a substantial amount of sound buying on
                            the part of the best class of investors. The firmer tendency of the
                            money market during the latter part of the week as the result of the
                            renewal of American shipments of gold caused a slight reaction for a
                            time, but it is significant that for the most part the tone has remained
                            firm, and that prices are well maintained.</p>
                        <p>A very satisfactory feature is the strength of gilt-edged stocks. In a
                            time of depression Consols are the first to suffer, and the present
                            firmness of the premier security may be accepted as an evidence of the
                            better feeling now pervading the Stock Exchange.</p>
                        <p>To-day as members have been chiefly employed in the evening-up of their
                            books, not much new business has been transacted. The tone has been
                            cheerful, however, and the tendency of prices generally favourable.</p>

                            Nicholas were down 1 ½ to 81. The last issue was unchanged at 88 ½ .
                            Last Saturday the Fours left off at 81 ¾ and the Fives at 90 ¼ .</p>
                        <p>To-day both first and second series of Japanese 4 ½ per cents. have shed
                            ¼ to 90 ½ and 90 respectively. Russian Fours are ½ lower at 80, and the

                        <p>The feature of the week in the home railway market has again been the
                            support given to the shares of the Great Northern and the Great Central
                            companies in consequence of the arrangement proposed for eliminating the
                            competition on the northern route. Up till Tuesday night Great Central
                            "B" had advanced 4 points to 33, and Great Northern Deferred 2 ¾ to 45 ½
                            . This rapid advance caused a certain amount of profit-taking, with the
                            result that prices fell away. Some selling also took place on the issue
                            of an official circular fixing the meeting of shareholders to discuss
                            the proposed arrangement a fortnight hence, on 20th December,
                            disappointment being expressed that no details of the proposed scheme
                            are forthcoming until that date. Yesterday Great Central "B" lost 1 to
                            30 ¼ and Great Northern Deferred 1⁄4 to 45 ¼ . Great Northern
                            Preference, however, advanced ½ to 96. It is stated that one dealer who
                            offered York Deferred at 45 immediately turned round and bid for £10,000
                            stock at 44 ⅞ .</p>
                        <p>The heavy stocks as a whole were steady.</p>
                        <p>There has been a renewal of buying of Great Northern and Great Central
                            issues to-day. York Def. close with a rise of 1 ⅜ at 46 ⅝ , and Great
                            Central Pref. have advanced a point to 31 ¼ .</p>

                            week. President Roosevelt's message to Congress did not have much
                            effect, as it had been fully discounted owing to the very accurate
                            forecasts which had been previously published in the New York papers,
                            but the increase in the premium on currency came as a cold douch, and
                            the announcement of the bank failure at Kansas caused further
                            selling.</p>
                        <p>In the "Street". last night there was a good recovery, however, and the
                            closing prices were about the best.</p>
                        <p>Americans have been very firm to-day. Union Pacific, New York Central,

                    <p>Stomach trouble is one of the worst of complaints, for not only does it cause
                        the victim cruel sufferings, but he also finds it impossible to obtain
                        sufficient nourishment to maintain his strength. His forces, therefore,
                        gradually waste away. However, he has no cause for despair, as Dr. Williams'
                        Pink Pills for Pale People will very quickly remedy his condition. Witness
                        what they have done for Mlle. Madeleine Lihermite, whose portrait is given

                    <p>She writes: "I have pleasure in informing you that Dr. Williams' Pink Pills
                        have done me a great deal of good. I had not believed that I could be so
                        rapidly cared of the indigestion from which I had suffered for so long. It
                        was quite time that I took Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People, because
                        all the other medicines which I had tried had done nothing for me. I was
                        scarcely able to eat anything, and as a natural result, became disquietingly
                        weak. After taking the first box of Dr. Williams' Pink Pills, however, I
                        felt much better - that is to say, I felt more at ease and stronger. I at
                        once began to eat with a better appetite and to digest my food very well. My
                        pains became less and less acute, and after a short treatment I was cured."
                        Mlle. Lhermite lives at Sains-en-Gohelle, near Noeuxles-Mines (Pas
                        de-Calais).</p>
                    <p>If you suffer from stomach troubles, it is quite useless to fret. Go at once
                        and buy a few boxes of Dr Willams' Pink Pills for Pale People. The treatment
                        will be more or less long according to the case and the temperament of the
                        sufferer ; but it will lead to one conclusion -a cure</p>
                    <p>Dr. Williams' Pink Pills are also a remedy for anæmia, chlorosis,
                        neurasthenia, general weakness, sick headache, neuralgia, sciatica,

                    <p>A number of interesting object shave recently been added to the Egyptian
                        Department of the British Museum, and are now on exhibition in the
                        galleries. Among the most interesting is a portion of the doorway from the
                        tomb of the Queen Ankhnes-nefer-ab-ru, whose sarcophagus is already in the
                        collection. The large granite sarcophagus of a scribe and high Court
                        official is also worthy of notice, the hieroglyphic inscription being
                        beautifully cut after the manner of the Ptolemaic period about B.C. 300, to
                        which age it probably belongs. There is also a huge tablet or stele carved
                        in the shape of a door and inscribed with a long funerary inscription. These
                        objects, which are technically known as "Ka" doors, were put up in the
                        tombs, and were supposed to give admission to the soul or "Ka" of the
                        deceased when it came to visit the mummy and partake of the offerings of
                        food placed in the tomb by relatives and friends.</p>
