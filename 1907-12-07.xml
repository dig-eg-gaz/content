                    <head>A GOOD START IN LIFE.</head>
                    <p>Mothers should early realize how essential good health is for the success of
                        their child in after life. A badly nourished baby generally means an
                        undersized child, wanting in stamina and vigour. If unable to nurse your
                        baby you must give the substitute that most closely resembles human milk. No
                        farinaceous or starchy food or unmodified cow's milk is permissible to a
                        child under 6 or 7 months of age. The "Allensburys" Milk Foods are so
                        prepared as to remove the difference between cow's milk and human milk, and
                        they are as easy of digestion as the natural food of the child.</p>
                    <p>The "Allenburys" Foods are alike suitable for the delicate and robust, and,
                        when used as directed, form the best means of rearing a child by hand. The
                        No. 1 Milk Food may be given alternately with the mother's milk without fear
                        of upsetting the child or causing digestive disturbance. The dreaded process
                        of weaning is thus made easy and comfortable both to the mother and
                        child.</p>

                    <head>SIR ELDON GORST.</head>
                    <p>Included in a house party assembled in the Eastern Counties some
                        two-and-twenty years ago was a young man who entered with spirit into all
                        the amusements of a very gay week. There was a county ball in the
                        neighbouring town, besides dancing and amusements of all kinds in the
                        country house itself. Of these gaieties the young man in question was the
                        life and soul. Few of those who formed that house party in the mid-eighties
                        foresaw the eminence to which their fellow-guest would attain, though many
                        were struck with the brilliance of his conversation and the pungency of his
                        wit. One or two predicted for him a great future.</p>
                    <p>These last were in the right for Eldon Gorst has in these twenty-odd years
                        risen to quite a dazzling height in the service of his country. It was just
                        after the house party in question that he first entered the Foreign Office,
                        at the age of twenty-four. He had, it is true, certain preliminary
                        advantages that stood him in good stead. The son of a distinguished
                        father–for even at that time Sir John Gorst was Solicitor-General, and in
                        the following year he became under-Secretary for India–Eldon Gorst had been
                        educated at Eton, and had gone thence to Trinity College, Cambridge, whence
                        he emerged twentieth wrangler. Yet these are advantages shared by many who
                        elect to make diplomacy their profession. It was this young man's own
                        personality that so soon made its mark, leading him on through the various
                        grades of attaché, third Secretary and second Secretary, until he became, in
                        the year 1890, a very important personage as Controller of Direct Taxes to
                        the Egyptian Government. Here was an opening that gave scope for the
                        brain-power that Nature had given Mr. Eldon Gorst in no scant measure. In
                        two years he became Under-Secretary of State for Finance, and two years
                        later came to him the post of Adviser to the Ministry of the Interior. These
                        important offices brought their holder, of course, into close relations with
                        Lord Cromer, whose understudy he became and that so successfully that five
                        years ago a grateful Government improved plain Mr. Eldon Gorst into Sir
                        Eldon Gorst by bestowing on him a Civil K.C.B. It is only during the present
                        year, however, that the clever young diplomat of twenty years ago attained
                        to the highest reward that comes of long service in Egypt. Lord Cromer, from
                        motives of health and because of advancing years, last spring elected to
                        retire from his responsible position in Cairo. Who so fit to succeed him as
                        Sir Eldon Gorst, trained for so many years under his watchtul eye ? So the
                        man of the moment was there at the moment, and now, at the age of forty-six,
                        finds himselt the deus ex machina of all the complicated network of Egyptian
                        affairs.</p>
                    <p>Even his most ardent admirers will not be disposed to consider Sir Eldon
                        Gorst particularly imposing in his personal appearance. He is quite
                        unusually short, as the men of these days go, with rather a stoop of the
                        shoulders, and short sight necessitates his wearing pince-nez at all times
                        and seasons. Yet his is an exceedingly clever face, and the eyes, even
                        through their spectacles, have a merry, bright twinkle that shows a keen
                        sense of humonr. In former days no one entered more keenly into the social
                        gaieties of Cairo, and Mr. Gorst, as he then was, in spite of being a man of
                        affairs, managed to be at all the amusing picnic parties, balls, and dinners
                        of the winter season in Egypt. Four years ago, bowever, having waited till
                        he was well over forty, Sir Eldon settled down to matrimony; he wooed and
                        won the daughter of a well-known South African financier, Mr. Charles Rudd,
                        and their wedding in Lancaster Gate was one of the events of the season of
                        1903. Lady Gorst is a very charming and popular lady, who will do the
                        honours of the British Consulate General with much of the grace that made
                        her predecessor, Lady Cromer, so well liked during these last five seasons
                        at Cairo. To complete the good fortune of Sir Eldon Gorst–to whom, surely,
                        the gods have been extraordinarily kind–there is a young hopeful, who has
                        just accompanied Lady Gorst to Egypt, and will, no doubt, in time carry on
                        the traditions of a specially talented family to the third generation.–(From

                            more serious consequences, by the dislocation of traffic through the

                        <p>The "New York American" remarks :"Many persons believe that cotton will
                            go lower, but some of those who believe this are trying to terrify the
                            Southern planters by pointing to Egypt. Egypt has had many chances to
                            raise all the cotton the world needed, but it has never been able to
                            increase its production materially. Improvements for handling the water
                            of the Nile were made some years ago. They did not result in any
                            increase in the cotton crop, although they did produce an immense crop
                            of scandal in London and Alexandria. The United States is secure in its
                            control of the cotton market, but in spite of that cotton seems to be
                            pointing downward simply because a season of economy has settled all
                            over the world. </p>

                    <head>EGYPT'S DANGER</head>
                    <p>Two interesting speeches, representing the different points of view in regard
                        to the policy to be pursued in regard to this country, were made last week.
                        The standpoint of the cosmopolitan European financier is tersely expressed
                        in the statement as to the situation in Egypt made by Baron G. de Reuter,
                        who presided over the second ordinary meeting of the Anglo-Belgian Company
                        of Egypt. The official report of his speech was published in our issue of
                        yesterday, but the remarks which we will now quote were not included
                        therein, although considerable prominence is given to them in the London
                        newspapers. The Baron, in moving the adoption of the report, said that
                        during the last twenty-four years the progress of Egypt had been phenomenal
                        from an economical point of view. The position of the fellah had been
                        immensely improved. He wanted to be left alone to cultivate his ground and
                        to be free from the unjust impositions with which he was burdened in the
                        past. The idea that he wanted Parliamentary representation was not serious,
                        and those persons who were really acquainted with the country scoffed at the
                        notion.</p>
                    <p>"Lord Cromer, at the Guildhall, last month, adverting to this question,
                        stated, that he viewed the extremists in this country who had misled the
                        Egyptians as to the true trend of feeling here as the worst enemies of
                        Egyptian progress : the extremists, were mischievous because of their
                        suggestion of changes for which the state of Egypt was not yet ripe."</p>
                    <p>If the edifice, which we have built up here, should crumble owing to the
                        policy of the Radical extremists, the Baron pointed out that it was those
                        who had financial interests in this country who would suffer, whether they
                        be foreigners or Egyptians, and he therefore, appealed to the shareholders
                        as business men to do what they could to nip such a danger in the bud. “It
                        was in their power to do it. The extremists in Egypt only existed because
                        they counted upon a certain support in this country and on the Continent;
                        and if that support be denied them they would inevitably and completely
                        cease to exist. All Europeans having a stake in Egypt deplored this fanning
                        of the flame in England, as they deemed it disastrous to all concerned.”</p>
                    <p>Elsewhere in yesterday's issue we give publicity to an equally characteristic
                        utterance by the very type of person, whose dangerous theories are
                        stigmatised by Baron de Reuter. The lecture on Egypt by the Radical
                        "doctrinaire," Mr. Robertson, M.P., is the expression of a diametrically
                        opposite point of view, which holds financiers as persons of no account in
                        comparison with the realisation of "a priori" theories as to the
                        amelioration of Egypt in accordance with Radical panaceas.</p>

                        leaving the service of Mustapha Pasha Kamel for a more congenial occupation

                    <p>The French Press in Cairo of every shade of opinion is unanimous in its
                        condemnation of Mustapha Pasha Kamel's conduct to Mr. Kastner, the late
                        editor of the "Etendard Egyptien." Kamel violated all the principles of
                        professional etiquette and also all the ordinary rules of courtesy by
                        announcing in the "Etendard" that Mr. Kastner had been dismissed, for our
                        French contemporaries declare that this is untrue, as Mr. Kastner sent a
                        letter to Kamel, twenty four hours prior to the alleged dismissal,
                        announcing that he intended severing his connection with Mustapha Pasha
                        Kamel and Company</p>
                    <p>Our observations on the question would only be interpreted as emanating from
                        a naturally prejudiced source, so we will confine ourselves to quoting the
                        opinion of some Cairo organs, "untainted by Imperialistic prejudice," and we
                        commend the perusal of these comments to Mr. Wilfrid Blunt and the other
                        supporters of Kamel at home.</p>
                    <p>The Anglophobe "Orient," whose sympathies with Egyptian Nationalism have of
                        late become very pronounced, remarks -</p>
                    <p>"L'attitude de Moustapha Kamel dans l'incident actuel nous oblige à déclarer
                        que si nous sommes des admirateurs de sa politique, nous ne saurions
                        approuver son attitude comme directeur de journal. L'"Etendard" n'admet pas
                        que les contrères "pleurnichent” sur le cas de notre ami Kastner. Il
                        revendique pour le journaliste la liberté. S'il veut parler de la liberté de
                        traiter ses collaborateurs, aussi cavalièrement, ce n'est plus de la liberté
                        du journaliste qu'il s'agit. Il faut s'entendre."</p>
                    <p>The "Bourse Egyptienne" says :</p>
                    <p>"L'opinion unanime de la presse, comme celle du public, sera du côté de notre
                        ami M Kastner.</p>
                    <p>The "Journal du Caire" remarks: -</p>
                    <p>"Il nons sera permis de regretter que le départ de M. Kastner ait été annoncé
                        par l'Eterdard" en termes peu courtois. C'est la facheuse façon d'illustrer,
                        par des faits, la théorie du rapprochement entre Egyptiens et Européens. En
                        toute chose, il y a une manière; celle de l'"Etendard" n'est certainement
                        pas la bonne."</p>
                    <p>"L'Egypte" devotes a considerable space to criticising the conduct of the
                        Pasha, both as regards the Editor of the "Etendard Egyptien" and also in the
                        case of the Editor of the "Egyptian Standard." We extract the following
                        passage from the leading article in to-day's issue of that newspaper :</p>
                    <p>Ce qu'il y a de particulièrement grave clans les décisions du pacha, c'est
                        qu'elles sont froidement calculées. Elles ont pour but de creuser davantage
                        si possible le fossé profond qui, grâce aux gens de son espèce, rend tout
                        rapprochement impossible entre Egyptiens et étrangers. Mustapha Kamel ne
                        veut pas tenir compte de l'immense sacrifice moral consenti à son soi-disant
                        patriotisme par ceux qui eurent le courage de le servir. Il engage des
                        journalistes pour l'encenser et les congédie pour se distraire. Il appelle
                        cela la liberté. La liberté ? La liberté de l'injustice sans doute ?</p>

                        of the Government, for when it is considered what a large amount of both
                        time and money has been expended in conducting the preliminary work
                        necessary to the ultimate success of the department, it seems to be a matter
                        for regret that it should have been found necessary to suspend operations
                        just at the time when everything had been put on a sound working basis and
                        the real work of the Department was about to commence.</p>
                    <p>We understand that the Director in his preliminary report to the Government
                        affirmed that it would not be until the year 1908 that any tangible results
                        could be expected, as in his opinion it would be impossible to carry out the
                        organization of the Department in a less time. Thus it happens that now at
                        the close of 1907, when the station at Edfou stands in perfect readiness for
                        the carrying through of any necessary experiments, and all is ready for the
                        start, the Government has chosen to abolish–or at least practically
                        abolish–the Department altogether.</p>
                    <p>It may very possibly be that in the opinion of the Government, the country is
                        not yet in a sufficiently advanced position to justify further expenditure
                        on what is, after all, a practically unknown quantity, but surely if this is
                        the case, there must have been a deplorable lack of forethought exercised by
                        those to whom the formation of the Department of Mines was originally due,
                        if the Department was intended only to make the crudest investigations into
                        the mining and geological possibilities of the country, then the expenditure
                        at Edfou was entirely unjustifiable and should have been checked. If however
                        the work, which has been carried on, has been in accordance with the ideas
                        and intentions of the Government, it is more than ever surprising that this
                        time should have been chosen for their sudden alterations in plan.</p>
                    <p>It would be interesting to know the precise reasons which has prompted the
                        Government to take this drastic action. We believe it to be primarily due to
                        motives of economy, but on the other hand it is an undoubted fact that an
                        oil field of considerable value has already been discovered, marble and
                        sulphur have been found, both of good quality and in presumably workable
                        quantities, and for the development of the pottery industries alone it might
                        have been imagined that a further lease of life would have been allotted to
                        the Department responsible for these discoveries. While it is true that as
                        far as gold is concerned, the results have been somewhat disappointing, it
                        is in only very few countries where gold can be said to be the staple form
                        of mineral wealth. There is gold in Egypt. There are emeralds and rubies
                        also. But because neither are found in extraordinary quantities is no reason
                        why the existence of other minerals should be ignored in the great portion
                        of the country as yet unexplored, and such discoveries as have already been
                        made augurs hopefully for the future. We believe that there are still one or
                        two men of the former Department to be retained to act in their original
                        positions, and it may be that the working is therefore simply to remain in
                        abeyance. In the meanwhile we trust that the money spent in the formation of
                        the Edfou base, and in the accumulation of the necessary details pertaining
                        to it will not prove to be so much money wasted.</p>

                    <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE".</p>
                    <p>Sir, –In reference to the unfortunate incidents that have of late occurred in
                        regard to Limited Liability Companies registered in London, but whose sphere
                        of operations is in Egypt and whose board of directors is only composed of
                        subjects of foreign Powers, the only remedy is to require the entire board
                        to be composed of British subjects amenable to British Consular juridiction,
                        thus avoiding the interminable delays and technical difficulties of the
                        Mixed Tribunals. An Act of Parliament could be passed for this purpose
                        without any difficulty, as by this time the authorities at home should be
                        aware of the abuse by foreigners in Egypt of the businesslike facilities
                        afforded by the English Law for the formation of companies.</p>
                    <p>Truly Yours</p>

                    <head>KHEDIVIAL AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY. MR. FLETCHER'S WORK.</head>
                    <p>At a meeting of the general committee of the Khedivial Agricultural Society
                        on the 4th inst, Mr. Frederick Fletcher, M.A. (Cantab), B. So (Lond),
                        Principal of Agriculture, Gizeh, was elected a member of the executive
                        committee.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Fletcher was from 1901 to 1903 lecturer on agriculture at the School of
                        Agriculture, Gizeh, and has returned to that school as successor to Dr.
                        Mackenzie after some four years' valuable and varied experience in India as
                        Deputy Director of Agriculture for the Bombay Presidency. Mr. Fletcher was
                        elected foundation scholar of St. John's College, Cambridge, in natural
                        science, and after taking the B.A. degree he proceed to the agricultural
                        department of the university and obtained the diploma in agriculture. During
                        his two years at the School of Agriculture at Gizeh he commenced breeding
                        experiments with Egyptian cotton, and gave special attention to making a
                        complete collection of the varieties of cotton grown all over the world.
                        Before leaving Egypt be passed the departmental examination in Arabic, and
                        wrote a handbook on "Egyptian Insect Pests." In India Mr. Fletcher's work
                        included the organisation of a department of practical agriculture, and the
                        establishment of experimental farms for cotton growing in various parts of
                        the Bombay Presidency. Mr. Fletcher continued to give attention to the
                        collection of cottons, and a largely illustrated monograph compiled by him
                        on this subject is now being printed by the Government of Bombay. Among
                        other agricultural questions taken up by Mr. Fletcher may be mentioned the
                        introduction of Egyptian cotton into the Indus valley, and an investigation
                        of the so-called "exhaustion" of soils, on which latter subject he prepared
                        a special paper now being printed by the Agricultural Department of the
                        Government of ludia. Mr. Fletcher has been able to see a considerable
                        improvement in the quality of cotton grown in the Bombay Presidency, and he
                        was not infrequently called upon by other provinces to advise on questions
                        connected with cotton and irrigation for Agricultural purposes. His special
                        knowledge of the vast projects of irrigation in the unreclaimed tracts of
                        the Punjab places him in the front rank of authorities in Egypt on so
                        important a subject as land reclamation.</p>
                    <p>The Ministry of Education and the new Department of Agriculture and Technical
                        Education are to be congratulated upon having secured the services of an
                        agricultural expert and administrator with such wide and important
                        experience, and it may be expected that the School of Agriculture and also
                        the Khedivial Agricultural Society will largely benefit as a result of the
                        appointment of Mr. Fletcher.</p>

                    <p>Yesterday afternoon and this morning the case of Mr. Montana v. the
                        Anglo-Egyptian Bank was heard at the British Consulate before Judge Cator of
                        the Supreme Consular Court. Counsel for the plaintiff was Mr. Halford
                        assisted by Mr. Moss, the counsel for the defence being Mr. A.W. Preston.
                        Mr. Montana claims a sum of £3,000 (approximately) on the grounds of having
                        instructed on July 3, 1907 the Anglo-Egyptian Bank to pay in London by
                        telegram a sum of £11,016 due on July 16,1907, and that his instructions
                        were not carried out. The amount having been deposited at the Anglo-Egyptian
                        Bank, Alexandria, the Bank telegraphed the same to their London office, but,
                        it is alleged, neglected to insert in their telegram the fact that the sum
                        mentioned was domiciled at the Bank of Egypt; the complainant thus claims
                        damages on the ground of loss of credit. During yesterday afternoon the
                        witnesses heard were Mr. Ralli, Mr. E. Moss, Mr. Triandas and Mr. G. Morris.
                        The case was adjourned at ten minutes to one this afternoon until 2 p.m.</p>

                        friends at home, could not do better than order their booksellers to send
                        them Professor Margoliouth's new book on the cities of the Egyptian Sultans,
                        Cairo, Jerusalem and Damascus. The illustrations in colour by Mr. Water
                        Tyrwhitt give a most vivid and artistic representation of Oriental Cairo and
                        the letter press is as interesting as the pictures are beautiful. It is
                        needless to mention that all the historical details are of extreme accuracy
                        in a work coming from such a polymath as the Laudian Professor of Arabic.
                        Professor Margoliouth, who dedicates the book to the Princess Nazli Hanem,
                        in his preface to the work says that its compilation was "a relief from the
                        labour of editing and translating Arabic texts. The chance of being
                        associated at any time in his life with the fine arts constituted a
                        temptation which he was unable to resist." Messrs Chatto and Windus are the

                                the settlement as of national significance. So long as the industry
                                was able to settle its disputes in this manner it had no need to

                    <head>WEATHER OF NOVEMBER SURVEY DEPARTMENTS REPORT.</head>
                    <p>During the first half of the month the weather was fine on the whole but
                        cold. In the second fortnight, however, from the 15th to the 21st. and from
                        the 28th to the end of the month, two depressions passed eastwards along the
                        Mediterranean with consequent bad weather, accompanied by rain over the
                        Delta. Pressure was on the whole above normal, and temperature was below it
                        nearly everywhere in Egypt and and the Sudan.</p>
                    <p>Except at Port Said where there was a slight defect, rainfall in northern
                        Egypt was much above the usual amount for the month. The Sudan, however,
                        where usually a few showers fall, showed a marked deficiency except at
                        Roseires. At the latter station 33 mm. fell in place of the normal 8.7
                        mm.</p>
                    <p>The Nile showed a slight improvement in the Sudan towards the middle of the
                        month, in consequence of the rains in Abyssinia, but afterwards fell away
                        from the mean levels towards the end.</p>

                    <dateline>LIMASSOL, December 3.</dateline>
                    <p>Terrifigales and rains have visited this Island during the last fortaight.
                        Much havoc was caused in many parts by the visitation of a windstorm of
                        unusual fury which broke over the Island uprooting trees, breaking down huge
                        branches, damaging roofs and in various ways causing loss to owners of
                        property. The rain storm of last week was the most severe that Cyprus has
                        known for many years. Floods occurred in a number of localities and losses
                        have resulted to farmers and gardeners both in regard to their crops and
                        their live stook.</p>
                    <p>The railway too suffered no little damage from the washing away of
                        embankments, and the displacing of sleepers. The passengers by the afternoon
                        train from Nicosia to Famagusta on Friday the 29th, had a series of
                        unpleasant experiences, which luckily terminated so far satisfactorily,
                        inasmuch as they reached the port in time for the weekly mail steamer. It
                        was doubtful until the last moment whether the train would be able to get
                        through, and had it not been for the resourcefulness and energy of Mr. P. P.
                        Higgins, the Superintendent of the Locomotive Department, who himself
                        proceeded up the line and took personal charge of the engine and succeeded
                        in piloting it safely across the most damaged portion of the permanent way,
                        it is improbable that the train would have reached its destination.</p>
                    <p>Among the passengers were Mr. Justice and Mrs., Miss and Master Leo Parker,
                        who were leaving for England before proceeding to their new home in the
                        Leeward Islands. Mr. Parker had been fêted to an unprecedented extent for
                        some little time before his departure and after seventeen years' service in
                        the Island he must have felt gratified by the many friendly dinners and
                        farewell meetings held in his honour. Not only did his brother officials
                        testify in this manner to their regret at his departure, but also
                        representative members of each section of the community. The dinner given on
                        the 27th by members of the English Club in Nicosia was attended by His
                        Excellency the High Commissioner and was of a specially enthusiastic
                        charaeter. On leaving the club the carriage in which he returned home was
                        drawn for a considerable distance by members of the club.</p>
                    <p>Some very bad passages have been made lately by the SS. "Salamis" while
                        fulfilling her weekly mail service. Last week the state of the sea would not
                        allow her to take on passengers or cargo at Limassol on her arrival; but as
                        the wind and sea abated she returned to Limassol from Famagusta before
                        crossing back to Port Said. Every week full cargoes of cattle, sheep and
                        pigs are shipped for Egypt, but a very poor time they have of it in bad
                        weather, and the proportion which die en-route cannot be insignificant.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Stanley Fisher, President of the District Court, Kyrenia, returned from
                        leave last week. Mr. and Mrs. W. Chaplin, of Perapedia, have also arrived
                        back in the Island.</p>

                        <byline>(From Our Own CORRESPONDANT.)</byline>
                        <dateline>Beyrout, December 4th. </dateline>
                        <p>The recent wheat riot in Beyrout, which resulted in the prohibition of
                            the exportation of wheat, barley and dariseed, was followed by other
                            more moderate demonstrations. On shipments of wheat being stopped the
                            prices naturally fell down further as the wheat merchants feared a
                            recrudescence of the minatory spirit of the mob. The various millers,
                            who own steam-mills and deal at the same time in wheat, naturally
                            resented this manner in which the tables were turned upon them and
                            struck, refusing to grind any wheat on hire and even to sell any of
                            their flour in stock, and the poor public found itself again in the same
                            impasse. It was then that the Municipality interfered officially.
                            Several municipal officials were given a sudden order to seize several
                            of the bread stalls and had the loaves weighed when they found an
                            enormous deficiency in the weight. The breadsellers were of course fined
                            and then a municipal notice was published in the local papers to the

                            then piastres 4 per two okes of extra flour and corresponding prices for
                            the lower qualities, he would be handed over to the authorities to
                            receive the punishment provided for by the law. This measure did not
                            have its full effect for prices of flour of extra quality continue to
                            range between piastres 5 and 5½. </p>

                        <head>The Hedjaz Railway.</head>
                        <p>The Hedjaz Railway affords a refutation of the widespread belief in the
                            refractoriness of Turkey to reform and the assimilation of modern
                            methods of administration. The Sovereign has only to keep a vigilant eye
                            and make his subordinates realize the earnestness of the Imperial wish
                            for honest work and energy and the undertaking, however vast it may be,
                            more or less will be properly carried out. The Hedjaz Railway has since
                            its inception been fortunate enough to enlist the constant sympathy of
                            the Sultan and the results have belied the pessimistic predictions that
                            had been made universally about it, even by men of great experience and
                            foresight. Every day we have proofs of the continuation of this vigilant
                            interest on the part of the Imperial head of this colossal undertaking,
                            and this interest acts as a marvellous mainspring of inspiration to a
                            composite body addicted by heredity and habit to the loosest form of
                            administration. And to afford a constant proof and reminder of the
                            Sultan's close interest and earnest wish, the puissant instrumentality
                            of the Press in the Empire is brought to bear on the subject. Every
                            order, action or event touching the "Grand Line” is communicated
                            officially to the different papers for insertion, and the following are
                            some that have recently appeared : –</p>
                        <p>Some of the Government officials in various departments at the capital
                            have been entrusted with the supplementary duties of lending assistance
                            and exercising control over the financial operations of the railway, and
                            three Moslem sanitary doctors have been added to the staff on the line
                            to treat such of the working soldiers as may succumb to illness. A
                            special Irade has been promulgated enjoining upon these sanitary doctors
                            the discharge of their duties in the most strict and conscientious
                            manner under penalty of severe punishment.</p>
                        <p>The same Irade includes the ordering of, 3000 cloaks and other wearing
                            apparel for the soldiers working on the line. The Sultan seems to take
                            interest in every detail, and his devotion to this pet scheme may be
                            called paternal.</p>
                        <p>Another recent Irade grants Meissner Pasha, the capable and indefatigable
                            German engineer and director of the construction works, a monthly
                            allowance of £tq. 50 in addition to his salary. This allowance shall
                            continue to be paid after the Pasha's death to his legal heirs. Every
                            effort is being done to push the work vigorously and reach with the
                            least possible loss of time the terminal parts. A thousand soldiers
                            selected from the Imperial Guard and other regiments have lately been
                            added to the number of soldiers engaged in the embankment works. Some of
                            this increased number is destined to fill the gaps occasioned by the
                            elimination of sick soldiers. The progress indeed is so rapid and the
                            near completion of the line is so sanguinely anticipated that the High
                            Commission at Constantinople already contemplates the ordering of the
                            rolling stock to be employed between Medina and Mecca.</p>

                        <p>A Imperial Irade has been issued for the drawing of the waters of Ain
                            Saffra to Al Medina in iron pipes. This together with the project of the
                            lighting by electricity of the Prophet's Sanctuary at the "Luminous
                            City" constitute a rather bold though commendable departure and a
                            tendency towards a slow breaking of the barrier that has so far
                            jealously guarded the sacred towns, changeless throngh the centuries, in
                            their antique garb of early Islamic traditions pure and intact. </p>

                        <p>A special committee has recently been formed to study and report upon the
                            project of a motor service between Alexandretta and Baghdad with branch
                            routes to Aleppo and Moussaul. The motor cars' capacity is to accomodate
                            sixteen passengers. One cannot help feeling rather sceptical about the
                            ultimate materialization of this scheme for many reasons, the most
                            potent of which is the probable opposition of the Baghdad Railway. Can
                            this be meant as a threat to be used to advantage by the Porte in future
                            difficulties.</p>

                        d'avis qnant à la situation de l'article Il n'en est rien pour le moment,
                        mais si au fond notre sentiment reste pour la baisse, cela ne nous empêche
                        pas, ne fat-ce que comme question de principe, de constater sans parti pris
                        la réalité des choses et cette réalité est que pour cette semaine la fermeté
                        a constamment prédominé et que les moments de faiblesse passagère qui ont
                        été enregistrés n'ont eu d'autres causes que le désir de réaliser</p>
                    <p>Le revers de la médaille à cela est que le commerce continue à ne se
                        présenter sur le marché que comme vendeur, confirmant de la sorte
                        l'information que nous n'avons fait que soutenir depuis plusieurs semaines,
                        à savoir que la demande manque de la part de la filature; mais si jusqu'ici
                        cela est vrai, il n'en est pas moins positit, d'autre part, que les
                        sollicitations d'offres commencent à devenir plus nombreu ses et plus
                        fréquentes. Cela ne veut pas dire qu'à coup sûr nous allons assister à un
                        prochain réveil de la demande, car la filature pourrait bien continuer à
                        afficher la prétention de vouloir acheter les éloignés aux mêmes cours qne
                        le disponible, mais les engagements très moderés de nos exportateurs pour
                        les livraisons à partir de janvier feraient croire à la probabilité de ce
                        réveil.</p>
                    <p>Toutefois, à notre avis, il ne faut pas s'attendre à des miracles, car par le
                        Continent on commenced employer les bons américains, qui sont abondants, en
                        remplacement de l'égyptien, pour certains articles, et cette circonstance
                        pourrait bien limiter le réveil éventuel de la demande, dont nous venons de
                        parler, aux seules qualités fines. Nous signalons simplement la chose. Quant
                        aux autres atouts en faveur des haussiers, ils consistent anjourd'hui dans
                        la qnestion des exportations et dans celles de la qcalité.</p>
                    <p>Sur le premier point il n'y a encore aucun signe de diminution marquée pour
                        s'y baser, mais il y a une telle unanimité dans l'assertion que, sauf
                        pouvelles affaires, il y aura réduction dans nos embarquements après la
                        seconde semaine de Décembre, qu'on est bien forcé de croire qu'il y a un
                        fond de vrai dans ce qui se dit. Rappelons à cette occasion que Décembre de
                        l'ann'e dernière a été de 156.000 balles, chiffre qui, pour cette année du
                        moins, semble devoir maintenir le record.</p>
                    <p>Pour ce qui est de la qnalité, nous avons déjà expliqué que le véritable
                        point dur serait pour le consommateur ; mais, pour ce qui est des contrats,
                        la poeition sans être très aisée, serait en tous cas, beaucoup moins grave.
                        Ajoutons encore que vulgairement l'on dit que fante de grives on mange des
                        merles "et, partant, il est à croire que si le bon Mit Affifi devait être
                        rare, on pourrait bien tomber sur le Goodtair et sur les provevances
                        Haute-Egypte pour les besoins indispensables en Egyptiens pour le reste de
                        la campagne. – Ce sont des points aussi à ne pas perdre de vue.</p>
                    <p>Pour revenir au marché, disons maintenant que la clôture de la semaine aen
                        lien à 1919 32 pour le Janvier et 20 15/32 pour le Mars, que le maximum des
                        cours a été pratique Mercredi et a été de 1923/32 pour le premier mois et 20
                        19/32 pour le second ; qu'en outro l'activité. malgré quelques accalmies, a
                        été satisfaisante dans son ensemble et que la tendance semble bonne. On
                        s'est occupé un peu plus du Novembre 1908 ; quand même les affaires n'y sont
                        guère nombreuses. Le dernier prix affiché pour cette échéance est de 19
                        31/32.</p>
                    <p>L'Alexandria General Produce Association a publié son résumé de Novembre. Au
                        fond il ne vous apprend rien de nouveau et la seule modification consiste
                        dans l'estimation de la récolte qui, au lieu de 6 3/4 à 7 millions de
                        Cantars, est donné maintenant comme étant de 6.750.000'environ Cela n'a
                        l'air de rien, mais en somme l'idée de 6 3/4 minimum semble exclue par cette
                        nouvelle évaluation. Tout le monde n'est pas satisfait et aux entêtés qui
                        tiennent pour 6 1/2 maximum, on peut opposer ceux qui penchent pour les 7
                        millions et nous somthes du nombre. Toutefois, si nong noye trompons, nous
                        en serons quitte pour reprocher l'erreur à nos amis particuliers qui nous
                        renseignent,</p>
                    <p>Les nouvelles du dehors ne nous ont pas manqué: Wall Street, dans la crainte
                        d'un mauvais Bureau, continue à acheter, tandis que Price, que l'on dit en
                        train de vendre, donne comme pronostic 12 000.000 Balles. Miss Giles, de son
                        côté, a lancé son estimation de 12.100.000 Batles. La date du 10 n'est pas
                        éloignée et ce jour-là nous serons fixés sur les idées du Bureau</p>
                    <p>On signale de New York, de source très<cb n="2"/> sérieuse, et contrairement
                        à des assertions spéculatives, que la filature ne montre aucun intérêt au
                        mouvement de hausse actuel et il paraitrait que l'industrie cotonnière aux
                        EtatsUnis a été beaucoup plus touchée qu'on ne le pensait par la crise
                        financière. Mais comme les choses semblent s'arranger sérieusement de ce
                        côté-là, il est à espérer que la filature américaine aussi ne tardera pas à
                        mieux marcher qu'elle ne le fait actuellement.</p>
                    <p>Ce qui est regrettable seulement, c'est que de New York on ait annoncé un
                        nouveau renchérissement de la prime sur l'or et une nouvelle faillite d'une
                        Bar que avec 24,000,000 de dollars de passif. Certes cela ne signifie pas
                        qne les choses vont de nouveau mal, mais on aurait préféré rester sous
                        l'impression que tout était déhnitivement fini du côté des fail. lites.</p>
                    <p>Par contre, les dépêches nous ont annoncé hier le règlement de la question de
                        la grève à Oldham.</p>
                    <p>Tant mieux. --- Cette solution favorable ne changera 'en rien l'état des
                        choses, mais, elle évite une crise au coton dont le besoin, d'ailleurs, ne
                        se faisait nullement sentir. .</p>
                    <p>Notre marché do disponible a été plas actif et d'une façon générale les
                        acheteurs se sont intéressés à toutes les qualités. A signaler cependant le
                        fait que, tandis que les classements supériegrs ont suivi la hausse des
                        contrats, les qualités de fully fair et au-dessous ont baissé et ceci
                        s'applique tout aussi bien au Mit Affifi qu'aux provenances Haute Egypte Ce
                        dernier genre aussi attire un peu plus l'attention des exportateurs.</p>
                    <p>Quant aux différences relevées de la cote officielle elles consistent en une
                        hausse de 1/4 à 1/2 tallari pour les deux genres suementionnés, tandis que
                        pour les variétés les prix restent sans changeinent pour l'Abassi, en hausse
                        de 1/4 pour le Joannovich et de 1/2 tallari pour le Nubari. .</p>
                    <p>Les exportations de la semaine ont atteint le chiffre très satisfaisant de
                        38.000 balles, contre 41.700 pour la même période en 1906.</p>
                    <p>La semaine prochaine sera forte aussi, quoi. que d'après nous elle restera
                        inférieure à la semaine correspondante de l'année passée qui a été de 43000
                        balles.</p>
                    <p>Liverpool a été plus actif pour les égyptiens disponibles, mais sans
                        changement pour le spot qui reste à 10 18.</p>
                    <p>Les futurs Janvier, par contre, gagnent 7/64 à la cote de 9 61/64.</p>
                    <p>Les américains aussi ont eu un marché très animé, avec des ventes atteignant
                        jusqu'à 18000 balles, et pour ce qui est des prix, la hausse a consisté en
                        17 points pour le spot, 15 et 13 pour les futurs, respectivement cotés ce
                        soir à 6.35 pour le premier et 6 pour le janvier février et le
                        mars-avril</p>
                    <p>Graines de Coton</p>
                    <p>Les arrivages ont été supérieurs à ceux de l'année dernière et quoique les
                        exportations soient restées dans le cas opposé, les prix n'en ont pas inoins
                        été très fermes, pour finir à P.T. 70 pour le spot.</p>
                    <p>En contrats, la situation est toujours la même, soit peu d'affaires, mais
                        cours sontenus. La dernière cote est de P.T. 72 1 2 pour le Décembre Janvier
                        et 75 20'40 pour le FévrierMars. Il y a un peu d'élargissement dans le
                        report.</p>
                    <p>Hull s'était tenu calme pour nos graines, mais depuis hier il y a fermeté et
                        amélioration dans l'article, fait que l'on attribue aux achats de la
                        spéculation. En tous cas, la cote aujourd'hui est de £ 6. 16/3-6.17/6 pour
                        DécembreJanvier</p>
                    <p>Huiles et tourteaux continuent i être calmes, tandis que Bombay ne signale
                        aucun changement de prix.</p>

                    <p>RÉSUMÉ DES REPONSES REÇUES EN NOVEMBRE 1907 </p>
                    <p>La température en Novembre, à l'exception des derniers dix jours du mois, a
                        été favorable aux cotonniers, mais par suite du peu de coton qui restait à
                        cueillir, les effets de cette circonstance sur le résultut total de la
                        récolte n'ont en que pen d'importance.</p>
                    <p>La troisième cueillette a été irrégulière : bonne dans quelques districts,
                        son rendement n été médiocre et inêine insignifiant dans les antres.</p>
                    <p>Le rendement l'igrenage s'est maintenu de 1 à 2 % supérieur à celui de
                        l'année passée.</p>
                    <p>Ces renseignements sont légèrement moins bons que ceux de fin Octobre et, par
                        consé. quent, nous croyons devoir modifier notre pré. cédente évaluation de

                        <p>L'allure de lundi a été dans l'ensemble très satisfaisante avec un
                            courant d'affaires assez facile et suivi, anns que pourtant elle ait
                            rien présenté de bien saillant à signaler. On était favorablement
                            impressionné par la hausse du coton et la baisse rapide da taux privé
                            d'escompte.</p>
                        <p>Notre marché a eu le lendemain le même aspect ; les vendeurs s'étant pour
                            la plupart retirés dans l'attente de meilleurs prix, les hauseiers en
                            ont profité pour pousser les cours et ils y ont parfaitement réussi.
                            L'attention s'est concentrée en National Bank, Agricole, Crédit Franco
                            Egyptien, Land Bank, Comptoir, Levico, Helouan et Ordinary Khedivial
                            Mail. Il s'agissait en général de demande sans contre-partie. En
                            definitive les affaires n'ont eu aucune importance relativement aux
                            oscillations de la cote.</p>
                        <p>Mereredi, après une ouverture bruyante inais pauvre en transactions,
                            leton aperdu de sa fermeté en cours de lance et kon a clature dans un
                            ealme plat. A s'en rapporter à la cote, on aurait pu croire à une
                            activité remarquable; malheureusement, comme nous venons de le
                            constater, les cours étaient en général nominaux, inscrits en fin de
                            séance au milieu d'un tapage assourdissant d'intéressée. En valeurs
                            dirigeantes la tenue a été inégale, l'Agricole et la Delta Light étant
                            fermes, tandis que la National Bank était offerte.</p>
                        <p>Il est difficile de caractériser le marché d'hier: Les échanges étaient
                            presque aula faute de vendeurs, disait-on, et cependant il se dégageait
                            de l'ensemble un sentiment de lourdeur et de lassitade ; aussi gerait-il
                            plus exact à notre avis de dire que d'un côté les acheteurs, s'ils
                            existent, ne montrent encore que peu d'empressement et que de l'autre
                            les vendeurs de naguère à moitié rassurés par la reprise de ces derniers
                            jours et par la baisse continue du taux d'escompte, attendent de
                            meilleurs prix pour liquider.</p>
                        <p>Enfin, l'annonce que la Banque d'Angleterre ne réduirait pas son taux
                            d'escompte à cause de la demande d'or américaine a eu ce matin sa
                            répercussion sur notre place où l'on s'attendait généralement à cette
                            réduction, pour aider la reprise. Comme hier la corbeille était morne ;
                            on ne faisait rien ou à peu près, au point qu'une demande ou une offre
                            insignifiantes ont suffi occasionner des oscillations disproportionnées
                            faute de contre-partie. En somme, c'était un marché restreint, sans rien
                            de saillant. Il y a eu pourtant quelques affaires en Agricole, Delta
                            Light, Dafra et Union Foncière. L'Aboukir, qui était demandée sous
                            vendeurs et cela depuis quelques jours, était offerte aujourd'hui. Les

                    <p>“Having tried many remedies for chronic catarrh of the bronchial tubes, and
                        not receiving any benefit, I began to think there was no help for me until I
                        began to use Peruna.</p>
                    <p>"In a short time the bronchial tubes began to clear, I did not have that
                        "frog in my throat' continually, my voice was not nearly so husky, and the
                        wheezing noise disappeared.</p>
                    <p>"I was soon able to believe that I was entirely free from catarrh, and as
                        this was several months ago, I do not believe that it will return."</p>

                    <p>"I can heartily recommend Perunal for catarrh of the stomach. I had tried
                        many things which did me no good and as last resort I got a bottle of
                        Peruna. </p>
                    <p>"I only regret that I did not try it before I forced so much bad stuff into
                        my stomach. It has entirely cured me and as a preventative I always keep a
                        bottle in the house.</p>

                    <p>Mrs. Wm. Hohmann, 560 N. Paulina St., Chicago, Ill., writes : </p>
                    <p>"I suffered with catarrh of the bronchial tubes and had a terrible cough ever
                        since a child. When a child it was supposed to be whooping cough or the
                        croup, but as I got older it got worse. </p>
                    <p>"After a while it got so bad I had to cough both winter and summer. Finally I
                        burst a blood vessel in my throat from the strain of conghing, next a blood
                        vessel in my stomach, so I kept getting worse and doctoring, and even then
                        could get no relief. </p>
                    <p>"I went to a dispensary for trestment, but it all done me no good. At night I
                        could never lie on my back. I would sit up until two or three o'clock in the
                        morning before I could close my eyes. Then of course, I thonght, and
                        everybody else that I had consumption.</p>
                    <p>"Reading the papere about Porus I decided to try it without the least hope
                        that it would do me any good. But after taking three bottles I noticed a
                        change. My appetite got better, so I kept on, never got discouraged.</p>
                    <p>"Now I can lie on my back and sleep all night, and you may well think how
                        thankful I am for Peruna."</p>

                        Illinois Woman's Alliance, writes:</p>
                    <p>"During the past year I gradually lost flesh and strength until I was unable
                        to perform my work properly. I tried different remedies, and finally Peruna
                        was suggested to me.</p>

                        few of them really understand. It it simply weakness—a break-down, as it
                        were, of the vital forces that sustain the system. No matter what may be its
                        causes (for they are almost numberless), its symptoms are much the same; the
                        more prominent being sleeplessness, sense of prostration or weariness,
                        depression of spirits and want of energy for all the ordinary affairs of
                        life. Now, what alone is absolutely essential in all such cases is increased
                        vitality—vigour--</p>
                    <p>VITAL STRENGTH &amp; ENERGY</p>
                    <p>to throw off these morbid feelings, and experience proves that as night
                        succeeds the day this may be more certainly secured by a course of the
                        celebrated life-reviving tonic</p>
                    <p>THERAPION No.3</p>
                    <p>than by any other known combination. So surely as it is taken in accordance
                        with the printed directions accompanying it, will the shattered health be
                        restored,</p>
                    <p>THE EXPIRING LAMP OF LIFE LIGHTED UP AFRESH,</p>
                    <p>and a new existence imparted in place of what had so lately seemed worn-out,
                        "used up,” and valueless. This wonderful medicament is purely vegetable and
                        innocuous, is agreeable to the taste —suitable for all constitutions and
                        conditions, in either sex; and it is difficult to imagine a case of disease
                        or derangement, whose main features are those of debility, that will not be
                        speedily and permanently benefited by this never-failing recuperative
                        essence, which is destined to cast into oblivion everything that had
                        preceded it for this wide-spread and numerous class of human ailments.</p>
