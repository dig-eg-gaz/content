                    <p>London, November 10. Mr. Balfour, speaking at the Guildhall, made a long
                        statement on the question of the unemployed. He dwelt on the difficulty
                        finding a remedy which wonld not do more harm than good. He appealed to the
                        benevolent support of the pablic, especially those present of aid the
                        Governmeut in the employment he means at its disposal. After having
                        mentioned the appearacoe Japan among the Great Powers he spoke of the
                        internal condition of Russia, and express- ed the hope that the future will
                        not be sullied by the horrible soenes whioh have marked the beginning of the
                        movement in the direction of self-government. He afterwards spoke of the
                        efforts of Great Britain in the oonne of the last ten years to make war
                        impossible, and to develop the field if arbitration. He remarked that now
                        there is no question of a frontier in Afrioa or else- where which might give
                        rise to misundersUnt ngs. He has the firm hope that we shall see 10 war in
                        the fntnre except some ruler should arise to trample on the rights for bis
                        own aggran disement. There is no pro-prot of such a calalamity falling upon

                    <p>To the Editor or thr Egyptian Gaxbtte Sir,—Your leading artiole on
                        Alexandria’s water supply in yesterday’s issue of the "Gssetta" was an
                        exoelknt pieoe of special pleading for that altroiitio and most phil-
                        anthropic ooncern known as the Alexandria Water. Company, limited. As a
                        matter of fact, however, there were some inaoonraoies, all of which possibly
                        nnoonscionsly were to the advantage of the oompany. In the first place, I
                        should be obliged if you will permit me to point oat that at the time the
                        Alexandria Municipality first attempted to exercise come supervision over
                        the company, it was discover- ed that the ktter were charging the doable of
                        what they were legally entitled to for a girbeh of water. The result was
                        that the poor native who took hk water from the "homes fontainee" bad to pay
                        mnob more than his more fortonste brethren, who oonld afford to subscribe
                        for a permanent supply of water. The Municipality pot a stop to this
                        extortion in the interests of the public. The question of the meters and the
                        monthly subscription were gone into soon sfterwards,and the tariff, whioh is
                        still in vigoor for sn un- limited supply of water, was then arranged. This
                        reform was duo to the Municipality. There is an omission in the article of
                        the name of Amin I aaha Fikry, one of the best Governors Alexandria ever
                        bad, who, during the short time he was Governor, contributed greatly to the
                        work of coming to an agreement with the oompany. The original oontnot was
                        that the Municipality should pay three quarters and the oompany one quarter,
                        with a maximum of LE 10,000: Subsequently the Municipality arranged that
                        they should give a lump sum of LE. 60,00 and that the company should provide
                        the balance. The construction of the filters has been admirably carried out,
                        and this balance paid by the company has exceeded to a certain extent the LB
                        10,000 calculated upon.—Truly, yours. Alexandrian. Alexaadria, November

                    <p>One of the questions, whioh will have to be settled soon, ia that of the new
                        theatre at Alexandria whioh is to take the plaoe of the Zinnia, which has
                        only a short time to ran before its demolition. The idea prevailing among
                        the leading lights of the Alexandria pkygoen is that tha Municipality should
                        give the site for a new theatre free, and that it should be bnilt by looal
                        capitalists and beoome the property of the Maniaq>*lity after the capital
                        has been amortised. Great divergenoy of opinion exists, firstly, as to what
                        site should be asked for, and second, ly, what sum should be spent on the
                        bnilding. Some ardent pttronc of tha drama want a bnilding of the paktial
                        character of the Paris Grand Opera, while others think £40,CC0 to £60,000
                        wonld be quite sufficient to spend on saoh a bnilding. Owing to these
                        conflicting opinions, to far no application has been to the Municipality,
                        which is, we believe, quite disposed to favorably oonsider any reasonable
                        proposals that may be made.</p>

                        from Bros roll on the 1st March, 1901, on a walking tonr round the world for
                        a wager. Gerard was to have completed his journey to three yean, bnt be was
                        stricken down with fever in Shanghai and had consequently to return to
                        Franoe to reonperate. and tiros lost the bet. He it, however, sn
                        indefatigable traveller, and was not long to Franoe before he staited on his
                        peregrinations again, so that he has been globe trotting more or lees for
                        the last 4 1/2 years, and has more than oomp'eted the tons of the world. The
                        countries ha has visited on his travels are Bulgaria, Germany, Denma k,
                        Norway, Swoden, Finland, Russia, Siberia, Korea, Japan, Chins, Cochin China,
                        India, Franoe, Spain, Portugal England, Sootland, Ireknd, Canada, United
                        States, Mexioo, Cuba. From Cuba he returned to Borope, visiting Luxemburg,
                        Switzerland, Italy, Spain again, Moroooo, Algeria, Toni, Tripoli Malta, and
                        on to Alexandria, where he gives a Jeoture this evening describing his
                        experiences, at the Cerole de 1’Union Artisti- que Francaise, S.
                        Stambonl-street, at 8.00 p.m. M. Gerard left Brunets without a penny in hk
                        pocket and k solely dependent on the aesiftaaoe which be U Lhk to obtain
                        through describing hk experiences to the various places be visits. He will
                        particularly treat the even- ing of Russia, Siberia, and Japan, on which the
                        eyes of the world have been fixed for some time past.</p>

                    <p>To THi Editor or thx Egyptian Gaottk. Sir,—Within the last few years, I note
                        with pleasure the increasing nse of the Ktglish kngusge in Egypt I have just
                        been (coking at a new periodioel entitled "The Oriental Truth,” whioh, the
                        editoT says, will ha ran entirely on American lines, and of which the first
                        part k written in what appean at first wight to he English. I do not find
                        any fault with the editor's ideas, and some of the articles are interesting
                        and cheerful hat many of the words he usee on every page are so utterly st
                        variance with three to be found to any English dictionary, that I am led to
                        suppose that the language as well as the lines on whioh the paper is to be
                        run is American. I regret to say that I have but a very alight acquaintance
                        with current American periodics literature, but if this is a specimen of it,
                        our langnage must be fast approaching a line of oleavage ; some such
                        nnoomfortable position as that of Sweden snd Norway. If this fa the care, I
                        wish to ray that the experience of many years in thk oopntry leads me fo
                        think that one of the hardens onder which it kbours k doe to the excessive
                        num- ber of languages used here, and I should like to ask the editor of "The
                        Oriental Truth" to pause and reflect for a little while before he inflicts
                        another on a long-suffering, hot already over-laden community.—I am, etc,

                    <head>THE SAHARAN OCEAN . AN IMPORTANT SCHEME</head>
                    <p>It wonld not.be a very, difficult undertaking to oonvert the great depression
                        of the Sahara into an inland ocean, as once it. was. Such a scheme is
                        already being mooted, and talk is sometimes the prelude to action. It is
                        reckoned that the depression comes up nearest to the sea midway between the
                        twentieth and thirti- eth parallels of latitude on the Atlantic tide, and
                        that a canal sixty miles in length would flood the whole interior with salt
                        water. The result would be both good, and bad. It wonld open op an immense
                        region to shipping communication, and there would be many large islands
                        still above wator-level. It would also obliterate vast realms of barbarism.
                        On the other hand, the vineyards of Southern Europe, which depend much on
                        the hot, dry winds from the African desert, would suffer severely, many even
                        to destruction.</p>

                    <head>THE DAM'S WATER POWER.</head>
                    <p>A curious photograph has been sent home by the engineers of Meseit. John Aird
                        to illustrate the surprising liftirgpower of flowing water, as illustrated
                        by the efffete of water pouring from the aluices of the Nile Dam at Arsonan.
                        The dam sometimes holds up a height of 60ft. of water, but the aluices are
                        of different heights, and give the stream that pours through them a head of
                        no more than 3fft and therefore a velocity of little toon than 30fL a
                        second. Yet the discharge has been able to lift a blook of quarts 17ft -by
                        12ft. by 7 ft., and weighing approximately 60 tone, and fling it took, head
                        over heels, as it Were, on to the masonry of the dam. Such occur- rences are
                        not rare-on sea-walk, where there : is an impact of storm-driven waves. At
                        Wick Harbour, for example, to 1872 a monolith weighing 1,870 tons was lilted
                        fay the wave* and later, when thk had been replaced by one of 9,610 tone,
                        the heavier stood was also washed- away. But at Assouan the impelling force
                        was only running water.</p>
