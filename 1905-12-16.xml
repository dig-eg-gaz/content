                    <p>THE EXTERMINATION OF THE MOSQUITO.</p>
                    <p>The articles and letters which have appeared recently in this journal under the above heading have given rise to much discussion as to the possibility of attempting in Egypt an organised crusade against the mosquito. That a really honest attempt to exterminate the mosquito and its attendant evils can be crowned with success has, as our correspondents point out, been demonstrated by experience in Singapore, Saigon, Salangor, Sierra Leone, New Orleans, and many other places. We would point out however, that although individuals may do much to protect their own homes and prevent them from becoming bleeding grounds for the larvae, to ensure success it is absolutely necessary to have the crusade carried out continuously and efficiently. It is not sufficient merely to kill the mosquitoes and their larvae one week and then neglect attending to their breeding haunts for another week.</p>
                    <p>Another one of the insect plagues of Egypt also might be considerably decreased-that of the common or garden house fly. Up the Nile especially, it is said that much of the ophthalmia is caused by these flies carrying infection from one to another. An expert entomologist might possibly be able to advise some method of dealing on a large scale with these pests. It has also often struck us as strange that in the large hotels in Egypt no attempt has been made to exclude insects by wire and netting and fine mesh screenings over windows and doors, the system adopted in America. Were this method carried out it would be possible to do away with mosquito nets for beds. That the present discussion has at least drawn attention to the possibility of combating the nuisance of the almost ubiquitous mosquito there is no doubt. Time, however, will show whether the carrying out of the destruction of the larvae on a wholesale scale will be attempted now or whether, like New Orleans, Egypt must wait until it is a choice between exterminating mosquitoes or the latter exterminating myriads of men.</p>
                    <p>It is unlikely, of course, that Egypt will ever be face to face with an epidemic of yellow fever, yet malaria we have always with us, and other diseases are known to be carried by the mosquito and the fly. It has been tritely said that we owe many diseases to their spreading by dirt, man, and the fly. The first we can remove, the second must remain, but in America they say "the fly must get." The climate of Egypt and the topography of the country lends itself to the successful accomplishment of at least ridding us in some measure of the mosquito. But as we stated above it is absolutely essential that the matter be not left entirely to individual or private enterprise, as the crusade to be effectual must be always at work. The organisation for each town must have the co-operation of the European community at least to have any means of success. Every house would have to be visited at least once a week until headway was made against the pest. All people interested would have to draw attention to the existence and persistence of mosquitoes in their locality. Wherever there was a fresh outbreak or recrudescence of the nuissance there would the vultures have to be gathered together. By swooping down on each place where mosquitoes were known to exist, in a very short time the numbers would be so enormously decreased as to convince the most pessimistic sanitary repressing neophyte that it was possible to do much to remove what is at present equally a menace to the health of the community as it is at all times a source of annoyance and discomfort.</p>

                    <p>Count von Bulow again asserted at length Germany's innocence of aggressive plans against England. He denied that Germany had ever been on the point of declaring war on Great Britain. The cause of the present crisis in the relations between the two countries is a mystery. Such stories as that of a violent collision between the Emperor and King Edward were idiotic lies. He vigorously attacked the Social-Democrats, whose constant representations of Germany as a disturbe of the peace have contributed to the present British mistrust of Germany.</p>	<p>(Reuter)</p>

                    <p>The imports into Egypt daring last month show a decline on those during the corresponding month of 1904. This decrease amounts to L.E. 477.784. But the total increase of imports for the eleven months of the year from January to November is LE. 1,049,916. Great Britain shared in the general falling-off of imports last month, importing only L.E. 557,164 worth of goods as against L.E. 829 858 for the previous November. But in the general increase of imports daring the eleven months Great Britain’s increased imports amount to L.E. 6,115,594, as against L.E. 6,045,234 for the same period in 1904.</p>
                    <p>More than half of the decrease in, imports for last month is due to the falling-off in textiles, which show a decrease of L.E. 267,365 on the corresponding month of last year.</p>

                    <p>We understand that Mr. Glymenopoulo is in the best of health, but is taking a week or two of repose before settling down thoroughly to business again. He is, nevertheless, attending daily to the interests and welfare of the company.</p>

                    <p>Our Beyrout Correspondent writes :-We have had quite an exciting time lately owing to the international naval demonstration. At one time there was actually a slight panic, a few families leaving for the Lebanon. The Porta's covert menace was. of course, calculated to cause some apprehension among the Christians, but what caused most fear was the massing of troops, estimated by some at 8 battalions, and the arrival of 3 batteries from Damascus. As a matter of fact the troops and guns are being sent to reinforce the dwindling numbers of the Yemen Army. The losses during the campaign have been terrible, some say as much as 50 %. An eye-witness tells me that on the troops landing from a recently arrived transport from the Yemen on the quay at Beyrout several fell dead, and their general aspect was one of ineffable misery.</p>

                    <p>The trial of the persons accused of having taken part in Sunday’s riot will begin at 8 o'clock to-morrow morning at the Native Court in Rosetta-street, Alexandria.

The police have taken every precaution to avoid any disturbance in the neighbourhood of the Court and 40 policemen will be on duty there, besides a large number in reserve.</p>
                    <p>There are no grounds for believing that there will be any renewal of last Sunday’s disturbances tomorrow, but every precaution will be taken by the police in order to cops with any possible outbreak.</p>

                    <head>ZIZINIA THEATRE.</head>
                    <p>We were well entertained, though not intensely overwhelmed by Samsone e Dalilah, as produced last night at this theatre. The delicate and sentimental handling, which Saint-Saëns’ magnum opus demands, can be found only in artistes of exceptional calibre and in minutely trained choruses, and, although last night’s caste was strong, it can hardly be said to have entirely met the exigencies of the case. Signa. Bianca Lavin carried out the arduous role of Dalilah in a melodious and very conscientious fashion. Her singing throughout Act II. was remarkably well sustained and was pleasantly distinguished by sensibility and refinement, most of her low tones being exquisite; at the same time there was occasionally a barely perceptible shortage in compassing the high notes. In all other respects she made a highly creditable Dalilah. Sig. Luigi Longobardi’s Samson was rendered with technical fluency and clear articulation, but he might with advantage have infused his part with more warmth and vigor. Sig. Pasquale Amato, as the Chief Priest and Sig. C. Nicolay who impersonated the aged Habrew, lent valuable and adequate support. Both are pos essors of rich, crisp voices. The part of Abimelech was rather stiffly rendered by Sig. Ricceri, who. is too apt to mouth his music. The chorus, on whom so much depends, gave a rather varied display. After singing in well with the overture, they became rather pre-cipitate after the rise of the curtain; moreover, the women's voices were too liable to fall into harsh, shrill tones. The men were decidedly better and showed feeling. A softer, if stolid, utterance was accorded to the graceful chorus of Philistine women. In Act III. a far more tasteful effect was obtained, all singing in very good harmony. The orchestra was again under Sig. Zuccani's skilful direction. Here at all events no exception whatever can be taken. They gave significant expression to the tender and refined music, which is too well known and too warmly esteemed to call for further dis-cussion in these columns. A word should be said for the ballets, which created a far better impression than Aida. Signa. A. Verganti's pas seul was very satisfactory and calls for little comment, but we wished we could have seen more of Signa. Bracchi, whose steps are extremely light and graceful. The production was well staged. All things considered, we are inclined to look upon the performance as very pleasing, but certainly not on a level with  those to which the present opera company have hitherto accustomed us, and it suffered consequently by the comparison.</p>

                    <head>THE CAIRO SEASON.</head>
                    <head>PROSPECTS FOR ’XMAS WEEK.</head>
                    <p>Many people an already installed in the Ghezireh Palace Hotel and enjoying its lovely
                        position and delightful gardens.—so welcome after the dusty streets of Cairo. On Wednesday the band of the King’s Royal Rifles was playing there from 4 to 6, and attracted many listeners. On other days a Tzigane orchestra provides music at frequent intervals. Sir Hugh and Lady Smiley have taken up their quarters here, and Mr. and Mrs. Rom, with their family, have moved on here from Shepheard’s. Mr. Astley Johnstone, who has already spent so many winters at Ghezireh, has again returned with his motor, and Mr. Curphy has also brought his motor. Colonel and Mrs. R Gordon are here, and Major Hessey, of the 2nd Inniskilling Fusiliers, and Mrs. Hessey are making the hotel their headquarters. Among other visitors are :—Comte and Comtesse Krassicki, Major, Mrs, and Miss Burney, Mr. and Miss Jones, Mr and Mrs. Honould, from Johannesburg, and Mr. C. Banbury, from India.</p>
                    <p>There will be a small dance at the hotel one evening in ’Xmas week, and several luncheon and dinner patties are being arranged for Sunday. Seeing its vicinity to the race-course, the hotel will be certain of much patronage on the occasion of the second meeting next week. On Shrove Tuesday, February 27, arrangements are being made for the big fancy-dress ball which has always been such a success in former years.</p>
                    <p>There will be 'Xmas trees at both Shepheard's and the Mena House Hotel on 'Xmas Eve, and as many grown-up’s as children are looking forward to that day. On ’Xmas evening there will be a gathering at the Hotel du Nil, when another tree will be in evidence.</p>
                    <p>Up to the present there have been but few social events to chronicle this season, but after this week we hope for better things. There is already “in the air” the expectation of ’Xmas, and if we cannot spend it in the old time honored English fashion, by our own fireside and among the children, we mean to do our best to celebrate the occasion.</p>
                    <p>There will be numerous small dances at the various hotels, and most people are making arrangements for cheery dinners at either one or the other.</p>
                    <p>Next week we have two days’(Wednesday and Friday) racing to anticipate at the Khedi vial Sporting Club at Ghezireh, and many ladies will take the opportunity of showing how well their pretty frocks become them It is rather unfortunate that Wednesday should also happen to be the day chosen for the marriage of Miss Nungovich to Capt. Wilson, R.A.M.C. So many friends have been bidden to the wedding and the reception to be held afterwards at the Savoy, that the first day’s raring will suffer by their absence.</p>

                    <head>AUTOMOBILES IN EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>The number of automobiles in Egypt ex ceeds 170, of which 110 are at Cairo and 56 at Alexandria, and the increase in this industry of recent years has given occasion for an interesting article in the Bulletin of the French Chamber of Commerce of Alexandria. A great drawback to the development of the industry is the lack of roads, especially the want of a great highway between Cairo and Alexandria. Our confrére remarks :—</p>
                    <p>Nous saisissons avec empressement cette circonstance pour joindre nos instances à celles qni s'élèvent un peu de toute part dans le but de demander au Gouvernement Egyptien la création d'une route carrossable d’Alexandrie au Caire, route qui serait une véritable artère vers lsquelle viendrait converger tout un réseau d’autres voies desservant les nombreux villages de l'intérieur. C’est ainsi que des communications faciles s’établi-ranent entre toutes les localités de l’Egypte au grand avantage du commerce et des transactions.</p>
                    <p>Certes, on ne peut invequer la pénurie du trésor ; peu d’Etats présentement une situation aussi florissante au point de vue des finances ; c'est ainsi que le projet de budget pour 1'an prochain, déduction faite de dégrèvemente dont le montant dépasse L.E. 300,000. accuse un excédent de recettes évalué à L.E. 500,000, somme dont l’emploi, jusqu'a présent, n'est pas déterminé. Tant au point de vue commercial qu'à celui de l’objet que nous traitons, nous apprendrions avec grand plaisir qu'une partie de cet excédent sera consacré à une oeuvre de si grande utilité et dont les conséquences écono-miques seraient incalculables pour la fortune du pays.</p>
                    <p>Nous verrions alors apparaltre les grosses voitures.de touristes, les 80-100 chevaux, avec lesquelles les 210 kilomètres qui séparent Alexandrie du Cairo seraient parcourus en une seule traite avec possibilité de retour dans la même journée.</p>
                    <p>Les amateurs, ayant devant eux de grands espaces à parcourir, deviendraient bien plus nombreux, et l'importation des automobiles en Egypte prendrait un grand développement.</p>
                    <p>The first automobile in Egypt was a little Dion Bouton, purchased by Prince Aziz about fifteen years ago. French motors are preferred, especially the following makes, de Dion Bouton, Peugeot, Renault, Panhard Levassor, Clément-Bayard. Charron-Girardot-Voigt, Darracq, Cot-terean. There are 43 motorcycles in Cairo and 17 in Alexandria. Motor omnibuses are being tried by the Cairo Omnibus Company, which has imported two of the Dietrich type and the trials are now being made.</p>

                    <head>EGYPT EXPLORATION FUND.</head>
                    <head>LECTURE BY MR HALL.</head>
                    <p>An interesting lecture was given yesterday afternoon at the Grand Continental Hotel, Cairo, by Mr. Hall of the British Museum under the auspices of the Egypt Exploration Fund, of which Dr. Gerling Hayward is secretary in Egypt. The lecture dealt with a new XI. Dynasty temple discovered at Deir el'Bahri, and is the first of a series of four, one of which is to be given by Professor Naville and another by Dr. Grentell. After Capt Lyons had introduced Mr. Hall to his audience, the lecturer, with the aid of the magio-lantern, described the temple and its surroundings. After giving an interesting account of the great temple at Deir el Behri Thebes, he proceeded  to describe the new temple and showed how the pyramid above the royal tomb characteristic of the IV. Dynasty, with its small temple at the foot, had been superseded in XL Dynasty times by the temple, at some distance from the real tomb and acting as a sort of funeral chapel The new temple showed the last survival of the pyramid, a structure in the centre of the temple court with a base of about 60 feet square. He then described the various features of the temple, among them the tombs of ladies of the royal harem of King Neferkeprà of the XI dynasty, many of whom had been buried simultaneously before the completion of the temple, a fact that led certain Egyptologists to believe that they had been strangled after their lord’s death. The tomb of Neb-keper-rà with its 150 foot shaft next claimed attention, and then came illustrations of the most valuable find during the excavations. Among them was a magnificent alabaster head of the sacred cow of Hathor, a remarkable piece of realistic sculpture, its eye sockets still bearing traces of lapis lazuli. Then came the portrait statue of the grim-featured Usartesan III., the Se-sostris of the ancients, now in the Cairo Museum. The statue was found with five others, each representing the monarch at a different period of his life, on the S.-W. porch of the temple. The angular facial type wrongly supposed to be ’Hyksos’ appeared in the XII. and the latter half of the XI. Dynasty Pharaohs. Reliefs showed Bedouine of Sinai,yellow-skinned and hook-nosed, falling before the monarch's arrows, while the heads of Mentu-hotep, from his looks a relative of theUsertesens who established the XI.. Dynasty rule in Lower Egypt,andhis wife were most interesting. These kings, so said the lecturer, were certainly of Egyptian stock and their facial type could be recognised among the fellaheen of the present day. A relief on the royal sarcophagus showing a ferocious-looking fox dragging a half-fledged bird from its nest, a model combined bakery and brewery with its little life-like figures,which it was hoped would by some magical process come to life and bake and brew for his Majesty in the other world, were among the other discoveries and among the last but not the least interesting illustrations of the lecture was a photograph of a triangular piece of bread, solid and unappetising after more than 8,000 years, but retaining its smell of bread when first discovered. Other photographs showed the methods employed in digging and the men at work.</p>
                    <p>At 6.30 p.m. the lecture closed and Capt. Lyons paid Mr. Hall in the name of the audience a warm tribute of thanks.</p>

                    <p>Dear Mr. Ward-Your delightful and most interesting book on the Sudan has reached me. I congratulate you heartily on the excellent manner in which the work is written and illustrated. All of us who have done our little best to regenerate the country, after its terrible misfortunes, have received more than kind treatment at your hands... I don't suppose anyone realises more than I do the change that has come over the Sudan since my old and tyrannical master the Khalifa disappeared from the scene. Your description of the 'Peace and Progress' is, in fact, a sequel to my 'Fire and Sword in the Sudan.'</p>
                    <p>With kindest regards, believe me,</p>
                    <p>yours sincerely,</p>
                    <p>Rudolf V. Slatin.</p>

                    <head>IRRIGATION ENGINEERING.</head>
                    <p>By Sir Handury Brown, K.C.M.G, late Inspector-General of Irrigation in Lower Egypt, and formerly in Upper Egypt.</p>
                    <p>X.</p>
                    <p>At the seaward margin of most dletas there are wide stretches of low-lying land, often salted, which are awaiting reclamation. The lands are so little above sea level that free-flow drainage is impossible. Holland is a country of such lands. To reclaim them to cultivation pumping stations must be set up for the drainage. The first operation consists in washing out the salt. The can be done to some extent by surface washings during the flood season, the water being allowed to flow freely over the surface. But, after surface washings have done all they can, the pumps must be called in to help. If necessary, the area to be treated should be surrounded by banks to exclude all water except that which is wanted and which would be admitted under regulation through the head sluice of the canal serving the enclosed area. A drain along the inside of the enclosing bank, and drains all over the area, alternating with the irrigating channels, would lead all excess water to the pumping stations and keep the saturation level low. The pumps would left the water into discharging channel outside the enclosure, which would carry it away. It is well to make provision, in the arrangements for the reclamation of these low lands, for periodical washings every third year or so, as their tendency is to return to their original salted condition, and it is therefore necessary to adopt effective measures to counteract the tendency.</p>
                    <p>It remains now to give references to works where fuller information on the matters treated in these articles can be obtained. There are two books which may be safely called standard works on the irrigation of India and Egypt. In them the information about irrigation in those two countries has been collected in a convenient form for reference, and the conclusioons reached by experience have been recorded and discussed with the authority of competence which both the authors have undoubtedly acquired as the result of their wide experience in irrigation matters, gained in positions of responsibility in India and Egypt respectively.</p>
                    <p>"The Irrigation Works of India," by Mr. R. B. Buckley, C.S.1., formerly chief engineer of the Indian Public Works Depaartment, is not only splendidly got up and illustrated-containing altogether 174 maps, plates and diagrams, besides 40 photographs, but is a perfect mine of detailed information about most things that an irrigation officer should know. The same may be said of "Egyptian Irrigation," by Sir William Willcocks, K.C.M.G, which is the corresponding work on Egypt, and the book of reference for irrigation engineers in that country. If books are capable of making engineers, these two valuable works would do it for irrigation. At any rate, they make it possible for men, new to India or Egypt, to enter on their duties as irrigation engineers with an equipment of knowledge that will render it an easy matter to profit by their own experience and will guide them in the straight road to success.</p>

                    <head>WHERE SMELLS COME FROM.</head>
                    <p>Is the sense of smell caused by gases or by particles is a question which Dr. John Aitken, LL.D., F.R.S., the discoverer of the fact that dust particles in the air are responsible for the formation of fog, has recently studied with very interesting results. In the case, says the "Lancet," of all the odorous substances with which he has so far experimented the answer is decidedly in favor of the gaseous theory. The first substance under investigation was musk, of which it is possible to detect by smell, according to Berthelot, 0.000,000,000,000,000,01 gramme. It would follow that the sense of smell is a refinement exceeding the delicacy of spectroscopic methods, though it is probable that radio-activity may prove to be a still more delicate method of detection. In his experiments Dr. Aitken relied upon "the cloudy condensation test," in which, if odours are due to particles, these particles become nuclei of cloudy condensation in supersaturated air and thus make their presence visible. Careful tests made in the way indicated and excluding adventitious substances gave no nuclei from the musk, showing that the musk does not give off solid particles, but evaporates as a gas or vapour, and that it is gaseous particles from the musk that act on the sense of smell. Of twenty-three other odorsous substances not one gave its perfume in solid particles, nothing but gases or vapours escaping from them. Dr. Aitken points out also that our nostrils seem to confirm this conclusion. The perfume of snoff, for example, "is a soft velvety sensation, whilst the effect of the solid is sharp and biting, more allied to pain than pleasure." Musk again, when "snuffed" has hardly any effect, only the musky odour is observed when no musk dut touches the nostrils.</p>

Amongst the large gathering present were Sir Charles and Mrs. Scotter, Mr. and Mrs. Trevithick, etc. For the first few minutes in the opening half, the Institute defence was busily employed in stopping the A.S.C. attacks, but by the home team's speed and endurance the tide was soon turned. The last-named began attacking with tremendous pressure and succeeded in scoring a couple of goals when half-time arrived. After the change of ends, the game became very fast and the railway men quite overpowered their visitors and added three more goals to their score. Sergt. Brown, of the A.S.C., was referee.</p>

                    <p>The Government has agreed that the International Archaeological Congress, which was convened this year in Athens, shall hold its next convention in Cairo in 1907.

                    <p>Some interesting statements for cultivators in the Delta are contained in the administration report of the Irrigation Department in Lower Egypt for the last year. Mr. Verschoyle remarks:--</p>
                    <p>There were a few grumbles at the end of July from those whom the good supplies of May and June had induced to put in too much summer rice. Before the Barrage weirs or the Reservoir came into action the Delta had to be content with a discharge of 40 to 42 millions per day at the end of July, so with an average discharge of 70 millions per day throughout the month, and, so far as available statistics go, no great increase in cropped area, there cannot have been any severe shortage of supply. No matter what may be the supply available during the last 10 days of July and 1st week of August, there will still be a cry for more, as every cultivator would then like to water practically his whole culturable area at once.</p>

Mr. Lehman being in a dying condition with typhoid fever.</p>
                    <p>Both the couples were married here just before sailing for Dhamtri, central province of India, on Oct. 2.

                    <head>THE AKABA RAILWAY.</head>
                    <p>When the Hedjaz line had been laid from Damascus to Amman and surveys had been pushed to Ma'an and the forbidding ravine of Batn el Ghoul it naturally occurred to the Turkish military authorities that a branch line from Ma'an to Akaba might be worth considering, and certain preliminary surveys were carried out along the proposed route. Early in 1905 an Imperial iradé authorised the local committee of the Hadjaz line which sits at Damascus to lay a line along the route. Very shortly after the issue of the iradé, counter orders came suspending the construction of the branch line, owing apparently to the fact that certain arrangements had been entered into by the Suez Canal Company and the Ottoman Government by which the dues on the transport of Turkish troops were considerably lowered and that there was, on that account, no particular reason for the construction of the line. The fortification of Akaba has also been discussed and plans have been drawn up by the Headquarters staff of the Vth Order for the construction of forts armed with 5.9 inch cannon, but here again nothing has been done. Akaba is in itself of little value except as a police station where a few parboiled soldiers look after the Bedouin tribes, and even were the Ottoman Empire unhappily involved in war, the post would not be likely to appeal to the cupidity of an invader.</p>

                    <head>MODERN QUEEN ELEANORS.</head>
                    <p>One of the newly appointed lecturers at the Vienna University has raised a pretty storm in that ever-bubbling teapot. Describing the character of Eleonore d'Anjou, the wife of the English King, Henry II., he parenthetically remarked that, like most emancipated women, she was careless about her marriage vows.</p>
                    <p>One of his listeners was herself married, and her husband sent in a complaint to the Rectorate. Then Professor Becker returned to the charge, and maintained his assertion that the emancipation of woman brings with it different ideas concerning love and marriage, as he had often had occasion to observe. He did not wish thereby to allude to any of his present hearers, but he protestes against anything which passed inside those walls being made the subject of incompetent outside criticism.</p>
                    <p>This statement was received with great applause and ironical laughter and comments by the male students, whereupon all the weaker sex rose and left the hall in a body.</p>
                    <p>The incident is an unfortunate one, as the women students feel shy exposing themselves to further remarks of their comrades. On the other hand, it is a serious matter for them to relinquish the course of their studies. The initial mistake, of course, was in taking notice of a casual observation on the character of a historical personage.</p>

                        RESPONSIBILITY FOR RIOT.</head>
                    <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                    <p>Sir,-Please insert the following in your esteemed paper if possible.</p>
                    <p>Most of the Eurpoean writers, whether in Egypt or abroad, are accustomed to call the Egyptians fanatics, and to accuse them whenever a dispute arises between them and the foreign residents of the awful accusation of fanaticism, and lay the responsibility of everything on their shoulders. They never forward a word of blame to those foreign criminals who deserted their countries and came to Egypt to disturb its tranquility and excite her people. This attitude in itself is the true fanaticism in its wider sense. For it is no doubt absurd to accuse a people as the Egyptians, who are widely known as lovers of peace and tranquility and most generous to foreigners, of fanaticism.</p>
                    <p>What it is most deplorable, is that the European press in Egypt declare publicly that the vernacular press, and especially the "Al Lewa" newspaper, provoked the Egyptians--"the shoe blacks"--against the European residents, while they know very well the originators of the Alexandrian disturbance of last Sunday, and are sure that it is not an anti-foreing movement.</p>
                    <p>The originators of the riot are the Greeks. Had they not attacked the Egyptians nothing would have occurred.</p>
                    <p>The vernacular press, and especially the "Al Lewa," have always repeated the fact that Christians are friends of Mohamedans and they both ought to live on good terms with each other.</p>
                    <p>Who can declare impartially that the lowest classes of the Egyptians read the Arabic Press even that they may become excited or fermented by what is published in them. So what the anti-Egyptian European writers say about Egypt and her people is absolutely wrong and vague.</p>
                    <p>It is to our satisfaction to see some of the moderate European writers who are promoting agreement between the different nationalities in Egypt, declare that the Greeks are the only disturbers who are responsible for the Alexandrian incident.</p>
                    <p>The false accusations which the European press accuse the Egyptians of is a true means of cultivating discord between them and the residents.</p>
                    <p>We believe that the only remedy for such a case as that of last Sunday is to entitle the Mixed Courts with right of trying the criminal cases of the foreigners who reside in Egypt and the disarmament of the Greeks residents.</p>
                    <p>-Yours truly,</p>

                    <head>OUR LONDON LETTER.</head>
                    <p>(From our Correspondent.)</p>
                    <p>London, December 9.</p>
                    <p>To-day as yesterday, no further appointments are announced. This was the intimation which confronted visitors to Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman's house in Belgrave square yesterday. No official information is hoped for until Monday. Indeed, late yesterday afternoon a definite statement to this effect was made the following notice being posted in the hall of 29. Belgrave-square: "No announcement as to offices will be made until the King's pleasure has been taken on his Majesty's return to town."</p>
                    <p>Not for the firsy time the Radicals will find themselves in a difficulty concerning the appointment of a Mistress of the Robes, which office according to long established usage, is not held by a peeress below the rank of a duchess. As a matter of fact, there is no duchess whose husband holds Radical views, and doubtless the same course will be taken as was adopted by the late Mr. Gladstone in 1892, and was followed by Lord Rosebery, viz., that of making no appointment at all. The Duchess of Buccleuch was then, as now, Mistress of the Robes, and as it was impossible for her to retain the position under a Radical Government, Queen Victoria herself appointed two ladies, the Dowager Duchesses of Roxburghe and Atholl, to perform in turn the duties of attending on the Queen at State ceremonies.</p>
                    <p>It is possible that we shall not know for some little time the full extent of the terrible accident at Charing-cross Station, but we may fairly hope that the tale of deaths is now complete. The accident is almost, if not quite, without a parallel in London, but it is nevertheless a very alarming one, owing to the fact that there are in the metropolis a great many other buildings of the same type, built in very much the same way, and of pretty much the same date. It is not yet possible to determine the cause of the accident, but there is, at any rate, good ground for asking that these other buildings should be examined without delay.</p>
                    <p>Iron buildings have hardly yet been long enough in existence for anyone to say how they will stand the test of time, but at any rate we know that they must be continually painted if the iron is not to corrode and the whole building come to the ground. This painting is very expensive, and it may be noticed that in several quarters, notably on the Metropolitan Railway, there is a disposition to discard this type of station, and revert to one which, if darker and less roomy, does not entail such heavy maintenance expenditure. It may be that we shall see a complete revulsion against the station with the large span of iron and glass.</p>
                    <p>Charing-cross was built in 1863, and is a monument of mid-Victorian ugliness which goes far to spoil the appearance of London. Presumably it will have to be re-built as a result of this accident, and I sincerely hope that it may be found possible to give us something which will be a credit to the metropolis. Speaking broadly, our railway stations in London compare badly in point of appearance with those of Germany, and the South-Eastern and Chatham might do worse than take a hint from that country. It is, I suppose, impossible to hope for the disestablishment of the hideous Hungerford Bridge, but, at any rate, the new Charing cross might be reasonably artistic.</p>
                    <p>The Charing Cross disaster, following closely upon the prompt detection of a structural flaw at His Majesty's Theatre, has caused in the public mind a certain feeling of uneasiness with regard to the safety of other public buildings, and fear has found expression whether the Nelson Column, within a few yards beneath which a new tubular railway will presently be running, will be in the future as free from danger as it has been in the past.</p>
                    <p>Lord Roberts has obtained greater freedom for his crowning campaign by resigning his last official post, but his career has given him such authority that his responsibility is in no way lessened. Nor would he wish it to be. He has thrown himself into this work of preaching universal military training with as wholehearted a desire to stake everything on it as he ever showed in most daring feats of war. To those who see in his crusade the threat of militarism and conscription, his speech at Newcastle may be earnestly recommended for study. They will be forced to admit that conscription is a very different matter from the scheme advocated by Lord Roberts-the inculcation of practical patriotism into children, military training in all State-sided schools, cadet corps in all schools and colleges and of the boys' brigade type, and a period of some months' continuous training for every able-bodied young man in the country. Only in this way can we secure a true reserve force, pledged and equal to the defence of this country against any invader, and including a large proportion likely to volunteer for service abroad in the case of a great emergency. There is nothing in this, surely, to scare the most timid, and even in a Campbell-Bannerman period the cause should make headway.</p>
                    <p>Very satisfactory figures have just been published giving the latest recruiting returns. A certain distrust has, however, always prevailed of the reports made by this often sorely vexed department. We are apt to question the accuracy and the permanence of the results claimed. Now, however, there seems little doubt that the method of nine years' enlistment which began fourteen months ago has been a success. Much apprehension was felt at the outset as to the willingness of candidates to accept service for the lengthened term. The totals given are nevertheless in excess of those in the best years, exclusive of the war period. It is stated, moreover, that at this present time enlistment is particularly brisk, better indeed by 20 per cent. of the numbers shown in the corresponding period of last year. Very sanguine conclusions are being drawn from the fact that the two terms of service, short and long, are now in progress concurrently without the one injuriously affecting the other. It is claimed also that a general improvement in physique and social respectability has been exhibited in the men now joining. Some qualification of this reassuring statement is to be noted, however, in the marked increase of medical rejections, which in some cases it is reported has risen to more than 80 per cent. of the applicants. This strengthens the uncomfortable and disquieting belief that the race is steadily degenerating. At the same time it is eing proved to demonstration that the advantages of military service are better appreciated among the classes that enlist.</p>
                    <p>One of the most interesting articles in the "Live Stock Journal Almanac" for 1906 is that by Sir Walter Gilbey on "How Betting should Aid Agriculture, and how £300,000 could Annually be Devoted to Stock-Breeding and Hospitals." Of course, the suggestion is that the bookmaker should be suppressed and his place be taken by the pari-mutuel or totalisator. Sir Walter is plainly impressed by the results that accrue from the operation of the pari-mutuel in France. In the year 1901 £9,038,278 was turned over at the mutuels on French racecourses. The authorities deducted 7 per cent., of which 1 per cent. (£90,383) was applied to horse-breeding, 2 per cent. (180,766) to public charities, and 4 per cent. (381,532) went in working expenses. At Kalgeorlie, in Western Australia, £123,231 was taken at the totalistor in three days, and at Johannesburg one day this year the turnover was £66,000. From these figures we may, says Sir Walter, gain some idea of what a week at Ascot or Epsom would produce. Little wonder, he adds, that Paris can afford to give £x2,000 for a single horse show and provide horses for her army at any moment, while at the same time her poor rates are as nothing compared with outs. Then he proceeds: Would those who are opposed to betting have as much to say against this reformation in the system of betting and racing as they have now? It is as impossible to put a stop to betting as it would be to close the Stock Exchange, Lloyd's or our insurance business. Our Legislature has already drawn as tight cords of restriction on betting as it could devise, but has hitherto failed to recognise the fact that by copying the example of other countries in the way I have endeavored to explain it will deal a blow to much of the rascality of the Turf, and practically of betting, and at the same time immensely benefit the country."</p>
                    <p>The Jews of all countries have reason to be proud of the success of their efforts for the relief of the sufferers by the recebt outrages in Russia. Up to last night no less than £401,000 had been contributed to the fund initiated and superintended by Lord Rothschild. England and America are responsible for a large share of the total, £85,000 having come from this side and £190,000 from the other side of the Atlantic. Here is irrefragable proof that in the hour of trial the Jew, wherever he be situated, feels the call of nationality. There may also be found in it some encouragement for Mr. Zangwill and his fellow Zionists, whose enthusiasm to many seems founded on the sand, but who may gather from the fund further inspiration and faith that the Jew recognises the ties of brotherhood when they are accompanied by the cry of distress. If he be convinced that the only way to alleviate that distress permanently be reunion in one land, he may--it is not beyong the bounds of possibility--make greater sacrifices than the subscription of some hundreds of thousand of pounds. </p>
                    <p>The last of the regular steam trains puffed itself off the District Railway at midnight on Saturday. It is impossible to pump up any sentiment about this disappearance, good servant in its dirty, makeshift way though the underground "puff-puff" has been for a third of a century. In a generation or two the surviving veterans who spin ghastly, and perfectly true, stories of the horrors of the old Inferno round about Westminster Bridge station, for instance, will be pitied as incorrigible old liears by an incredulous posterity. Already the point has arrived for grumbling at the imperfections and drawbacks of the new electricity. There is room for improvement in some respects, undoubtedly ; but even "straphanging" in the new cars is an improvement on the Black Hole of Calcutta experiences of a football afternoon, with nineteen or more people in one compartment, on the old steam trains. And we are all learning how to dash out of those sliding central doors without being nipped, or to get in and out of any door that we prefer in sublime defiance of rules.</p>
                    <p>England's decisive defeat by the New Zealand team cannot be said to have come as a shock. There was generally felt to be no reason why she should do any better than Scotland or Ireland had done, and against the fact that she did considerably worse we have been hardened by the sad experiences of recent years, in the course of which England has often had to realise that, in Rugby football, at any rate, she has no reason to speak disrespectfully of the Celtic fungus. The Rugby "ashes" have gone often enough to Edinburgh, Dublin, or Cardiff. To Wales alone the Old Country has now to look for a possible bright spot in the "All Black" story of this winter, and it is satisfactory to learn that the confidence of the Welshmen in their champions is "amazing." Confidence is no small factor in a football match ; and we are even glad to be reminded of the humiliating fact that last year, Wales beat England by ten points more than the New Zealanders did on Saturday.</p>
                    <p>The determination of the working-men's clubs in Durham and Northumberland to combine to brew their own beer is an altogether novel development of the co-operative principle, and one whoch may have far-reaching consequences. It will probably, for instance, considerably modify the views of the working-class electors in these counties towards the Licensing Act. It may also serve to direct the attention of Parliament to those working-men's political clubs-Radical, we are glad to say, almost exclusively-which, in spite of the efforts of the Legislature, are still merely means for evading the regulations which compel the ordinary licensed victualler to close during certain hours of Sunday.</p>

                        HOW BEER AFFECTED THE KIDNEYS.
                        Cured 2 Years Ago-Still Well To-Day.</head>
                    <p>54, Brighton Place, Hampton Square,</p>
                    <p>Sheen Lane, Mortlake,</p>
                    <p>London, England.</p>
                    <p>For nearly 19 years I suffered from stricture and kidney disease, and many a time have I laid on the bedroom floor writhing in agony. Twice I have been in hospital and undergone operations for the stricture. Never, as long as I live, shall I forget what I want through them. The doctors said I could not live another three months, yet I can truly say that, although two years have passed since then, I was never better in my life than I am to-day.</p>
                    <p>My illness came on in this way: One day at work, I strained my back, and afterwards I suffered from severe cutting pains just over where the kidneys are, especially when I stooped. I could not sleep well at nights, and there were distressing urinary disorders. I was miserable and out of sorts, and although the doctor did all he could for me, I got worse instead of better. If I had a glass of beer it irritated my kidneys so much that I had to keep to my bed for a week, btu since using Doan's Backache Kidney Pills, I can enjoy my glass without feeling a bit the worse for it.</p>
                    <p>It wasn't until I had finished the fourth box of Doan's Pills that they seemed to be doing me any good, but I persisted with the medicine, and with the fifth box there was a decidedly freer action of the bladder. No other medicine had ever helped me at all, and you can imagine how delighted I was at this relief. For six months I continued with Doan's Backache Kidney Pills, and then I was entirely cured of the stricture and kidney disease. From that day to this there hasn't been any sign of the old complaints returning.</p>
                    <p>My suffering any my cure are well-known to hundreds of men I have worked with in London, and I am sure that had I not used Doan's Backache Kidney Pills when I did, I should never have lived.</p>

                    <p>(From our Correspondent).</p>
                    <p>London, December 8.</p>
                    <p>The S.S. Plassy leaves Southampton to-day with a large number of drafts for the Royal Artillery and infantry battalions in India. The liner is due at Port Said on the 19th, and at Bombay on the 19th inst.</p>
                    <p>Lieutenant-Colonel Stanley Bird, Royal Fusiliers (who is well known in Egypt), the new chief of the 1st Battalion at Parkhurst, Isle of Wight, has been associated with that distinguished regiment for over twenty-two years. He received his first commission in August, 1883, his captaincy in 1891, was promoted major in 1898, and since March, 1901, was second in command of his present battalion. While serving in Egypt as a staff captain he shared in Kitchener's advance of Khartoum (mentioned in despatches, British medal, Khedive's medal with clasp).</p>
                    <p>Brevet Colonel G. F. Leslie, Rifle Brigade, has vacated the command of the 4th Battalion at Malta, and has been succeeded by Lieutenant-Colonel V. A. Cooper, second in command of the 3rd battalion at Aden. Major W. G. Beutinck, D. S. O., who for some time has been employed as a Resident Magistrate in the Trasvaal, has taken his retired pay. The vacancy thus created has been filled by the promotion to substantive rank of Captain and Brevet-Major R. B. Stephens, now in the Staff College.</p>
                    <p>Major-General Baden-Powell, Inspector of Cavalry, will accompany H.R.H. the Duke of Connaught during his South African tour. The Duke will visit all the notable battlefields of the late war.</p>
                    <p>Lieutenant A. W. Norris, Royal Berkshire Regiment, recently employed with the Gold Coast Regiment, on returning to regimental duty, has been posted to the 1st Battalion at Dublin, with effect from the 18th inst.</p>
                    <p>The 3rd Battalion Rifle Brigade will embark at Aden on the S.S. Assaye the 15th inst. en route for England. The liner is due at Southampton on New Year's Day. The battalion will proceed to Plymouth, where it will be stationed. It will absorb the details left by the 4th Battalion when it went to Malta.</p>
                    <p>The army may once more be consigned to the melting pot. Mr. Arnold-Forster's "reforms" have stopped short under the influence of the dissolution. What his successor has in store is a question not easily answered, but it is a comforting remembrance that Liberal administration has never been marked by heroic methods. That party, like the Conservative party up till recent years, was quite content to muddle on when in office, fortified by a faith in Providence, and an unlimited belief in Tommy Atkins and his fighting abilities, though never giving any tangible proof of that in the way of increased emoluments.</p>
                    <p>The Channel Fleet, including the First Cruiser Squadron, will leave England in about a fortnight for Vigo, and then proceed to Arosa Bay, spending Christmas at Lisbon. During January, the ship will visit Lagos and Las Palmas, returning to Gibraltar on February 1 for combined manoeuvres with the Mediterranean and Atlantic Fleets together with their respective Cruiser Squadrons under the Admiral Sir A. K. Wilson, of the Channel Fleet.</p>

                        being sleeplessness, sense of prostration or weariness, depression of spirits
