                            summer. The sky is still clouded and the weather generally is dull and
                            chilly.</p>

                        <p>THE EXTERMINATION OF THE MOSQUITO.</p>
                        <p>The articles and letters which have appeared recently in this journal
                            under the above heading have given rise to much discussion as to the
                            possibility of attempting in Egypt an organised crusade against the
                            mosquito. That a really honest attempt to exterminate the mosquito and
                            its attendant evils can be crowned with success has, as our
                            correspondents point out, been demonstrated by experience in Singapore,
                            Saigon, Salangor, Sierra Leone, New Orleans, and many other places. We
                            would point out however, that although individuals may do much to
                            protect their own homes and prevent them from becoming bleeding grounds
                            for the larvae, to ensure success it is absolutely necessary to have the
                            crusade carried out continuously and efficiently. It is not sufficient
                            merely to kill the mosquitoes and their larvae one week and then neglect
                            attending to their breeding haunts for another week.</p>
                        <p>Another one of the insect plagues of Egypt also might be considerably
                            decreased-that of the common or garden house fly. Up the Nile
                            especially, it is said that much of the ophthalmia is caused by these
                            flies carrying infection from one to another. An expert entomologist
                            might possibly be able to advise some method of dealing on a large scale
                            with these pests. It has also often struck us as strange that in the
                            large hotels in Egypt no attempt has been made to exclude insects by
                            wire and netting and fine mesh screenings over windows and doors, the
                            system adopted in America. Were this method carried out it would be
                            possible to do away with mosquito nets for beds. That the present
                            discussion has at least drawn attention to the possibility of combating
                            the nuisance of the almost ubiquitous mosquito there is no doubt. Time,
                            however, will show whether the carrying out of the destruction of the
                            larvae on a wholesale scale will be attempted now or whether, like New
                            Orleans, Egypt must wait until it is a choice between exterminating
                            mosquitoes or the latter exterminating myriads of men.</p>
                        <p>It is unlikely, of course, that Egypt will ever be face to face with an
                            epidemic of yellow fever, yet malaria we have always with us, and other
                            diseases are known to be carried by the mosquito and the fly. It has
                            been tritely said that we owe many diseases to their spreading by dirt,
                            man, and the fly. The first we can remove, the second must remain, but
                            in America they say "the fly must get." The climate of Egypt and the
                            topography of the country lends itself to the successful accomplishment
                            of at least ridding us in some measure of the mosquito. But as we stated
                            above it is absolutely essential that the matter be not left entirely to
                            individual or private enterprise, as the crusade to be effectual must be
                            always at work. The organisation for each town must have the
                            co-operation of the European community at least to have any means of
                            success. Every house would have to be visited at least once a week until
                            headway was made against the pest. All people interested would have to
                            draw attention to the existence and persistence of mosquitoes in their
                            locality. Wherever there was a fresh outbreak or recrudescence of the
                            nuissance there would the vultures have to be gathered together. By
                            swooping down on each place where mosquitoes were known to exist, in a
                            very short time the numbers would be so enormously decreased as to
                            convince the most pessimistic sanitary repressing neophyte that it was
                            possible to do much to remove what is at present equally a menace to the
                            health of the community as it is at all times a source of annoyance and
                            discomfort.</p>

                    <p>Berlin, December 15.</p>
                    <p>Count von Bulow again asserted at length Germany's innocence of aggressive
                        plans against England. He denied that Germany had ever been on the point of
                        declaring war on Great Britain. The cause of the present crisis in the
                        relations between the two countries is a mystery. Such stories as that of a
                        violent collision between the Emperor and King Edward were idiotic lies. He
                        vigorously attacked the Social-Democrats, whose constant representations of
                        Germany as a disturbe of the peace have contributed to the present British
                        mistrust of Germany.</p>

                    <p>The imports into Egypt daring last month show a decline on those during the
                        corresponding month of 1904. This decrease amounts to L.E. 477.784. But the
                        total increase of imports for the eleven months of the year from January to
                        November is LE. 1,049,916. Great Britain shared in the general falling-off
                        of imports last month, importing only L.E. 557,164 worth of goods as against
                        L.E. 829 858 for the previous November. But in the general increase of
                        imports daring the eleven months Great Britain’s increased imports amount to
                        L.E. 6,115,594, as against L.E. 6,045,234 for the same period in 1904.</p>
                    <p>More than half of the decrease in, imports for last month is due to the
                        falling-off in textiles, which show a decrease of L.E. 267,365 on the
                        corresponding month of last year.</p>
                    <p>The exports for last month show an increase of L.E. 195,591 over those for
                        November, 1904, but the total exports for the eleven months show a decrease
                        of L.E. 522,147, which is accounted for by the falling off in the cotton
                        exports by L.E. 1,040,671, as compared with the corresponding months in the

                        owing to the international naval demonstration. At one time there was
                        actually a slight panic, a few families leaving for the Lebanon. The Porta's
                        covert menace was. of course, calculated to cause some apprehension among
                        the Christians, but what caused most fear was the massing of troops,
                        estimated by some at 8 battalions, and the arrival of 3 batteries from
                        Damascus. As a matter of fact the troops and guns are being sent to
                        reinforce the dwindling numbers of the Yemen Army. The losses during the
                        campaign have been terrible, some say as much as 50 %. An eye-witness tells
                        me that on the troops landing from a recently arrived transport from the
                        Yemen on the quay at Beyrout several fell dead, and their general aspect was
                        one of ineffable misery.</p>

                    <p>We were well entertained, though not intensely overwhelmed by Samsone e
                        Dalilah, as produced last night at this theatre. The delicate and
                        sentimental handling, which Saint-Saëns’ magnum opus demands, can be found
                        only in artistes of exceptional calibre and in minutely trained choruses,
                        and, although last night’s caste was strong, it can hardly be said to have
                        entirely met the exigencies of the case. Signa. Bianca Lavin carried out the
                        arduous role of Dalilah in a melodious and very conscientious fashion. Her
                        singing throughout Act II. was remarkably well sustained and was pleasantly
                        distinguished by sensibility and refinement, most of her low tones being
                        exquisite; at the same time there was occasionally a barely perceptible
                        shortage in compassing the high notes. In all other respects she made a
                        highly creditable Dalilah. Sig. Luigi Longobardi’s Samson was rendered with
                        technical fluency and clear articulation, but he might with advantage have
                        infused his part with more warmth and vigor. Sig. Pasquale Amato, as the
                        Chief Priest and Sig. C. Nicolay who impersonated the aged Habrew, lent
                        valuable and adequate support. Both are pos essors of rich, crisp voices.
                        The part of Abimelech was rather stiffly rendered by Sig. Ricceri, who. is
                        too apt to mouth his music. The chorus, on whom so much depends, gave a
                        rather varied display. After singing in well with the overture, they became
                        rather pre-cipitate after the rise of the curtain; moreover, the women's
                        voices were too liable to fall into harsh, shrill tones. The men were
                        decidedly better and showed feeling. A softer, if stolid, utterance was
                        accorded to the graceful chorus of Philistine women. In Act III. a far more
                        tasteful effect was obtained, all singing in very good harmony. The
                        orchestra was again under Sig. Zuccani's skilful direction. Here at all
                        events no exception whatever can be taken. They gave significant expression
                        to the tender and refined music, which is too well known and too warmly
                        esteemed to call for further dis-cussion in these columns. A word should be
                        said for the ballets, which created a far better impression than Aida.
                        Signa. A. Verganti's pas seul was very satisfactory and calls for little
                        comment, but we wished we could have seen more of Signa. Bracchi, whose
                        steps are extremely light and graceful. The production was well staged. All
                        things considered, we are inclined to look upon the performance as very
                        pleasing, but certainly not on a level with those to which the present opera
                        company have hitherto accustomed us, and it suffered consequently by the
                        comparison.</p>

                    <head>THE CAIRO SEASON. PROSPECTS FOR ’XMAS WEEK.</head>
                    <p>Many people an already installed in the Ghezireh Palace Hotel and enjoying
                        its lovely position and delightful gardens.—so welcome after the dusty
                        streets of Cairo. On Wednesday the band of the King’s Royal Rifles was
                        playing there from 4 to 6, and attracted many listeners. On other days a
                        Tzigane orchestra provides music at frequent intervals. Sir Hugh and Lady
                        Smiley have taken up their quarters here, and Mr. and Mrs. Rom, with their
                        family, have moved on here from Shepheard’s. Mr. Astley Johnstone, who has
                        already spent so many winters at Ghezireh, has again returned with his
                        motor, and Mr. Curphy has also brought his motor. Colonel and Mrs. R Gordon
                        are here, and Major Hessey, of the 2nd Inniskilling Fusiliers, and Mrs.
                        Hessey are making the hotel their headquarters. Among other visitors are
                        :—Comte and Comtesse Krassicki, Major, Mrs, and Miss Burney, Mr. and Miss
                        Jones, Mr and Mrs. Honould, from Johannesburg, and Mr. C. Banbury, from
                        India.</p>
                    <p>There will be a small dance at the hotel one evening in ’Xmas week, and
                        several luncheon and dinner patties are being arranged for Sunday. Seeing
                        its vicinity to the race-course, the hotel will be certain of much patronage
                        on the occasion of the second meeting next week. On Shrove Tuesday, February
                        27, arrangements are being made for the big fancy-dress ball which has
                        always been such a success in former years.</p>
                    <p>There will be 'Xmas trees at both Shepheard's and the Mena House Hotel on
                        'Xmas Eve, and as many grown-up’s as children are looking forward to that
                        day. On ’Xmas evening there will be a gathering at the Hotel du Nil, when
                        another tree will be in evidence.</p>
                    <p>Up to the present there have been but few social events to chronicle this
                        season, but after this week we hope for better things. There is already “in
                        the air” the expectation of ’Xmas, and if we cannot spend it in the old time
                        honored English fashion, by our own fireside and among the children, we mean
                        to do our best to celebrate the occasion.</p>
                    <p>There will be numerous small dances at the various hotels, and most people
                        are making arrangements for cheery dinners at either one or the other.</p>
                    <p>Next week we have two days’(Wednesday and Friday) racing to anticipate at the
                        Khedi vial Sporting Club at Ghezireh, and many ladies will take the
                        opportunity of showing how well their pretty frocks become them It is rather
                        unfortunate that Wednesday should also happen to be the day chosen for the
                        marriage of Miss Nungovich to Capt. Wilson, R.A.M.C. So many friends have
                        been bidden to the wedding and the reception to be held afterwards at the
                        Savoy, that the first day’s raring will suffer by their absence.</p>

                    <head>AUTOMOBILES IN EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>The number of automobiles in Egypt ex ceeds 170, of which 110 are at Cairo
                        and 56 at Alexandria, and the increase in this industry of recent years has
                        given occasion for an interesting article in the Bulletin of the French
                        Chamber of Commerce of Alexandria. A great drawback to the development of
                        the industry is the lack of roads, especially the want of a great highway
                        between Cairo and Alexandria. Our confrére remarks :—</p>
                    <p>Nous saisissons avec empressement cette circonstance pour joindre nos
                        instances à celles qni s'élèvent un peu de toute part dans le but de
                        demander au Gouvernement Egyptien la création d'une route carrossable
                        d’Alexandrie au Caire, route qui serait une véritable artère vers lsquelle
                        viendrait converger tout un réseau d’autres voies desservant les nombreux
                        villages de l'intérieur. C’est ainsi que des communications faciles
                        s’établi-ranent entre toutes les localités de l’Egypte au grand avantage du
                        commerce et des transactions.</p>
                    <p>Certes, on ne peut invequer la pénurie du trésor ; peu d’Etats présentement
                        une situation aussi florissante au point de vue des finances ; c'est ainsi
                        que le projet de budget pour 1'an prochain, déduction faite de dégrèvemente
                        dont le montant dépasse L.E. 300,000. accuse un excédent de recettes évalué
                        à L.E. 500,000, somme dont l’emploi, jusqu'a présent, n'est pas déterminé.
                        Tant au point de vue commercial qu'à celui de l’objet que nous traitons,
                        nous apprendrions avec grand plaisir qu'une partie de cet excédent sera
                        consacré à une oeuvre de si grande utilité et dont les conséquences
                        écono-miques seraient incalculables pour la fortune du pays.</p>
                    <p>Nous verrions alors apparaltre les grosses voitures.de touristes, les 80-100
                        chevaux, avec lesquelles les 210 kilomètres qui séparent Alexandrie du Cairo
                        seraient parcourus en une seule traite avec possibilité de retour dans la
                        même journée.</p>
                    <p>Les amateurs, ayant devant eux de grands espaces à parcourir, deviendraient
                        bien plus nombreux, et l'importation des automobiles en Egypte prendrait un
                        grand développement.</p>
                    <p>The first automobile in Egypt was a little Dion Bouton, purchased by Prince
                        Aziz about fifteen years ago. French motors are preferred, especially the
                        following makes, de Dion Bouton, Peugeot, Renault, Panhard Levassor,
                        Clément-Bayard. Charron-Girardot-Voigt, Darracq, Cot-terean. There are 43
                        motorcycles in Cairo and 17 in Alexandria. Motor omnibuses are being tried
                        by the Cairo Omnibus Company, which has imported two of the Dietrich type
                        and the trials are now being made.</p>

                    <head>EGYPT EXPLORATION FUND. LECTURE BY MR HALL.</head>
                    <p>An interesting lecture was given yesterday afternoon at the Grand Continental
                        Hotel, Cairo, by Mr. Hall of the British Museum under the auspices of the
                        Egypt Exploration Fund, of which Dr. Gerling Hayward is secretary in Egypt.
                        The lecture dealt with a new XI. Dynasty temple discovered at Deir el'Bahri,
                        and is the first of a series of four, one of which is to be given by
                        Professor Naville and another by Dr. Grentell. After Capt Lyons had
                        introduced Mr. Hall to his audience, the lecturer, with the aid of the
                        magio-lantern, described the temple and its surroundings. After giving an
                        interesting account of the great temple at Deir el Behri Thebes, he
                        proceeded to describe the new temple and showed how the pyramid above the
                        royal tomb characteristic of the IV. Dynasty, with its small temple at the
                        foot, had been superseded in XL Dynasty times by the temple, at some
                        distance from the real tomb and acting as a sort of funeral chapel The new
                        temple showed the last survival of the pyramid, a structure in the centre of
                        the temple court with a base of about 60 feet square. He then described the
                        various features of the temple, among them the tombs of ladies of the royal
                        harem of King Neferkeprà of the XI dynasty, many of whom had been buried
                        simultaneously before the completion of the temple, a fact that led certain
                        Egyptologists to believe that they had been strangled after their lord’s
                        death. The tomb of Neb-keper-rà with its 150 foot shaft next claimed
                        attention, and then came illustrations of the most valuable find during the
                        excavations. Among them was a magnificent alabaster head of the sacred cow
                        of Hathor, a remarkable piece of realistic sculpture, its eye sockets still
                        bearing traces of lapis lazuli. Then came the portrait statue of the
                        grim-featured Usartesan III., the Se-sostris of the ancients, now in the
                        Cairo Museum. The statue was found with five others, each representing the
                        monarch at a different period of his life, on the S.-W. porch of the temple.
                        The angular facial type wrongly supposed to be ’Hyksos’ appeared in the XII.
                        and the latter half of the XI. Dynasty Pharaohs. Reliefs showed Bedouine of
                        Sinai,yellow-skinned and hook-nosed, falling before the monarch's arrows,
                        while the heads of Mentu-hotep, from his looks a relative of theUsertesens
                        who established the XI.. Dynasty rule in Lower Egypt,andhis wife were most
                        interesting. These kings, so said the lecturer, were certainly of Egyptian
                        stock and their facial type could be recognised among the fellaheen of the
                        present day. A relief on the royal sarcophagus showing a ferocious-looking
                        fox dragging a half-fledged bird from its nest, a model combined bakery and
                        brewery with its little life-like figures,which it was hoped would by some
                        magical process come to life and bake and brew for his Majesty in the other
                        world, were among the other discoveries and among the last but not the least
                        interesting illustrations of the lecture was a photograph of a triangular
                        piece of bread, solid and unappetising after more than 8,000 years, but
                        retaining its smell of bread when first discovered. Other photographs showed
                        the methods employed in digging and the men at work.</p>
                    <p>At 6.30 p.m. the lecture closed and Capt. Lyons paid Mr. Hall in the name of
                        the audience a warm tribute of thanks.</p>

                    <p>Dear Mr. Ward-Your delightful and most interesting book on the Sudan has
                        reached me. I congratulate you heartily on the excellent manner in which the
                        work is written and illustrated. All of us who have done our little best to
                        regenerate the country, after its terrible misfortunes, have received more
                        than kind treatment at your hands... I don't suppose anyone realises more
                        than I do the change that has come over the Sudan since my old and
                        tyrannical master the Khalifa disappeared from the scene. Your description
                        of the 'Peace and Progress' is, in fact, a sequel to my 'Fire and Sword in
                        the Sudan.'</p>
                    <p>With kindest regards, believe me,</p>
                    <p>yours sincerely,</p>

                    <head>IRRIGATION ENGINEERING.</head>
                    <p>By Sir Handury Brown, K.C.M.G, late Inspector-General of Irrigation in Lower
                        Egypt, and formerly in Upper Egypt.</p>
                    <p>X.</p>
                    <p>At the seaward margin of most dletas there are wide stretches of low-lying
                        land, often salted, which are awaiting reclamation. The lands are so little
                        above sea level that free-flow drainage is impossible. Holland is a country
                        of such lands. To reclaim them to cultivation pumping stations must be set
                        up for the drainage. The first operation consists in washing out the salt.
                        The can be done to some extent by surface washings during the flood season,
                        the water being allowed to flow freely over the surface. But, after surface
                        washings have done all they can, the pumps must be called in to help. If
                        necessary, the area to be treated should be surrounded by banks to exclude
                        all water except that which is wanted and which would be admitted under
                        regulation through the head sluice of the canal serving the enclosed area. A
                        drain along the inside of the enclosing bank, and drains all over the area,
                        alternating with the irrigating channels, would lead all excess water to the
                        pumping stations and keep the saturation level low. The pumps would left the
                        water into discharging channel outside the enclosure, which would carry it
                        away. It is well to make provision, in the arrangements for the reclamation
                        of these low lands, for periodical washings every third year or so, as their
                        tendency is to return to their original salted condition, and it is
                        therefore necessary to adopt effective measures to counteract the
                        tendency.</p>
                    <p>It remains now to give references to works where fuller information on the
                        matters treated in these articles can be obtained. There are two books which
                        may be safely called standard works on the irrigation of India and Egypt. In
                        them the information about irrigation in those two countries has been
                        collected in a convenient form for reference, and the conclusioons reached
                        by experience have been recorded and discussed with the authority of
                        competence which both the authors have undoubtedly acquired as the result of
                        their wide experience in irrigation matters, gained in positions of
                        responsibility in India and Egypt respectively.</p>
                    <p>"The Irrigation Works of India," by Mr. R. B. Buckley, C.S.1., formerly chief
                        engineer of the Indian Public Works Depaartment, is not only splendidly got
                        up and illustrated-containing altogether 174 maps, plates and diagrams,
                        besides 40 photographs, but is a perfect mine of detailed information about
                        most things that an irrigation officer should know. The same may be said of
                        "Egyptian Irrigation," by Sir William Willcocks, K.C.M.G, which is the
                        corresponding work on Egypt, and the book of reference for irrigation
                        engineers in that country. If books are capable of making engineers, these
                        two valuable works would do it for irrigation. At any rate, they make it
                        possible for men, new to India or Egypt, to enter on their duties as
                        irrigation engineers with an equipment of knowledge that will render it an
                        easy matter to profit by their own experience and will guide them in the
                        straight road to success.</p>

                    <head>WHERE SMELLS COME FROM.</head>
                    <p>Is the sense of smell caused by gases or by particles is a question which Dr.
                        John Aitken, LL.D., F.R.S., the discoverer of the fact that dust particles
                        in the air are responsible for the formation of fog, has recently studied
                        with very interesting results. In the case, says the "Lancet," of all the
                        odorous substances with which he has so far experimented the answer is
                        decidedly in favor of the gaseous theory. The first substance under
                        investigation was musk, of which it is possible to detect by smell,
                        according to Berthelot, 0.000,000,000,000,000,01 gramme. It would follow
                        that the sense of smell is a refinement exceeding the delicacy of
                        spectroscopic methods, though it is probable that radio-activity may prove
                        to be a still more delicate method of detection. In his experiments Dr.
                        Aitken relied upon "the cloudy condensation test," in which, if odours are
                        due to particles, these particles become nuclei of cloudy condensation in
                        supersaturated air and thus make their presence visible. Careful tests made
                        in the way indicated and excluding adventitious substances gave no nuclei
                        from the musk, showing that the musk does not give off solid particles, but
                        evaporates as a gas or vapour, and that it is gaseous particles from the
                        musk that act on the sense of smell. Of twenty-three other odorsous
                        substances not one gave its perfume in solid particles, nothing but gases or
                        vapours escaping from them. Dr. Aitken points out also that our nostrils
                        seem to confirm this conclusion. The perfume of snoff, for example, "is a
                        soft velvety sensation, whilst the effect of the solid is sharp and biting,
                        more allied to pain than pleasure." Musk again, when "snuffed" has hardly
                        any effect, only the musky odour is observed when no musk dut touches the
                        nostrils.</p>

                    <p>On Friday, at Geziret Badrane, the Railway Institute won their return match
                        with the A.S.C. after a pleasant game, by scoring 5 goals to their
                        opponents' nil. Amongst the large gathering present were Sir Charles and
                        Mrs. Scotter, Mr. and Mrs. Trevithick, etc. For the first few minutes in the
                        opening half, the Institute defence was busily employed in stopping the
                        A.S.C. attacks, but by the home team's speed and endurance the tide was soon
                        turned. The last-named began attacking with tremendous pressure and
                        succeeded in scoring a couple of goals when half-time arrived. After the
                        change of ends, the game became very fast and the railway men quite
                        overpowered their visitors and added three more goals to their score. Sergt.
                        Brown, of the A.S.C., was referee.</p>

                    <p>The Government has agreed that the International Archaeological Congress,
                        which was convened this year in Athens, shall hold its next convention in
                        Cairo in 1907. The Khedive has consented to appoint a local committee of
                        arrangements ; the Athenian committee, however, to retain the general
                        management. It is also announced that the Transactions of the convention
                        held in Athens are to appear within the next few weeks, and are to be sold
                        through the trade at an exceptionally low price.</p>

                    <p>Some interesting statements for cultivators in the Delta are contained in the
                        administration report of the Irrigation Department in Lower Egypt for the
                        last year. Mr. Verschoyle remarks:--</p>
                    <p>There were a few grumbles at the end of July from those whom the good
                        supplies of May and June had induced to put in too much summer rice. Before
                        the Barrage weirs or the Reservoir came into action the Delta had to be
                        content with a discharge of 40 to 42 millions per day at the end of July, so
                        with an average discharge of 70 millions per day throughout the month, and,
                        so far as available statistics go, no great increase in cropped area, there
                        cannot have been any severe shortage of supply. No matter what may be the
                        supply available during the last 10 days of July and 1st week of August,
                        there will still be a cry for more, as every cultivator would then like to
                        water practically his whole culturable area at once.</p>

                    <p>The following telegram appears in an American paper:--</p>
                    <p>Goshen, Ind., Nov. 18.-The Rev. and Mrs. J. Lapp and the Rev. and Mrs. M. C.
                        Lehman, missionaries from Goshen college to India, are stranded on a
                        steamship at Port Said, Egypt, and a cablegram received here says the party
                        is in sore straits, the Rev. Mr. Lehman being in a dying condition with
                        typhoid fever.</p>
                    <p>Both the couples were married here just before sailing for Dhamtri, central
                        province of India, on Oct. 2. Mrs. Lapp was Miss Mary Ebersole, a trained
                        nurse, and Mrs. Lehman was Miss Emily Lichty, a Goshen college student.
                        Government representatives have been asked to look after the

                    <head>THE AKABA RAILWAY.</head>
                    <p>When the Hedjaz line had been laid from Damascus to Amman and surveys had
                        been pushed to Ma'an and the forbidding ravine of Batn el Ghoul it naturally
                        occurred to the Turkish military authorities that a branch line from Ma'an
                        to Akaba might be worth considering, and certain preliminary surveys were
                        carried out along the proposed route. Early in 1905 an Imperial iradé
                        authorised the local committee of the Hadjaz line which sits at Damascus to
                        lay a line along the route. Very shortly after the issue of the iradé,
                        counter orders came suspending the construction of the branch line, owing
                        apparently to the fact that certain arrangements had been entered into by
                        the Suez Canal Company and the Ottoman Government by which the dues on the
                        transport of Turkish troops were considerably lowered and that there was, on
                        that account, no particular reason for the construction of the line. The
                        fortification of Akaba has also been discussed and plans have been drawn up
                        by the Headquarters staff of the Vth Order for the construction of forts
                        armed with 5.9 inch cannon, but here again nothing has been done. Akaba is
                        in itself of little value except as a police station where a few parboiled
                        soldiers look after the Bedouin tribes, and even were the Ottoman Empire
                        unhappily involved in war, the post would not be likely to appeal to the
                        cupidity of an invader.</p>

                    <head>MODERN QUEEN ELEANORS.</head>
                    <p>One of the newly appointed lecturers at the Vienna University has raised a
                        pretty storm in that ever-bubbling teapot. Describing the character of
                        Eleonore d'Anjou, the wife of the English King, Henry II., he
                        parenthetically remarked that, like most emancipated women, she was careless
                        about her marriage vows.</p>
                    <p>One of his listeners was herself married, and her husband sent in a complaint
                        to the Rectorate. Then Professor Becker returned to the charge, and
                        maintained his assertion that the emancipation of woman brings with it
                        different ideas concerning love and marriage, as he had often had occasion
                        to observe. He did not wish thereby to allude to any of his present hearers,
                        but he protestes against anything which passed inside those walls being made
                        the subject of incompetent outside criticism.</p>
                    <p>This statement was received with great applause and ironical laughter and
                        comments by the male students, whereupon all the weaker sex rose and left
                        the hall in a body.</p>
                    <p>The incident is an unfortunate one, as the women students feel shy exposing
                        themselves to further remarks of their comrades. On the other hand, it is a
                        serious matter for them to relinquish the course of their studies. The
                        initial mistake, of course, was in taking notice of a casual observation on
                        the character of a historical personage.</p>

                    <head>A MOSLEM'S PROTEST. RESPONSIBILITY FOR RIOT.</head>
                    <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                    <p>Sir,-Please insert the following in your esteemed paper if possible.</p>
                    <p>Most of the Eurpoean writers, whether in Egypt or abroad, are accustomed to
                        call the Egyptians fanatics, and to accuse them whenever a dispute arises
                        between them and the foreign residents of the awful accusation of
                        fanaticism, and lay the responsibility of everything on their shoulders.
                        They never forward a word of blame to those foreign criminals who deserted
                        their countries and came to Egypt to disturb its tranquility and excite her
                        people. This attitude in itself is the true fanaticism in its wider sense.
                        For it is no doubt absurd to accuse a people as the Egyptians, who are
                        widely known as lovers of peace and tranquility and most generous to
                        foreigners, of fanaticism.</p>
                    <p>What it is most deplorable, is that the European press in Egypt declare
                        publicly that the vernacular press, and especially the "Al Lewa" newspaper,
                        provoked the Egyptians--"the shoe blacks"--against the European residents,
                        while they know very well the originators of the Alexandrian disturbance of
                        last Sunday, and are sure that it is not an anti-foreing movement.</p>
                    <p>The originators of the riot are the Greeks. Had they not attacked the
                        Egyptians nothing would have occurred.</p>
                    <p>The vernacular press, and especially the "Al Lewa," have always repeated the
                        fact that Christians are friends of Mohamedans and they both ought to live
                        on good terms with each other.</p>
                    <p>Who can declare impartially that the lowest classes of the Egyptians read the
                        Arabic Press even that they may become excited or fermented by what is
                        published in them. So what the anti-Egyptian European writers say about
                        Egypt and her people is absolutely wrong and vague.</p>
                    <p>It is to our satisfaction to see some of the moderate European writers who
                        are promoting agreement between the different nationalities in Egypt,
                        declare that the Greeks are the only disturbers who are responsible for the
                        Alexandrian incident.</p>
                    <p>The false accusations which the European press accuse the Egyptians of is a
                        true means of cultivating discord between them and the residents.</p>
                    <p>We believe that the only remedy for such a case as that of last Sunday is to
                        entitle the Mixed Courts with right of trying the criminal cases of the
                        foreigners who reside in Egypt and the disarmament of the Greeks
                        residents.</p>
                    <p>-Yours truly,</p>

                    <p>(From our Correspondent.)</p>
                    <p>London, December 9.</p>
                    <p>To-day as yesterday, no further appointments are announced. This was the
                        intimation which confronted visitors to Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman's house
                        in Belgrave square yesterday. No official information is hoped for until
                        Monday. Indeed, late yesterday afternoon a definite statement to this effect
                        was made the following notice being posted in the hall of 29.
                        Belgrave-square: "No announcement as to offices will be made until the
                        King's pleasure has been taken on his Majesty's return to town."</p>
                    <p>Not for the firsy time the Radicals will find themselves in a difficulty
                        concerning the appointment of a Mistress of the Robes, which office
                        according to long established usage, is not held by a peeress below the rank
                        of a duchess. As a matter of fact, there is no duchess whose husband holds
                        Radical views, and doubtless the same course will be taken as was adopted by
                        the late Mr. Gladstone in 1892, and was followed by Lord Rosebery, viz.,
                        that of making no appointment at all. The Duchess of Buccleuch was then, as
                        now, Mistress of the Robes, and as it was impossible for her to retain the
                        position under a Radical Government, Queen Victoria herself appointed two
                        ladies, the Dowager Duchesses of Roxburghe and Atholl, to perform in turn
                        the duties of attending on the Queen at State ceremonies.</p>
                    <p>It is possible that we shall not know for some little time the full extent of
                        the terrible accident at Charing-cross Station, but we may fairly hope that
                        the tale of deaths is now complete. The accident is almost, if not quite,
                        without a parallel in London, but it is nevertheless a very alarming one,
                        owing to the fact that there are in the metropolis a great many other
                        buildings of the same type, built in very much the same way, and of pretty
                        much the same date. It is not yet possible to determine the cause of the
                        accident, but there is, at any rate, good ground for asking that these other
                        buildings should be examined without delay.</p>
                    <p>Iron buildings have hardly yet been long enough in existence for anyone to
                        say how they will stand the test of time, but at any rate we know that they
                        must be continually painted if the iron is not to corrode and the whole
                        building come to the ground. This painting is very expensive, and it may be
                        noticed that in several quarters, notably on the Metropolitan Railway, there
                        is a disposition to discard this type of station, and revert to one which,
                        if darker and less roomy, does not entail such heavy maintenance
                        expenditure. It may be that we shall see a complete revulsion against the
                        station with the large span of iron and glass.</p>
                    <p>Charing-cross was built in 1863, and is a monument of mid-Victorian ugliness
                        which goes far to spoil the appearance of London. Presumably it will have to
                        be re-built as a result of this accident, and I sincerely hope that it may
                        be found possible to give us something which will be a credit to the
                        metropolis. Speaking broadly, our railway stations in London compare badly
                        in point of appearance with those of Germany, and the South-Eastern and
                        Chatham might do worse than take a hint from that country. It is, I suppose,
                        impossible to hope for the disestablishment of the hideous Hungerford
                        Bridge, but, at any rate, the new Charing cross might be reasonably
                        artistic.</p>
                    <p>The Charing Cross disaster, following closely upon the prompt detection of a
                        structural flaw at His Majesty's Theatre, has caused in the public mind a
                        certain feeling of uneasiness with regard to the safety of other public
                        buildings, and fear has found expression whether the Nelson Column, within a
                        few yards beneath which a new tubular railway will presently be running,
                        will be in the future as free from danger as it has been in the past.</p>
                    <p>Lord Roberts has obtained greater freedom for his crowning campaign by
                        resigning his last official post, but his career has given him such
                        authority that his responsibility is in no way lessened. Nor would he wish
                        it to be. He has thrown himself into this work of preaching universal
                        military training with as wholehearted a desire to stake everything on it as
                        he ever showed in most daring feats of war. To those who see in his crusade
                        the threat of militarism and conscription, his speech at Newcastle may be
                        earnestly recommended for study. They will be forced to admit that
                        conscription is a very different matter from the scheme advocated by Lord
                        Roberts-the inculcation of practical patriotism into children, military
                        training in all State-sided schools, cadet corps in all schools and colleges
                        and of the boys' brigade type, and a period of some months' continuous
                        training for every able-bodied young man in the country. Only in this way
                        can we secure a true reserve force, pledged and equal to the defence of this
                        country against any invader, and including a large proportion likely to
                        volunteer for service abroad in the case of a great emergency. There is
                        nothing in this, surely, to scare the most timid, and even in a
                        Campbell-Bannerman period the cause should make headway.</p>
                    <p>Very satisfactory figures have just been published giving the latest
                        recruiting returns. A certain distrust has, however, always prevailed of the
                        reports made by this often sorely vexed department. We are apt to question
                        the accuracy and the permanence of the results claimed. Now, however, there
                        seems little doubt that the method of nine years' enlistment which began
                        fourteen months ago has been a success. Much apprehension was felt at the
                        outset as to the willingness of candidates to accept service for the
                        lengthened term. The totals given are nevertheless in excess of those in the
                        best years, exclusive of the war period. It is stated, moreover, that at
                        this present time enlistment is particularly brisk, better indeed by 20 per
                        cent. of the numbers shown in the corresponding period of last year. Very
                        sanguine conclusions are being drawn from the fact that the two terms of
                        service, short and long, are now in progress concurrently without the one
                        injuriously affecting the other. It is claimed also that a general
                        improvement in physique and social respectability has been exhibited in the
                        men now joining. Some qualification of this reassuring statement is to be
                        noted, however, in the marked increase of medical rejections, which in some
                        cases it is reported has risen to more than 80 per cent. of the applicants.
                        This strengthens the uncomfortable and disquieting belief that the race is
                        steadily degenerating. At the same time it is eing proved to demonstration
                        that the advantages of military service are better appreciated among the
                        classes that enlist.</p>
                    <p>One of the most interesting articles in the "Live Stock Journal Almanac" for
                        1906 is that by Sir Walter Gilbey on "How Betting should Aid Agriculture,
                        and how £300,000 could Annually be Devoted to Stock-Breeding and Hospitals."
                        Of course, the suggestion is that the bookmaker should be suppressed and his
                        place be taken by the pari-mutuel or totalisator. Sir Walter is plainly
                        impressed by the results that accrue from the operation of the pari-mutuel
                        in France. In the year 1901 £9,038,278 was turned over at the mutuels on
                        French racecourses. The authorities deducted 7 per cent., of which 1 per
                        cent. (£90,383) was applied to horse-breeding, 2 per cent. (180,766) to
                        public charities, and 4 per cent. (381,532) went in working expenses. At
                        Kalgeorlie, in Western Australia, £123,231 was taken at the totalistor in
                        three days, and at Johannesburg one day this year the turnover was £66,000.
                        From these figures we may, says Sir Walter, gain some idea of what a week at
                        Ascot or Epsom would produce. Little wonder, he adds, that Paris can afford
                        to give £x2,000 for a single horse show and provide horses for her army at
                        any moment, while at the same time her poor rates are as nothing compared
                        with outs. Then he proceeds: Would those who are opposed to betting have as
                        much to say against this reformation in the system of betting and racing as
                        they have now? It is as impossible to put a stop to betting as it would be
                        to close the Stock Exchange, Lloyd's or our insurance business. Our
                        Legislature has already drawn as tight cords of restriction on betting as it
                        could devise, but has hitherto failed to recognise the fact that by copying
                        the example of other countries in the way I have endeavored to explain it
                        will deal a blow to much of the rascality of the Turf, and practically of
                        betting, and at the same time immensely benefit the country."</p>
                    <p>The Jews of all countries have reason to be proud of the success of their
                        efforts for the relief of the sufferers by the recebt outrages in Russia. Up
                        to last night no less than £401,000 had been contributed to the fund
                        initiated and superintended by Lord Rothschild. England and America are
                        responsible for a large share of the total, £85,000 having come from this
                        side and £190,000 from the other side of the Atlantic. Here is irrefragable
                        proof that in the hour of trial the Jew, wherever he be situated, feels the
                        call of nationality. There may also be found in it some encouragement for
                        Mr. Zangwill and his fellow Zionists, whose enthusiasm to many seems founded
                        on the sand, but who may gather from the fund further inspiration and faith
                        that the Jew recognises the ties of brotherhood when they are accompanied by
                        the cry of distress. If he be convinced that the only way to alleviate that
                        distress permanently be reunion in one land, he may--it is not beyong the
                        bounds of possibility--make greater sacrifices than the subscription of some
                        hundreds of thousand of pounds. </p>
                    <p>The last of the regular steam trains puffed itself off the District Railway
                        at midnight on Saturday. It is impossible to pump up any sentiment about
                        this disappearance, good servant in its dirty, makeshift way though the
                        underground "puff-puff" has been for a third of a century. In a generation
                        or two the surviving veterans who spin ghastly, and perfectly true, stories
                        of the horrors of the old Inferno round about Westminster Bridge station,
                        for instance, will be pitied as incorrigible old liears by an incredulous
                        posterity. Already the point has arrived for grumbling at the imperfections
                        and drawbacks of the new electricity. There is room for improvement in some
                        respects, undoubtedly ; but even "straphanging" in the new cars is an
                        improvement on the Black Hole of Calcutta experiences of a football
                        afternoon, with nineteen or more people in one compartment, on the old steam
                        trains. And we are all learning how to dash out of those sliding central
                        doors without being nipped, or to get in and out of any door that we prefer
                        in sublime defiance of rules.</p>
                    <p>England's decisive defeat by the New Zealand team cannot be said to have come
                        as a shock. There was generally felt to be no reason why she should do any
                        better than Scotland or Ireland had done, and against the fact that she did
                        considerably worse we have been hardened by the sad experiences of recent
                        years, in the course of which England has often had to realise that, in
                        Rugby football, at any rate, she has no reason to speak disrespectfully of
                        the Celtic fungus. The Rugby "ashes" have gone often enough to Edinburgh,
                        Dublin, or Cardiff. To Wales alone the Old Country has now to look for a
                        possible bright spot in the "All Black" story of this winter, and it is
                        satisfactory to learn that the confidence of the Welshmen in their champions
                        is "amazing." Confidence is no small factor in a football match ; and we are
                        even glad to be reminded of the humiliating fact that last year, Wales beat
                        England by ten points more than the New Zealanders did on Saturday.</p>
                    <p>The determination of the working-men's clubs in Durham and Northumberland to
                        combine to brew their own beer is an altogether novel development of the
                        co-operative principle, and one whoch may have far-reaching consequences. It
                        will probably, for instance, considerably modify the views of the
                        working-class electors in these counties towards the Licensing Act. It may
                        also serve to direct the attention of Parliament to those working-men's
                        political clubs-Radical, we are glad to say, almost exclusively-which, in
                        spite of the efforts of the Legislature, are still merely means for evading
                        the regulations which compel the ordinary licensed victualler to close
                        during certain hours of Sunday.</p>

                        Ago-Still Well To-Day.</head>
                    <p>54, Brighton Place, Hampton Square,</p>
                    <p>Sheen Lane, Mortlake,</p>
                    <p>London, England.</p>
                    <p>For nearly 19 years I suffered from stricture and kidney disease, and many a
                        time have I laid on the bedroom floor writhing in agony. Twice I have been
                        in hospital and undergone operations for the stricture. Never, as long as I
                        live, shall I forget what I want through them. The doctors said I could not
                        live another three months, yet I can truly say that, although two years have
                        passed since then, I was never better in my life than I am to-day.</p>
                    <p>My illness came on in this way: One day at work, I strained my back, and
                        afterwards I suffered from severe cutting pains just over where the kidneys
                        are, especially when I stooped. I could not sleep well at nights, and there
                        were distressing urinary disorders. I was miserable and out of sorts, and
                        although the doctor did all he could for me, I got worse instead of better.
                        If I had a glass of beer it irritated my kidneys so much that I had to keep
                        to my bed for a week, btu since using Doan's Backache Kidney Pills, I can
                        enjoy my glass without feeling a bit the worse for it.</p>
                    <p>It wasn't until I had finished the fourth box of Doan's Pills that they
                        seemed to be doing me any good, but I persisted with the medicine, and with
                        the fifth box there was a decidedly freer action of the bladder. No other
                        medicine had ever helped me at all, and you can imagine how delighted I was
                        at this relief. For six months I continued with Doan's Backache Kidney
                        Pills, and then I was entirely cured of the stricture and kidney disease.
                        From that day to this there hasn't been any sign of the old complaints
                        returning.</p>
                    <p>My suffering any my cure are well-known to hundreds of men I have worked with
                        in London, and I am sure that had I not used Doan's Backache Kidney Pills
                        when I did, I should never have lived.</p>

                        Port Said on the 19th, and at Bombay on the 19th inst.</p>
                    <p>Lieutenant-Colonel Stanley Bird, Royal Fusiliers (who is well known in
                        Egypt), the new chief of the 1st Battalion at Parkhurst, Isle of Wight, has
                        been associated with that distinguished regiment for over twenty-two years.
                        He received his first commission in August, 1883, his captaincy in 1891, was
                        promoted major in 1898, and since March, 1901, was second in command of his
                        present battalion. While serving in Egypt as a staff captain he shared in
                        Kitchener's advance of Khartoum (mentioned in despatches, British medal,
                        Khedive's medal with clasp).</p>
                    <p>Brevet Colonel G. F. Leslie, Rifle Brigade, has vacated the command of the
                        4th Battalion at Malta, and has been succeeded by Lieutenant-Colonel V. A.
                        Cooper, second in command of the 3rd battalion at Aden. Major W. G.
                        Beutinck, D. S. O., who for some time has been employed as a Resident
                        Magistrate in the Trasvaal, has taken his retired pay. The vacancy thus
                        created has been filled by the promotion to substantive rank of Captain and
                        Brevet-Major R. B. Stephens, now in the Staff College.</p>
                    <p>Major-General Baden-Powell, Inspector of Cavalry, will accompany H.R.H. the
                        Duke of Connaught during his South African tour. The Duke will visit all the
                        notable battlefields of the late war.</p>
                    <p>Lieutenant A. W. Norris, Royal Berkshire Regiment, recently employed with the
                        Gold Coast Regiment, on returning to regimental duty, has been posted to the
                        1st Battalion at Dublin, with effect from the 18th inst.</p>
                    <p>The 3rd Battalion Rifle Brigade will embark at Aden on the S.S. Assaye the
                        15th inst. en route for England. The liner is due at Southampton on New
                        Year's Day. The battalion will proceed to Plymouth, where it will be
                        stationed. It will absorb the details left by the 4th Battalion when it went
                        to Malta.</p>
                    <p>The army may once more be consigned to the melting pot. Mr. Arnold-Forster's
                        "reforms" have stopped short under the influence of the dissolution. What
                        his successor has in store is a question not easily answered, but it is a
                        comforting remembrance that Liberal administration has never been marked by
                        heroic methods. That party, like the Conservative party up till recent
                        years, was quite content to muddle on when in office, fortified by a faith
                        in Providence, and an unlimited belief in Tommy Atkins and his fighting
                        abilities, though never giving any tangible proof of that in the way of
                        increased emoluments.</p>
                    <p>The Channel Fleet, including the First Cruiser Squadron, will leave England
                        in about a fortnight for Vigo, and then proceed to Arosa Bay, spending
                        Christmas at Lisbon. During January, the ship will visit Lagos and Las
                        Palmas, returning to Gibraltar on February 1 for combined manoeuvres with
                        the Mediterranean and Atlantic Fleets together with their respective Cruiser
                        Squadrons under the Admiral Sir A. K. Wilson, of the Channel Fleet.</p>

                        causes (for they are almost numberless), its symptoms are much the same; the
                        more prominent being sleeplessness, sense of prostration or weariness,
                        depression of spirits and want of energy for all the ordinary affairs of
                        life. Now, what alone is absolutely essential in all such cases is increased
