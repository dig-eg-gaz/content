                        <p>An artistic wall covering.</p>
                        <p>This celebrated water paint is made in two qualities for Inside and

                        <p>HALL’S SANITARY WASHABLE DISTEMPER is rapidly superseding wall papers in
                            all tastefully furnished homes. It is made in 70 artistic tints, and
                            only requires the addition of water to make it ready for use. It is
                            quickly and easily applied with a whitewash brush, with half the labour
                            and at one third the cost of paint. HALL’S DISTEMPER ensures
                            cleanliness, and is pleasing to the eye. It appeals alike to artistic
                            and practical house decoration.</p>
                        <p>HALL’S DISTEMPER is of special value in hot climates. Owing to its cool,
                            pleasing colours, great weather-resisting and germ-destroying
                            properties, it lends itself to every kind of wall, wood, brick or stone
                            coating, possessing all the advantages of paint, colour- wash, and
                            disinfectant at one third the cost of oil paint. It never blisters in
                            the hottest sun, and the fact that it can be washed adds greatly to its
                            sanitary advantages.</p>

                            <p>While the Prince and Princess of Wales are passing through the Suez
                                Canal en route to the East, the elder members of the British
                                community in Egypt will no doubt recall the interest that was
                                excited by the departure of our present King, the Prince of Wales,
                                for the East in 1875. Then the royal itinerary included Cairo, and
                                the Prince rejoined the transport Serapis at Suez, reaching Aden on
                                the 1dt of November and Bombay on the 8th, the eve of his birthday.
                                The present Prince of Wales will reach Bombay on that auspicious
                                date and we do not doubt that the 9th of November will be celebrated
                                with even greater manifestations of joy and patrio- ism than usual,
                                owing to the presence among our fellow-subjects of the Heir-Apparent
                                and his gracious consort.</p>
                            <p>Since the last Egypt and India have changed. Under the enlightened
                                rule of H.H. the Khedive and the guidance of Lord Cromer and a
                                devoted and energetic band of officials, Egypt, from a bankrupt
                                despotism, has become one of the most enlightened and progressive of
                                Oriental states. The Sudan, once a province where corrupt and
                                tyrannous officials made their fortunes or lost their lives, a drain
                                on Egypt's resources and a breeding ground for the forces of
                                violence and fanaticism which were to lay it desolate, has become a
                                well-governed and promising country, to-day a useful recruit- ing
                                ground and a valuable commercial asset, to-morrow one of the most
                                productive regions of Africa. In Egypt, as in the Sudan, justice has
                                been purified, education is making great strides, and in all that
                                concerns the material side of human development the country has
                                progressed astonishingly since 1875.</p>
                            <p>India, too, has changed, though the history of India shows more ups
                                and downs, more alternations of war and famine with peace and
                                prosperity, than that of Egypt in the last generation. Upper Burmah
                                has been annexed; Mysore has been restored to its royal houses, and
                                remains a well-managed and in some ways a model principality; the
                                industrial and com- mercial development of the country has in-
                                creased enormously; railway communications have been extended, and
                                despite the savage backwardness of some and the proud con servatism
                                of others among the many races of our great dependency, education
                                making rapid pro- gress. Wars have, it is true, retarded in some
                                degree the development of the Indian Empire. THe hill tribes have
                                given constant trouble and still require the vigilant watch of our
                                frontier garrisons, Anglo-Indian armies have entered Kabul and
                                Kandshar, Mandalay and Lhassa, and events beyond the N.W. frontier
                                have made a reorganisation of the Indian Army a necessity. It is
                                unfortunate that this reor- ganisation should have led to a dispute
                                be- tween one of the ablest of British soliders and the most
                                energetic and far-seeing of recent Viceroys of India, but it will be
                                in some measure a consolation to Lord Curzon to be able to welcome
                                the Prince and Princess of Wales on their arrival to the dependency
                                which has so ably and so justly ruled.</p>

                    <p><placeName>ST. PETERSBURG</placeName>, October 26. Immense meetings of
                        students, workmen, and others took place yesterday evening in the

                            <placeName>Russia</placeName>, and all trades are paralized. 3,000

                        the strike are being fed and sheltered by authorities. Tradesmen are
                        exasperated at the dislocation of business. At the conclusion of a Council
                        of Ministers held at <placeName>Peterhoff</placeName>, the Ministers were
                        conveyed to <placeName>St. Petersburg</placeName> in an Imperial Yacht, as
                        they were unable to return by rail.</p>
                    <p>There has been a conflict at <placeName>Nicolai station</placeName> between
                        the strikers and several engine-drivers who were desirous of taking out a

                        this morning. Several shops were plundered. Tho streets are crowded
                        with-workmen, and the shops are rapidly, closing.</p>
                    <p>The Cossacks dispersed a meeting of 7,000 workmen, wounding a hundred. Eight
                        Cossacks were injured by stones. The railway bridge over the
                            <placeName>Obvodny Canal</placeName> has been destroyed. Else- where the
                        city is quiet, overawed by the strong display of troops. Two track loads of
                        arms and ammunition which arrived at tho terminus of the <placeName>Finnish
                            Railway</placeName> in the morning were carried off before the police
                        arrived to seize them.</p>
                    <p>The Council of Ministers has definitely decided in favor of the formation of
                        a Cabinet. The Premier will be entitled to propose mi- nisterial

                        associat with their decorative work. The Princess's day saloon, with the
                        bedroom and bathroom attached, is upholstered with cream challis having a

                        Highness’s voyage, but several fine mezzotint engravings were sent from York

                        tissue of pink and blue, the table cloths are pale blue bordered with white
                        silk and fringe, and the curtains are of the same material as those in the
                        dining- room, the electric lights being enclosed in opaque glass with shades
                        of pink.</p>

                    <p>The floors of all the apartments are covered with very fine matting. Numerous
                        semi-struc- tural alterations have been made for the accom- modation of the

                        into two rooms which will serve as lounge and reading rooms. These are

                    <p>We are glad to hear that there is every likelihood of a British Club being
                        formed in <placeName>Alexandria</placeName> before the New Year. There are
                        many young Englishmen now established in this town, and their number is
                        annually in- creasing. At present there is no place whore they can meet in
                        the evening to enjoy that club life which is so dear to the Englishman's
                        heart, so any attempt seriously made to form a suitable club will no doubt
                        meet with wide sympathy. There must of course be a well-stocked
                        reading-room, billiard and card-rooms, and a bar, and these we see are
                        included int he scheme. Some difficulty may arise about finding a suitable
                        "locale,” but on this point the gentlemen who reply favorably to the
                        circular which has just been issued by the promoters will be consulted.</p>
                    <p>It is obviously impossible to reach all would-be members by means of a
                        circular, so it is hoped that those who receive the circular will mention
                        the matter to their friends and let it be known that application forms may
                        be obtained from any of the provisional committee, which is composed of
                        Admiral:- <persName>Sir Massie Blomfield</persName>, K.C.M.G.,
                            <persName>Captain Borton</persName>, <persName>Mr. P. W.
                            Carver</persName>, <persName>Mr. R C. Crafton</persName>,
                            <persName>Mr.K. P. Birley</persName>, <persName>Mr. W. F.
                            Sarjeant</persName>,<persName> Mr. P. A. Malone</persName>,
                            <persName>Mr. H. S. Martin</persName>, and <persName>Mr. A. R.
                            Purvis</persName>, hon. sec. (pro tem). This committee will only act
                        until a general meeting can be called to elect its own committee.</p>
                    <p>It is evident no club can be started without a sufficient number of promises
                        to join, and as tho annual subscription is fixed at P.T. 150, tho club will
                        be within the reach of all. That a sufficient sum for furnishing the club is
                        to be given as a free gift is an encouraging feature for it is essential
                        that the club be bright and well-furnished, and not start with a debt on its
                        shoulders.</p>

                    <p>The Ministry of the Interior have issued a a note relative to the expenses
                        incurred by the pilgrims who accompany the Mahmal to
                            <placeName>Mecca</placeName>. The accounts which have been drawn up by,
                        the Ministry of Finance show that last year the travelling expenses of the
                        pilgrims accompany- ing the Mahmal exceeded the sum deposited, by them for
                        the defraying of such expenses, and the Government has had to pay the
                        excess. "The surplus” according to the text of the note, “has become such a
                        heavy charge that the Government cannot support it." It has therefore boon
                        decided to increase by a small amount the sum to be deposited by each
                        pilgrim who wishes to accompany the Mahmal, but should the amount thus
                        deposited exceed the expenses of the journey the surplus will be reimbursed
                        to the pilgrims.</p>
                    <p>This note also draws attention to the fact that in former years, in
                        consequence of the existence of plague in <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, the
                        Sanitary Board of Constantinople subjected pilgrims going to the Hedjax, to
                        a preliminary quarantine, which, with the disinfection, gave rise to the
                        levy of a maximum tax of L.E. 50 per pilgrim. This tax was payable at
                            <placeName>Suez</placeName> and caused considerable embarrassment to the
                        pilgrims who did not. know beforehand that such a call would be made upon
                        them.</p>
                    <p>The Government has therefore decided that this sum must be deposited in
                        advance, as well as the L.E. 56 ordinarily deposited for the quarantine
                        expenses on the return journey by all the pilgrims who do not accompany the
                        Mahmal.</p>
                    <p>Under such conditions the pilgrim will have already paid all expenses, be it
                        for disinfection at <placeName>Suez</placeName>, or Tor, or for the
                        preliminary quaran- tine, and will not have to further concern himself with
                        the payments of tho different taxes for these several operations. If
                        quarantine on the way to <placeName>Mecca</placeName> and disinfection are
                        not necessary, as there is every reason to hope will be the case this year,
                        the excess amount deposited by the pilgrim will be refunded to him on his
                        return.</p>

                    <head>SALVINI AS “HAMLET.”</head>
                    <p>Cavaliere Salvini, who is at present occupy- ing the boards of the Zizinia
                        Theatre, took his “benefit" last night, when he appeared in Shakespeare’s
                        sublime tragedy Hamlet. The occasion was a veritable triumph for the great
                        Italian tragedian. Although some little exception might be taken to the pro-
                        duction as a whole, there was no gainsaying the power of Salvini’s
                        impersonation of the Prince of Denmark. His conception of Hamlet differed
                        from those we have been accustomed to see on the English stage in that there
                        was little of that melancholia with which the character is generally
                        invested. From the days of Kemble downwards, our Hamlets have all suffered
                        too much of the megrims. They have had too strong an affinity with the
                        Stranger. But "melancholy,” in the case of Hamlet, is not the word. The King
                        and Queen think, or prefer to pretend to think, that he is melancholy ; but
                        Hamlet is really enbittered, soured, indignant It is not the loss of his
                        father that is “within” him and passes show in the first act, but the haunt-
                        ing suspicions which arise within his "pro- phetic soul,” the desperate
                        disillusion caused by his mother's indecent haste to marry again, and the
                        ruin of his own prospects. A man so beset with mind troubles is not
                        melancholy ; he is overstrung. As a protest against the old, slow,
                        pump-handle preachy than acceptable, interesting, and .thrilling. There were
                        moments last night when Salvini rose to the greatest heights of his
                        wonderful genius, and kept his audience absolutely spell- bound. The scene
                        with his terrified mother in the fourth act was a masterpiece of dramatic
                        art. <persName>Cavaliere Salvini</persName> laboured under the heavy
                        disadvantage of a bad cold, but his magnificent elocution was not for a
                        single instant impaired, and the thunders of applause which greeted each
                        fall of the curtain de- monstrated the great hold the actor had ob- tained
                        over his auditors. Sig. Cesare Olivieri was a spirited 'Laertes. Sig.
                        Camillo Aureli was careful and commendable, but hardly pompons and
                        self-important enough as Polonius and Sig. Giyola was'an. inoffensive-
                        Horatio. ( Sig. Diaz emphasised the villainy of Claudius in make-up and
                        manner, but his performance was hardly convincing. Signa. Fortuzzi-Podda was
                        a fragile and sympathetic Ophelia, and was particularly effective in the
                        "mad” scene; while Signa. Aliprandi made a very natural but not altogether
                        imposing Queen. The mounting of the piece was not all that it might have
                        been, but any defeats in that respect were fully made up for by the
                        brilliance of <persName>Cav. Salvini</persName>’s performance.</p>

                    <p>The death of this distinguished officer re- moves from the scene one of the
                        leading figures of the <placeName>Nile</placeName> expedition of 1884.5.
                        Born at <placeName>Liverpool</placeName> on the 14th March, 1836, and
                        educated at Cheltenham College, young Wilson gave the first proof of his
                        remarkable abilities by passing the second in the first open competition for
                        admission to the Royal Engineers. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant
                        in 1855 (at the early age of nineteen) and from 1858 to 1862 acted as a
                        Secretary to the North American Boundary Commission. His sur- vets of
                            <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName> and <placeName>Palestine</placeName>,
                        1864-66, brought him further credit, and his work on the Ordnance Survey of
                        Scotland, 1866-68, and as assistant commissioner of the Borough Boundary
                        Commission added to his reputation. In 1868-69 he surveyed the
                            <placeName>Sinai Peninsula</placeName>, and was immediately afterwards
                        appointed Director of the Topographical Department of the War Office and
                        A.Q.M.G of the Intelli- gence Department. He was elected F.R.S in 1874 and
                        the rank of C.B (civil) was conferred on him in 1877 for his services in the
                        organisa- ion of the Intelligence Department. After work on Royal
                        Commissions and the Ordnance Survey of Ireland he was appointed British
                        Commissioner of the Servan Boundary Com- mission, and Consul-General in
                        Anatolia, and was sent on a special mission to Eastern Rou- melia in 1880.
                        In the Egyptian campaign of 1882 <placeName>Sir Charles Wilson</placeName>
                        joined Lord Wolse- ley as D.A.G., Intelligence Department, and on January 8
                        joined the Desert Column with orders to proceed with <placeName>Lord
                            Charles</placeName> Beresford to Khartoum after the occu- patron of
                        Metemmeh, and deliver a letter from <persName>Lord Wolseley</persName> to
                        General Gordon. After distinguishing himself at Abon Kles, where he helped
                        to rescue <persName>Sir Herbert Stewart</persName> from three dervishes, he
                        took over the command on the 18th January, after <persName>Sir Herbert
                            Stewart</persName> had been wounded, and led the force that had to fight
                        for the Nile and water on that memo- table day. On January 24 he started up
                        for Khartoum in command of two “penny steamers” containing crews and
                        soldiers absolu- tele without discipline, and twenty English soldiers. All
                        the world knows the story of that desperate venture, that came, alas just
                        too late. Sir Wilson recrossed the Bayed steppe, a distance of 175 miles, in
                        four days, riding 60 miles on the last day, and brought the news of the
                        safety of the steamers. He received the thanks of the Government for his
                        services, the Sudan medal with two clasps and the decoration of K.C.B.
                        Shortly after his return to England he wrote “From Korti to Khartoum,” one
                        of the best descriptions of the experiences of the desert column extant.
                            <placeName>Sir Charles Wilson </placeName>became Director-General of the
                        Ordnance Survey from 1886 to 1894, and in 1895 became Director General of
                        Mili- tary Education, retiring in 1898. From 1897 to 1902 he was
                        Vice-President of the Royal Geographical Society, having twice presided over
                        the meetings of the geographical section of the British Association. Among
                        his works were “Picturesque Palestine” and “the Life of Lord Clive” (Men of
                        Action series), and he edited Murray’s handbooks to Asia Minor and
                            <placeName>Constantinople</placeName>. He was created K.C.M.G in 1881
                        and held the additional distinctions of D.C.L (oxon), LL.D. (Edin), M.E.
                        (Dublin), besides being a fellow of the Royal and of the Royal Geographical
                        Societies.</p>

                        <p>The E.T.C staff opened their football season yesterday with a match
                            against the Depart- mental Corps on the Mustafa ground. Play- ing with
                            the wind in the first half, the E.T.C. did most of the pressing, and
                            though the home goalkeeper had several shots to negotiate the teams
                            crossed over with a blank sheet. In the second half the play was more
                            evenly divided, the visitors having reconstructed their forward line,
                            but it was not until two minutes from time that Byrne, from a pass by
                            Collier, scored the only goal of the match; the E.T.C. thus winning by
                            one to nil. The home team had bad luck in the second half and should
                            certainly have scored. <persName>Gunner Davis</persName> played a fine
                            back game for the “Dep- artments,” and the trio of E.T.C. halves did
                            excellently ; their defencs and that of “Lees at back being mainly
                            responsible for their win.</p>

                    <p>The following report, dated September 22, which is of the utmost importance
                        in its bearing upon the value of the "extensive laud grants made by the
                        Egyp- tian Government to the Corporation, has been received from Mr. H. J.
                        L. Beadnell, the Cor- poration’s Manager in the Oases and Geolo- gical
                        Expert. It. should be remembered that Mr. Beadnell speaks with nine years’
                        intimate acquaintance with the Oases, and as it will | be seen that no
                        difficulty is likely to be ex- perienced in obtaining artesian supplies of
                        water, the successful irrigation of these lands is seemingly assured.</p>

                    <head>NOTE ON THE WATER SUPPLY OP KHARGBH AND DAKHLA.</head>
                    <p>The present output of water from the wells of the Southern Oases (Khargeh and
                        Dakhla) may be taken as approximately 200,000,000 cubic metres per annum.
                        This water is suffi- cient to irrigate 30,000 acres, the duty being some
                        6,600 acres per cubic metre per second. The underground artesian supply
                        being prac- tically inexhaustible, tho output at the sur- face may be almost
                        indefinitely augmented, provided tho wells are sunk in suitable loca- lities
                        and kept sufficiently far apart to avoid any appreciable reduction of the
                        hydrostatic , pressure.</p>
                    <p>The region of the Oases being practically rainless, the origin of the
                        underground water must be looked for in remote regions. In all probability
                        the supply is derived from the rainy districts of Darter and from the swamps
                        of the Bahr el Gharal. Those appears to be a considerable difference between
                        the amount cf water discharged into the swamps from the various tributaries
                        of the Nile and the theoretical amount lost by evaporation, and this
                        difference may bo accounted for by un- dergrouud leakage. This water,
                        together with that from the rains of Darfur, flows north- wards through tho
                        porous beds of the Nubian Sandstone, which have a general dip to the north.
                        It is kept down by impermeable bods of clay, through which it rises under
                        pres- sure when those are pierced by borings. The difference of level
                        between the water-bearing stratum in the Oases and the swamps of the sudd
                        district is over 400 metres.</p>
                    <p>Up to the present time practically the whole supply of water is from one or
                        more beds of sandstone lying at an average depth of 120 metres below the
                        Oases floor. It is quite possible, therefore, that still deeper borings
                        would strike other water-bearing ta- bles; in which the water would be under
                        still greater pressure. Such a supply would be invaluable for those
                        districts in which, owing to the higher average level of the cultivable
                        land, or or? account of the excessive number of existing wells, the water
                        from the existing source does not rise with sufficient pressure to reach the
                        surface.</p>
                    <p>The Oases lands have one great advantage over those of the Nile Valley in
                        that they are not dependent on the time, volume and dura- tion of the Nile
                        Flood. With proper care and attention the output of wells remains constant
                        and, in several instances wells sunk thousands of years ago by the Romans
                        and early Egyptians, are still yielding over 500 gallons a minute.</p>

                    <p>AN ELEPHANT’S 'ESCAPADE.</p>
                    <p>The little French town of Agen was last week thrown into consternation by an
                        elephant in panic. A dramatised version of Jules Verne’s “Round the World of
                        Eighty Days" is being played at tho loo it theatre, and an elephant bad been
                        hired for the purpose. The elephant, a powerful young beast, was being taken
                        through the streets to the theatre, with his keeper in regulation position
                        on the howdah. Somehow the unwanted spectacle seemed to, attract to the line
                        of route every dog in Agen, and there was such a pandemonium of yelping that
                        the elephant gave way to something like frenzy. Wi h tail in the air, and
                        trumpeting loudly, he tore at full gallop through the streets, scattering
                        everything before him right and left, to the imminent peril of the man in
                        the howdah, who, however, had the presence mind to stick close to his perch.
                        It was not until the brute £ad crashed into the middle of a large shop
                        through its plate glass frontage, and had ruined the entire stock of a
                        leading tradesman that he consented to ff fleet upon the indecorous levity
                        of his antics. When be had duly considered matters he permitted himself to
                        be again directed towards the theatre, leaving much wreckage' and a heavy
                        bill of costs behind him.</p>

                    <head>PIGMIES IN ANCIENT EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>M. Edouard Naville, D.C.L., L.L.D, writes I M follows to the ‘Lauoet" :—
                        Sir,—The articles of Dr. G. Blliot Smith I and Dr. A. Churchward both
                        contain informa- tion which is highly interesting for Egyptolo- gists. I
                        have often advocated the idea that in our researches we look too much
                        towards the Semitic world in Asia and that we should find explanations of
                        difficulties in the religion, the oastoms, and oven the language of tho old
                        Egyptians if we studied more carefully the African populations wk ch were
                        their neigh- bours.</p>
                    <p>As for dwarfs or pigmies I cannot agree with the opinion of my eminent
                            friend,<placeName> M. Maspero</placeName>, on this point I believe the
                        Egyptian texts mention two different kinds. One is the real dwarf, the
                        deformed being whom rich people like to have in their houses for amusement
                        and chiefly for dancing. Their misshapen bodies seem to me the prototypes of
                        the god Bes and also of a form of Phtah, as has been conclusively shown by
                            <persName>Dr. Carrot</persName> (Rucueil II, p. 129). But in other cases
                        I think that the Egyptians really meant pigmies. For instance, the Dangaof
                        the kings of the Sixth Dynasty must be pigmies. Dwarfs are not rare in
                            <placeName>Egypt</placeName> and if the Danga had been only small and
                        distorted bodies 1 see no reason by their arrival is
                            <placeName>Egypt</placeName> should have been an event, why the kings
                        should have valued them so much, and why an officer should have recorded in
                        his biography that he brought with him one of those beings if they were Lot
                        of rare occurrence. The Danga must have belonged to an African tribe which
                        bad especial propensity to dancing like other full- sized African
                        populations. In the temples at <placeName>Dier-el-Bahari</placeName> and at
                        Luxor we see dancing executed by the Tarnahu, a well-known African nation.
                        They occur in various exorcises for the occasion, they wear ostrich
                        feathers, and they are called "the dancers of the royal b >at." If the case
                        of the Daugai is still doubtful can quote two instances in which it seems to
                        be certain that Sixth Dynasty must be pigmies. In the sculptures which
                        describe a great festival in the temple at Bubastis we see a procession of
                        priests, among whom are three small men matching along cud holding long
                        canes. They have a title which Bubastis trans- bates "guards,” ' beadles,"
                        something connected with the police pf the temple. These guards are neither
                        children n. r dwarfs ; they are well proportioned and are certainly pigmies.
                        They are probably not Egyptians, for we find in the same ceremony another
                        African population, the Ann or Anti of Nubia, coming from the south, A third
                        extraordinary figure in a man having a face like Bes but a well-proportioned
                        body. The inscription which is above the figure can- not be understood ; it
                        ends with “nanasu nana,' which may be this man's language. Another instance
                        where we find the pigmies mentioned is in a nome or district inscription
                        from tho temple at I hike of the time of Pto- lemy IV. It begins with the
                        nome of Nubia, where we find the words : "I give my bow to 11 his Majesty
                        that he may subdue the Anti... I the dwarfs of the countries of the sooth
                        bring I their tributes to his palace.” Now it is clear that here we must
                        translate pigmies and not | dwarfs. Dwarfs could not pay tribute, it must I
                        be a settled population. Here, again, as at I Bubastis, they are quoted with
                        the Anti and I are said to come 'from the south where we I expect to find
                        the pigmies.</p>
                    <p>I might add to these two instances the I population called the "Pit" which
                        Brusch o naiders as the of Herodotus, and his I identification seems
                        probable, but it requires I further proofs, as this name, which means the I
                        springer, or the leaper, may be only an epithet I describing their dancing
                        abilities.</p>

                    <p>FRENCH RESERVE OFFICERS.</p>
                    <p>The controversy that has arisen around the I fall of <persName>M.
                            Delcass</persName>e has at least had one definite result. It has brought
                        to the light of day the weak points in the defensive resources of France. I
                        Early in the discussion it was revealed that the frontier fortresses on the
                        East were in no con- dition for meeting a bombardment. Now we I learn that
                        the territorial army, on which, of course, the balk of the fighting would
                        fall in cue of invasion, is in a sad state of dfiorganisa- tion owing to the
                        want of officers. It is said I that the shortage is fully 10,000, and that!
                        allowing 60 men for each officer, quite 600,000 men would be reduced to
                        uselessness for want I of leaders.</p>

                    <p>There is nothing that has endeared King Edward VII. to his subjects so much
                        as his universal good humours and tact, and it is these qualities which halo
                        enabled him,during he short period of reign, to cement our friendly
                        relationship throughout Europe, and to bring us closer to the Dependencies
                        of the Crown. It seems only the other day that the Prince and Princess of
                        Wales returned from their successful tour in the Colonies. Now they iro to
                        visit India, where the Heir Apparent joes for the first time to represent
                        bis Majesty in our vast Ei-tern possessions. Tho preparations for this tour,
                        fraught with so much importance, have of a necessity re- quired the most
                        elaborate planning and fore- thought, and everything that can both the
                        voyage and the visit as easy and enjoyable as possible has been done. A good
                        deal of State pageant must attend the journey, and it is more or less
                        imperative that the son of the Emperor should arrive in the East in imperial
                        fashion.</p>
                    <p>A special train, with dining and day saloons and sleeping apartments,
                        conveyed the Prince and his party across France to, Italy, whore they were
                        entertained at a farewell fete orgainised by theKing and Queen of
                            <placeName>Italy</placeName>, prior to joining their ship at Genoa. The
                        work of converting the huge battleship Renown, which is destined to carry
                        the travel- lers, was completed over a fortnight ago, when, accompanied by
                        the cruiser Terrible, she left <placeName>Portsmouth</placeName>, having on
                        board a large number of the suite, who had the advantage of getting used to
                        theses by the time they arrived at Genoa, in readiness to receive the Prince
                        and Princess last Saturday.</p>
                    <p>A huge naval pageant took place on the following Monday, when the royal
                        travellers were escorted through the Straits of Messina by the fleet, which
                        left Malta the day before, ai.d consists of his Majesty’s ships
                        Bulwark,Queen, Formidable, Implacable,Vener- able, Irresistible, Goliath,
                        Prince of Wales, Leviathan, Venus, Sentinel, and fifteen des- troyers. These
                        met the Renown off Cape Pellaro, and the manauvres began with a royal
                        salute, and terminated with a grand display of illuminations in the evening,
                        before the fleet returned to Malta. The life on board promises to be very
                        enjoyable, provided the travellers are favored with good weather. For the
                        transformation of the huge battleship provides in addition to the ship’s
                        full com- plement — provision for a company of about one hundred, compared
                        of ladies and gentlemen of the suite and their personal attendants. All the
                        officers—including the captain and the commander - have given up their
                        cabins to the visitors, extra cabins being formed in the empty casements of
                        the guns, that have had to be evicted, only those required for saluting
                        purposes being left.</p>
                    <p>The special suites of rooms reserved for the Prince and Princess have been
                        handsomely fitted op—those of the Princess being built on the promenade
                        deck. This site has been specially selected on account of her Royal Highness
                        being a bad sailor. All the cabins are heated throughout and ventilated by
                        electricity. A spacious dining-room, capable of stating some fifty guests,
                        with a charming retiring or drawing-room leading out of it, have been
                        arranged in the Admiral’s apart- ments tor the use of the royal guests. For
                        in spite of the fact that H.R.H. the Prince of Wales is a Vice-Admiral, and
                        as such will be superior in rank to any officer on board the Renown, his
                        Royal Highness will not fly his own pennant during the voyage, but will rank
                        simply as a royal visitor. Every possible amusement to relieve the monotony
                        of the life on board has been thought oL Games of every kind, including
                        ship’s croquet, quoits, bull- board, and so on, are provided. -The decks
                        have bem covered with linoleum to deaden all sound, and roofed in with an
                        immense awning; this will allow of dancing on board, as well as supplying a
                        shady place, which should prove an inestimable boon during the time the
                        travellers are in the tropics. A library of well-chosen books, including
                        several recent works on India, specially selected by the Princess, and a
                        number of Hindustani grammars have been placed on board—for it is a curious
                        fact that no member of the party has an acquaintance with the native
                        language. Preparations have also been made for pub- lishing a paper on
                        board, news for which will be collected by means of wireless telegraphy.
                        Upon their arrival in Bombay, the Prince and Princess will be received by
                        Lord Cuin, and once in the East they will find a pro- gramme of enormous
                        length has been prepared. India is laying itself out to entertain its royal

                        for the Prince, who is an expert shot Not only is his Royal Highness taking
                        out a great assortment of guns for this purpose, but he has also a
                        taxidermist attached to his stiff, in order that the more valuable skins and
                        trophies of the chase may receive immediate attention. For the convenience
                        of the royal guests a special train de luxe has been built to Lord Curzon’s
                        order. This far surpasses in grandeur any train that has hitherto been seen
                        in India. It consists of dining and sleeping cars and special apartments for
                        the use of the Prince and Princess. The apartments destined for the use of
                        the Prince are upholstered in green , and those furnished for the Princess
                        in delicate French grey ; the whole train being or the outside painted cream
                        colour and ornamented with the royal arms, while the inside is decorated
                        with highly polished woods, the varitions natural colours of which have been
                        wonderfully preserved.</p>
                    <p>Of the gowns and jewels taken by the Princess much has been written. The
                        latter alone have been injured for £60,000 ; bat this does not include the
                        magnificent collection of orders and badges which the Prince is taking, nor
                        yet the collection of English-made jewels, in the form of brooches and scarf
                        pins, eta, destined to be distributed amongst various I people with whom he
                        will come in contact. In addition to these the royalties are taking huge
                        quantities of their own photographs, for which they hare given special
                        sittings, as well as no fewer than forty-four oil paintings of King Edward,
                        in the uniform of a field marshal, and 520 large colour prints from the
                        same, which are intended for the adornment of public buildings, Government
                        residences, courts of law, etc, throughout the great Empire of India.</p>

                    <p>EARLY AMERICAN JOURNALISM. INTERESTING REMINISCENCES.</p>
                    <p>Dr. E E. Hale, chaplain of the Senate of the United States, contributes to
                        the New York "Tribune” some interesting personal memories of American
                        journalism, which run back to his father’s printing office, when he was
                        publisher and editor of the "Boston Daily Advertiser.” This, says the
                        writer, was the first daily journal published in Boston, and from a very
                        early period he owed the estab- lishment, adding that this was the fashion
                        of those days.</p>
                    <p>The publisher was the editor, the editor was the printer and publisher, in
                        the stronger newspaper enterprises of the country. My father had not been
                        trained as a printer, but had been a professor of mathematics at Exeter had
                        studied law, and had been admitted to the Boston Bar. But all the same he
                        owned his printing equipment, as well for the newspaper as for an office
                        that printed books. He in- troduced type-founding and stereotype work in New
                        England, and what we then called power printing, meaning printing by water
                        or steam power. Treadwell’s power printing press marked an epoch in printing
                        in America. Daniel Treadwell, the inventor, was my father's intimate friend,
                        and be was glad to use Mr. Treadwell’s inventions from the first. When I was
                        a boy at school, I suppose in 1829. there appeared in the London New Monthly
                        Magazine” a bright poem on steam. One of the verses said :—</p>
                    <p>“The newspapers our breakfast bless, No dinner talk unless we see ‘em. “ten
                        thousand,” says the “times”,”our press Strikes off in three short hours by
                        steam.”</p>
                    <p>This was regarded as miraculous work in those times. My mother then took oare
                        of my school oratory and taught me to “speak the piece” on Saturday at
                        school, with an alteration which said that the "Daily Advertiser” press
                        “worked off two thousand copies by steam. r I This was considered a large
                        circulation.. AH the journalism of those days, whether in Boston or in New
                        York, both trades of the dis- tinctly mercantile origin of the newspapers.
                        The very name of the "News Letter," the I oldest journal, points to this
                        origin. The orig -inal “News Letter’’ was a sheet of foolscap paper (f which
                        two pages of printed trims were first, the third and fourth pages being ]eft
                        blank for manuscript communications which a merchant liked to make to his
                        correspondents. This custom descended to times quite late — is preserved,
                        indeed, in some lines of industry today. Once a week the "price current” of
                        every journal in a mercantile city was printed on a separate sheet in this
                        way for the use of mercantile correspondents. Then, as now, the
                        advertisements were a great source of revenue; and indeed in every way the
                        wishes of the mercantile class as such were dominant in the preparation of
                        the newspaper.</p>
                    <p>The dependence of America on Europe' and European opinion was snob as it is
                        impossible to make any American now understand. You may buy a newspaper
                        today in the Valley of the Mississippi, and perhaps it will not contain a
                        word about England or France or Germany. If it does, it will be perhaps a
                        word on their re- lations with Japan or Manchuria. But in the t early half
                        of the nineteenth century news meant largely European news. Bankruptcy or
                        success might turn on one arrival from Europe. I re- rolled the traditions
                        in our office of the arrival t of the news of Napoleon's landing from Elba,
                        and the news afterwards of the Sattel of Waterloo, and I could tell a dozen
                        instances of ruin to prosperous merchants which hinged on 11 the
                        announcement of victory or defeat pub- lished in one number of one
                        newspaper. The invention of the telegraph as applicable to the uses to which
                        we put it to-day was as late as Morse's voyage across tie Atlantic in 1832
                        when Charles Jackson told him of the expert meats in that line which had
                        already been made in Europe. The first real transmission of American news by
                        telegraph was as late as 1844, so long had it taken Morse to period his
                        invention and to persuade Congress to vote him money enough for a trial It
                        is curious to see that no private capitalist dared assist Morse in this
                        adventure. Capital, as always, was timid, and the Congress was in advance of
                        Wall Street.</p>
