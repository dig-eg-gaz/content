                        requested to have letter boxes placed at the entrance of their residences in which 
                        correspondence can be placed by the postmen. The public is also reminded that postmen

                    <p>A Welcome Reform.</p>
                    <p>We have frequently complained about the disgraceful way in which the footpaths and in many 
                        cases the streets of Alexandria were occupied by shoe-keepers. We are glad to see that 
                        the Municipality has now taken the matter seriously in hand, and already a very great 
                        improvement is to be noted. All the bye-streets round the “French” Market and behind 
                        the Eastern Telegraph Company, which were almost impassable, have now been cleared. 
                        We understand that this branch of municipal work has changed hands, and we hope the 
                        department has been entrusted with it will persevere in the excellent way it has started.</p>
                    <p>A Remarkable Prosolyte.</p>
                    <p>Considerable sensation has been arouses in native and Syrian circle in Cairo and Beyront by 
                        the action of Sheikh Nassim el -Azar, a member of a well-known Orthodox Christian family of 
                        Beyront, who has recently become a Moslem at Cairo. The Cadi of the Cairo Mehkemeh doubted 
                        the man’s professions when he came to him in order to join Islam, but as he could not refuse to 
                        accept this urgent solicitations, the Cadi admitted him as a new believer. The new Moslem is 
                        an able and a highly educated man and recently wrote a pamphlet in Arabic on bourse speculation, 
                        which has a great vogue in Egypt. He is now living in Cairo.</p>

                    <head>LORD CROMER'S TRIP</head>
                    <p>Visit to Assiout</p>
                    <p>We translate the following dated February 11th from a native correspondent at Assiont:- </p>
                    <p>Since Saturday an air of activity has floated over Assiont. The dredger was at work, near the entrance of the Ibrahimieh Canal, the gates of the Barrage 
                        were closed, so as to increase the level of the water, and batches of workmen here and there were seen repairing the roads and soaking those parts, especially 
                        the landing stage, which are usually knee deep in dust. </p>
                    <p>It was concluded that the dredging and the closing of the sluice gates was owing to pretty nearly every tourist streamer having stranded at that spot for 
                        weeks past and because one of the Rameses, of Cook’s line, last week, had the misfortune of being stuck for over 86 hours.</p>
                    <p>The mending of the roads I could not account for until, on enquiry, I was told that this, as well as the clearing of the waterways, was in honour of Lord Cromer’s 
                        visit. Today, therefore, in the early morning, after partaking of my cup of coffee, I wended my way to the landing stage. Yes, evidently he was expected soon, 
                        as not only were the necessary number of policemen there but also a carriage full of young English Effendis in tarboaches, their white gloves peeping out of 
                        their pockets, ready, evidently, to salaam his Excellenoy. The weather was unusually gloomy for these parts, and as there was no sign of the steamer, a sharp 
                        shower of rain soon dispersed those in waiting. </p>
                    <p>It was not until about five this afternoon that the steamer was hard and seen approaching the Barrage. Them Moudir and other official notables hastened to the 
                        landing stage, to receive Lord and Lady Cromer. Several smart carriages, belonging to our aristocracy, were in waiting and after the necessary hand shaking, etc., 
                        they started for a drive towards the town. To the astonishment of all, they were back in less than half-an-hour, before the coaling, for which apparently they had 
                        stopped, as been completed. This over, they steamed off at about half-past six, preceded by a launch, as the sand has made the sailing in this vicinity was very difficult. </p>
                    <p>It was a great disappointment to many of us natives, who had hoped that Lord Cromer would have made a longer stay and have visited the town and some of its institutions. 
                        We were hoping to derive some benefit from his Lordship’s visit. It is true that we pride ourselves that our town is the best in the provinces; still, this is not saying 
                        that there is no room for improvement, and many of the towns in Lower Egypt are progressing by leaps and bounds, whereas awe are stationary. Our Moudir is a very good man 
                        and very much respected but has not done much for the bettering of our town. We are told he has not the power to do so. Then, what are the moudirs appointed for, 
                        can you, Mr. Editor, tell us?</p>
                    <p>Wedding at Suez</p>
                    <p>Moberly-Unsworth</p>
                    <p>Our Suez Correspondent writes: The marriage of Mr. Maurice Moberly, Governor of Tourah Prison, to Mrs. Katherine Mary Unsworth, widow of the late Dr. Noel Unsowrth, 
                        took place yesterday (Tuesday) afternoon at St. Saviour’s Church, Suez, Rev. E.H. Blyth officiating. Dr. Ekins, of the Public Health Department, acted as best man, 
                        and the bride was given a way by her brother-in-law, Mr. H.B. Bush. The church was prettily decorated by Mrs. Chevallier, and the large congregation practically consisted 
                        of the whole of the British colony of Suez and Port Twefik. Among those present were also the Governor of Suez, Schlach Bey, Commandant Suez Canal Police, Captain Grant, 
                        of the Ministry of Interior, and Mr. Mason, of the Veterinary Department. A reception was subsequently held by Mrs. Bush, who entertained her numerous guests till 5:30pm, 
                        when the happy pair left for Cairo.</p>
                    <p>Dangers of Cairo Streets</p>
                    <p>At about 5:20pm yesterday a rather unusual sight was witnessed a few yards from the point where the rue Madabegh joins the rue Maghraby, Cairo. A strengthening wall was being 
                        pulled down by the workmen, who, beginning from beneath, knocked away all the lower 10 feet of the wall and found that the rest, which was jammed tightly against the wall of 
                        the corner house opposite the Spanish Consulate, refused to come down. At last, however, it cracked and collapsed, the fragments, including numerous large fragments and hewn 
                        stones of over a foot in length, pouring out on to the pavement, which they covered up to the kerb. There was nothing extraordinary in this. What was extraordinary was that: - </p>
                    <p>(1)The wall, on being demolished from below, was sufficiently considerate to avoid falling on the workmen. </p>
                    <p>(2)No warning whatever was given to pedestrians using the pavement on which the stones fell, so that a few hundredweight of stone might at any moment come frisking round them. 
                        Nor was anyone stationed to warn riders. We need not enlarge on the consequences that might have followed the fall had a nervous horse passed at its precise moment.</p>
                    <p>But the workmen and their foreman, all Arabs, showed the sublime confidence of their race that nothing could possibly go wrong. Nothing went wrong, but that was not through 
                        their precautions. </p>

                    <head>The Ghezireh Ball</head>
                    <p>Description of Costumes</p>
                    <p>(From our Lady Correspondent)</p>
                    <p>There was usual immense crowd at the fancy dress ball at Ghezireh on Tuesday night, and though there were many who preferred to pay the fine and swell the funds of the S.P.C.A. 
                        by appearing in their ordinary attire, the greater proportion of the guests had responded valiantly to the wording of their invitations. Never has the Casino looked better than 
                        on this night, perhaps the very last occasion on which it will ever serve as the scene of this annual function, the decorations and garlands of light hanging from the roof of the 
                        lounge, and the beautiful ball room affording the best possible background for the brilliant and motely crowd that had gathered there. Naturally there were many dinner parties 
                        given in the hotel and great was the interest shown at every new arrival, but the crowd in the Casino was so great that many costumes never struck the eye till the end of the evening, 
                        when the numbers were less and opportunities for recognizing people became more frequent.</p>
                    <p>Striking and most becoming as were most of the ladies’ costumes, there was perhaps smore originality show in those of the men, and this season we have been glad to note a decided 
                        diminution in the number of men appearing in the guide of the fair sex. There was no one perhaps who appeared to greater advantage than Miss Nungovish, whose lovely face never looked 
                        lovelier than it did within the fantastic headdress she wore. He represented a dancing girl of the sun; and though her costume was a glittering fantasy of white and silver, it otherwise 
                        fully carried out the idea. Upon her head she wore a semi-classical casque glittering with silver and jewels which served as a perfect setting to her dark curls and southern beauty. 
                        Miss Rees was also much admired in her fresh and elaborate toilette as Punchinells, all pale blue outlined with roses, the skirt decorated with bonffant paniers, her fair hair topped with 
                        a very carnival chapeau, her shoulders for the nonce disfigured by the traditional hump. There were many representations of national costumes, some carried out with faithful attention to dtail, 
                        some adapted to suit the occasion and the wearer. Miss Leverich was in teantiful Swiss dress with showy chemisette and regulation bodice laced about with silver chains, and Mrs. Nolan looked 
                        her best in a black Spanish mantills, the traditional red rose lurking abover her ear. Miss Wahn as a Japanese girl carried herself with supple grace, and Mrs. Peckett in semi-oriental guise 
                        was excellently got up. Very beautiful was she who represented a Queen of the Middle Ages, with blue velvet cloak hanging from her shoulders, and a long transparent veil and wimple depending 
                        from her golden crown. Mrs. Nungovich was in a most becoming and original frock, of flowered silk of the early Victorian days, a huge beflowered bonnet framing her pretty side curb and upstanding 
                        bows of hair. Miss Coxon made a delightful “Mary had a little lamb” in short frock and big hat over her wealth of hair, and Miss Tuck had also resumed the muslin frills and blue sash of infantile 
                        days, to the great advantage of her twinkling feet. We noticed several “Nights”, one in black dotted over with sislver stars and bearing a tinsel moon, and another in soft cloudy blue and 
                        green glittering also with star, which was worn by Mrs. Herring. Mr. Wilson, ass Princease de Lamballe, could not have chosen anything that suited her features better than the stately wig and 
                        garland of roses of the period. </p>
                    <p>There were no less than three different ideas of water lilies, one being worn by Miss Hobson and a second by Miss Love, and various other flowers had been requisitioned, perhaps the prettiest 
                        being the lily of the valley scheme worn by Miss Hemming. Lady Vivian as Melisonde wore a long trailing robe of purple and green, and Miss Carey made a delightful Spanish girl with 
                        jaunty little scarlet cap upon her head and many gold chains about her neck. Miss Lang Anderson was a fitting representative of that unfortunate heroine of old Fatima, the wife of Bluebeard. 
                        The Misses Coles were dressed as milkmaids, Mrs. Peach ass a Brittany serving maid, Miss de Vahl was in Turkish dress with small glittering caps and bolero, while Miss Nora de Vahl had a 
                        very effective costume hung about with cherries ripe. Miss Moore went ass Carnival, Mrs. Gillard as a school girl, Mis Duke as Yachting, Mr. Elliot Smith ass Mme. Sans Gene, Miss Joseph as 
                        a Butterfly, Miss Beddoe as a Gitano, and Miss Fearson as  a Roumanian peasant. </p>
                    <p>As before remarked, there was a great amount of originality shown among the costumes of the men, many of them being so well disguised that recognition was impossible. Most effective were 
                        Messr, Emmens and Creighton as Fuzzie-Wuzzies of the Sudan, who, though they were not able to figure on the dancing floor, had the satisfaction of knowing they were the most realistic couple 
                        in the Casino. Nobody recognized Mr. Nesbit as one of the three gigantic and bearded Sikh soldiers, and Mr. Bolland in his Arab garments found it difficult to assure his partners of his identity. 
                        Three were many Bedouin and Arab costumes represented, none better nor more complete than that worn by Mr. Graves as Sheikh of the Rna’a, whose bronzed face and hands still further added to the effect.
                        Mr Scott-Monerieff as an orderly and punctilious tourist was excellent in this neat check suit and short trim grey side whiskers, and ought to have spent his evening alongside of the lady globe trotter 
                        who was most characteristically attired. Nobody recognized Capt. Wilson in the dignified young Pasha with beard and tarbooah and much elaboration in his choice of buttons 
                        and studs; and naturally 
                        <cb n="5"/>
                        no one knew Cart Wyndham as he perambulated htrough the rooms as a big fat baby with fair top knot and an inscription on his body “Not wanted on the voyage.” He was not the only baby on the hore though, 
                        for there was another, alsos fats and large, who ran him hard. Eastern potentates and rajahs were there in plenty, some wonderfully and fearfully attired, and one or two showing a slackness about 
                        their turbans that would have boded them no good in their ancestral halls. Capt. Adams’ uniform as a Japanese (or could it have been Chinese) soldier of the ancient days was excellent and most becoming, 
                        and Mr. Hankey, too, as an ancient Egyptian solider, deserves high commendation. There were Chinese mandarins as there were Chinese ladies, and also some characteristic garments from Japan. Syces 
                        of course there were, and a headman with his horrid axe, and various fresh combinations of the regulation black dress suit and white fixiags which form the ordinary garb of man. Mr. Rentyens was a 
                        gallant figure in his court dress of the time of Louis XVL and Mr. Garibaldi had chosen his costume from the time of Henry IV.</p>

                    <head>LORD CROMER'S POLICY</head>
                    <p>MR. DICEY'S OPINIONS.</p>
                    <p>“Egypt of the Future” contains some remarkable criticisms on Lord Cromer’s policy of 
                        governing Egypt, and Mr. Edward Dicey is very outspoken in his objections to what he considers 
                        is an autocracy. Here are some passages: --</p>
                    <p>His Lordship prefers to do as much as possible by himself, dislikes criticism, and prefers to act through 
                        officials who, whether native or European, are content to carry out his instructions even though privately 
                        they may dissent from his views. One by one, every influence which impaired his autocracy has been removed or 
                        fettered. The Khedive has been taught that it is more consonant with his comfort and self-respect not to tender 
                        advice about the internal affairs of his kingdom. The native ministers in common with all Orientals dislike trouble, 
                        and, having found out their position is much pleasanter if they accept the proposals of their British advisers 
                        without discussing their merits or demerits, avoid any futile discussion. The British officials, with few and decreasing 
                        exceptions, are ready to carry out the policy dictated from the British Agency without raising objections or suggesting 
                        difficulties which might delay its prompt execution. The only institution which tends to limit his autocracy are the 
                        capitulations, the mixed tribunals, the mercantile community, and the Consuls-General accredited to the Khedivial Court, 
                        whose authority has already been seriously diminished under the Anglo-French agreement.</p>
                    <p>I have, I hope, succeeded in showing that the Egypt of today is governed by an autocratic system whose fundamental 
                        principle is the same as that under which Egypt has been ruled for ages, namely, that the will of the Monarch is law. 
                        I fully admit that the application is very different. The Sovereign de facto, is a high-minded British nobleman, who, 
                        so long as he retains the confidence of his own Government, can administer the affairs of Egypt in any way he deems most 
                        conducive to British interests. The Sovereign de jure is, in theory, an independent Prince, whose real function is to issue 
                        willingly or unwillingly the decrees he is instructed to sign by his Major of the Palace. I have endeavoured to show that 
                        this anomalous arrangement has been mainly brought about by a variety of causes for which Lord Cromer is not responsible and 
                        which might very possibly have led any other Counsul-General who had held the same post to pursue the same policy under the 
                        same conditions.</p>
                    <p>It is with great reluctance I say anything in depreciation of Lord Cromer’s great merits as an administrator. But the interests 
                        of truth compel me to state that his remarkable individuality has biased him almost unconsciously in favour of a system of 
                        autocratic rule administered by British officials appointed by himself and holding their offices subject, in fact though 
                        not in name, to his approval. A knowledge of Arabic is not considered an essential qualification for a representative of 
                        Great Britain in Egypt and it must be owned that there is far less risk of orders being misunderstood or disregarded or performed 
                        with negligence, if these orders are given directly in English to English officials. All Orientals are fond of talking, and, 
                        as a matter of courtesy and custom, use long winded phrases and are slow in coming to the point. The day’s work is quicker 
                        done if conducted in English, and this condition is better fulfilled if a native official has no opportunity of expressing his 
                        own views in his own language. Moreover, the Latin saying, Crescit indulgens sibi dirus hyrops seems to be applicable to almost 
                        all moral as well as physical diseases; and especially that mental malady, the inordinate love of power. To this malady his 
                        Lordship seems to me a victim. The force of circumstances, as I have already said, far more than his own volition, has placed 
                        him in a position of exceptional authority; and his personal characteristics have led him to make the consolidation and 
                        extension of that authority the dominant principle of his policy. The extent to which this policy is now carried on, 
                        and has been carried on for years, can hardly be appreciated by anyone not intimately acquainted with Egypt. It is no exaggeration 
                        to assert that under this policy the administration of Egypt is conducted by British officials, and that these officials are 
                        under the absolute control of the British Agency. From the highest posts in the public service to the lowest, every appointment 
                        is made under the supervision of Lord Cromer, and his disapproval is fatal. This is not all; I have no doubt his Lordship would, 
                        in good faith, deny the statement that no British official can express doubt as to the expediency of any measure emanating from 
                        the Agency, or criticize it unfavourably, without losing all chance of promotion and risking the tenure of his position. All 
                        old public servants, whether British or native, who have resided long in the country and who have thus acquired experience, 
                        are viewed with a certain disfavor from the fact that they are competent to express opinions which may not be in accord with 
                        the ideas in favour at headquarters. What his Lordship prefers are young officials utterly unacquainted with the country, 
                        and who, therefore, even if they had the wish, have not the power to question the wisdom of his opinions. Very shortly 
                        before his leaving Egypt for South Africa, Lord Kirchener, while still Governor of the Soudan, came down to Cairo on a visit, 
                        and on being asked by an acquaintance what he had come for, replied, as the story goes: “I have come to take a course 
                        of lessons in Lord Cromer’s 
                        <cb n="4"/>
                        Kindergarten.” I cannot vouch myself for the truth of this story, but I can vouch for it as 
                        representing the current opinion of the day. Under the existing regime, the policy of the Agency has always been to 
                        discourage any intimacy between our officials and their native colleagues, and to give as little encouragement as 
                        possible to any British official who endeavours to ascertain for himself the views and opinions of Egyptian population. 
                        No doubt, for his own convenience, and for the purpose of carrying out his duties, a British official may pick up sufficient 
                        Arabic to understand and speak it colloquially. But any attempt to study Arabic literature and hold converse with the teachers 
                        of Islam would not be a mark in his favour with the powers that be. The inevitable result of this state of things is that the 
                        Agency for many years past has only been visited by persons who shared, or professed to share, Lord Cromer’s views as to the 
                        expediency of administering Egypt by British officials, and that the few persons, whether British, foreign, or native, 
                        who were competent to form an independent opinion differing from that of our Consul-General have gradually ceased to have 
                        any relations with the Agency other than those of a personal or social character.</p>

                    <p>M. D'ABAZA ON PALMS</p>
                    <p>The new Bulletin of the Alexandria Horticultural Society will be welcomed by all our readers interested in horticulture for the 
                        information it contains. The first paper, by M. A. d’Abaza, on palms, devotes twenty pages to the physiology, classification, 
                        geographical distribution, and utilization of this ornamental family of plants which he has made his special study; it is, at 
                        present, arranged under 6 tribes, 140 genera, and between 1,100 and 1,200 species, of which many, especially those of the Island of 
                        Madagascar, are as yet imperfectly known. The home of all but a few is tropical; about one-third living between the parallels of 10 
                        degrees N and 10 degrees S. lat, and the number of species gradually diminishing as the Equinoctial line is approached on either side 
                        of the Equator. The absolute limits however, vary with the geographical distribution. The only European palm (genus chanse rops), 
                        known as the Palmetto, extends to 44 degrees N. The Northern palm-limit in Asia (genus Nannorops), consisting like the Palmetto of a 
                        single species is 34 degrees N. In America (genus Sabal) it is 36 degrees N—all three being fan palms. The Southern palm-limit is 
                        (genus Rhopalo stylis) in New Zealand, like the Northern, is 44 degree S. In South America (genus Jubeaa) it is 37 degree S. In South 
                        Africa (genus Phoenix) it is 31 degree S, the three latter not being fan palms. Few palms grow higher than 3,000 feet above the sea 
                        and only one at a very high elevation, viz., the wax palm of New Granada, which has a straight spindle-shaped stem 160 feet high, its 
                        home being on the Andes within 5 degrees f the Equator between 9,000 and 11,000 feet above the sea, scarcely 3,000 feet below the limit 
                        of perpetual snow. The thin coating of white wax on its stem forms an article of commerce, like that derived from the leaves of the 
                        Brazilian yellow wax palm (Copernicia cerifera, Mart.) formerly cultivated in Egypt. Etypt proper has but two indigenous palms; the date 
                        (Phoenix dactylifera L.) and the Doum (Hyphaee Thabaica Gaeit); the latter, however, is not known out of cultivation, north of Ansiout. 
                        Between Koroako and Abou Hamed, in the Sudan, grows a third palm (Mademia Argun), a fan plam like the doum, but without the forked stem 
                        of the latter. Still farther South, a fourth palm (Borsaus Flabellifer L) is not uncommon.</p>
                    <p>The remaining 26 pages contain a description of the exotic palms at present cultivated in Egypt (which M. d’Abaza estimates at about 40 
                        species), ending with a list of others he recommends for cultivation. Out of the above 40 not above a dozen can be said to have become 
                        acclimatized in Egypt, the remainder being, as yet, in too young a stage of existence to enable us to form an opinion of their adaptability 
                        to the climatic conditions of Alexandria. The acclimatization in our altitude, so near the sea, of any intertropical palm found in its native 
                        habitation at an elevation of less than 3,000 feet, may be looked upon as hopeless, however, successful expert horticulturists may be in 
                        growing it as a curiosity in their gardens. The earliest exotic palm planted in Egypt is the highly ornamental “Royal Odeodox”, still to 
                        be seen in the island of Ronda; this dates from about 1830. Until ten or fifteen years ago it was known by the botanical name under which 
                        it was planted. (Sagus farinifera Gaert, the old name for one of the two species of Sago palm), and, strange to say, in the Calcutta Botanic 
                        Garden, where there has long existed a fine avenue of these palms, the latter have always been popularly known as “Sago palm,” pointing to the 
                        probability of the mother tree we have spoken of having reached Egypt via Calcutta, although its native home is in the Antilles of the West Indies. 
                        The Sago and Royal palms belong to two distint tribes of the order; but Delchevalerie, in his “Etudes Egyptiennes” (1870), still calls it “e sagoutier 
                        farineaux,” an error not corrected until his “Aperca” (1881), written for “La Societe d’ sc-climatation de France.” It is remarkable that no avenue 
                        of this noble palm has yet been creatd in Egypt. At Alexandria the tree requires shelter from the salt sea winds which it can only get under the lee 
                        of buildings, or inland by the Mahmoudieh Canal, where it thrives well, and an avenue would be highly ornamental; but, in Cairo, there is no such 
                        difficulty. The two palms “par excellence” for 
                        <cb n="5"/>
                        an Alexandrian avenue are the Californian desert palm (washingtonia fi ife a) and the Canary Island date palm (Phoenix Canarieasis) both rapid 
                        growers with very stout stems resisting any amount of drought and sea wind; the former is a fan palm, and the latter a hybrid with highly ornamental 
                        pinnate foliage. Placed alternatively, in a double row, the effect of an avenue would be highly picturesque; good specimens of the “Washingtonia,” 
                        fifteen years old may be seen in the Autoniasdis garden on the Canal, and both palms in the garden of Mr. N.E. Tamvaco in the Greek quarter of 
                        Alexandria; it is curious that the fan palm (Livistona Chimensis) introduced in 1870, so largely cultivated now in Egypt, and more ornamental 
                        than the Californian one though less hardy, has no known habitat in a wild state. It was first described by Philibert Commerson, the naturalist 
                        to the expedition (1766-1769), round the world, of L.A.de Bougainville (1729-1811) immortalized in the name of one of our most admired wall-creepers. 
                        Commerson founded the celebrated botanic garden of Pamplemousses in Mauritius under Intendant Poivre in 1769 and died there in 1774; he named 
                        this palm “Latania Borbonica” from its native appellation and from having found it in the Island of Bourbon. The botanist, J. Jaquin, introduced 
                        it to Europe from Mauritius in 1788, and there is a coloured plate of it in his “Fragments botanica” (1809) under the name of “Latania Chinesis” 
                        (being known in Mauritius as “Latanier de Chine”), pointing to its having been introduced from South China, where it was and is largely 
                        cultivated for fan making, about forty miles S of Canton. C.F.P. von Martius (1794-1868), in his “Historia Palmarum” (1823 50) places this tree 
                        in the genus “Livistona” created for it by the celebrated botanist Robert Brown (1773 1858), in his Prodromus (18 0), in honour of Patrick Murray 
                        of Livistone, near Edinburgh, and calls it “Livistona Chinesis.” Dr. W G Griffith (1810-1815), calls it, “Livistona Sinensis,” the latter word being 
                        more classical than “Chinesis.”</p>
                    <p>Again, Dr D.I.B Balfour, in the Flora of Mauritius and the Seychelles (1877) by F.G. Baker, of Kew, goes back to the old generic name, and identifies 
                        the “Latania Borbonica” with the “Latania Commersonic” of J F Gmelin (1768-1803), and considers it a native of the Mascarene Isles. This is the more 
                        remarkable as the genus “Latania” is dioecious, whilst the flowers of “Livistona” are hermaphrodite, and the two genera belong to two distinct tribes of 
                        palms; “Livistona” to “Coryphea” and Latania” to “Boreasea”. There can be no doubt that our Alexandria palm cultivated by Delchevalerie as “Latania 
                        Borbonica” belongs to the former genus. The beautiful variety with very long drooping, slender, filiform-pointed leaves, in some of our gardens, may 
                        be a hybrid with L cochinchinensir, as the leaf stalks are not spin as in that species.</p>
                    <p>It is to the accidental or systematic hybridization, on the French Riviera, of many of the palms whose offspring has been introduced thence to Egyptian 
                        gardens of late years, that the great confusion of botanical names of palm species has taken place, a fact observed twenty years ago by Mr. W. Watson, 
                        Asst. Curator of Kew (sent specifically by the authorities to study the Rivera gardens), and noted in a very interesting paper in the Kew Bulletin for 
                        December 1889. </p>

                    <p>ABRIDGED PROSPECTUS</p>
                    <p>This Company has been formed for the purposes specified in the Memorandum of Association, and in particular to undertake contractcs for the 
                        construction of public buildings, private houses and other works, and to exploit the manafacturs of materials for construction and to 
                        acquire and carry on any business useful in this connection.</p>
                    <p>The Directors have been fortunate in securing a plot of land of about 10,000 square Buildings, situated a the immediate approach to the new Boulac 
                        Bridge at Ghezireh and having a large frontage on the new tramway route which will lead direct to the Pyramids. Upon completion of the Bridge, 
                        passengers will be able to take a train from the centre over the New Bridge direct to the Pyramids and there is no doubt that when this important 
                        work is finished, there will be a great augmentation of passenger and vehicular traffic to and from the Pyramids and Ghezireh.</p>
                    <p>This Company has secured the valuable and sole Monopoly of being able to build shops on the estate therefore all the trade in this rapidly rising 
                        Suburb must neccessarily be confined to those who have the prilivage of becoming tanants or puchasers of the plots. The Company has also secured 
                        the right to build shops and houses to a height of 20 metres this being 2 metres higher than the height allowed to any previous purchasers, which 
                        is a privilege of considerable value to this Company.</p>
                    <p>The Ghezireh Estate was owned by the late Khedive, Ismail Pacha, who built the present Palace and made it his principal residence. It is now the 
                        property of the “Egyptian Hotels Limited” and is called the Ghezireh Palace Hotel , which is one of the most luxurious Hotels to be found anywhere.</p>
                    <p>The property to be purchased, besides the advantages stated above of being opposite the approach to the new Boulac Bridge, has the most delightful surroundings, 
                        being situated in the centre of the well-known Ghezireh Gardens, adjoining which are the Khedivial Sporting Club, the Race course and the Grotto. This 
                        district is already a fashionable quarter for the wealthy classes and the increased facilities of access from Cairo must necessarily tend to increase the 
                        residential population.</p>
                    <p>Hitherto no villas have been erected at lower rentals than L250 to L300 per annum and permission was given to build on only 1/3rd of the area of each plot, 
                        in consequence of which and also owing to the difficulty of access to and from Cairo, the cost of living in the neighbourhood has been very high.</p>
                    <p>The Egyptian Hotels Company, Limited, being desirous of developing their Estate as rapidly as possible and with a view to providing increased facilities 
                        to Residents, have granted to this Company the sole right to erect shops as well as houses. The building of these shops should ensure a considerable 
                        increase in the number of Residents and be of great advantage to the neighborhood, and a substantial source of revenue to the Company.</p>

                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the accompanying 
                        description of some of the many interesting routes by which they may travel homewards. Great care 
                        has been taken to arrange them as accurately and concisely as possible and it will be found that 
                        none of them are fraught with difficulty. In chosing the route home there are several things to be 
                        considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate between Egypt and the various points 
                        at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>

                    <p>A pleasantly situated village lying in the valley between Piacenza and Parma, rapidly becoming famous

                    <p>This depends party upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in January may be a little warmer 
                        than the Riviera, and possibly not so warm as Sicily but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more 
                        uniformly warm than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in the year, for 
                        as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest placae to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at sea, and we therefore subjoin a list

                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co's steamers, which leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, 
                        where one takes train to TAORMINA, one of the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is the 
                        station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful, occupying about one hour. In and 
                        around the town is machto interest the visitor The theatre is of Greek origin, but restored under the Romans. 
                        CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of Etna, and here also is a fine Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and 
                        Saracenic remains that are found all over the island, are an endless source of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting 
                        history, having been a Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C. 413, and taken by the Romans in B.C. 
                        212, when Archimedes was slain- his tomb is to be seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, 
                        with about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a delightful climate. Much of interest 
                        is to be found in this fine city The Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic orgin and close to it the church of S. Giovannia 
                        degli Erimiti with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral, Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park 
                        are also worth a visit.</p>

                    <head>CENTRAL ITALY.</head>
                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday during the season for Naples, the voyage 
                        being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio Rubattino Co.'s steamers, which leave daily. One cannot 
                        approach Naples or leave it without wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its bay- Castellamare 
                        and Sorrento [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will devote at least one week to visiting the many 
                        historical and interesting portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be 
                        spent admiring the City of Flowers and its surrounding county. In Florence itself the chruchs and galleries are of absorbing 
                        interest, whilst the local promendares and excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and fashionable 
                        promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of the finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up 
                        through the hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its 
                        Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero, thence by cogwheel 
                        railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours; here there is a fine Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least 
                        one night should if possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is 
                        a very convenient half-way house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air and surroundings 
                        exceptionally good.</p>

                    <p>GENOA (La Superba). — The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with the record of having one of the lowest death averages 
                        of European cities and a phenomenally equable temperature— warm in winter and deliciously cool breezes from the surrounding mountains 
                        and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy’s most ancient nobility, whose palaces, gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes and paintings, 
                        are a constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa. Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches 
                        containing exquisite marble calumns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santa filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern ltaly before making the tour of the Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful 
                        windows illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal springs

                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours’ journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. 
                        The total absence of vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange; no horse, cart, carriage or bicycle is to be seen, 
                        and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The approach the Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other seaport. 
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of 
                        Campaniles appear above the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter hours by train by way of Monza :</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the 
                        lake is most enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo, Cadenabbia, and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town 
                        of Bellaggio opposite. The walk from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio is most enjoyable. A steam tram runs from Menaggio 
                        to Porlezza on Lake Lugano in three-quarters of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                        an excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated above the town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings, “Entombment,” 
                        by Ciseri, and “The Flight into Egypt,” by Bramanfion.</p>

                    <p>The Lake of Lucerne abounds in delightful excursions, those to the Rigi, Pilatus, Burgenstock and Sonnenberg needing a special visit each. Other excursions 
                        on the lake can be made by steamer, and the ever-changing scenery on the trip from Lucerne to Fluelen is a source of dlelight to the lover of nature.</p>

                        waterfalls, Giessback, Trummelback and Staubbach. Then also the glaciers of Grindelwald and view from Murren and the Schynige Platte are sights not to be missed.</p>
