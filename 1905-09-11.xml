                     <head>RUSSIAN DIPLOMACY</head>
                     <p>The diplomatic skill of the Russian Govern¬ment 
                in devising and pushing its plans is, we suspect, a little overrated
                in Western Europe. It is there believed that St. Peters¬burg is 
                served by hundreds of able and uns¬crupulous agen s, who all pull 
                together, and all carry out far reaching plans, which they do not
                talk about, but thoroughly understand. The Russian Government is,
                therefore, it is alleged, successful beyond all other Govern¬ments, 
                so successful that any whisper of its future plans of aggrandisement, 
                even when badly authenticated, sometimes causes a flutter among the 
                nations. Russia, it is said, never, even if defeated, gives up her
                purpo¬ses ; and as she has no Parliament to distract her, and no
                diplomatists can contend with her agents in aubtlety and foresight, 
                sba almost always succeeds in them. The result is a widely 
                diffused alarm, and a consequent exaltation of the Russian 
                repute for ability, which of itself increases the weight of Russia in the councils of the world. The facts, however, if carefully observed, do not bear out these pessimistic opinions. Russia, it is true, has spread far and fast in Northern Asia, where there was nothing strong enough to resist her, and where, it must in justice be added, her administration, though always too daa- potio, and occasionally violent and cruel, is distinctly better through long terms of years than the administrations it superseded. Bnt she has not succeeded at all strikingly in making herself a "world-Power.” She She has feared to colonise any place divided from herself by the sea. She has not, after a century of effort, broken her way to open water yet. She has not conquered Constantinople, and her land road to it is as solidly barred as ever. Bhe has, by permitting the conversion of Germany from a loosely knit Federation into a strongly knit military Empire, immeasurably reduced her own influence in Europe ; has, indeed, compelled hmelf to lean for safety on an ally whose thoughts are not her thought®, and whose objects ere aaaeawily Inn in Aab ab hm oonpQad India to
                strengthen herself so greatly that an invasion from the North is most difficult; and goaded Japan into fighting her before she herself was nearly ready to repel and punish the assault. She has driven England, which at heart dis- likes fettering alliances, into a close alliance with the most formidable enemy of Russia on he Pacific ; has at the same time, by a series of amazing blunders, alienated the strong sym¬pathy formerly felt for her. in the United States ; and has forced the strongest and most united of clans, the world-wide Jewish people, with its controlling influence over finance and journalism, to become her irreconcilable foe.
                These can hardly be called successes, even if we refrain from comparing Russian diplo- matists and statesmen with Bismarck and Cavour, each of whom won for his master each splendid triumphs ; and the successive occu¬pants of the Russian Foreign Office have failed at another point which may prove hereafter of ever greater importance. They have failed in securing the confidence of the world, or even of that section of it whose ideas march fairly well with their own. We do not our¬selves believe, as most of our countrymen do, that this loss is a	deserved, We see
                no reason for believing that falsity is imbedded in the Russian character, or that her diplomat¬ists despise a rigid adherence to truth more than the majority of their profession. Russia keeps European treaties fairly well, and has once or twice exhibited in difficult circumstance a fidelity to pecuniary engagements at once praiseworthy in itself and profitable to her credit We should have said that the innate Russian fault was a violent aggreesive- ness of demeanour rather than a silken falsity like that of the Byzantines. Bat it is mere matter of fact that her agents have in one way or another created a nearly universal distrust in her sincerity, and that this distrust hampers and burdens her at every turn. It was really disbelief in Russian promises which induced Japan to stake her existence as an independent Power upon the ohanoea of a long, exhausting, and most com plicated war. But for distrust as to the security of the “open door,” Russia might have almost a free hand in settling the destiny of China. But for a suspicion which, jnst or unjust, seems irremovable, Great Britain and Russia would long ago have come to an agree¬ment about influence in Asia which would, to say the least of it, have reduced their financial hardens in that continent by one-half. It is Russia's indefiniteness as to pledgee, to use the most polite expression, which prevents the world from securing for her the o]ear water¬way to the Mediterranean which she very naturally thinks her right Let Russia but convince the world that she intends to go straight, and her career, even if it is still a career of conquest, will be smoothed for her in every direction. Nobody wants to keep her away from the water out of pare spite ; bat then nobody believes what her agents, who are struggling to clear the road to the water for her, say or promise.
                To what, then, are we to ascribe the ten¬dency of successive Russian Governments to inspire a distrust which, so far from streng-thening, cripples them I They must know that it is an obstacle, and why do they allow it to grow np ! In part, no donbt, it is due to the fact that under an obscurantist autocracy it is the unscrupulous who most frequently rise to the top ; but it is also in part due to a very curious failure within the autocracy itself. Every one in Western Europe thinks of the Russian agents as slaves to a central Com¬mittee ; but in reality the Russian Govern¬ment gives its agents more of a free hand than is enjoyed by those of any other European Power. It leaves to its Ambassadors and Vice- a liberty as complete as it claims for it¬self, refuses to fetter them with detailed “instructions,” and requires of them nothing but success. Sometimes, when the agents are able and dreamstanoes are favourable, that policy succeeds; and sometimes, when, as often happens, they are stupid cr obstinate men, it fails; but always it leaves to oompa* ratively irresponsible men too much power, and always it tempts them to make promises and sign arrangements which the ultimate authority is obliged more or less decisively  to repudiate. The agents are, of course, eager for approval at home, and they are also eager to be, and to appear to be, great personages at their stations. They straggle for sucess, they grow jealous of each other, they try to make everything pleasant to St. Petersburg, till their Government, there is reason to believe, often grows bewildered by the information oonveyed, and a sort of contest springs up between the delegating authority and the authorities who are delegated. There is an incoherence in their action which at once suggests to the observe* —who, be it remembered, is full of distrust— that somebody is cheating, or hiding truths, or making promises which it is not inten ded to keep. It is dear, for example even from the very imperfect revelations that have reached the general ear, that a struggle of thia kind occurred between St Petersburg and the Viceroy of the Far East; that the Tsar in tended a compromise while his Viceroy tend¬ed either to secure a grand diplomatic victory or to force a war, the result being that the Japanese thought that they were being amused while preparations went on,'and at last refused to be delayed any longer. Could they have trusted their antagonists, they might have assented to an arrangement which would at least have postponed war for five years ; but with Admiral Alexeieff saying one thing and the Foreign Office another, they at last came to disbelieve both, aud stuck for their own interests exclusively. England regarded the whole affair as proof positive at once of Russian aggressiveness and Russian duplicity bat the loose system through which the autocracy works is at least as much to blame as any inherent duplicity in the Russian character, os any quality of excessiveness in Russian ambition.</p>

            The latest telegrams from the Caucasus are vague and confused. It is impossible to say whether the rising is spreading or subsiding. Against the reassuring official telegrams, there are private messages recounting wholesale massacres of Armenians.
            It is feared that the four British subjects at Balakhany have been shot or perished in the flames.	(fiswtw)
            BAKU, September 9.
            The Armenian Bishop at Shusha telegraphs an appalling account of the devastation there. The town is a mass of rains. The fighting between the Tartars and the Armenians lasted five days. Hundreds of killed and wounded are lying in the streets. He appeals for aid for the starving people who number thousands. It is estimated that the actual destruction to the oil industry at Baku involves a direct loss of £20,000,000, while it will require several millions to restore the workings. In addition there will be immense losses to the Russian industries using naphtha as a fuel. (BsalsrJ
            ST. PETEBSBUBO, September 9.
            It is annonnoed from Baku that the damages caused by the fires are estimated at 500,000,000 francs, and that in the fights between the Tartars and Armenians 1,500 people have been killed.	(Ham)

                            <head>SIR WILLIAM GARSTIN ON UPPER ’NILE PROBLEMS.</head>
            <p>Sir William Garstin in his: article entitled “Some problems of the Upper Nile" which has recently appeared ; in the September Nineteenth Century, and After,’’ after a most interesting description of the part played by the different rivers which together form the Nile, and a picturesque account of their prin¬cipal features, points out that by 1908, two and a half million seres of land in Egypt will require to be provided with perennial irriga¬tion. (Te most thin need five million of cobio metres of water must be stored.
            The Assouan dam will, perhaps, not be raised, and the Wadi Rayan will probably be left till »such time are the question of reclaim¬ing and irrigating the shallowlakes of, the Northern Delta shall,become one- of urgency,Farther storage of water, even if, the Assouan dam were raised, (would injure winter, navign tion on the Nila between Assouan and Cairo in. a year of low supply and would only furnish a partial solution of the problem. The extra water required can only be obtained by in- creasing the flow of,the Upper Nile during winter, spring, and early summer.
            Sir William Garstin then describes the scheme suggested by Mr. J. E. Beresford, late Impastor General of legation in India for the construction of a new Channel between Bor and the Sohat junction. The scheme would oertainly enable the whole summer
            discharge of the white Nile to reach Tewfi kieh with the minimum of loss, the marshes being used to receive the flood overflow.
            This new channel would be 322 miles in' length, while if the Bahr el Zeraf were cleared and freed of obstructions the distance from Bor to Tewfikieh would still be 498 miles,, and if the Bahr el Gebel was used it would be fifty-two miles longer.
            As regards distance the advantages of the Beresford's scheme are great, but the author points out that there are two difficulties; its possibly prohibitive cost owing to diffi¬cult levels which surveys may yet discover, and the practical difficulties in the way of actually constructing the channel. At the same time a regulator should be constructed near the outlet of the Albert Lake, as Sir William Willoooks has long urged, to secure permanency of supply in the river. Its cons¬truction is in Sir William Garstin's opinion ' the key to the whole question of the impro¬vement of the Upper Nile."
            Taming to the Bine Nile, the question of a Tsana reservoir cannot be discussed owing to the immense political difficulties connected therewith, and it is a little doubtful whether a suitable site for a Blue Nile reservoir exists in Anglo Egyptian territory. Perennial irriga¬tion in the Sudan south of Khartoum must for the present be abandoned, and all future schemes must almost certainly be devoted to the study of the improvement of winter and flood irrigation. Weirs will have to be constructed between Khartoum and Roeaires, and would be accompanied .by. a system of basins and distributory canals, Such basins might reduce the risk of flood in the Northern Nile valley in “high Nile” years.

            No sooner was M. Cronies buried than those interested in the Say concern and in the Sucreries d' Egypte went to work to examine the situation, and to see what1 remedies' could be found to save the existence, at least, of the former venture. Apparently all efforts will be concentrated to that end, so that the concentration of the production in which thousands of people are engaged ought not to be stopped one moment. M. Peytel (the managing director of the Credit Algerian)' has meanwhile been entrusted with the duties' of'Chairman of the Sav Company and M. Pelissier with those of technical director of the factories. It is not likely that M. Peytel, who in- recent years has been one of the busiest' of bank directors, would definitely, sesame the sucession of M. Oronier. As to the Sucreries of Egypte, - repre¬sentatives of the banks holding the notorious bills signed by the late' M. Gronier1—notably,' the “Ronvier” Bank, the Union Parisignne, the Austrian Laiderbank, and Messrs. Hindi
            have met and discussed the state of affairs with the directors of this Franco-Egyptian venture, in which, moreover, English capital is largely interested. No definite resolution has been adopted besides that to "urgently convence a general meeting of the shareholders, which will take place at Cairo.'The secretary of the company his already left for that place, to prepare'eventually measures for a- “conooidat" according to Egyptian company law, which, in any case, would be more pro¬fitable to the shareholders than a winding-up under French legislation.
            If certain statements are to be credited, the consolidation of the Sudrsries d' Egypte is indeed fraught with great and complicated difficulties. The Societe dee Raffiheries et Snoreriee d'Egypte is really an emalgamatioh of the various sugar concern formerly belong¬ing to the Daira Banish, and; according to its statutes, has to pay to the latter an annuity of 2,030,421 fra. The inability to pay, this amount would necessarily lead to a declaration of bankruptcy. It is in that direction, there¬fore, that the board will have to use all its endeavours. On the other hand, Hear from a' well-informed source; 17 out of the 18  banks which were reported to hold bills signed by M. -Grenier, and due- on September 1, had consented * to a moratorium, -and the' Banque Russo'Chinoise alone refused'to adhere to this arrange cut - Strong appeals -here made to the Russian Government to urge upon the director! of the Russo- Chimsed Bank to change their attitude. ‘ A point'iwhich also required etosidatioa has now been made clear. It was said at first that it was a request of the flay family to render accounts of the treat money- which drove1 M. Csenier to commit suicide. The real and direct cause, however, was that M. Oronier was unable to -settle a bill for 1,000,OOOfra, which matured on the fatal Saturday with the Anglo-Egypt Bank. •
           As we go to press we receive a telegram from our London correspondent informing M that Malta Carton de Wiart left London on Friday and will arrive at early-on Wednesday morning. Maltre Carton de Wiart’a advanced return to Egypt is connected with the Sucraries situation.</p>

Once outside the tent Agoao made off at remarkable speed the Cafe d’Afrique. Several individuals who tried to stop him were promptly stabbed, though their injuries were in no case severe. Once safely past the cafe the culprit turned into’ the aide alleys, where there are no police; and twisting and dodging at fall, speed disap¬peared from view.
