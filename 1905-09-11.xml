                    <head>RUSSIAN DIPLOMACY</head>
                    <p>The diplomatic skill of the Russian Govern¬ment in devising and pushing its
                        plans is, we suspect, a little overrated in Western Europe. It is there
                        believed that St. Peters¬burg is served by hundreds of able and
                        uns¬crupulous agen s, who all pull together, and all carry out far reaching
                        plans, which they do not talk about, but thoroughly understand. The Russian
                        Government is, therefore, it is alleged, successful beyond all other
                        Govern¬ments, so successful that any whisper of its future plans of
                        aggrandisement, even when badly authenticated, sometimes causes a flutter
                        among the nations. Russia, it is said, never, even if defeated, gives up her
                        purpo¬ses ; and as she has no Parliament to distract her, and no
                        diplomatists can contend with her agents in aubtlety and foresight, sba
                        almost always succeeds in them. The result is a widely diffused alarm, and a
                        consequent exaltation of the Russian repute for ability, which of itself
                        increases the weight of Russia in the councils of the world. The facts,
                        however, if carefully observed, do not bear out these pessimistic opinions.
                        Russia, it is true, has spread far and fast in Northern Asia, where there
                        was nothing strong enough to resist her, and where, it must in justice be
                        added, her administration, though always too daa- potio, and occasionally
                        violent and cruel, is distinctly better through long terms of years than the
                        administrations it superseded. Bnt she has not succeeded at all strikingly
                        in making herself a "world-Power.” She She has feared to colonise any place
                        divided from herself by the sea. She has not, after a century of effort,
                        broken her way to open water yet. She has not conquered Constantinople, and
                        her land road to it is as solidly barred as ever. Bhe has, by permitting the
                        conversion of Germany from a loosely knit Federation into a strongly knit
                        military Empire, immeasurably reduced her own influence in Europe ; has,
                        indeed, compelled hmelf to lean for safety on an ally whose thoughts are not
                        her thought®, and whose objects ere aaaeawily Inn in Aab ab hm oonpQad India
                        to strengthen herself so greatly that an invasion from the North is most
                        difficult; and goaded Japan into fighting her before she herself was nearly
                        ready to repel and punish the assault. She has driven England, which at
                        heart dis- likes fettering alliances, into a close alliance with the most
                        formidable enemy of Russia on he Pacific ; has at the same time, by a series
                        of amazing blunders, alienated the strong sym¬pathy formerly felt for her.
                        in the United States ; and has forced the strongest and most united of
                        clans, the world-wide Jewish people, with its controlling influence over
                        finance and journalism, to become her irreconcilable foe. These can hardly
                        be called successes, even if we refrain from comparing Russian diplo-
                        matists and statesmen with Bismarck and Cavour, each of whom won for his
                        master each splendid triumphs ; and the successive occu¬pants of the Russian
                        Foreign Office have failed at another point which may prove hereafter of
                        ever greater importance. They have failed in securing the confidence of the
                        world, or even of that section of it whose ideas march fairly well with
                        their own. We do not our¬selves believe, as most of our countrymen do, that
                        this loss is a deserved, We see no reason for believing that falsity is
                        imbedded in the Russian character, or that her diplomat¬ists despise a rigid
                        adherence to truth more than the majority of their profession. Russia keeps
                        European treaties fairly well, and has once or twice exhibited in difficult
                        circumstance a fidelity to pecuniary engagements at once praiseworthy in
                        itself and profitable to her credit We should have said that the innate
                        Russian fault was a violent aggreesive- ness of demeanour rather than a
                        silken falsity like that of the Byzantines. Bat it is mere matter of fact
                        that her agents have in one way or another created a nearly universal
                        distrust in her sincerity, and that this distrust hampers and burdens her at
                        every turn. It was really disbelief in Russian promises which induced Japan
                        to stake her existence as an independent Power upon the ohanoea of a long,
                        exhausting, and most com plicated war. But for distrust as to the security
                        of the “open door,” Russia might have almost a free hand in settling the
                        destiny of China. But for a suspicion which, jnst or unjust, seems
                        irremovable, Great Britain and Russia would long ago have come to an
                        agree¬ment about influence in Asia which would, to say the least of it, have
                        reduced their financial hardens in that continent by one-half. It is
                        Russia's indefiniteness as to pledgee, to use the most polite expression,
                        which prevents the world from securing for her the o]ear water¬way to the
                        Mediterranean which she very naturally thinks her right Let Russia but
                        convince the world that she intends to go straight, and her career, even if
                        it is still a career of conquest, will be smoothed for her in every
                        direction. Nobody wants to keep her away from the water out of pare spite ;
                        bat then nobody believes what her agents, who are struggling to clear the
                        road to the water for her, say or promise. To what, then, are we to ascribe
                        the ten¬dency of successive Russian Governments to inspire a distrust which,
                        so far from streng-thening, cripples them I They must know that it is an
                        obstacle, and why do they allow it to grow np ! In part, no donbt, it is due
                        to the fact that under an obscurantist autocracy it is the unscrupulous who
                        most frequently rise to the top ; but it is also in part due to a very
                        curious failure within the autocracy itself. Every one in Western Europe
                        thinks of the Russian agents as slaves to a central Com¬mittee ; but in
                        reality the Russian Govern¬ment gives its agents more of a free hand than is
                        enjoyed by those of any other European Power. It leaves to its Ambassadors
                        and Vice- a liberty as complete as it claims for it¬self, refuses to fetter
                        them with detailed “instructions,” and requires of them nothing but success.
                        Sometimes, when the agents are able and dreamstanoes are favourable, that
                        policy succeeds; and sometimes, when, as often happens, they are stupid cr
                        obstinate men, it fails; but always it leaves to oompa* ratively
                        irresponsible men too much power, and always it tempts them to make promises
                        and sign arrangements which the ultimate authority is obliged more or less
                        decisively to repudiate. The agents are, of course, eager for approval at
                        home, and they are also eager to be, and to appear to be, great personages
                        at their stations. They straggle for sucess, they grow jealous of each
                        other, they try to make everything pleasant to St. Petersburg, till their
                        Government, there is reason to believe, often grows bewildered by the
                        information oonveyed, and a sort of contest springs up between the
                        delegating authority and the authorities who are delegated. There is an
                        incoherence in their action which at once suggests to the observe* —who, be
                        it remembered, is full of distrust— that somebody is cheating, or hiding
                        truths, or making promises which it is not inten ded to keep. It is dear,
                        for example even from the very imperfect revelations that have reached the
                        general ear, that a struggle of thia kind occurred between St Petersburg and
                        the Viceroy of the Far East; that the Tsar in tended a compromise while his
                        Viceroy tend¬ed either to secure a grand diplomatic victory or to force a
                        war, the result being that the Japanese thought that they were being amused
                        while preparations went on,'and at last refused to be delayed any longer.
                        Could they have trusted their antagonists, they might have assented to an
                        arrangement which would at least have postponed war for five years ; but
                        with Admiral Alexeieff saying one thing and the Foreign Office another, they
                        at last came to disbelieve both, aud stuck for their own interests
                        exclusively. England regarded the whole affair as proof positive at once of
                        Russian aggressiveness and Russian duplicity bat the loose system through
                        which the autocracy works is at least as much to blame as any inherent
                        duplicity in the Russian character, os any quality of excessiveness in
                        Russian ambition.</p>

                    confused. It is impossible to say whether the rising is spreading or subsiding.
                    Against the reassuring official telegrams, there are private messages recounting
                    wholesale massacres of Armenians. It is feared that the four British subjects at
                    Balakhany have been shot or perished in the flames. (fiswtw) BAKU, September 9.
                    The Armenian Bishop at Shusha telegraphs an appalling account of the devastation
                    there. The town is a mass of rains. The fighting between the Tartars and the
                    Armenians lasted five days. Hundreds of killed and wounded are lying in the
                    streets. He appeals for aid for the starving people who number thousands. It is
                    estimated that the actual destruction to the oil industry at Baku involves a
                    direct loss of £20,000,000, while it will require several millions to restore
                    the workings. In addition there will be immense losses to the Russian industries
                    using naphtha as a fuel. (BsalsrJ ST. PETEBSBUBO, September 9. It is annonnoed
                    from Baku that the damages caused by the fires are estimated at 500,000,000
                    francs, and that in the fights between the Tartars and Armenians 1,500 people
                    have been killed. (Ham) BAKU, September 10. The Vice-Consul telegraphs that all

                    which together form the Nile, and a picturesque account of their prin¬cipal
                    features, points out that by 1908, two and a half million seres of land in Egypt
                    will require to be provided with perennial irriga¬tion. (Te most thin need five
                    million of cobio metres of water must be stored. The Assouan dam will, perhaps,
                    not be raised, and the Wadi Rayan will probably be left till »such time are the
                    question of reclaim¬ing and irrigating the shallowlakes of, the Northern Delta
                    shall,become one- of urgency,Farther storage of water, even if, the Assouan dam
                    were raised, (would injure winter, navign tion on the Nila between Assouan and
                    Cairo in. a year of low supply and would only furnish a partial solution of the
                    problem. The extra water required can only be obtained by in- creasing the flow
                    of,the Upper Nile during winter, spring, and early summer. Sir William Garstin
                    then describes the scheme suggested by Mr. J. E. Beresford, late Impastor
                    General of legation in India for the construction of a new Channel between Bor
                    and the Sohat junction. The scheme would oertainly enable the whole summer
                    discharge of the white Nile to reach Tewfi kieh with the minimum of loss, the
                    marshes being used to receive the flood overflow. This new channel would be 322
                    miles in' length, while if the Bahr el Zeraf were cleared and freed of
                    obstructions the distance from Bor to Tewfikieh would still be 498 miles,, and
                    if the Bahr el Gebel was used it would be fifty-two miles longer. As regards
                    distance the advantages of the Beresford's scheme are great, but the author
                    points out that there are two difficulties; its possibly prohibitive cost owing
                    to diffi¬cult levels which surveys may yet discover, and the practical
                    difficulties in the way of actually constructing the channel. At the same time a
                    regulator should be constructed near the outlet of the Albert Lake, as Sir
                    William Willoooks has long urged, to secure permanency of supply in the river.
                    Its cons¬truction is in Sir William Garstin's opinion ' the key to the whole
                    question of the impro¬vement of the Upper Nile." Taming to the Bine Nile, the
                    question of a Tsana reservoir cannot be discussed owing to the immense political
                    difficulties connected therewith, and it is a little doubtful whether a suitable
                    site for a Blue Nile reservoir exists in Anglo Egyptian territory. Perennial
                    irriga¬tion in the Sudan south of Khartoum must for the present be abandoned,
                    and all future schemes must almost certainly be devoted to the study of the
                    improvement of winter and flood irrigation. Weirs will have to be constructed
                    between Khartoum and Roeaires, and would be accompanied .by. a system of basins
                    and distributory canals, Such basins might reduce the risk of flood in the
                    Northern Nile valley in “high Nile” years. MISSIONARIES FOR THE SUDAN. THE

                <p> The latest reports from the Yemen show that the success of Ahmed Pari Pasha was
                    due to the astonishing courage with which his troops repeatedly rushed
                    formidably en- trenched positions with the bayonet in the face of a very heavy

                    offensive tactics, though the veteran Marshal was denied the farther
                    reinforcement of 25,000 men which he demanded, and might well have feared to

                    those interested in the Say concern and in the Sucreries d' Egypte went to work
                    to examine the situation, and to see what1 remedies' could be found to save the
                    existence, at least, of the former venture. Apparently all efforts will be
                    concentrated to that end, so that the concentration of the production in which
                    thousands of people are engaged ought not to be stopped one moment. M. Peytel
                    (the managing director of the Credit Algerian)' has meanwhile been entrusted
                    with the duties' of'Chairman of the Sav Company and M. Pelissier with those of
                    technical director of the factories. It is not likely that M. Peytel, who in-
                    recent years has been one of the busiest' of bank directors, would definitely,
                    sesame the sucession of M. Oronier. As to the Sucreries of Egypte, -
                    repre¬sentatives of the banks holding the notorious bills signed by the late' M.
                    Gronier1—notably,' the “Ronvier” Bank, the Union Parisignne, the Austrian
                    Laiderbank, and Messrs. Hindi have met and discussed the state of affairs with
                    the directors of this Franco-Egyptian venture, in which, moreover, English
                    capital is largely interested. No definite resolution has been adopted besides
                    that to "urgently convence a general meeting of the shareholders, which will

                    than a winding-up under French legislation. If certain statements are to be
                    credited, the consolidation of the Sudrsries d' Egypte is indeed fraught with
                    great and complicated difficulties. The Societe dee Raffiheries et Snoreriee

                    the latter an annuity of 2,030,421 fra. The inability to pay, this amount would
                    necessarily lead to a declaration of bankruptcy. It is in that direction,
                    there¬fore, that the board will have to use all its endeavours. On the other

                    reported to hold bills signed by M. -Grenier, and due- on September 1, had
                    consented * to a moratorium, -and the' Banque Russo'Chinoise alone refused'to
                    adhere to this arrange cut - Strong appeals -here made to the Russian Government
                    to urge upon the director! of the Russo- Chimsed Bank to change their attitude.

                    cause, however, was that M. Oronier was unable to -settle a bill for
                    1,000,OOOfra, which matured on the fatal Saturday with the Anglo-Egypt Bank. •

                    <p>On a dit de Cronier qu’il etait I’adminiatra teur ideal des Sacreries dont
                        lexistence ne pouvait etre assuree que par l’appoint de ses speculations
                        tonjoars heureuses. Par consequent,’ plus de Cronier, plus d cannes sacra,
                        plus da Sucreries ni da Raffi nerie possibles an Egypte. Un journal du
                        Caire, apres avoir admia que la Societe pouvait aisement ameliorer sa situa-
                        tion, si lea 20 millions de la Sugar Corporation dtaient saufs, n’en
                        assurait pas moins quelqnes jours apres, alors que oette somme etait

                        National Bank pouvaient bien en prolonger lea jours, mais non les suaver.
                        Lea raisons que faisait valoir le journal en question dtaieat lea suivantes
                        : 1. la Societe tra vaille aperte, et 2. le travail sera bientot arrete
                        parlemanque de la matiere prem ere indispensa¬ble : la canne. Ainsi plus on
                        fabriquera de sacs de sucre, plus on perdra de l’argent.Cela me rap pelle oe
                        que disait an lendemain do Kracli Philippart un journal de cette villa a
                        propos des trama d’Alexandrie : “Plus ile transportent de voyageura, plus
                        ila perdent de l'argent.” Et il etait pas seul defendre ce paradoxe ; an
                        autre journal, qui a empruntd son nom an marohd des titres, prouvait en meme
                        tempa par une ingenieuse combination de chiffres que lactif des Trama etait
                        presque nul, que l’ex- ploitation en dtait ruineuse et qu’il fallait se
                        debarrasser des actions dividendes tout an moins (elles dtaient alora a 21
                        fr.) car, soutenait, elles ne calent pas un sou ! Le conseil ne fut quere

                        mal pour cela,paisqu’il y a bean tamps que lea titres sont a fra. 350 et
                        plus. Bref, je ne puis partager lea vues qae le journal de la capitale a
                        emises tant sur la va- lenr dea titres de la Societe des Sucreries en cas de

                        preuve, par dea donndas precises, que la culture de la canne eat moins
                        lucrative que celle des cereales et meme du coton dans la Haute-Egypte,
                        reate encore a faire. Lea ter¬rains, d’ailleura, ne font paa defaut. En

                        maladroitement d’ailleura. Le prix de la canne sera certainement tou- jours
                        plus eleve ici qu’k Cuba on a Java, mais une exploitation bien comprise pent

                            <head> COTTON FROM BRITISH EAST AFRICA.</head>
                            <p> Professor Garstang writes to the "Times" as follows: -The expedition
                                which left here at Christmas time last year to make excavations
                                between Edfu and Esna in Upper Egypt has returned, and the objects
                                of antiquity discovered have arrived in England, after a somewhat
                                prolonged season. Hierakonpolis, the home of Egypt’s earliest kings,
                                was the place selected for first investiga¬tion. The palace site is
                                well known from the researches of former explorers, and
                                conse¬quently the present excavations were made rathet in the
                                outlying township, which proved to be almost wholly of
                                proto-dynastic age. Immediately below the rubbish of more recent
                                times, strata representing the third and earlier dynasties were
                                comes upon ; it was even pos Bible in some instances to trace the
                                walls of houses and the disposition of rooms and passages of that
                                remote date, about 3000 B.C. Vases of alabaster and granite, as well
                                as Hint knives of conspicuously delicate workmanship, and other
                                small objects, served to illustrate the archaeology of the time and
                                locality, As the dry season came on, however, the ground in general
                                proved too hard for the careful excavation demanded by so important
                                a site, and work thereon was postponed until a more favourable
                                season. Meanwhile within the great fortress which stands immediately
                                opposite upon the edge of the western desert and seems to have been
                                built in a contemporary age for the protection of this palace, it
                                was found by experiment that previous excavators had not penetrated
                                deeply enough to reach its lowest historical strata. At a depth
                                which varied according to the accu¬mulation of sand from two to
                                three metres be¬low the existing surface, a whole necropolis of the
                                prehistoric are was discovered and excavat¬ed : 1»8 graves were
                                registered and photo¬graphed in detail, Ihey seem to range in date
                                from about the middle portion of the pre dynastic sequence until the
                                beginning of the first dynasty. in themselves they have provided
                                much that is of interest, and in relation to the walls of the
                                fortress, associated with the tomb structures of later date upon the
                                outside, have furnished reliable evidence that the fortress itself
                                belongs to a date lying between the first and third dynasties. At
                                the completion of that excavation, after nearly two months of works,
                                explorations were made throughout the whole region lying south¬ward
                                as far as Histayeh. Tentative excavations were made at several
                                points. At Edfu the remains seem to be of Ptolemaic times, while at
                                Hiasayeh some interesting funereal furniture and hieroglyphic papyri
                                of pro-Ptolemaio date were discovered in the debris of a former exca
                                vation. Plundering during very reoent times had rendered these sites
                                unsuitable for the continuous work of an organised expedition ;
                                consequently, after the third month, camp was fixed at Esna on the
                                northern limit of the concession. As is often the case, rumours that
                                the place had been plundered had in some measure saved it for the
                                excavators. The smaller tombs of the great necropolis at once gave
                                evidenoe of their origin during the Hyksoa period ; it seems
                                probable (though the results of further excavation must be awaited
                                before a definite conclusion can be established) that the site came
                                into being daring the pressure from the north in those troubled
                                times upon the oapi’al at Thebes. During the prosperous era of the
                                Egyptian monarchy which followed—the age of the Pharaohs of the
                                eighteenth and nine¬teenth dynasties—the site at Esna seems to have
                                fallen into neglect ; but from the twent¬ieth dynasty, which
                                heralded the period of the decline of the Egyptian power power,
                                about 100 B.C., Esna again came into prominenoe. Two great mounds,
                                conspicuous in the desert from afar, proved to be tomb structures of
                                this later date. These, cleared of their accumulated sand, disclosed
                                great structures of brick in good preservation, which comprises a
                                series of eight or ten chambers upon the ground-floor with a
                                stairway leading up to a similar series above. The arches and vaults
                                were pointed, in nearly every case. In a stone-lined chamber within
                                the largest structure there was found the head of an apis carved in
                                stone, of the time of Raineses VI., and numerous remains of animals
                                sacrificed at that shrine were found within the chamber. These
                                structures were in reality great tombs, built, it would seem, for
                                the permanent use of some fomily. Unfort¬unately, a conflagration
                                within the chambers, which seemed to have been deliberately brought
                                about, had destroyed much arcbasologioal evidence ;but the
                                architecture illustrated is of a new interst. The largest of those
                                tombs stood upon abase 14 8 metres (nearly 50ft.) square ; and its
                                height was half its length, measured from its lowest course, deep in
                                the sand, to the existing summit, which seems to be original. The
                                annual exhibition of antiquities discover- cd (which in previous
                                years under the same auspices has been held in Burlington Hone.)
                                will be held this year, owing to the lateness of the season, in the
                                premises of the Institute of Archmology of this Univvreity ; it will
                                be open for inspection towards the end of the present month. The
                                "Bulletin of the Imperial Institute” writes as follows :— Samples of
                                five varieties of cotton, including ginned and unginned specimens of
                                each, were recently forwarded to the Imperial Institute by the
                                Director of Agriculture for the East Africa Protectorate, together
                                with a memoran¬dum on their cultivation. These samples have been
                                submitted to avami nation in the scientific and technical department
                                of the Imperial Institute, and have been referred to commercial
                                experts for valua¬tion. An account of the results of the
                                investi¬gation is given below. The following interesting particulars
                                relat¬ing to the sample labelled "No. J. 6, Lamu Cotton” were
                                supplied by the Director of Agriculture in the memorandum referred
                                to above. The plant which yields this cotton is a variety of
                                Goseyptum kerbaceum, which was probably introduced into East Africa
                                from India at an early date, and has long been grown on the Bajoon
                                coast. The quantity of cotton fibre produced in this district
                                amounts , to about six tons per annnm, part of which is . used
                                locally for stuffing pillows, and part is exported to India. The
                                cotton is plant- i ed in April, and the crop is gathered from
                                October to January. The seed is sown on sandy soil, in holes about
                                three i feet apart, in some cereal crop or in sesame^ ;. after the
                                latter crop has been harvested the 1 cotton is left on the land, but
                                receive’ no , farther cultivation. Cotton is collected from ! the
                                same plants for at least five years, but owing to growth of weeds
                                and bush, the plants gradually become fewer in number, and finally
                                disappear. The average yield of cotton is probably less than 100
                                pounds per acre. The large amount of leaf and boll fragments in the
                                cotton is due to the method of colleo- tion. The whole capsules are
                                gathered, and the cotton, after being roughly removed, is beaten on
                                a mattress, when the greater part1 of the dry leaves and capsules
                                are powdered j and fall to the ground. The cotton is then ‘ ginned
                                by means of a pair of small wooden j rollers. The ootton is sold at
                                about 2 jd. per pound. The samples consisted of 2 pounds of ginned '
                                cotton and I pound of the unginned product. Both specimens,
                                especially the unginned con¬tained a large amount of fragments of
                                leaves and bolls. The seeds were very small and closely invested
                                with short, white downy hairs, The cotton was white with numerous
                                buff-coloured stains ; it was harsh, of fair strength, and 0'6 to 0
                                9 incheas long. The fibre would not be of much value for i spinning
                                alone, but could be used for mixing 1 with cotton of a higher grade.
                                The commercial experts reported that the 1 ginned ootton was of too
                                low a quality to class, ! but was perhaps worth Id. per pound. It is
                                stated in the memorandom furnished ' by the Director of Agriculture
                                that the sample ’ labelled "No. J. 7, Fort Hall Cotton,” is pro-1
                                bably derived from an American variety. The i cotton was grown
                                experimentally by H.M. ; sub commissioner on damp, shallow, dark
                                loam, i was planted in December 1903, and harvested ' in June 1904.
                                The sample consisted of about one pound of ginned and one pound of
                                unginned cotton. I The seeds were dark brown in colour and bore 1 a
                                small white tuft at the pointed end; in i some cases they were
                                covered with a light ' brown or brownish green down. The cotton was
                                of bright appearance, was cream-coloured, fairly soft, of rather
                                poor strength, and from 1*0 to 1*5 inches long. | The commercial
                                experts reported that the cotton, was, on the whole, of good silky
                                staple, but somewhat mixed and worth d. per pound, "middling
                                American” cotton being quoted at 4^ d. per pound on the same date.
                                The sample labelled “No. J. 8, Kibwezi Cotton, Afifi” was stated to
                                have been grown from Egyptian seed by an Arab at Kibwezi, by means
                                of irrigation on shallow rocky soil. The cotton was planted in March
                                and har¬vested in September. The plants were healthy and produced a
                                large number of capsnles. The samples consisted of 3 pounds of
                                ginned cotton, and 1| pounds of the unginned mater¬ial. The ungiuned
                                cotton was fairly clean but was to a large extent unripe. The seeds
                                corresponded to those of Egyptian "mitafifi,” but a considerable
                                portion terminated in a sharp point and resembled the seed of the
                                so-called "hindi” cotton, the old white cotton of Egypt, which
                                commonly occurs associated with “mitafifi” and lowers the value of
                                that product. In Egypt it is the custom on select¬ing the seeds for
                                sowing to reject all these sharp-pointed seeds. The sample was of
                                uneven colour with occa¬sional brown stains; the fibre was of very
                                irregular strength, fairly soft to the touch, and 1 0 to 13 inches
                                long. The commercial experts reported that the cotton was deeply
                                stained, but of fair staple and worth about 3d. per pound, ‘ fully
                                good fair brown Egyptian” cotton being quoted at 6 l/8d. per pound
                                on the same date. The sample labelled "No. J. 9, M’hindi Cotton,
                                Malindi.” Cotton is said to be a variety of Gouypium peruvtanum. The
                                plants occur singly on the coast, and also grow at Voi and Teavo.
                                The tree is growing as a perennial, and very little ootton of this
                                variety is prodnoed. The sample consisted of 1 pound 8 ounces of
                                unginned cotton and 1 pound of ginned cotton. The cotton was of the
                                "kidney” variety, the black seeds being united in groups Of about
                                seven. The cotton was easily detached from the seeds and was of
                                uneven colour, being cream-coloured with occasional reddish-brown
                                stains. The fibre was fairly soft, of poor strength, and 0*9 to It

                                pound on the same date. The sample labelled "No. J. 10, Kiaumu
                                Cotton” consisted of 1 j pounds of unginned and 2 pounds of ginned
                                cotton. The cotton appeared to consist of two distinct varieties,
                                the fibre of one being white whilst that of the other was reddish.
                                The reddish ootton had dark brown seeds bearing a small, green¬ish
                                tuft, whilst the white cotton had black, sharply-pointed seeds like
                                those of "hindi” cotton. The ginned cotton was of a pale reddish
                                oolour with occasional brown stains. The fibre was soft to the
                                touch, of irregular strength, and 10 to 13 inohea long. The
                                commercial exports reported that the cotton was of very hard staple,
                                and was worth about 5 d. per pound, "fully good fair brown Egyptian”
                                cotton being quoted at 6 id. per pound on the same date. In
                                conclusion, the results of this investiga¬tion prove that these
                                cottons are, on the whole, of promising quality, but that they show
                                evidence of lack of care in cultivation. If more care were employed,
                                particularly in the selection of seed for sowing end in the
                                harvesting of the cotton, there can be no doubt that a product could
                                be obtained which would be readily rateable in the English market.
                                THE ENGINE OB THE FUTURE. The gas-eugine is regarded as the prime
                                mover of the future, and because of this, importance is attached to
                                a dear statement, by a writer in “Engineering,” of the principal
                                difficulties which remain to be overcome in order to enable large
                                engines operating with poor gas in general to work with safety,
                                facility of control and upkeep — attributes which appear to have
                                remained the special feature of the s team -engine. Economically the
                                gas- engine is evidently superior, but low consump¬tion is not the
                                only quality which users require from a motive power. It is
                                necessary above all that it should be free from the risk of sudden
                                stoppages, which lead to great expense, as they hamper production,
                                and may be at times fatal in certain industries where break¬downs
                                must be especially avoided ; such is the case with electric
                                stations, pumping, hoisting and ventilating work in mines, Ac. The
                                principal causes of breakdowns in engines fed by gas other than town
                                gas, which undergoes a complete purification, consists in the
                                foaling of parts, such as the pipes, the valves, and the oylinder,
                                by impurities in the gas. In large installations, where it is
                                extremely important to avoid breakdowns, resourse is had to special
                                means of washing and purifying, by the use of centrifugals and other
                                apparatus. But although these succeed in reducing to 1/5 gramme per
                                cubiometretheamountofdustaccompanying the gas, they still allow the
                                passage of tar, which is the principal element destructive to the
                                engine. This tar adheres to the sides of the passages, causes the
                                valves and piston-rings to attack,thua preventing their proper
                                action. It also deposits itself in the cylinder, where it finally
                                gives rise to premature ignitions.Certain coke-oven gases contain as
                                much as 1 gramme of tar per cubic metre. It is this very question of
                                tar which compels us, in order to avoid great complica¬tions, to
                                employ exclusively non-caking anthra¬cite coal for annotion
                                gas-producers, now so largely in nee owing to their simplicity and
                                economical efficiency. As tar is a product of the volatile carbons
                                (carbides) which escape combustion and on the conversion into fuel-
                                gas, it is to our intersts to reduce them in the producer itself.
                                Different systems have been proposed, amongst which is the system of
                                in¬verted combustion, which is said to have the result of burning
                                the volatile matters as they are given off, and the distillation of
                                the hydro¬carbons in the independent reducers. It must be admitted
                                that BO far the efforts of the inventors have not met with the
                                success expected. The caking of the fuel and the for¬mation of
                                cavities injurious to the regularity of combustion constitute the
                                principal difficulty to combat. The use of bituminous coal,
                                espe¬cially in suction gas producers, is not,therefore, a question
                                which has been industrially accom¬plished. Whether it is
                                producer-gas, blast¬furnace gas, or coke-oven gas which is used,
                                their purity is an important factor in the propet working of the
                                engines whioh they feed. The organic defects of large engines do not
                                appear to play in this respect a preponderating part. They should,
                                however, be perfected as regards facility of access and upkeep of
                                the parts, such as valves and piston. The oil con¬sumption should be
                                low, and they should be made less susceptible to variations in the
                                quality of the gas. The skill of our experts and our makers will, we
                                have no doubt, Boon overcime these latter difficulties, large gas-
                                engines will then constitute one of the most remarkable industrial
                                victories of the age in whioh we live.</p>

                            <p> "What do they know of England who only England know 1" What do they
                                even know of London 1 How, many of her children realise her
                                splendour, her mystery, and her beauty 1— for beautiful she is, with
                                a beauty of her own: She is worn and weary with her age-long matron
                                hood ; she is ill-dressed, untidy, a care¬less, tired queen ; but a
                                queen all the same, with royal footsteps and moments when she
                                flashes on yon a strange charm more pene¬trating than that of her
                                younger sisters decked in rose and gold. But her sons and daughters
                                know her not. They go about their toil or pleasure with unseeing
                                eyes. To them London is a place to make money in, or to spend it,
                                the site of the workshop, the office, the club, the restaurant, but
                                otherwise just a spoilt fragment of earth’s surface, serrated with
                                mean streets and grey buildings. So when we want beauty we hasten
                                away from London to seek aesthetic impressions elsewhere, ignoring
                                those that lie so dose at hand. Most of us in these days, though we
                                may be no great travellers, have made acquaintance with many famous
                                cities, with some of the earth's show places. We have rooked in a
                                gondola on a summer night in venice, and heard the boatman's deep
                                “stall” as we glided from the blaok shadows into the squares of
                                silver. We have stood at midday on the shore of the Bay of Naples
                                and looked back from a sea of white and purple to the cone of
                                Vesuvius shimmer- ing in an orange base of light We have seen the
                                Pacific plashing in long rollers at the Golden Gate, and the
                                Atlantic licking the palms and pines of the low Florida shore : we
                                have counted the minarets of Stamboul and the gilded domes and
                                painted roofs of Mosoow. Yet, in her own way, London can be as
                                im¬pressive as any of these. To tens and hundreds of thousands of
                                those who navigate this roaring strait of traffic, Fleet-street I
                                suppose, is no more than a huddle of shops, taverns, and newspaper
                                offces, too crowded to be comfortable. Yet Fleet- street can give us
                                one of the finest sights in the world. Come down it on the top of a
                                'bus, and forget for a moment your evening paper and the Test match.
                                Slowly the heavy vehicle threads its way down the crooked, sloping
                                street. The curve (how many Londoners could tell you that
                                Fleet-street is not straight?) shuts off the view, till you are well
                                past Fetter-lane. Then of a sudden it opens out be¬fore you a
                                stirring prospect. At your feet the Bridge-street creasing seethes
                                and boils, men and horses struggling, as it seems, in a black
                                whirlpool. The railway bridge, holds a train of carriages, a panting
                                engine, suspended above their heads. Beyond it, Ludgate-hiU,
                                thrust¬ing its irregular zigzag of facades upon yon, rising steeply
                                like a stairway, to where the Cathedral closes in the prospect
                                Ponderous, majestic, impenetrable, massive, the great Christian
                                church sits on the world-old hill where once the Romans made their
                                offerings in the Temple of Diana. The mighty dome hangs aloft in
                                air, shutting out a vast segment of grey sky and flying eoud,
                                filling np the horizon*: portentous in its size, by contrast with
                                every¬thing else, swelling, in free and noble curves, like a
                                mother's breast leaning, benign and gracious over the little dark
                                oity, the tense and hurrying crowds below. For several years of my
                                life it was my lot to drive from Fleet-street to Chelsea between
                                midnight and early morning. An unromantic journey, surely , yet I
                                seldom made it without wondering afresh at the strange and fanciful
                                aspects of some of our London streets in the time of slumber.
                                F.eet-street itself has no snob time of rest It is the one
                                thoroughfare in London that never sleeps. There is no hour in the
                                twenty-four when you will not find Fleet-street broad awake, with
                                lights winking from its casements, and men and horses datter- on its
                                wood and flagstones. As your h*n- som spins aloDg, it passes groups
                                of waiting carts, men shooting bags and bundles into vans yawning
                                open at the kerb, messengers diving briskly into and out of the
                                offioee. Up the middle of the street, oarelen of the rackety
                                newspaper carts aad the impatient hansoms, there swings slowly a
                                great wagon, bound for Covent Garden Market. It is piled high with
                                green stuff or fragrant ba keta of fruit , two horses, harnessed in
                                single file, draw it with sturdy, earth-shaking stride ; the driver,
                                with high whip quivering in an ample loop over his shoulder,
                                slouches heavily beside his cattle, or nods upon them from the
                                shafts. It brings a breath of the Kentish hedgerows and com- fields
                                as it ploughs its steady purposeful way up the worrying little
                                street. Like a battleship, amid its covey of fi lgeting destroyers,
                                the big wagon forges on, till it creaks ponderously round the corner
                                by Wellington-street, and strains up the bill towards the market.
                                That particular fragment of London is always full of contrasts. In
                                the win ter and early spring, on Friday night, I used to touch one
                                that I always thought peooliarly poignant As you passed by the Law
                                Courts and beyond the two churohes into the Strand, you would see a
                                long line of men. The vehicles were the hansoms waiting to take
                                people away from the Covent Garden fancy dress ball : the men were
                                the hungTy wretches tramping wearily towards General Booth’s
                                kitchen, where a bowl of warm soup was to be had. At the point of
                                Aldwych and the Kings way, where two columns cross, you might see,
                                on there nights,* canons scene. Some of General Booth’s clients
                                looked evil as well as hungry, but had nothing to fear ; there is a
                                capable sergeant of police,and two or three big, vigilant
                                constables. One of them holds up his hand with the immortal gesture
                                that is the symbol of civic law and order, end a pushing hansom
                                stops, with instant obedience, to allow a country eart to get past
                                The beam from a high standard lamp is thrown right upon the two
                                people, male and female sitting in the back Tha man is middleaged
                                with a and oiled moustache. He we are evening dress, and he is
                                smoking a plump cigar, whose savour floats gratefully to the
                                nestriis. The woman is young, and rather handsome ; there is a star
                                of diamonds in her fair hair, and the clock which falls open at the
                                front reveals a pendant of Dearls and turqnises on the white throat.
                                Man and woman are talking a little too gaily, there is a slight
                                vinous flush on both faces, and the perfume of heliotrope and
                                violets mingles with the fine fragrant of the tobacco. Not exactly
                                an idyl ; still, you may see worse pictures. And so, perhaps, think
                                the two or three outliers from the other pro¬cession, the walking
                                one, who share the spectacle with me. They stand heavily, like men
                                whose boots are broken and their feet sore; their clothes are
                                horrible ; their hair is matted and tousled under battered old hats
                                ; their faces are not nice to look upon. With strange questioning
                                eyes they stare at the couple in the hansom, at the lady, so white
                                and smooth and scented, at the sleek gentleman, overcoming the fumes
                                of a guinea bottle of champagne with an eighteen penny. Well, it is
                                the eternal antithesis, not limited to the Strand on a Friday night
                                in spring. On the one side, youth and luxury, and the jots cfe vivre
                                ; on the other, men who have walked four miles to get a crust and a
                                mug of broth. And between the two, with vigilant eyes on both, the
                                tall constables and the majesty of the Established Order. But we had
                                better stop here, for we are getting away from Fleet-street.</p>
