                    (Havas.) St. Petersburg, January 29. A circular from the Holy Synod to the
                    Chruch says that the strikes have been instigated by enemies at home and abread
                    and have been led by a crinimal priest. They have broken out at a moment when
                    all should cooperate to protect their Fatherland. The object of Russia's enemies
                    is to produce a civil war and to prevent reinforcements being sent to the
                    Manchurian Army; It concludes with an appeal for obedience to the Emperor and to
                    God's commands, and a warning against advisers with who are in the pay of
                    Russia's enemies. Moscow and our city are quiet. (Reuter.) Warsaw, January 29.

                    give his patronage to the performance. Alhambra Theatre.—Lumieres et Tenebres,
                    the latest production at the Alhambra, is a spectacular play which should have a
                    long run. It is supported by a excellent variety entertainment. A favorite with
                    Alhambra habitues, Mila Liza Cariola, makes her rentree this evening. H. M.
                    Transport "Sicilia” (Capt. G. H. C. Weston, R. N. R.) arrived at Port Said early
                    on Saturday morning from Bombay, and left at noon for Southampton direct. The
                    troops on board, consisting of details, numbered 1,206 of all ranks. A draft of
                    100 men embarked at p.r Said. Major J. R Carte, R. G. A., is the officer
                    commanding. The North German Lloyd’s S.S. “Ho-henzollern” arrived at Alexandria
                    today from Naples and Marseilles at about 2 p.m. She brought about eighty first
                    class passengers for Egypt, including a number of distinguished visitors. They
                    expect to catch the 4.25 afternoon express for Cairo, otherwise a special train
                    may be arranged for. The "Hohenzollern" is leaving Alexandria on Wednesday and
                    will return here again on the 14th proxo. "The Pirates of Penzance."—The date of
                    the first performance of the above has been advanced to the 17th of February to
                    suit the convenience of H.R.H. the Duke of Connaught, who has promised to honor
                    the performance with his presence. H.H. the Khedive has also bestowed his

                    Slade has likewise been obtained. The theatricals will thus assume the dignity

                    Cairo took place at 7 p.m. on Friday night, Skander Pasha Fehmy accompanying
                    them as far as Luxor. An empty train acted as pilot to avoid any risk of
                    accident, and the special train was composed of six carriages, in the third of
                    which were the Duke and Duchess. Prince Mohamed Ibrahim, Lord and Lady Cromer,
                    Dr. Rucker-Jenisch, Graf von Wedel, General Slade, C. B, Adly Pasha Yaghen,
                    Mansfield Pasha, Mr. P. Machell, and many other distinguished persons were on

                <p>(From Our Correspondent.) <placeName>Luxor,</placeName> Saturday. The Duke and
                    Duchess of Connaught arrived at Luxor to-day at 10.55 a.m. A number of official
                    personages were on the platform awaiting the arrival of the Royal train. Among
                    them I noticed the British consular agent, Mr. Hazell, Mr. Western, the Moudir
                    of Keneh and the Mondirieh officials, M. Legrain and Mr. Quibell, of the
                    Antiquities Department, and others, with whom the Duke wes pleased to exchange
                    salutations. On leaving the station, the Duke and Duchess of Connaught drove to
                    the temple, over which they were shown by Mr. Quibell and M. Legrain. Their
                    Royal Highnsesses spent about half an hour in inspecting the ruins, in which the
                    Princesses took especial interest. They did not proceed to Karnak, as was
                    intended, owing to the delay caused to the Royal train by the “train de luxe,"
                    which stopped for about an hour and a half on its up journey and prevented the
                    Royal train from arriving here at the scheduled time. After visiting the temple,
                    the Royal party went on board the S.S. “Ibis,” which was anchored near the
                    Anglo-American Nile Steamer and Hotel Company's landing-stage^ which Mr.
                    Simpson, the company’s agent, had tastefully decorated in honor of the occasion.
                    Tho “Ibis” left on its journey to Assouan at 12.15 p.m. Luxor station was
                    prettily decorated and the streets were lined by large crowds of people, who
                    were kept in order by the polios, whose arrangements were excellent. The front
                    of the Luxor Hotel, as well as the road leading to the landing-stage, was
                    crowded with visitors, anxious to see our Royal guests, who graciously responded
                    to the salutations that greeted them.</p>

                <p>The ball given at the Khedivial Hotel on Saturday by the Austro-Hungarian
                    Benevolent Society at Alexandria was, in every sense of the word, a brilliant
                    success. There was a very large and representative gathering present, including
                    all the leaders of local society. The scene presented in the magnificent
                    ball-room at the height of the ball was animated and pretty, some of the fair
                    dancers being garbed in exquisite "creations,” which it is beyond the power of a
                    “mere man" to describe. The ball, however, was notable for the magnificence of
                    the ladies' toilettes and the number of gentlemen present bedecked with
                    decorations. It would be futile to attempt to give an idea of the number of
                    well-known people who filled the ball-room and the saloons of the hotel We will
                    confine ourselves to giving a few of the names of the members of the English

                        selection of aire in their best style. Among the number of guests were Mrs.

                        has now become again— as Officer in Charge of Public Lands within the area
