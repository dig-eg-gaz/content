                    <head>THE MOTOR-OMNIBUS PANIC</head>
                    <p>No one who is a follower of the letters and diaries of the early Victorian
                        era can fail to be struck, says the “Daily Mail," by the close resemblance
                        between the outcry there was at that period against railways, and the storm
                        of abuse that is now breaking upon the motor omnibus. The feeling of dislike
                        and distrust of everything that is new is ineradicable, not only in homan
                        nature but in everything which hath life : “Omne ignotum pro horrifico ” It
                        is true of animals, and the mass of mankind <cb n="6"/> has not yet got over
                        the animal instincts of bieng afraid of the unfamiliar.</p>
                    <p> In the early years of railways the most gloomy prophecies were made as to
                        the penicious effects they would have on the human race. They would destroy
                        life_jopd limb whole salp, and all who esoaped matilation would by their
                        poisonous fumes. The .country would be utterly ririned by the twin plagues
                        of smoke and dust. The earth would cease to yield its increase and passenger
                        wo nil be stricken with'heart-disease brought on by the excessive speel at
                        which traios travelled 4at that time it was about twenty- five miles an
                        hoar. Many highly respeotabls and even eminent men declared their belief
                        that railways, were the invention of the devil, introduced io brdet to lure
                        to their deetractioo all who were foolhardy enough to use (hem.</p>
                    <p> Fortunately, little heed was paid to the prophets o? evil. RulwayT went
                        ahead. Eng¬land supplied them to the world and sent her engineers to teach
                        their ose to other nations. We look back nowadays and laugh at the faint
                        hearts and slow coaches who. seerionsly proposed to prohibit the
                        steam-engine. Oar descendants will have the laugh of this genera, tion for
                        being so terribly afraid of the motor- omnibus. Tjjiat this usefal vehicle,
                        already a god send to thousands of Londoners, is capable of great
                        improvement, no one but a share¬holder woold deny. It it only too true that
                        it makes a great deal of noise, that it causes a smell which many people
                        find exceedingly up- pleasant, and that the steering often leaves much to be
                        desired. But no invention ever issued from the brain of mao in petfeof
                        form.</p>
                    <p> There is, too, a vast deal of exaggeration in the complaints that are made
                        by unhappy correspondents to newspapers or across the dinner table, where
                        nowadays the plague of motor omnibuses is a fruitful topic, the most violent
                        in- their deounpiations often being motor maniacs themselvbs. Professor Sir
                        James Dewar is a great authority qn air, liquid, and atmospheric, and when
                        he tells us gravely that motor omnibuses fill our luogs with minute
                        partioles of salphor and oarbonfc oxide, which are poisonous, wary people
                        Should tremble. But the qaestion which we feel inolined to pat to Sir james
                        is, how much of these poi- sjns will hurt a man ? We are oonsoious of no
                        toxio symptoms at present We have to take so many risks, aooordiog to
                        science, in oar daily life they it scarcely seems worth while to fall into a
                        panic over one more.</p>
                    <p> At the same time, we are in fall agreement with Sir Edward Henry, the
                        Commissioner of Police, who thinks the moment has oome to oall upon the
                        motor-omnibus companies to fulfil their pledges of improvement Sir Edward
                        fioa wisely he'.d his hand so far from fear of damaging a young, important,
                        and promising iaduetry. He hes given it a good term of probation; be now
                        means to call upon it to justify his wiie and patient attitude. We most have
                        less noise; drivers must steer less emtio- ally ; they mast not oarry away
                        eo many*lamp posts; and they must lubricate so as to-avoid giving off clouds
                        of evil-smelling vapour. This is not a counsel of perfection, it .is merely
                        a qaeation of mechanics and reasonable precau-tions. If the present dim
                        panics cannot over¬came these ills, othera-wijl soon he in the field with
                        impfoved vehicles and more skilful drivers.</p>

                    <head> PAN-ISLAMISM.</head>
                    <p> The Sultan aptepts a very grave risk by posing as ,champion of combatant
                        Islym. He mast be aware (says the ‘Globe") that it is for easier to light a
                        conflagration ot that character than to extinguish the fierce flames. If he
                        hoped by stirring np Mohamedan fanaticism in Egypt to gain Frftnoh support,
                        he mast now reoog- uise that he made a profound blunder. Oar neighbours,
                        like oareelves (he rulers of great Mohamedan populations,^ already perceive
                        that the same danger that menaoes England in Northern Africa threatens their
                        military oontrol in the sooth western portion of earth extensive
                        territories. It is"atwo-edged sword which Abdal Hamid is so recklessly

                        Turkish territorial integrity. There are great military Powers not very
                        remote from the Golden Horn to whom that prospect is, naturally, fulh of
                        attractiveness, and they must have been .oovertly mirthfal when Mr. Haldane
                        announced the coming redaction of oar Mediterranean* garrison, despite Lord
                        Cromer’s argent demand for the immediate reinforoement of the British
                        contingent on the Nile. But that insanity has not orossed the ChauneL On the
                        con¬trary, the ‘ Tempe” loudly oalls for the dis¬patch of additional troops
                        to the places chiefly effected by the Saltan’s misohidMns intrigues Great
                        Britain is, however, far more deeply ooo- oercei io fighting militant Pan
                        Islamism tooth and nail. Not to speak of othfcr parts of her Empire, she

                    <p> To THE EDITOR' OF THE “EGYPTIAN GAZETTE.’’</p>
                    <p> Sir,—Yesterday I receivod an amusing reve-lation of the view taken by the
                        villagers of Denishwai themselves respecting the retribu-tion recently
                        inflicted on their village. I met fellah of Denishwai and irqnired of him
                        what he thought of the punishment that had come upon them. I expected to
                        hear, of course, a pitiable tale of the harrowing tcenes enacted in the
                        village on the memorable Thursday. What was my surprise, however, to find
                        that, these had made no impression upon the man’s mind, but thit all that he
                        thought about was his pocket. Io antwer to my question, he replied in an
                        aggrieved tone “Algum etlakhbat wal ataba zadet ("The threshing floors have
                        been aiixed np and the watchmen’s tax increased.”) I told him that these
                        were small matters, and attempted to draw his interest back to the more
                        striking events of the fateful^ Thursday, asking him what he thought of the
                        seve/o punishment then inflio/ed on his fellow- villag^fK. With the utmost
                        nonchalance he, however, exclaimed “Gat hum dahya el gum' etlakhbat wal
                        alaba zadet" (‘Let them go to the devil, for are they not the cause of our
                        thre-hing Boors being^mixea np and our watch¬</p>
                    <p> men’s tax being increased”).</p>
                    <p> As showing how far British sentiment is removed from native feeling in such
                        matters, it is curious to contrast the oompassionate interest taken by the
                        British Parliament in the severity of the sentences inflicted on the
                        vil-lagers with the view thus taken by the people of the locality

                    <head> LORD CROMER ANd tHE HOME GOVERNMENT</head>
                    <p> Sir H. Campbell-Bannerman evidently imagines that by observing silence in
                        con-nection with Lord Cromer’s recently ex¬pressed desire for additional
                        British troops io Egypt, that embarrassing request will slip from public
                        memory. Up to date, this policy of reticence has been submissively observed
                        even by the loquacious War Saoretary. In yesterday’s debate on Mr. F. E
                        Smith’s motion, it was not alluded to, directly or indirectly. The
                        assumption is, therefore, that Ministers are agreed to flout the great
                        statesman who has regenerated egypt and to ignore the dangers conseq ent on
                        the rapid spread of Pan-Islamism of whfoh he has given solemn Warning. And
                        why is that insult? to ,be offered and that grave risk to be ran? Miinly, if
                        not solely, to enable Mr. Haldane to carry through his wonderful scheme of
                        streugthen- ing-the Army by largely -reducing its fighting strength. If Ljrd
                        Cromer’s urgent^ demand were acceded to, it would bo impracticable to get
                        rid of the 20,0 0 trained troops Mr. Haldane has marked out for elimination.
                        The Government still entrenches itself be hind the "mandate” which it
                        supposes it received from the electorate at the beginning of the year. Bat
                        that ridiculous pretext for endangering the, 'safety of the Empire is
                        knocked to bit^ in the case of the Egyptian garrison by tin fact that when
                        the General Ejection took place, Lord Cromer had not sounded any note of
                        alarm. It was the im-pudent invasion of Egyptian territory by a Tirkish
                        fores. dispatched for the purpose, followed by the Deniihwai outrage aud thj
                        discovery of'Ottoman plotting at Cairo, that brooght the hidden danger to
                        light. Even the most rabid militarists will Bcaroaly charge Lord Cromer with
                        any -addiction to the use of the sword, whilq, as we h-ive shown, the
                        “mandate” foolishness does not hold water as an excuse.. (‘ G’obe”)</p>

                    <p> The British Assistant Resident at’ Kario has started on an adventurous
                        journey, which has for its object the crossing of the great Arab caravan
                        route through the Tripolitan hinterland to Kano. Fhe projeot has given rise
                        to some oomment abroad, and has even led to the saggestioo that a German
                        traveller is endeavouring to oross the Great Sahara in oannexion with the
                        Pan-blamio movement</p>
                    <p> The traveller in question,is named Visoher, and this apparently has led to
                        the belief that he is a derman. Mr. Hans Visoher, Assistant Resident at
                        Kano, is an offioial of Sir Frederick Lagard’s Administration, and is, of
                        course, a British subject. He is of Swiss extraction. So me months ago he
                        returned to Ragland on leave, and in Febraary lost went/to Tripoli,
                        intend¬ing to return to his poit atjKano by tbe^fosert route through the
                        hinterland of Tripoli.</p>
                    <p> Mr. vischers original idea was to start fromTripoli in February last, in
                        order that he might reach Kano at the end of April* While he was in Tripoli
                        mskingpreparations and obtain¬ing the necessary permission from the Turkish
                        authorities to travel in the "forbidden hinter land,” a number of pilgrims,
                        returning from Mecca to the distriotff round Kano, hearing of the presenoe
                        of a Northern Nigeria official, asked for facilities to return to their
                        homes by the desert route, aud it was then .agreed that Mr. Visoher should
                        go with them in his offioial capacity. Delay ensued in reference to cer¬tain
                        objections which were raised, and in secur¬ing the necessary permits wh'ch
                        wore obtained through the British Embassy in Constanti¬nople. The Turkish
                        Government raised mo difficulties whatever, and on july 9th Mr. Visoher,
                        acoompanied by the pilgrims, left Tripoli, travelling to Kano, via murzuk,
                        the chief town of fezzan, six hundred miles across the desert from Tripoli.
                        his journey has no political significance.</p>

                        Bank return, shewing a reserve ’ of £26,874,437, making 49 17 of the
                        liabilities, fairly represents the improvement in the sitnatioD. Tile Paris
                        oheque ra’e is down to 25.14}. ard.money is very plentifal in that market.
                        There is nothing to indicate any ooming stringency, and as far as the market
                        can see, nothing hot the move- of the Amerioan crops* is likely to oreate
                        any special demand, and this, as we have before indicated, the Secretary of
                        the United States Treasury is taking steps to satisfy with</p>
                    <p> the enormous stock at his ooinmand.</p>
                    <p> The pessimistic and even panicky feeling in the stock markets is likely to
                        oaose further disinclination to invest in any securities, and the
                        £18,060,000 required for the last Russian loan on the 1st of August will be
                        drawn from so many centres that it will not be likely to create a scarcity.
                        Of oonrse the state of affairs in Russia is intensely unsatisfactory, and it
                        is difficult to forecast the result of possible events, which we most admit
                        might upset all oalonla- tionk. At presentthe market has a foil supply, and
                        1} to 2% is all that can he obtained by lenders for short loans. The
                        discount houses are, however, very conservative in their rates, which to-day
                        are 3} to 3}% for three months’ hankers bills.</p>
                    <p> With reference to the issue of £1,500,000 Treasury Bills, in part
                        replacement of the bills doe on Jnly^th. the ‘‘Times” in its financial
                        article says that “besideanthe £’,000/ 00 pnVlioly issued, there are /also
                        some hills outstanding held by the Debt Commissioners. The phrase “in part
                        replacement” is thus justi¬fied, but.the mystification that it oaosed is a
                        orther evidence of the desirability of more looid statements concerning the
                        management of the national finances.</p>
                    <p> Tho Stook Market*.</p>
                    <p> The average Londoner is but poorly oonsti- toted to effectively resist the
                        depressing effect of semi tropical weather, hence the high tem¬perature this
                        week prodnoed a general feeling of lassitude. This being the oaae, the stook
                        markets became an easy victim to adverse influences and ramonrs, which are
                        never far removed iroin the neighbourhood of Tfirog- morton Street. Russia
                        has again been a dis¬turbing element. The feeling of confidence which had
                        followed the reports that a Parlia- mentaiy Ministry 'would sneoeed the
                        present administration disappeared when it was real¬ised that there was
                        little probability of the I’sar making such a democratic oonoession, and the
                        official recognition of the troubles in that country observed in the
                        postponement of the visit of the British fleet to Cronstadt increased the
                        bearish tone. The latest news from Rassia is even more unsatisfactory, and
                        there is an -uDeaayJeeling that the real situa¬tion is more serious^ than
                        the telegrams of correspondents make out. We are told that yesterday intense
                        pessimism prevailed on the Petersburg Bxohange, while the ^lamp in Russian
                        securities here has undoubtedly hesn responsible is DO small degree for the
                        general weakness of stocks. It is suggested that Russian bonds are being
                        deliberately hammer¬ed with the object of forcing the hand of the Antooraoy,
                        but it is too much to expect that at the present jauctnre shrewd financiers
                        are likely to add to their already numerous an¬xieties the rdle of
                        coercionist when the Tsar and bis relatives are concerned. The fall in the
                        bonds most be wholly ahoribed to extreme nervousness regarding the situation
                        in Rassia. This morning’s advices from St. Petersburg have had a
                        demoralising effect in the markets, and the bonds have shown a farther
                        consider¬able deolire. The “panicky” feeling has also seriously influenced
                        the gilt edged and other sections.</p>
                    <p>Consols.</p>
                    <p> Last week the gilt-edged market snooesbfally > resisted the gloomy feeling,
                        but this week they have 8noonmbed to the general depression, and olose }}

                        have ever been. The bearish influence is working havoc in this seotioD, and
                        the liquidation shows no signs at present of ceasing, inasmuch as Faris is
                        taking the lead in this respeo/ The FOOTS olose to night at 74} and the new

                    <p> Horne Ralls,</p>
                    <p> The dividend announcements* of the home railways have commenced. The
                        Brighton line maintains its rate of 3}%, and the Great Eastern is increased
                        by } to 1 The Tilbnry dividend, on the other hand, is lower at 3|%, and the
                        Metropolitan rate at 1}% is less by 1%. City and Scnth London is increased
                        by } to 2}%. Notwithstanding the generally satisfactory nature of these
                        returns the market failed to benefit by them, and Great Eastern sha'O’, in
                        fact, olosed } down after the dividend was announced. Movements generally
                        have been in a downward direotioD, this being attributed to the depression*
                        ruling in other markets.</p>
                    <p> Americana,</p>
                    <p> There has been certain anfco.int of irrega- larity in the movements'rf
                        American railway shares, but on the whole prioes have kept firm at higher
                        levels. New York Central and Unions have been the leading features, -the
                        former dosing abont 4 points higher on the <cb n="4"/>> week, and the latter
                        about 3} better. Chicago- Milwaukee have again been fairly well support¬ed
                        and show an appreciable rise on our last quotations. </p>
                    <p>Egyptians</p>
                    <p> Prioes keep firm in the Egyptian marked, though there is still no baseness
