                    <p>Trains run alongside the steamers on the quay, and passengers can be conveyed
                        to Famagusta, Nicosia, Morphou and intermediate stations. Good hotel
                        accommodation for tourists is provided at Famagusta, at the Savoy Hotel (Mr.
                        Najem Houry proprietor). Olympus Hotel, Mount Troodos, 6000 ft. above the
                        sea. Magnificent Scenery. Perfect climate. Season May to end of October. For
                        information apply to Mr. Najem Houry, Managing Director of Cyprus Hotel Co.,
                        Army Contractor, Limassol, Cyprus. There is a good carriage road from Kopia
                        (on Railway) to Troodos. At Famagusta may be seen the fine old Latin
                        Cathedral (now a mosque) begun in 1300 and finished in 1312, together with
                        other ancient ruins and the Venetian fortifications, the finest in the
                        world. Also the tower or palace, the scene of "Othello'' and of Ford's
                        "Lover's Melancholy.'' The climate of Cyprus in the winter months is
                        delightful and the Island will well repay a visit.</p>

                    <head>THE YEMEN SITUATION</head>
                    <p>The recent report that Medina is threatened by the Wahabi leader, Ibn Saud,
                        is of special interest in view of the dangerous situation of the Turkish
                        Army in the Yemen, where Ahmet Faizi Pasha's situation is described as very
                        dangerous. The Wahabis of Nejd first attained notoriety or fame in the last
                        years of the eighteenth and the first two decades of the nineteenth century,
                        during which they conquered the whole of Arabia, sacked Kerbela Nejefand
                        Meshed Ali in Mesopotamia, and levied tribute on the cities of Damascus and
                        Baghdad. Checked by Mohamed Ali they were finally conquered after groat
                        efforts by Ibrahim Pasha who took Dereyeyah in 1828, and left garrisons in
                        the Nejd. In 1840 however the Egyptian and Turkish garrisons were expelled
                        and the dynasty of the Sauds restored, Feysul the chief of the house ruling
                        Nejd, Muteyr, Hail, Jebel Shammar and the Jowf, with territories in Al Hasa
                        near the Persian gulf. In the early sixties the Sauds found a powerful rival
                        in the Bedouin Emir Mohamed ibn Rashid who after winning independence for
                        Hail and Jebel Shammar finally subjected Itiadh, and for nearly 30 years
                        ruled a large state in central Arabia with a tolerance to which the Wahabis
                        were strangers and with a severity that terrified even the zealots of
                        Riadh.</p>
                    <p>His relations with the Sultan were friendly if distant and it was only when
                        his nephew Abd el Aziz ibn Rashid succeeded him that the Bedouin power began
                        to totter. Early in the nineties, Abd el Aziz son of Feysul of the house of
                        the Sauds rose against the Shammar overlords of Riadh and restored the
                        Wahubi kingdom. The new ruler of Riadh married his sister to the energetic
                        Sheikh of Koweit, Mubarak ibn Sabah and aided by him made frequent raids on
                        Hail. These attacks were at times successful and at times were repulsed, and
                        it was not till 1904 that the Wahabis won a decisive success and captured
                        Hail from the Shammar. But the very completeness of their success brought
                        about the interposition of a new factor in central Arabian politics. Faizi
                        Pasha marched to Hail from Meshed Ali, a Turkish army threatened Koweit and
                        provoked a British naval demonstration and the Wahabis retired. But they
                        retired only 'pour mieux sauter'. Hail was attacked after Faizi Pasha's
                        departure, and Abd el Aziz ibn Rashid died a violent death, in battle
                        according to some accounts, at the hands of conspirators according to
                        others, and was succeeded by his nephew Mutaab who after some fighting made
                        a truce with the Wahabites.</p>
                    <p>But in the early spring of this year Mutaah was murdered by his cousin who
                        demanded Turkish aid against Ibn Saud who attacked him and was apparently
                        repulsed. The Turks however were quite unable to spare men for campaigns in
                        the wildernesses of Central Arabia, the Wahabis gained ground and according
                        to the latest news are threatening Medina.</p>
                    <p>At the same time it must not he imagined that the Wahabis are working for the
                        Imam of the Yemen. The Yemen rebels are Zaidis, of pronounced Shiah
                        tendencies, while the Nejdis are Waluihis i.e. Mohammedan puritans, who are
                        the spiritual descendants of Kharejites and the Carinathiaus. Any
                        cooperation therefore between them can only be purely temporary, for
                        assuming the possibility of the loss by the Sultan of the Holy Places, it is
                        quite inconceivable that the Wahabis would consent for one instant to their
                        occupation by heretics while the Yemenis would certainly make a bold bid for
                        their possession.</p>
                    <p>Here we may refer for a moment to our contemporary the "Egyptian Standard."
                        It is not often that we are agreement with that organ, hut we concur with
                        the writer of an article headed by the title 'The Senoussi Tribe and the
                        Slave Trade" who expresses his surprise at the portentous ignorance of a
                        contributor to "Pearsons Weekly" which published a comic ally inaccurate
                        account of the 'Port of Midi.' the centre of tho slave trade (a port which
                        appears to be quite unknown to map makers and navigators) and of the oases
                        of 'Aziat' and 'Negila.' Aziut may be Lagator Lajiat, a small Tripolitan
                        oasis, while Negila must be Aujilo, an oasis between Tripoli and Jerabub
                        (Jagh- bub) which according to Rolilfs, who went there, is a small trade
                        centre and oasis with perhaps 15,000 inhabitants. The Berliers of Aujila and
                        Jalo are indeed accused of indulging in the purchase and resale of slaves,
                        hut the Senoussi sect, while it very probably docs not forbid the traffic,
                        is by no means identified with it according to the judgment of competent
                        authorities. The Jehad preparations of the Senoussi has often been described
                        hut the fact that, with a single exception, the action between the Senoussi
                        and a French force in Wadai in 1905, no collisions have occurred between
                        them and the European powers represented in N. Africa, makes us a trille
                        sceptical of the veracity of the publicists who delight in "making our flesh
                        creep."</p>

                        <p>About half past five this morning a Syrian woman went bathing near the

                            shrieks were heard. She had apparently been seized by fright, having got
                            out of her depth. A fishing smack was close by but paid no attention to
                            the poor woman's appeals for help, but she was fortunately saved by the
                            coastguard on point duty. At the place where the woman was bathing there
                            is a strong and dangerous current, and the spot is generally avoided by
                            bathers, who are wont to describe it as a death trap.</p>

                        <p>A Greek girl some months ago, of the name of Exarcliopoulo, went from
                            Athens to enter the service of a well-known Greek trader at Cairo. She
                            soon ceased to write home und her parents became very nnxious as to her
                            whereabouts. The mother at length set out from Athens in search of her
                            child und a few days ago arrived at Cairo. Assisted by tho authorities
                            of the Greek Consulate she at last found the child shut up in a house of
                            a notorious character. The unfortunate girl's mother Inis decided to

                    <p>The misfortunes of the Alexandria and Cairo Bourses have begun to attract
                        considerable attention among financial circles in London, and the leading
                        newspapers all comment on the deplorable financial crisis through which the
                        Egyptian stock markets are now passing. Last Thursday the London Stock
                        Exchange experienced a spasm of uneasiness owing to a heavy failure in
                        Paris, arriving partly from difficulties in Egypt Seven London brokers were
                        reported to have been hit in consequence. The weakness of Egyptian Bonds
                        testified to to the demoralisation in Paris, and the general weak tonp all
                        round and the fears of further difficulties in the City created general
                        depression. Our London financial correspon dent's remarks on the situation
                        should be noted in the Money Market letter, which will be fourni on another
                        page of to-day's issue. His opinions are supported by the authoritative
                        organs of public opinion in London and a large amount of attention is drawn
                        to the Egyptian Money Market's dolorous situation. The "Times" remarks :</p>
                    <p>"The condition of affairs in Alexandria will surprise no one who has followed
                        the course of events in connexion with the land and mining (sic) speculation
                        which has been going on there for nearly three years. Owing to the
                        remarkable prosperity of the country the operators for the rise have lmd a
                        longer period of success than prudent and farseeing people thought they
                        would enjoy : but for some time past the banks having relations with Egypt
                        have been preparing for trouble there by reducing the facilities for
                        granting loans on speculative issues as much as possible. During the last
                        few days margins have run of advances granted on a number of securities ; in
                        many cases new cover conld not he provided, and the stock lias been sold. In
                        other cases margins have been kept up lately by pledging Egyptian securities
                        of a character superior to the stocks in which the speculation existed, and
                        the renewed decline of the latter having once more caused margins to
                        disappear, the good stocks have been sold by the hanks, since they were
                        marketable, while the stocks they were brought in to support were not. This
                        is a very usual accompaniment of the breakdown of a speculation. As already
                        men tinned, there appears to have been no actual failure in Alexandria as
                        yet : hut failures are naturally looked for in the conditions now prevailing
                        there."</p>
                    <p>The "Evening Standard ami St. James's Gazette," of Friday last, says :</p>
                    <p>"The disturbance of the Egyptian markets, which is having an indirect
                        influence upon our Stock Market, lmd been long expected. The great
                        prosperity which prevailed in Egypt, thanks to the enlightened rule under
                        British control and the high prices recently ruling for cotton, produced a
                        vast development in the formation of local companies, many of which were
                        based upon speculations in laud and buildings. So far did the speculative
                        enthusiasm go, that local operators bought hack from London much of the
                        capital issued here of companies working in Egypt, and in consequence of
                        this fact the present weakness has little direct interest to this uiaiket.
                        There are, however, a powerful group of British banks working in the country
                        which have done very well, ami might he expected to he iiillueiïçed by the
                        events proceeding in Alexandria. Mere again, however, there is little reason
                        foranxiety, as the British hanks have long recognised the dangerous
                        character of the speculation being carried on, andindeed have been loudly
                        blamed in Egypt lor the manner in which they have refused to advance upon
                        many of the local shares. (banks and financial institutions located in the
                        country were found more com plaisant, hut operators are now discovering that
                        loans contracted on these terms have inconveniences attached to them, and
                        much of the liquidation now proceeding results from the extended credit
                        given by institution in which thought to be from the conservative policy of
                        the British banks.</p>
                    <p>The following comments are from the city article of the "Pall Mall Gazette"
                        of Friday last - "Unpleasant- rumours of failures abroad continue to have
                        their market iulliieuce, and no doubt there will be a certain amount of
                        slnugh taring of weaklings at the t' Vuitinentai bourse centres and
                        elsewhere. In Paris unfortunately there are rumours of graver mishaps, and
                        talk of difficulties involving one of the agents de change is troubling the
                        markets. A "Financial News" correspondent goes even further, and while
                        noting the "hear" attacks and the general liquidation, states that the
                        report was current that two official btokers will have to retire, after
                        being assisted at the Settlement. A big speculator is in trouble, though
                        unfortunately that is the case in other directions also. Thus in Egypt there
                        is much uncertainty and difficulty as a result of the gambling that lias
                        been indulged in by land enthusiasts during the last few years. Reports of a
                        big failure in Alexandria following upon the Cairo troubles, and general
                        concern over the financial position, naturally make for uneasiness.
                        Unfortunately there is a hitch over the big financial relief syndicate that
                        was being formed in Cairo to assist the market position. It is said that the
                        National Bank and several big financiers in Cairo and Alexandria are
                        interested in this syndicate, and the capital will he half a million
                        sterling. The latest information in connection with this important financial
                        movement is that some momentary hitch has occurred, inasmuch as the French
                        hanks have been forbidden to join it, under the lead, so it is rumoured, of
                        the Crédit- Lyonnais.'</p>
                    <p>A very important fact, which is of extreme significance at the present
                        moment, is to be observed in the returns of the Customs Administration for
                        May. From the 1st January to the 31st to the amount of specie exported from
                        Egypt totalled L.E. 3,059,380, as against L.E. 697,909 during the
                        corresponding five months last year. In other words the excess of specie
                        exported compared with the figures for the corresponding period in 1906
                        amounted to L.E. 2,361,421. During the past five months specie to the value
                        of L.E. 2,020,103 was exported to England. During the same months in the
                        previous year the exports of specie from Egypt to England only totalled L.E,
                        458,387. Thus from the beginning of this year to the end ot last month
                        England has taken specie to the value of L.E. 1,561,716 over and above the
                        total taken during the same period in 1906. France's surplus imports of

                    <p>EGYPTIAN PARTIES</p>
                    <p>(From "Al Watan")</p>
                    <p>For the want of a better name those Egyptians who are against the British
                        occupation are known by the name of Nationalists. The name is generally
                        accepted now although it does not convey the real meaning of the
                        anti-British party to those who are. not acquainted with the facts. For tho
                        want of a better name also those who are not against modern reform and are
                        vehemently vociferous in their denunciation of the present regime are known
                        by the name of Liberals. This is likely to he generally accepted also after
                        some time.</p>
                    <p>The Nationalist party includes the majority of Mohammedans mostly of the
                        illiterate type. Its leaders are in almost every case journalists,
                        solicitors, and discharged employés of the Government. Among its supporters
                        the religious feature predominates with a smattering of young men educated
                        in Europe. The main principle of this party is hatred of England and
                        foreigners in general, hut the leaders have no definite aim in view. Most of
                        them seem to think that if foreign rule could be shaken the future
                        Government of Egypt will he their own monopoly and their gain will be
                        immense.</p>
                    <p>The liberal party counts among its supporters the enlightened minority of the
                        Mobnmuiedntis, the whole of the Coptic nation with hardly an exception, the
                        residents of foreign descent, und generally every sane Egyptian who has no
                        interest in agitating against the Government of the day, The main principle
                        of this party is the support of the present regime in its policy of reform
                        ami justice, and the pacification of minds which have been fanned to
                        fanaticism by the Nationalist Press. Seeing that their opponents have
                        brought about a financial crisis and will one day bring about a more serious
                        trouble by the seditious agitation which has lasted so long, the Liberals
                        have of late carried the cam paign into the enemy's land and disclosed tho
                        hypocrisy ami misdeeds of their opponents, by a series of articles ami
                        letters in the local Press which has almost silenced those who were not
                        sparing in the use of their vocal chords before this date. We believe that
                        this vigorous attack has gained its purpose and proved to tho world that the
                        shrieking Nationalists of Egypt are not the only party in the country that
                        ought to heard. Thanks to Mohamed Bey Wahid and his friends who initiated
                        the last move the Liberal party has gained much in courage and numbers
                        during the last month.</p>

                        72, 73, and 1905, page 86, that private primary schools in Egypt copy the
                        Europeanised curriculum of the Government schools, to the prejudice of
                        vernacular education, and whereas it is only by such imitation that private
                        schools can secure for their pupils certificates enabling them to compete
                        for Gov eminent and other employment, be will advise the Egyptian Government
                        to substitute for its present school curriculum a system of teaching and
                        certificates which shall meet the needs at once of the Government service

                    <p>Sir E. Grey. —The Egyptian Government are fully alive to the educational
                        needs of the country, and are making every effort to meet them. I consider
                        that no useful purpose would be served by the interference of H.M.

                        to Egypt is only 2d.; what was the number of letters registered in Egypt for
                        transmission to the United Kingdom during the year 1906; is the extra charge
                        retained by the Egyptian Postal Administration, or is it divided, and in

                        Egypt to the United Kingdom are transmitted; and whether seeing that the
                        net, revenue of the Postal Department, for the year 1906 is approximately
                        £E.240,000, an increase of £.E.34,000 over the previous year, and is
                        estimated at £E.260,000 for 1907, he will advise the Egyptian Government to

                    <p>Sir E. Grey.—I will enquire as to the facts. Reductions of postage are always
                        welcome, but I cannot promise to ask the Egyptian Government to make a

                        of the Mysore Reefs (1905) and Explorers (Limited), held at the offices, 6,
                        Queen-street place, E.C., said that when they looked back to the
                        commencement of the last year they would see that at that time everything
                        looked rose coloured. At that time the Um Rus Mine was making regular
                        returns of gold and seemed in a fair way to soon become a dividend paying
                        concern Later returns had not been so favourable, with the result,
                        unfortunately, that mining operations had been stopped, the board coming to
                        the decision that they would not be justified in continuing to spend the
                        money of the shareholders with little chance of success. Even at the present
                        time there was a large and unit of ore still left in the mine, which was of
                        the value of about lldwt. to the ton, but it unfortunately would not pay to
                        extract it of course, the closing of that mine was a very serious thing to
                        this company, which had such a large interest in it. There had during the
                        past year been several other promising properties brought to the notice of
                        the board, but they needed a large immediate payment, and that was not the
                        view of the directors of this company. The most satisfactory one which had
                        been received was from the Mercantile and General Syndicate (Limited), with
                        reference to a tin concession which the company opened in the Malay
                        Peninsula. Tho prospects there were very favourable, for the deposits were
                        of an encouraging nature, and only a small amount of capital was, he said,
                        needful, mid eventually a company could be formed to provide the funds
                        necessary for the conduct of the operations on a large scale. He moved the

                        proceeded to terrorise the neighbourhood by molesting and insulting
                        pedestrians. Finding their way eventually into Atfet el Soukaria street,
                        Francesco Bertone, one of the hand, without any provocation, savagely
                        attacked a Berberin named Chehata Fallas Ha bashi, inflicting a deep wound
                        in the left side with a knife. Thereupon the villians tried to make good

                    <p>Nous allions oublier de dire que, d'ordre du Comite, la duree des seances a
                        ete fixee a une heure, au lieu d'une demie. Toutes les opera- rations
                        pratiquees sont de nouveau enregis- trdes. Les teneurs de carnet ont ete

                    <p>Toutes ces decisions sont diversement com­mentees. Reconnaissons qu'elles
                        n'.emeuvent profondement personne, par suite de leur ca- ractfcre febrile.
                        L'opinion prevaut, d'ailleurs, que le Comite prend decidement trop de
                        mesures hatives. Le calme et la circonspection ne sauraient nuire a aucun
                        interet, pas meme a ceux de la respectable Corporation. Il faudrait autant
                        que possible s'attacher a ne pas res- treindro la liberty des transactions,
                        a ne pas tomber dans l'arbitraire et laisser les choses suivre leur cours
                        naturel, d'autantplus que le fond de baisse est presque attaint et qn'en

                    <p>Nous detachons d'une correspondance de Londres, en date du 9 Juin, le passage
                        suivant :</p>
                    <p>" La situation du marche monetaire n est pas satisfnisante. On remarque trop
                        d'exporta- tions d'or, et l'argent au lendemain est cher et difficile. Les
                        Banques " ramassent '',a Paris surtout, par suite de la toumure inquietante
                        que prennent de Russie.</p>
                    <p>" Au Stock Exchange, les transactions sont presque nulles en presence de la

                    <dateline>London, June 14</dateline>
                    <p>The money market</p>
                    <p>Stock Exchange Pay-Day requirements caused a fairly strong demand for money,
                        but there was no difficulty in obtaining all the accomodation that was
                        required. The general rate for day-to-day money was 3 ½ per cent was
                        obtained by bankers. The rate for three months' bills was firm at 3,
                        11/16</p>
                    <p>The weakness of the Paris exchange is a prominent feature in the present
                        situation, and it is feared that this will have the effect of attracting
                        still more gold from New York. The Bank of England is, however, in a very
                        strong position, and the outlook gives cause for an optomistic view of
                        things. The return this week shows an increase of 437,000 pounds in the
                        reserve, which now stands at not less than 24,618,000 pounds while, the
                        proportion to liabilities is up to 47 percent. "Other" deposits have
                        increased by nearly one million and Other Securities are 440,000 pounds
                        up.</p>
                    <p>The quotation for bar gold is somewhat easier, being now 779 ¾ </p>
                    <p>Silver</p>
                    <p>The silver market is quiet, and the price, 30, 13/16 is unchanged on the
                        week.</p>
                    <p>The Stock Markets</p>
                    <p>It would be idle to minimise the effect of the financial trouble in Egypt
                        upon the stock markets here, for this has been felt more or less in most
                        sections. On the other hand, it is equally futile to regardthis unsettles
                        state of affairs as anything more than a passing phase, and in the informed
                        circles this is the view which finds most favour. The present upset has
                        caused no surprise, for it was recognised that the wild spectulation which
                        had been going on during last winter would be inevitably followed by a
                        reaction, and those who are suffering the most are these rash speculators to
                        whon we refer. That they country will come through the crisis, and be better
                        for it, there can be no manner of doubt, for the real basis of Egypt's
                        prosperity is, and can be, in no way affected by these disturbances. On the
                        other hand, the weeding out of the unsatisfactory features is a matter of
                        much satisfaction. No better evidence of the confidence in Egyptian
                        securities which is entertained by the best financial houses here could be
                        desired than the fact that they are now buying up these at the present low
                        prices as lock-up investments, and no one whose opinion is worth considering
                        entertains any manner of doubt that their far-seeing policy will be amply
                        rewarded. </p>
                    <p>As is usual when there is little business forthcoming, the rumours of
                        failures in Egypt yesterday were much exaggerated, and prices slumped
                        heavily in consequence, but a more confident tone has since been
                        established, and an early recovery is now expected.</p>
                    <p>Consols. </p>
                    <p>The gilt-edged market was much harder early in the week, and Consols
                        recovered some of their previos heavy loss. Yesterday they touched 84 1/8
                        for the account, but eased off in the afternoon, and closed at 84. They
                        leave off tonight at 83 7/8 showing a further decline of 1/8. Last Friday we
                        quoted them 83 ¾. </p>
                    <p>Foreign Bonds.</p>
                    <p>A disturbing influence in this section has been the race trouble between
                        Japan and America in California, and this has had the effect of putting
                        Japanese issues down. The reports of the complications have been much
                        exaggerated in both be American and Japan, ese sensational press, and it is
                        satisfactory to note from a cable this morning that the authorities' at
                        Tokio have issued a warning to editors there that warlike articles on the
                        situation, such as have been given much prominence during the last week or
                        two, are forbidden. This is a wise step to take, as the evil results of
                        thèse inflnmatory statements cannot be overestimated.</p>
                    <p>Japanese stocks were rather firmer yesterday. although at the close the 5 per
                        cent. 1895-6 showed a loss 1/8 at 101, and both series of 4 ½ per cents. 1/8
                        at 94 7/8 and 93 7/8.</p>
                    <p>To-day Japanese have received support, and most of the stocks leave of with

                    <p>Russians were bouyant at the beginning of the week, but have since shown a

                        3/4.</p>
                    <p>Homo Ralls.</p>
                    <p>It is announced that the directors of the various metropolitan railways have
                        come to an agreement regarding the raising of fares which it is expected
                        will shortly he put into effect. The decision has not caused any surprise,
                        as it had been evident for a long time past that, with the increasing
                        competition of County Council trainways and motor buses, a revision of fares
                        was absolutely necessary if the railways were to be run as paying
                        concerns.</p>
                    <p>On the face of it, it would seem that the companies by this latest move are
                        playing still further into the hands of the motor bus companies, but there
                        is good reason for supposing that, in the near future, the latter will also
                        be compelled to increase their charges to the public, in consequence of the
                        heavy losses they have suffered in substituting the more expensive
                        petrol-driven Inis for the old horse-bus.</p>
                    <p>The above announcement gave a firm tone to the market, and the shares of the
                        Metropolitan and Central London had a sharp advance, the former gaining 4£
                        and "Tubes". Other shares moved up in sympathy.</p>
                    <p>Yesterday the market was easier and although Central London managed to
                        sustain a further advance of A at 74, Districts gave way A to H i after
                        being 12. and Metropolitans to 42.</p>
                    <p>Southern Deferred stocks were weak at declines of it. To-day home rails
                        display a het-tei tendency, but prices have moved irregularly.</p>
                    <p>Americans.</p>
                    <p>The flatness of the market in New York has kept movements in American shares
                        here within narrow limits, and the tone has for the most part been
                        irregular. Yesterday in Wall Street was the quietest session experienced for
                        two years, no more than 189,000 shares changing hands. Our market started
                        well above parity, hut fell away in the afternoon. At the close, however, a
                        few advances were marked, notably 2 in Chesapeake and Ohio and Illinois
                        Central, and 3/8 in Southern Pacific and Ait- chi.snn. Southern Railway
                        Preference were marked down 2, but in the main the declines were
                        fractional.</p>
                    <p>The movements to-day have generally been adverse. Unions are 1 lower hut
                        Southern Preference have gained 2.</p>
                    <p>Egyptians</p>
                    <p>We have had a very wild and fluctuating market in Egyptians during the past
                        week, and prices yesterday were very flat on rumours if failures in Cairn
                        and Alexandria. To-day, however, there has been a substantial recovery all
                        round.</p>
                    <p>National Bank suffered most yesterday and fell rapidly to 19, which is the
                        lowest point touched for a very long time. To-day they closent 20.
                        Agricultural Bank were also flat, and went down to they recovered to 7, 9/16
                        bid. They are now 7 J, and the Preference 9.L Daira Sanieli are quoted
                        13-14, and the Deferred 65-75 nominal.</p>

                        respect lively.</p>
                    <p>The fall in value of the really good shares -such as National Bank,
                        Agricultural Bank, and Delta Preference, is attracting the attention of
                        investors, and there is steady buying going on by all the best brokers,
                        whose clients are locking away these shares. As soon as the forced
                        liquidation ceases, a very sharp rebound all-round is anticipated.</p>
                    <p>Mining.</p>
                    <p>The mining market has fairly successfully resisted the influence of the
                        depression jn other sections, although yesterday there was some falling away
                        in prices. Business has of course lieen on a small scale throughout, one
                        reason for this being the feeling of uncertainty regarding the future policy
                        of the Transvasl Government on the labour question, which is to be announced
                        by General Botha to-day. The general opinionm however is that the patriation
                        of the Chinese will be commenced at the earliest possible date.</p>
                    <p>There has not been much business done in Kaffirs today. Rand mines clase at 5
                        ¾, also of 1/32, but East Rands are 1/8 better at 4 1/8.</p>
                    <p>There is nothing new to report with regard to Egyptian mining shares, which
                        are still ignored by the public. Nile Valley are unchanged on the week, at
                        1-s but Egyptian Mines Exploration are a little better at 2.</p>

                    <head>REPORT ON THE CONGO</head>
                    <p>KING LEOPOLD'S REGIME</p>
                    <p>BRUSSELS, Saturday.</p>
                    <p>Telegraphing under date of the 8th inst. the Brussels correspondent of the
                        "Daily Telegraph" says – </p>
                    <p>The Congo Free Staff published yesterday an extensive report dealing with the
                        entire situation of its affairs. This document, which is somewhat bulky, as
                        it covers some 300 pages of the "Bulletin Official" of the State, is meant
                        to he an answer to the desire expressed by the Belgian Parliamentary
                        Committee now inquiring into the conditions of the annexation ol the Congo,
                        for some reliable information concerning the State. The report is addressed
                        by the three general secretaries of the Congo administration to the
                        King-Sovereign, and is in tone and in wording nothing but a respectful
                        eulogy of the Leopoldian régime. I cannot undertake to analyse it
                        completely, all the more as it includes much that, is not new. I will only
                        dwell here on the pointa which may have some (tearing on the future
                        political issues of the Congo question.</p>
                    <p>First of all, the report sets out os a principle that, the King is the
                        creator of the Congo State, and that he has the right to dispose of his
                        creation as he chooses. Further, dealing with the "Domaine de la Couronne,"
                        that immense area of land which the King wants to exempt from any control
                        for his personal interest, the report says that it is a lawful intitution,
                        and that his Majesty is entitled to dispose of its revenues as a recognition
                        of bis personal sacrifices of past years. This contention is not new, but
                        although it is once more expounded with much adroitness, it. will never lie
                        adopted by the Belgian Parliament</p>
                    <p>With regard to the general politics of the State, and more especially to its
                        financial policy, the report entirely npproves what has lieen dona The
                        finanças of the State are most satisfactory, the labour tax gives good
                        results, the Congo State has been worthy of its task, and so forth. But this
                        report would, as a whole, lie rather uninteresting if its writers and its
                        inspirera had not in the last pnrt of the document adopted an aggressive
                        attitude and a polemical tone entirely inconsistent with the object of the
                        report.. The document was meant originally to give some information to a
                        Parliamentary Committee. The report now- before us is partly an obscure and
                        unconvinc ing panegyrie of Congo rule, partly a fierce uttack, written in a
                        language and tone which might he expected from a third class newspaper
                        directed against all those who have hitherto failed to find that the Congo
                        was an earthly Paradise. The recent report of his Britannic Majesty's
                        consuls in the Congo are also assailed, and some extracts from these
                        documents are published with comments intended to mislead those for whom the
                        report is written as regards the motives of the British consuls.</p>
                    <p>In fact, this "official" report may be termed a desperate attempt by its
                        authors to convey a favourable idea of the Congo. It is, as the French say,
                        "de la poudre aux yeux." The report finally gives some interesting
                        information as to the mining possibilities of the Congo, where great
                        petroleum deposits and extensive tin and copper mines have been
                        discovered.</p>
                    <p>Brussels, Sunday Night.</p>
                    <p>The report published on Friday by the Congo administration has met with an
                        unsympathetic reception from the Belgian Press except the papers inspired or
                        subsidised by the Free State. This morning the "Gazette" gives pro minence
                        to a communication from Professor Cattier, a well-known authority on
                        Colonial matters, wherein he gives a list, a lengthy one indeed, of the
                        shortcomings and "forgotten things" of the report. Three items in the
                        Congolese problem, he says, are essential for the Belgian Parliament to
                        consider, viz., the financial situation of the State, the question of native
                        taxation, and that of the "Crown Domaine." The report is utterly devoid of
                        any information on these vital matters.</p>
                    <p>The "Dernière Heure" says that the repon uses 260 pages to say nothing at
                        all, and that it is merely flinging dust into the eyes of the public to
                        prevent them from seeing anything. Even the sane Conservative newspapers
                        express the same view.</p>
                    <p>In my own opinion this "whitewashing" report will not. do much to hasten the
                        solution of the annexation problem. The Parliamentary Committee cannot, be
                        expected to proceed with their labours with such little information as is
                        handed to them. New questions will and must be asked, and the Congo State
                        will have to answer them. Belgium is "willing to annex the State, and
                        intends to escape none of her duties, but she cannot be expected to take
                        over with the Congo a financial burden of the extent of which she is
                        absolutely ignorant.</p>
