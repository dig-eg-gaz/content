                    <p>Berths can be definitely engaged beforehand. Plans can be seen at the Offices
                        of the Company's Agents.</p>
                    <p>The through Steamers for Marseilles, Gibraltar, Plymouth and London are
                        Intended to leave Port Said after the arrival of the 11 a.m. train from
                        Cairo, every Monday. A steam tender will meet the train to convey passengers
                        to the ship.</p>
                    <p>The Brindisi Express Steamer leaves Port Said directly the Indian Mails
                        arrive. Passengers can go on board the evening before.</p>
                    <p>The express steamer usually reaches Brindisi on Wednesday afternoon, the
                        special train starting at 8 p.m. and arriving in London at the very
                        convenient hour of 4.56 p.m. on Friday.</p>
                    <p>The combined Sea and special train fare is £22.9.11 Port Said to London via
                        Brindisi or via Marseilles.</p>
                    <p>Passengers having paid fall fare in one direction are allowed an abatement of
                        25 per cent, on returning within 12 months.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the above regular weekly service there are sailings about
                        twice a fortnight of 5,000 to 7,000 tons steamers to London, calling at
                        Malta or Marseilles.</p>
                    <p>TO THE EAST.</p>
                    <p>The Mail Steamers leave Suez for Aden and Bombay every Wednesday, and for
                        Australia and China every alternate Wednesday. A steamer leaves for
                        Calcutta, fortnightly, and another for Japan. Passengers can embark at Port
                        Said.</p>

                    <p>A Berberea groom employed in a stable at Bab Sidra Barrani was found dead on
                        the 19th inst and as the circumstances appeared suspicious his body was
                        removed to hospital and the stable and its neighbourhood were disinfected.
                        Today the bacteriological examination proved that it was a case of
                        plague.</p>
                    <p>In consequence of this fresh case, the usual prophylactic measures on the
                        departure of vessels from Egyptian ports have been put in force again.</p>
                    <p>In connection with this case of plague, we have received a complaint that,
                        while the Sanitary Department of the Municipality have whitewashed the base
                        in the district where the case occurred, and taken other similar
                        precautions, they still allow the accumulation of dirt and refuse, injurious
                        to the health, on the open space in front of the stable. We beg to draw the
                        attention of the authorities to this complaint, and trust that the nuisance
                        complained of will be promptly remedied.</p>

                        (Limited) for the year ended December 31 states that crushing was commenced
                        on the Um Ros Mine on March 6, 1905, and the following is a statement of the
                        results since then :- Tons, 6,161. Ounces bar gold 4.295, value realized,
                        £14,721; tons falings stored, 4,895 ; assay value tailings, 3.30 dwt. , and
                        total average yield 17.21 dwt. The properties, now being developed by the
                        subsidiary companies are as follow - Atallah, worked by the Central Egypt
                        Exploration Company (Limited); Semna, worked by the Fatira (Egypt) Exploring
                        Company (Limited), and Eridia, worked by the Eridia (Egypt) Exploring
                        Company (Limited); and the prospects are most satisfactory. Mr. Alford is
                        strongly of opinion that the development on these properties now justify the
                        formation of a company with a working capital of £150,000. He estimates this
                        will be sufficient to build a railway to connect them with Keneh and to
                        erect the milling plant and fully equip the mine. The directors are engaged
                        in negotiations for carrying out these recommendations, and 14 acres of land
                        close to the town of Kereh have been purchased for a mill site.</p>

                        ball on the Admiral's flagship Habsburg and the S. George on the 5th April.
                        There will be 1,300 guests. This morning Rear Admiral Jedios paid an
                        official visit to Mahmoud Pacha Sidky, Governor of Alexandria and Rear
                        Admiral Sir Massie Boomfield.</p>
                    <p>The Austro Hungarian Diplomatic Agent and Consul General has arrived at
                        Alexandria from Cairo to visit the Admiral. A number of officers of the
                        squadron went to Cairo to-day for a visit.</p>
                    <p>The squadron contains some of the best vessels in the small but efficient
                        navy of the Emperor Francis Joseph. The Habsburg, Arpad, and Babenburg are
                        extremely handy little ironclades, displacing some 8,400 tons. Their
                        designed horse-power was 18.5 knots, which all exceeded averaging 19.6 knots
                        on their trials. Their protection, if not equal to that of the largest
                        British and French battleships, is efficient, the belt being 8 ¾ inches
                        thick, while the turrets are protected by 9 ¼ inch armour. The armament
                        comprises three 9.4 inch and twelve 6-inch guns, with ten twelve-pounders
                        and ten machine guns. The St. Georg is a new armoured cruiser with a speed
                        of 21 knots and a displacement of 7,400 tons. In her case, coal capacity,
                        which is of slight importance to Austrian vessels whose radius of action
                        must be limited in case of war to the Adriatic and the Levant, has been
                        sacrificed to protection and gun power. She carries two 9.4 inch, five 7.5
                        inch, and four 6-inch guns, with seventeen smaller pieces and two submerged
                        torpedo tubes and is for her size one of the best armed warships afloat.

                        EXTRACTS. </head>
                    <p>We give a few extracts from the Judicial Adviser's Report, dealing with the
                        establishment of Courts for the trial of juvenile offenders: </p>
                    <p> Sending Children to Prison: </p>
                    <p>For some considerable time past it has been becoming more and more evident to
                        the authorities that far too many young children are sent to prison in
                        Egypt. Not that Egypt presents a peculiar spectacle in this respect, for the
                        same the phenomenon is unhappily observable in most countries, and is
                        everywhere proving a force of anxiety to legislators and prison reformers.
                        And it obviously is a matter of the first importance. One of the principal
                        aims of modern two penologists is, as far as possible, to cut off the
                        sources of criminality at its toes, and it is clear that children who have
                        once been contaminated by the baneful associations of a gaol are little
                        likely ever to become respectable members of society but are, on the
                        contrary after such experiences, more or less inevitably destined to swell
                        the ranks of the criminal classes.</p>
                    <p> Revision of the Penal Code. </p>
                    <p>As far as this country is concerned, it must be admitted that this
                        unsatisfactory state of things was largely due to the defective condition of
                        the law, before the revision of the Penal Code. The old article 58 drew a
                        highly theoretical and highly artificial distinction between the case where
                        the child was supposed to have acted "with discernment" and those where he
                        had not. In the former case the judge was bound to convict and to sentence
                        the offender to fine or imprisonment. He had no power to send him to a
                        reformatory. That course was only open to him if he found that the child had
                        acted <hi rend="italic">without</hi> discernment, in which case he had to
                        acquit, but might, nevertheless, if he thought proper, send the boy to a
                        reformatory. Of course, in practice, the proof of discernment or its absence
                        was always difficult, and some judges habitually took one view and some
                        another, which led to very unsatisfactory results. The new law, therefore,
                        swept away the whole of this on cumbrus and factitious doctrine and gave the
                        judge a very wide discretions to the penalties he could inflict, if he found
                        the young offender guilty of the act with which he was charged.</p>
                    <p>In cases of crime or misdemeanour he can either :</p>
                    <p>(1) Sentence to imprisonment or to fine when permitted ;</p>
                    <p>(2) Hand the child over to his parents or guardian on certain terms ;</p>
                    <p>(3) Order him to be whipped (this in the case of boys only) ;</p>
                    <p>(4) Send him to a reformatory for from two to five years ;</p>
                    <p>(5) Order him to be whipped and then sent to a reformatory. </p>
                    <p> Children's Courts In Egypt. </p>
                    <p>Having thus effected a considerable improvement in the law, the next thing
                        was to endeavour to provide some special machinery the for its effective
                        application, and it appeared to me that this might very possibly be
                        successfully accomplished by essaying here the system of Children's Courts,
                        or Courts reserved special for juvenile offenses and presided over by a
                        special judge, which has given such excellent results in other countries. As
                        is well known, the system is in force in America, in Australia and other of
                        our colonies, in Scotland and in certain parts of England and Ireland, e.g.,
                        Birmingham, Bradford, Dublin and Cork. It was accordingly decided to try the
                        experiment of such a Court in Cairo, inasmuch as there did not appear to be
                        any prima-facie reasons for supposing that it was, in any way, unsuited to
                        an oriental country, and the system was subsequently extended to
                        Alexandria.</p>
                    <p> What the Cairo Judge says. </p>
                    <p>Young Egyptians, at any rate in Cairo, manifest but little real tendency to
                        crime. In the majority of the cases brought before me. there was no ground
                        for the belief that the instinct of these offenders towards criminal
                        misconduct was such as to justify a heavy and severe punishment in order to
                        correct them. On the contrary, I found that in most cases, by reproving them
                        severely and pointing out to them the inevitable consequences of the course
                        they were pursuing, they were greatly moved. I am glad to be able to say
                        that the method in which I followed in explaining to them that whereas I was
                        indulgent to them for the first time, they need expect nothing but pitiless
                        severity if they transgressed again, has had the effect of preventing almost
                        all those who have come before me from committing further offences.</p>
                    <p>Obviously the parents of juvenile offenders are often responsible. I always
                        took the opportunity of the presence in Court of the young offender's father
                        or guardian to give him sound advice as to watching over the conduct of his
                        child--and this not only in times where I decided to hand over the offender
                        to his parents, but even where in view of the<!-- missing footnote --><cb
                            n="5"/> comparative gravity of the offense, I ordered him to be
                        whipped.</p>
                    <p>In working at this Children's Court, I have not confined myself solely to the
                        decision of the cases put before me. I have endeavoured to influence the
                        action of those who are responsible for dealing with cases in which juvenile
                        offenders are concerned.</p>
                    <p>I am, however, far from saying that cases of juvenile offenders in Cairo are
                        now dealt with in an entirely satisfactory manner. There is still much room
                        for improvement. Such cases should be far less numerous than they are at
                        present, and many of those who are now brought up as accused persons before
                        me should never have been committed for trial at all. I still notice that
                        cases are submitted to the Court which are of a very trifling nature and
                        ought therefore to have been filed. ln others it is adult persons who are
                        principally concerned ; the juveniles being merely implicated through filial
                        affection or similar motives and should not have been put upon their trial.
                        For instance, two families quarrel with one other. The son or daughter,
                        seeing their father or mother being assaulted, attacks the other party or
                        insults him. The son or daughter is considered by the police to have taken
                        part in the quarrel, and is consequently prosecuted. The case comes up to
                        the Juvenile Offenders Court and one observes that all the accused are
                        grown-up men or women, with a young boy or girl, tried with them, because
                        they have attacked or affronted the assailant of their parent. Before
                        concluding, I desire to call attention to three points:</p>
                    <p>First, the necessity of enlarging the Reformatory and increasing its
                        accommodation. From time to time I receive an intimation from the proper
                        authorities that no more boys are to be sent to the Reformatory, owing to
                        its being quite full and there being no vacancies. In some cases, however, a
                        reformatory sentence would, having regard to the offence committed be the
                        only suitable penalty. Cases have also come before me in which young girls
                        were accused, where the facts of the case and the position of the offenders'
                        parents were such to render a Reformatory sentence by far the most suitable
                        of all those which might be inflicted. But the fact that there is no place
                        for girls in the Reformatory has prevented the pursing of such a ganter, and
                        other penalties had to be inflicted. The power of the judge not being so
                        wide in the case of girls as in the case of boys, it is desirable to take
                        steps, as soon as possible for the addition to the Reformatory be of a
                        section for girls.</p>
                    <p>Secondly, the institution of industrial schools to which children could be
                        handed over, if an guilty of light offence, whether misdemeanours or
                        contraventions (such as, for example, cases of mendicity and contraventions
                        against the regulations as to the various trades). In many cases, the
                        position of the offendere renders it necessary, if they are to be reformed,
                        that they should not be a burden to their parents nor be left to wander
                        about the streets, homeless and neglected.</p>
                    <p>Thirdly, the desirability of organizing some authority to which parents may
                        apply for the correction of their children. The feeling of satisfaction with
                        which the people hailed the institution of the special Juvenile Offenders
                        Court, as an indication that the Government was interested in the welfare of
                        the young, and their readiness to have recourse to it whenever their
                        children gave them cause for complaint, has been extremely remarkable. All
                        classes of the population regret the failure of the Native Codes to sanction
                        paternal rights and power, as in French law (articles 376 &amp; 377 of the
                        Civil Code), which enables the father to have his unruly child incarcerated
                        for a month or six months, according to circumstances. Personally, I am
                        strongly in favour of granting such powers to Mohammedan parents, many
                        children being nowadays so undisciplined as to be practically incorrigible
                        by any other means. Of course the place of confinement should be a special
                        establishment.</p>
                    <p> The Judicial Advisor's Comments. </p>
                    <p>I fully agree with the remarks of Sarwat Bey as to the want of judgement
                        displayed by certain officials in the taking up of petty cases. Such matters
                        as some of those to which he has called my attention, where young schoolboys
                        are prosecuted for accidentally hurting a comrade at play, or for breaking a
                        window with a ball, are obviously of too innocent a character to be brought
                        before a Police Court.</p>
                    <p>But the fact is that it is not only in the case of juveniles that we are
                        suffering from an excess of zeal on the part of some officials. The same
                        want of judgment is noticeable in the case of petty assault(coups) and
                        insults (injures) of which a vast number are of so trivial a character, if
                        genuine at all, that the Police should decline to prosecute and leave the
                        complainant to do so himself, if he thinks fit. This has, I know, long been
                        the opinion of the Adviser to the Ministry of the Interior and is a matter
                        to which he has repeatedly called attention. And as these views are also
                        shared by the Procureur General, I hope that before long a solution, or at
                        any rate palliative may be found.</p>

                    <p>Baroness Rucker Jenisch left Cairo yesterday morning to join her husband at
                        Berlin. Many friends of the Baroness, among them all the chief members of
                        the German colony, were present at the station to say farewell to the wife
                        of the German Diplomatic Agent at Darmstadt, who, like her husband, leaves
                        none but the pleasantest souvenirs.</p>
                    <p>Count Bernstorff, who has been appointed to the German Embassy in Egypt, will
                        be succeeded in London by Herr Wilhelm von Stumm, who comes from the Madrid
                        Embassy. He belongs, the Berlin correspondent of the Glasgow Herald says, to
                        the great industrial family of that name, of which the head was Baron Karl
                        von Stumm-Halberg, the notable German ironmaster and pillar of the
                        Conservative Party in the Reichstag. A. Baron von Stumm left only a
                        daughter, the elder line died out, and the new secretary of the London
                        Embassy is now the head of the family. It is only five years since the great
                        firm Stumm celebrated its 200th year of existence. In March. 1701, "Stumm
                        the Smith," as the chronicles fame him, founded the firm which now enjoys a
                        world wide reputation.</p>

                    <p>when he won the Devonshire Plate riding Mr. J. D. Whyte's Fairyland. He was
                        also the winner of the Weller Cup at the Down Royal Meeting in 1883, and in
                        1897 achieved success with Galtee More, winning the Two Thousand Guineas and
                        the Derby and the St. Leger. In 1902 he won the Darby with Ard Patrick.</p>

                            Chamberlain moved that a Royal Commission should be appointed to
                            investigate the labour question in the Transvaal. Mr. Winston Churchill
                            said that the appointment said that the appointment of a Commission was
                            both unnecessary and futile and whatever its decision might be, one side
                            would remain unconvinced. The motion was rejected by 378 to 110.

                    <head>SUDAN SPECULATION.</head>
                    <p>THE "GREEDY FOREIGNER".</p>
                    <p>A correspondent writes as follows to the "Sudan Times". -</p>
                    <p>A sense of distrust of the foreign merchant seems to permeate the atmosphere
                        of the Government circles. To most Government officials merchant and
                        speculator are synonymous and little sympathy is felt for either. The
                        interests of the merchant class and the natives are supposed to be
                        diametrically oppossed. In its eagerness to win popularity among the
                        Sudanese the Government spares no effort to secure what is believed to be
                        protecting them from the greedy foreigner.</p>
                    <p>The merchant makes money in the dura trade. At once measures are suggested
                        for putting and end to "speculation" and "cornering". He buys land and the
                        cry is raised that he is robbing the natives of their inheritance and that
                        such trespasses should be vetoed in the interests of the natives and the
                        country generally. He offers to lend money at interested and he is dubbed
                        "naurer" In fact one hears nothing else but talk of naury, speculation, and
                        all the other time worn terms which signify nothing but lack of insight into
                        the natural course of things.</p>
                    <p>It is amusing to read the crude suggestions made by some officials to stern
                        the tide of these evils and keep the Sudan spotless.</p>
                    <p>As a merchant my words may not carry much weight, but time and time alone
                        will show the fallacy of the truth of my intentions. This is that so long as
                        the Sudan Government does not provide ample room for private enterprise and
                        does not renounce the antiquated system of interference with all things, the
                        progress of the Sudan, will be very slow indeed. Many of those who visited
                        the country this winter with a view to extending their operations into it
                        went away with a different conviciton.</p>

                    <p>"JUSTICE IS THE FOUNDATION OF EMPIRES."</p>
                    <p>The following is the text of a "reclamation" (as it is termed), which has
                        been sent to the chiefs of the State Railways by the Traffic pupile of the

                    <p>Sir:= It is said that as the chief is greater the justice and mercy, the
                        greater is the rest of his employees and as long as compassion and right are
                        his conduct, they may ask for their due of which they have been deprived and
                        neither small or large crime they won, nor any guilt they have
                        committed.</p>
                    <p>We are aware, you are a good experienced man who knows well the miserable
                        condition of the Railway Employees specially those of the Line Department.
                        They deak great trouble in their works either at day-time or during night
                        whether at winter in the very coldest places or in the deserted stations
                        where there cannot be found the necessary livelihood affairs moreover they
                        work barely without any season leave. Should the Adm. authorize the one of
                        them any annual leave, it does not increase 7 days, and bondest to this
                        greatest hardheartedness and the ill treatment of the case of oppression,
                        the paucity of salaries is added.</p>
                    <p>This wretched and lamentable case, to which we are all crying and grieving
                        too much, obliged many of the employees to resign, to live freely in draught
                        and famine than to serve as they are the batter enemies of the Adm. and not
                        its faithful employees who serve it literally and sincerely.</p>
                    <p>Do you think that such statement of the Traffic Pupils (specially) satisfy
                        any? We think you are very sorry for such condition, the hardest heart of
                        which justice, the care, and the blind eyes weep bitterly.</p>
                    <p>What do you mean by serving hardly by a daily payment of 15 P.T., the earning
                        of shoe-blackmen or a low servant at day and remain hors cadre a period not
                        less that 5 years. What is the use of our useless certificates that we have
                        lost their meaning in our loved Adm. for it's irregular treatment which is
                        inconsistent with Financial Code and Governmental Decrees.</p>
                    <p>Did not all resignations attract your attention to know why they have taken
                        place or did not this loud cry strike your kind ears to rectify our bad case
                        to another of which you will be met by the heartly thanks of all oppressed

                    <p>The decline in the American exchange and the weakness in the French rate
                        mentioned in this column last week have had the effet looked for, and weekly
                        loans now command 3, whilst discount rates have hardened to 3 for three
                        months' bills. Gold having been shipped from San Francisco to Tokin, and
                        some purchases of the precious metal having been made here on American
                        account, caused some uneasiness and attracted more attention than the
                        circumstances warranted. The exchange not having receded to a figure which
                        could make the shipment of the gold in question a profitable transaction
                        from an arbitrage point of view, it was no doubt undertaken in the interest
                        of some Stock Exchange operations. The rate of exchange has since been
                        recovered; it now stands at 4.86 (cable) and it is rot anticipated that any
                        serious drain of gold to that country will take place in the immediate
                        future.</p>
                    <p>The French exchange, however, has shown marked weakness during the past few
                        days, having declined 1 points, and to-day, at 25.13, it as a menace to our
                        gold reserve. To the Morocco Conference must the present uncertainty be
                        mainly attributed. Could a settlement be arrived at, the atmosphere would at
                        once be cleared, French money would flow into our markets, and the relief
                        felt would be almost instantaneous, but this happy state of things cannot be
                        hoped for in the next few days, as is expected in some quarters.</p>
                    <p>One leading factor which tends to keep money and discount at such a high
                        level is the collection of revenue. The amount of public deposits is now
                        over 19 millions, which is higher than it has been for some years past, and
                        the commerical community is justified in grumbling and demanding that
                        something should be done to obviate this difficulty.</p>
                    <p>Apart from the disclosure of the above fact, the Bank returns this week are
                        not very interesting. "Other Deposits" show a slight decrease, and "Other
                        Securities" an increase of about half a million, not withstanding that many
                        bills must have matured during the period covered by the returns.</p>
                    <p>The Stock Markets.</p>
                    <p>The Stock Exchange has this week simply been a relfection of the position at
                        Algeciras, alternately buoyant and depressed, and with the exception of the
                        large traffic returns of the South American railways and some specially
                        favourable news for the shareholders of the Peking Syndicate, there has been
                        nothing worthy of note.</p>
                    <p>The Kaffir market continued to receive blow after blow from the repeated and
                        extraordinary utterances of Mr. Winston Churchill, developing the views of
                        the new Government in the direction of the proposal new self-governing
                        colony. That the heavy losses in the mining shares have fallen on a very
                        large number of small investors, and have been to the advantage of the
                        larger groups, who were apparently aware of the policy of the Government
                        beforehand, there is little doubt. At the same time the practical outcome is
                        not likely to be as bad as the pessimists forecast. In the meantime the
                        Kaffir market becomes a heavier burden each account.</p>
                    <p>Gilt-Edged Stocks.</p>
                    <p>In common with other stocks, gilt-edged securities have been very dull
                        throughout the week, with a daily decline in the price of Console, which
                        yesterday changed hands as low as 90 for cash. They are now a little firmer
                        and close at 90 for cash and 90 for the account.</p>
                    <p>Foreign Bonds.</p>
                    <p>The features of the market for international bonds in the early part of the
                        week was the strength of Russian Fours, which were largely bought as the
                        result of rumours of a new loan. The price jumped a full point to 85, and
                        this was when a fall of 1/2 was registered. The quotation to-night is 84
                        3/4. Some of the Japanese stocks have also been in demand, especially the
                        Four-per-cents, which on Wednesday were 5/8 higher than our last quotation
                        at 90 7/8. They are now 90. The second series of sixes are better at 10
                        1/2.</p>
                    <p>Home Railways</p>
                    <p>There has been very little business done in home railways since our last, and
                        this can only be accounted for by the general weakness of markets, for the
                        traffic returns this week are better than ever. The North Eastern have an
                        increase of over $11,000, and the North Western of $10,000 while there are
                        several four figure gains. The slight improvement in business noted on the
                        publication of these results has been surrendered, and the market is now
                        dial in the extreme.</p>
                    <p>Americans</p>
                    <p>A has prevailed in the American market, which has been acting in close
                        sympathy with Wall Street. Prices all round are somewhat below last week's
                        level, with the exception of Louisvilles, which have risen 2 3/4 points and
                        Illinois Central, which are 1 3/4 up, in good buying. The closing prices in
                        the leading Americans are as follows -</p>

                        Estates Ordinary are still firm at 2 1/8. There has been a large demand for
                        the Deferred shares, but there were none to be procured. The price of these
                        is now 13 1/8 14. Eight Deferred shares were offered at 14, but were
                        withdrawn.</p>

                        shares about, and it takes very little to move the price. It is difficult to
                        see how the shares can be worth so much. Daira Sugar are about 4 1/2.</p>

                    <p> Liverpool, March 15.</p>
                    <p>Egyptian cotton on the spot has been very neglected, and quotations of Brown
                        are reduced 1/8 per lb., and Upper 1/18 per lb. In Futures a moderate

                    <p>American Futures The Market this week has again been narrow with frequent
                        fluctuations, but in the absence of any speculative disposition, prices have
                        had a declining tendency, to-day's closing values veing 10 @ 11 points below
                        those of last Thursday. There is no special features. There has been
                        continued liquidation, chiefly in the American markets, where apparently
                        some stale "Bull" accounts have been thrown over, and the buoyant demand by
                        spinners has been a little less in evidence. As far as we can learn the
                        prospects are for an increased planting, work well forward, and a
                        considerable use of fertilizers reported. It is, however, much too early to
                        base any argument upon these points, only, when other conditions are absent,
                        they exert a certain influence.</p>

                    <p>(Suite a Fin) </p>
                    <p>Attendu que la véritable question litigieuse dono de voir si la préemption
                        actuelle tre dans l'un des cas de préemption licite vus par l'article 1 N 2
                        du Décret sur l'asSomption du 26 Mars 1900.</p>
                    <p>Attenda que la loi exige comme condition d'admissibilité de la préemption,
                        entre voisine, I s'agit d'immeubles ruraux, que les terrains ient contigues
                        des deux côtés et que la valeur celui du préempteur représente au moine la
                        pitié de la valeur du terrain préempté ($ 3 de it. 1 N° 2); Qu'il est
                        d'autre part constan' entre les parties et d'ailleurs établi &amp; priori
                        per documents de la Case que cette double condition n'existe pas en l'espèce
                        en sorte qu'il y a lieu de rechercher si l'espejo rentre dans l'une des deux
                        autre hypothèses légales est à dire s'il s'agit d'immeubles urbains, de loi
                        s'entend de "constructions on terrains des néz à être bâtis, situés dans une
                        ville ou dans • village" (8 1 de l'art. 1 N 2) on s'il s'agit 'immeubles
                        reliés par un rapport de servitude (1 de l'art. 1 N° 2); auxquels cas la loi
                        'exige qu'une contiguïté simple;</p>
                    <p>Attendu que l'immeuble connu sous le nom le Mens House" ne peut pas être
                        envisagé comme urbain, dans le sens légal de ce mot, ni qu'il togobe d'une
                        part au désert et d'autre part de vastes terrains de altore, soumis à les
                        inondations périodiques; Qie la loi tient en effet pour urbains, les
                        immeubles (constructions on terrains sitae, dans une agglomération batio
                        (ville ou village), par opposition aux immeubles ruraux, dont la destination
                        générale ost la altare plutôt que la bâtisse, et dans les quels les
                        constructions sont par suite plus on moins espacées ;</p>
                    <p>Que vainement les intimes se prévalent du tait que diverses constructions ne
                        seraient élevées récemment sur la route qui mène da Caire I aq Mena House
                        car, selon l'esprit de la loi si la destination qu'elle vise, n'est pay one
                        destination éventuelle, hypothétique et partant plus ou moins incertaine on
                        aléatoire: mais une destination résultant positivement et actuellement de
                        fait que les immeubles (constructions on terrains) sont situés au milieu on
                        dans le voisinage immédiat d'une agglomération bâtie.</p>
                    <p>Attenda d'entre part qu'en l'espèce les deux immeubles ont cessé depuis le 27
                        Novembre 1895 d'être unis par un lien de servitude, ia partie préemptée et
                        son auteur ayant à oletta date renonce au bedfordi la servitude qui grevait
                        le fonds du préempteur au bénéfice du fonds préempté.</p>
                    <p>Que vainement les intimés prétendent un droit aoq pis qui serait résulté
                        d'une déclaration de préemption antérieure à la renonciation, or il est de
                        droit commun, que les servitudes sé toïgo ont par la renonciation de
                        propriétaire de l'héritage dominant et que la renonciation n'a pas besoin
                        d'être acceptée pour produire re effets entre les parties (Aubry et Rau T.
                        III 965 poto 31); et d'autre part, selon une règle régissant
                        particulièrement la manière de la perception," la propriété de l'immeuble
                        sur lequel " le droit de préemption est exercé ne s'ap " qnet au préempteur
                        que par la décision du "juge ou par la livraison qui lui on est faite
                        volontairement par l'aube tour" (Kadry Pa oba, Statut réel, selon le rite
                        Hanafite. art. 125,</p>
                    <p>Qu'en somme aucune raison de droit on d'équité de s'opposer à ce qu'on puisse
                        se prémunir, en renonçant au bénéfice d'une servitude, atre les suites få
                        sableuses d'une préemption, i, a raison de son caractère exorbitant, doit e
                        strictement maintenue dans ses limites rales, </p>
                    <p>Qu'en l'espèce, la servitude étant légalement binte, la préemption n'a plus
                        aucune raison Btre et la demande doit donc être rejetée môme manquant d'une
                        base légale.</p>

                    <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                        January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so warm as
                        Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm
                        than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in
                        the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest
                        place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                        sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on each of
                        the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="3"/>
                    <p>They are as follows:-</p>
                    <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southhampton,
                        London or Liverpool—occupy about 4 days. The short ones are as follows:—</p>

                    <p>The steamers, of the P.&amp;O. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageriea
                        Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines are
                        also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by travellers to
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made without change
                        in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp;O.
                        Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna
                        express from Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis" to Brindisi. One of these leaves port
                        Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian <cb n="6"
                        />mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                    <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                        attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats" having
                        been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi.
                        If you are going straight through to England you will find the train waiting
                        at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete
                        arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in
                        London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <head>SICILY.</head>
                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMENA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is the
                        station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful,
                        occupying about one hour. In and around the town is much to interest the
                        visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but restored under the Romans.
                        CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of Etna and here also is a fine
                        Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all over
                        the island, are an endless sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting
                        history, having been a Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C.
                        413, and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb
                        is to be seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                        about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                        delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The
                        Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S.
                        Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral,
                        Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also worth a
                        visit.</p>

                    <head>CENTRAL ITALY.</head>
                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                        bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento
                        [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                        City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence itself the churches
                        and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local promenades and
                        excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and
                        fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea
                        level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero,
                        thence by cog-wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks
                        takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; hero there is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                        and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                        house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                        and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                    <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                        the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and deliciously cool
                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                        SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal springs,
                        change trains at Borgo San Donino and in half-an-hour you are at

                    <head>NORTHERN ITALY (Continued) and The ITALIAN LAKES.</head>
                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea port.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                        lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza :</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo, Cadenabbia,
                        and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio opposite. The walk
                        from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio is most enjoyable. A
                        steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake Lugano in three-quarters
                        of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                    <p>LUGANO is some 20 miles from Como and reached by train in one-and-a-half
                        hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated on
                        the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San

                    <p>LOCARNO, may be reached by rail from Bellinzona in forty minutes. This pretty

                        excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated above the
                        town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings, "Entombment,"
                        by Ciseri, and 'Tho Flight into Egypt," by Bramantion.</p>

                        Pilatus, Burgenstock and Sonnenberg needing a special visit each. Other
                        excursions on the lake can be made by steamer, and the ever-changing scenery
                        on the trip from Lucerne, to Fluelen is a source of delight to the lover of
                        nature.</p>
                    <p>BRUNNEN, charmingly situated on the most beautiful part of the Lake of

                        from here, and the panoramic view of the Alps is grand; extending from Monte
                        Rosa to the Black Forest, and from the Santis to the Matterhorn.</p>
