                        Western Oasis Railway, arrived ponctoally at 7 o'clock thie morning at
                        Kbarga Junction where the new line leaves the State Railway Breakfaxt was
                        served on the train, and the visitors then chang. ed trains and boarded the
                        comfortable new carriages of the company, which are to bear them across the
                        hitherto little known regions of the Lybian Desert.</p>
                    <p> Kharga Junction is situated some four kilo- metres to the north of the
                        market town of Far shat and about ¢ight from the better-known sugar centre
                        of Nag Hamadi The line for the first four kilometres runs on one of the
                        irriga- tion embankments of the Government, emerging into the open desert t
                        &amp; picturesque old horial ground at. the village of Karnak, where the
                        railway base of the company is situa- ted, and where the opening ceremony
                        was per- formed. The base station stands on the high ground, which borders
                        the desert at this point, and the order!y arrangements of the white wash ed
                        houses, the flag staffs upon which the Eo glish and Egyptian flags floated
                        proudly side by side, suggest rather a Coast Guard station at home than the
                        base of construction for a new railway. The train drew up opposite to the
                        bungalow ocenpied by Mr. William C Hornblower, the su perintendent of the
                        railway ,and bere the passen- gers alighted to witness the inanguration.
                        After an inspection of the station had been made, H B. Pakbry Pasha,the
                        Minister of Public Works, performed the ceremony by which the line was
                        declared open for traffic. This inangural pro cedure took the form of the
                        unlocking of a first- class carriage with a silver key designed for the
                        purpose, and which bore the inscription Corporetion of Western Egypt Weetern

                        distant asia, and within an hour of its arrival at the Qara Base the train

                        enough, bat it gives asplendid idea of the desert, though to appreciate its
                        hardships it should be seen in a sand storm. Still further onthe railway
                        crosses a bed of lime stone, and here the great difficulties attendant upon
                        the construction work will be evident, for the necessary materia! tor the
                        embankment was exceedingly hard to obtain, all the earth in the vicinity of
                        the road being for the most part composed of lime, and was useless for the
                        purpose for which it was required, crumbling away to nothing as soon as any
                        pressure was brought to bear upon it There are people who complain of the

                        i! is so in this case, here you get a shimmering led of lime stone gleaming
                        like a lake of silver iu the sunlight, and there the dark shadows of
                        coutrast which are ever chang ing in their depth of colour, from brown to
                        purple, from purple to black, and so on with a variety which is as infinite
                        as the chenging colours of the sea At kilometre 92 the line passes within a
                        few yards of an old Roman well. This point must have been at one time a
                        centre of some impor tance, probably as a watering station, fur the broken
                        remains of lamps and beads and potter of the Roman period are still to be
                        found in ite vicinity. The Corporation wisely determined to clear this well

                        difhcalties in the way of its re moval, it was found to be perforated with
                        fis snes through which the powder used for blas ting escaped, leaving the

                        was followed by the camel caravans of former days, and at kilometre 147 the
                        descent into the valley of the Oasis begins The scarp is approached across
                        the face of a plateau which rises above the surrounding depressions in the
                        formation of the land, and which apparently stretcher away abead of the
                        railways indefinitely. Therefore it is not until the decent is acteally
                        commenced that one realizes that the narrow gorge through which the train is
                        passing is io reality the entrance to the Ossie of Kharga, the great Oasis
                        The next sixteen kilometres is one sharp descent with « maximum grade for a

                        being more than suff. cient to render the passageof trein« onsafe. The
                        company therefore wisely decided to increase the height of embankments where
                        it was in any way feasible and so obviate the nedeasity of constantly
                        employing gangs of men to clear away the driven sand from cuttings. At
                        kilometre 151 the train passes cver a ravine of some thirty metres in depth,
                        once apparently a water course . thoagh the oldest resident of the Oasis
                        cannot recall having seen | it ander any other conditions than its present
                        one of extreme dryness. Towards the end of the scarp a huge sand dune
                        covering a dyke of rock crosses the line of the railway, and it was decided
                        to lead up to thie by an embankment which now takes the trains nearly op to
                        the level of the higher land which surrounds the ravine, and at kilometre
                        168 the’ train emerges into open country once more, the open valley of the
                        Oasis. This point marks the termination of all difficulties of construction,
                        the land from here being practically level, and earth for the formation of
                        such embankments as are neces sary, plentiful </p>

                        upon the success which has attended their efforts. In the first place there

                        allotted to them on this occasion. Even providing that labour was easy to
                        procure, the work in the scarp Was one which would tax any firm in its
                        accomplish- ment, but to add to the difficulties of natare, it was extremely

                        <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                        <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers
                            the accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by
                            which they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange
                            them as accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that
                            none of them are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home
                            there are several things to be considered. To begin with there is the
                            difference in climate between Egypt and the various points at which you
                            may arrive in Europe.</p>
                        <cb n="2"/>
                        <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                            January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so
                            warm as Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more
                            uniformly warm than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt
                            far too early in the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is
                            perfect. The warmest place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                        <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent
                            at sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on
                            each of the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of
                            Europe.</p>
                        <cb n="3"/>
                        <p>They are as follows:-</p>
                        <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth,
                            Southhampton, London or Liverpool—occupy about 4 days. The short ones
                            are as follows:—</p>

                        <p>The steamers, of the P.&amp;O. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageriea
                            Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines
                            are also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by
                            travellers to Egypt.</p>
                        <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to
                            Alexandria, without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made
                            without change in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                        <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                            Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German
                            Levant line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                        <cb n="5"/>
                        <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by
                            P.&amp;O. Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd
                            Trieste Vienna express from Alexandria.</p>
                        <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little
                            luggage is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several
                            good and responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed
                            charge to deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                        <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by
                            the fast Mail Steamers “Osiris" and “Isis” to Brindisi. One of these
                            leaves port Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the
                            Indian <cb n="6"/>mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                        <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                            attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats"
                            having been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to
                            Brindisi. If you are going straight through to England you will find the
                            train waiting at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without
                            changing. It has complete arrangements for sleeping and eating on board,
                            and you should arrive in London on the fifth day from leaving Port
                            Said.</p>

                        <head>SICILY.</head>
                        <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.’s steamers
                            which leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to
                            TAORMENA, one of the most charming and popular places on the island.
                            Giardini is the station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina
                            is most delightful, occupying about one hour. In and around the town is
                            much to interest the visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but
                            restored under the Romans. CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent
                            of Etna and here also is a fine Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and
                            Saracenic remains that are found all over the island, are an endless
                            sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting history, having been a
                            Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C. 413, and taken by
                            the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb is to be
                            seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                            about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                            delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city.
                            The Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of
                            S. Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The
                            Cathedral, Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also
                            worth a visit.</p>

                    <div type="item">
                        <head>CENTRAL ITALY.</head>
                        <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every
                            Wednesday during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3
                            days.</p>
                        <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino
                            Co.’s steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave
                            it without wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely
                            places on its bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that
                            takes you to Sorrento [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                        <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can
                            will devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and
                            interesting portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are
                            too well-known to need comment here.</p>
                        <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five
                            hours brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent
                            admiring the City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence
                            itself the churches and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the
                            local promenades and excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is
                            the most attractive and fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the
                            Viale dei Colli, one of the finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago,
                            goes winding up through the hills a distance of four miles. The most
                            delightful excursion outside Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its
                            Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea level. This is made first by ordinary
                            train from Florence to St. Ellero, thence by cog-wheel railway to
                            Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks takes an hour, and most
                            striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                        <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; hero there is a
                            fine Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night
                            should if possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile
                            at sunset.</p>
                        <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near
                            Pisa and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient
                            half-way house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable
                            and the air and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                        <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy,
                            with the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European
                            cities and a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and
                            deliciously cool breezes from the surrounding mountains and the
                            Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                        <p>The patriarchal home of Italy’s most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                            gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings,
                            are a constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn
                            in Genoa. Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches
                            containing exquisite marble columns and historical paintings, and the
                            incomparable Campo Santo filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                        <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                        <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                            Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful
                            windows illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and
                            the monumental cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                        <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                            SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal
                            springs, change trains at Borgo San Donino and in half-an-hour you are
                            at Salsomaggiore.</p>

                        <head>NORTHERN ITALY (Continued) and The ITALIAN LAKES.</head>
                        <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                            delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                            vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage
                            or bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every
                            turn. The approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any
                            other sea port. The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of
                            the sea, no hills behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of
                            Campaniles appear above the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering
                            town rises like a fairy mirage out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                        <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                            lakes.</p>
                        <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in
                            one-and-a-quarter hours by train by way of Monza :</p>
                        <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is
                            very beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                            enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo,
                            Cadenabbia, and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio
                            opposite. The walk from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio
                            is most enjoyable. A steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake
                            Lugano in three-quarters of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in
                            two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                        <p>LUGANO is some 20 miles from Como and reached by train in one-and-a-half
                            hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated
                            on the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M.

                        <p>LOCARNO, may be reached by rail from Bellinzona in forty minutes. This
                            pretty town, situated at the top of lake Maggiore has a mild climate and
                            is an excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated
                            above the town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings,
                            “Entombment," by Ciseri, and ‘Tho Flight into Egypt,” by Bramantion.</p>

                        <p>In and around the town the walks are charming, and the excursions to be
                            made from Lucerne by boat, rail, etc., are very numerous.</p>
                        <p>The Lake of Lucerne abounds in delightful excursions, those to the Rigi,
                            Pilatus, Burgenstock and Sonnenberg needing a special visit each. Other
                            excursions on the lake can be made by steamer, and the ever-changing
                            scenery on the trip from Lucerne, to Fluelen is a source of delight to
                            the lover of nature.</p>

                        <p>A delightful exeption from Lucerne is that to ENGELBERG. Take boat to

                            Railway, with delightful scenery en route. The ascent of Titlis, is made
                            from here, and the panoramic view of the Alps is grand; extending from

                            reached from Alexandria ; the climate in April is charming. The best
