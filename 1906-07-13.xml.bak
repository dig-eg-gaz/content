                    <p>The dose of the Dreyfus case in the rehabilitation of the victim who is
                        restored to the army and promoted to the rank of major, ends one of the most
                        painful episodes of modern history. The affair, which threatened at one time
                        to wreck the French Republic, which</p>

                    <p>convulsed French politics end social life, and at one moment seemed shout to
                        produce serious international complications, has terminated happily, and we
                        trust that no more will be heard of it. Major Dreyfus has now ceased to be a
                        symbol, and we gather that French public opinion, which has been for some
                        time prepared for his rehabilitation, regards it with satisfaction or at
                        least with composure. </p>
                    <p>One of the most disagreeable features of the case—in our opinion, the most
                        dangerous feature of all—was the ardour with which the British and
                        Continental Press engaged in anti-French polemics in a question which was,
                        after all, one for the French people to decide. Little anticipating the Beck
                        trial, the British Press indulged in a campaign which was probably far more
                        harmful than beneficial to the interests of the 'prisoner of the Devil’s
                        Island, and the German Press, by throwing its weight into the scales, only
                        strengthened the prevailing impression that Dreyfus had been employed by the
                        German Government to obtain military secrets from the Ministry of War, where
                        he was employed on the technical staff. The undoubted fact that a leakage of
                        plans and designs took place, resulting in the discovery by Germany of
                        certain rather important secrets relating to the French Artillery— an arm of
                        which the Republic is justly proud,— the personal unpopularity of Dreyfus,
                        the somewhat ridiculous mystifications in which certain officers and
                        officials indulged, the discovery of documents relating to espionage
                        written, it was believed, by foreign military attaches and containing a
                        cryptic reference to "ce canaille de D.,” and the fact that the unfortunate
                        officer had visited Germany at the time of the loss of certain documents
                        referring to the new French 4‘7-inch Howitzer, all combined to injure his
                        chances. Add to this the fact that the most vigorous partisans of Dreyfus
                        were, rightly or wrongly, considered to ha opponents of the existing social
                        order—cranks, enemies of the church, the army and of private property,
                        communists or cosmopolitans- and it will be easily understood that a
                        court-martial composed of officers, who were in no sense legal experts and
                        mast have been influenced by the violence of the party straggle that raged
                        round "the affair,” and by the testimony of important members of the
                        military hierarchy, condemned him a second time. </p>
                    <p>Dreyfus certainly owes much to some of his French supporters—M, Reinach,
                        Emile Zola, and a host of others, and above all Colonel Picqnart, whose
                        conduct, inspired neither by pity for a co-religionist, nor by political
                        animosity, nor by a desire for ‘reclame,” but simply and solely by the wish
                        to see justice done, must ever merit the admiration of the world. This
                        officer, restored to the army with the rank of brigadier-general, must feel
                        a profound satisfaction at the success that has at last attended his
                        efforts. At the same time justice is due to some of the opponents of the
                        revisionists. Officers, who naturally enough believed that their chiefs were
                        superior .to prejudice and could not be duped by false information, felt a
                        natural repugnance towards a cause championed by such as M. Urbain Gohier,
                        the author of sundry attacks on the army, who he sines justified the
                        suspicions entertained by tbh anti-Dreyfusards by supporting a movement
                        which aims at inducing reservists to refuse to join the colours in case of
                        war with Germany. The Clericals—many of whom were sincerely religions and
                        honest men regarded the campaign waged by many of the Dreyfasards not merely
                        against the Roman Catholic Church, bat against all forms of religion, a
                        campaign conduced with the maximum of intolerance and the minimum of good
                        taste, with a genuine abhorrence. Is it to be wondered at that large numbers
                        of them jumped to the conclusion that the Dreyfusard was necassarily an
                        enemy of Church and State? </p>
                    <p>The last enquiry having already terminated in the restoration of his military
                        rank to the inured officer, it is probable that no more will be heard of a
                        case that rivalled the affair of the Diamond Necklace and at one time
                        appeared certain to have ‘he same fatal consequences. The case of the
                        Diamond Necklace aided in the destruction of the Monarchy, the Dreyfus
                        Affair shook the Republic, but the latter Government, if it bent to the
                        storm, possessed sufficient flexibility to save it from being broken, and,
                        when the clamour and violence that accompanied the earlier stages of the
                        affair had died down, was able to conjure a potential danger by a prudent
                        magnanimity</p>

                    <p>Fanaticism in Egypt </p>
                    <p>Under the heading “There is no Fanaticism in Egypt,” the “Moajrad” recalls
                        the sympathy always shown to Christians by the Egyptians, mentioning among
                        other cases that of Nubar Pasha, who became President of the Council Of
                        Ministers, Regent, and even presided over the religious ceremony of the
                        Mahmal. The “Moayad”- concludes with) a reference to the harmony which
                        exists between Egyptians and Greeks in the smallest villages. </p>
                    <p>The “Times” and Mustapha Kamel. </p>
                    <p>Several of our contemporaries publish a letter addressed to the “Times” by
                        Mustapba Kamel. We note that the letter does not appear to have been
                        published by the “Times” in any of the numbers yet to hand. It is strange
                        that our Nationalist confrere has waited eleven years before protesting
                        against the Institution Of this court—first created on Feib. 25, 1895, in
                        consequence of an attack made on some British sailors by a crowd of
                        Alexandrian natives</p>
                    <p>Unlucky Months.</p>
                    <p>The “Lewa” briefly recapitulates the principal events which have taken place
                        in Egypt, and calls “fatal" the months of June and July, during which
                        calamities have befallen the country, to with the massacre of Alexandria,
                        June 11 1882; the bombardment, July 11, 1882 ; the Denishwai incident, June
                        J3,1906 ; the sentence and execution of the criminals, Jane 27 and 28 ; and,
                        finally the declaration of Sir Edward Grey, accusing the Egyptians of
                        fanaticism, July 7. </p>
                    <p>Presentation</p>
                    <p> A pleasing function took place on Thursday afternoon in the Church of
                        Scotland girls’ schools, when Miss Elisabeth Hannah, M.A., was presented
                        with a parting gift of a silver tea services from the staff and teachers of
                        the Mission, and the pupils of the girls’ schools Two girls from the school
                        and Mr. Buchanan, for the staff and teachers, asked Miss Hannah to accept
                        the present and expressed their regret at her resignation. Miss Hannah, in
                        reply, thanked all for the sympathy and friendliness she had experienced
                        during the past three years, and said the handsome gift would remain one of
                        her most valued possessions. She hoped some of those present would come to
                        see her in Ragland, and meanwhile their prayers for her, and her prayers for
                        them, would be a golden link binding them together, though many seas rolled
                        between.—Miss Hannah will be much missed by a large circle of friends, who
                        wish her all health and happiness in her home in England. </p>

                    <head>THE DENISHWAI AFFAIR. MR. DILLON AGAIN.</head>
                    <p>Mr. Dillon again interpolated Sir Edward Grey in the House of Commons last
                        Thursday on the subject of the Denishwai executions. He asked whether the
                        Egyptian Ministry of the Interior, acting under the advice of Mr. Machell,
                        issued an official report of the facts of the Denishwai affray case, as
                        presented/ by the Government at the trial, a week or some days before each
                        trial took place ; if so,, whether in view of the effect of such publication
                        upon the public mind in Egypt and in England, and in view of the possibility
                        of prejudicing the Court before which the trial was held, he would explain
                        why this course was adopted : whether the trial was held under the special
                        Khedivial decree of 1895 and the Court duly constituted in accordance with
                        such decree, and all the members thereof thoroughly familiar with the Arabic
                        tongue, both written and spoken, and duly qualified in criminal law;
                        whether, under the Egyptian native penal code, flogging was permitted for
                        any offence whatever, and if he would state whether such flogging was
                        permitted under the decree of 1895 ; whether there was any preliminary
                        investigation, and, if so, whether the prisoners, or any of them, were
                        represented thereat by counsel, and whether such investigation was held in
                        public or in private ; and whether at 4ne preliminary investigation, it any,
                        and at the trial, counsel for the prisoners were permitted to cross-examine
                        the witnesses for the prosecution, or whether all questions were put to the
                        witnesses by the President of the Court.</p>
                    <p>Sir E. Grey.—In view of the very incorrect reports which were being
                        circulated in the Press, a preliminary statement of the facts, so far as
                        they were then known, was given to the Press by the Ministry of the Interior
                        on Jane 17. The trial was held under the Khedivial decree of 1895, and the
                        Court was duly constituted in accordance with that decree. The English
                        members of the Court were specially chosen on account of their knowledge of
                        Arabic, and all except the military member, who was specially selected for
                        his knowledge of Arabic and his experience of such matters, were technically
                        as well as thoroughly qualified in criminal law. Flogging is no longer
                        allowed under the ordinary criminal law, and no stipulation as to the
                        character of the punishment to be inflicted is laid down in the decree of
                        1895. The decree of 1895 lays down that a preliminary investigation shall
                        take place, on the termination of which the case shall be brought publicly
                        before the Court. I have no official information as to the other points
                        mentioned in the question, but they will be dealt with in the fall report
                        which has been asked for, I should like to add, as Captain Machell’s name is
                        mentioned in this question and was mentioned the other day, that, while any
                        responsibility that Captain Machell had in the matter cannot be pronounced
                        upon until the fall report has been received, I have asked Lord Cromer about
                        him, and I am told by him that there is probably no European in Egypt who is
                        more popular with Egyptians and whose character stands higher. </p>
                    <p>Mr. Paul (Northampton) asked when his right hon. friend expected to receive
                        the dispatch for Which he had asked. </p>
                    <p>Sir E. Grey.—A fall report of the judgment is on its way, and a fall report,
                        I imagine also, of the execution of the sentence?. The evidence which I also
                        promised, extends to 200 pages of Arabic, which have to be translated, and
                        obviously I cannot expect to have that as early as the other reports, </p>
                    <p>Mr. Dillon asked, inasmuch as the decree of 1895 did not specifically mention
                        the right of the special tribunal to give punishments not passible under the
                        ordinary law of Egypt, on what principle the special tribunal acted? </p>
                    <p>Sir E. Grey.—The decree, if I remember aright—I can give the quotation later
                        on if necessary gives the Court full discretion as to the punishments to be
                        inflicted. </p>
                    <p>Mr. Pickersgill (Bethnal-green, S.W.) asked whether/with the other papers,
                        the right hon. gentleman would include a translation of the Khedivial decree
                        of 1895 </p>
                    <p>Sir K Grey.—Yes, Sir, there will be no difficulty about doing that. </p>
                    <p>Mr. Dillon asked the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether an appeal
                        to the Court of Native Appeal from the judgment of the special tribunal was
                        not allowed in the Monatazah case in July, 1900; and who was responsible for
                        the non-allowance of an appeal in the Denishwai case. </p>
                    <p>Sir E. Grey. — In the case of the assault on two British officers at Montazah
                        in July, 1900, proceedings were instituted against the two principal
                        offenders before the ordinary tribunals, and not before the special tribunal
                        as in the present ca-e. Article 4 of the Khedivial Decree of 1895 lays down
                        that there shall be no appeal from the judgment pronounced by the special
                        tribunal. </p>
                    <p>THE LAW OF TRESPASS IN EGYPT. </p>
                    <p>Mr. Pickersgill asked the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs what was the
                        outcome of the promise made by Lord Cromer in 1S01, after the fracas near
                        Cairo between British officers and the watchmen of Mr. Wilfrid Blunt, that
                        he would consult the legal advisers of the Egyptian Government as to
                        suggested strengthening of the aw of trespass in Egypt, so as to protect
                        native cultivators from injury at the hand of Europeans ; and whether
                        anything had been done in the premises. </p>
                    <p>Sir E. Gray.— Lord Cromer consulted the legal adviser to the Egyptian
                        Government on hi* return to Cairo in 1901, and they were of opinion that no
                        change in 'the law was necessary or practicable. Nor is there reason to
                        believe that oases of trespass by Europeans are more common than cases of
                        trespass by natives. </p>

                    <head>AS OTHERS SEE US ENGLISH AND EGYPTIANS</head>
                    <p>Under the heading of ‘Wanted—A Diplomatic Agency at London,” “Al Minbar”says:
                        - It is unfortunate for the English in Egypt that the entire population of
                        Egypt, with but few exceptions, is under the impression that the English in
                        Great Britain, from the highest to the lowest, are selfish, greedy, and
                        ambitious ; that, by occupying Egypt or taking possession of another
                        country, they do so merely for the pleasure of satisfying their ambition and
                        becoming masters of other nations ; and this being their utmost desire all
                        that they may say to the contrary is simply false and misleading. The
                        Egyptians would undoubtedly reconsider this idea and would treat the English
                        in a different way had they been shown or induced to believe that, as a
                        matter of fact, the English in England and abroad confidently believe that
                        they are rendering great services to Egypt by sending their best men and
                        dearest sons to save it from feebleness, and elevate it from its degradation
                        to an equality with civilized nations. </p>
                    <p>This general belief in England, which, however, is at great variance with the
                        impression prevailing in Egypt, is a real fact confirmed by those who have
                        been in touch with the English and have studied their characters. Whether
                        the English are doing so merely with the idea of doing good to other
                        countries occupied by them or for the sake of humanity exclusively, has
                        nothing to do with the case. For man is always man, and oppression is hat
                        part of human nature ; it becomes obvious when joined to strength but it is
                        concealed when accompanied by weakness. </p>
                    <p>Such being the belief in London, those of the English who are in authority in
                        a country occupied or possessed by England, once they find themselves in
                        fall power with a wide sphere of influence and authority, almost lose sight
                        of the object for which they are sent unless they are confronted with a
                        strong opposition from the nation ruled by them or they are subjected to a
                        strict control by the power to which they belong. </p>
                    <p>Whether the British Government and its statesmen say what they believe and do
                        what they say or not, there is no doubt that the English nation believes
                        that its sons in Egypt and other countries are rendering great services to
                        those countries and are civilising and instructing their peoples. </p>
                    <p>From what was reported yesterday by “A1 Moayad” at the meeting in which on?
                        contemporary was present, we extract the following passage in support of our
                        statement: </p>
                    <p>The Editor of the “Standard” said : We have gone to Egypt with the only
                        object in view to civilizes that nation and lead it into the way most
                        beneficial to it. </p>
                    <p>Sir Henniker Heaton said: Egypt is not to be ruled by strength and
                        oppression; it is our interest to see it advancing and progressing in
                        civilisation and prosperity. </p>
                    <p>Such being the belief of the English nation, it is certain that it will take
                        into most careful consideration any complaints on our behalf when properly
                        laid before it and supported by substantial evidence. It is known that in
                        every discussion there are two sides, according to personal tastes and
                        inclinations. For a long time past the British nation has received
                        information from one side only, and its representatives here have been able
                        to present matters to their -Countrymen according to their point of' view,
                        so as to show that their efforts in Egypt are enjoying unsurpassed success,
                        and that happiness and satisfaction are widespread Now that they have
                        attained their aim and obtained the confidence of the English nation, they
                        have in some eases come to the conclusion that they are infallible and free
                        from any defects, and this is the worst of all. </p>
                    <p>It is for this reason that the Egyptians are in need of a Diplomatic Agency
                        at London to represent their interests and present to the English nation the
                        right side of current events, 20 that those who are in Egypt will feel that
                        there is a public opinion In their country that checks their statements and
                        observes their notions. In our opinion it is extremely difficult for Egypt
                        to make any serious progress and rise to the rank of other countries, and
                        all efforts are useless and in vain so long as iced of the English
                        representatives Egypt remain unchecked and so long as they are given a free
                        hand in the administration of this country without any control whatever
                        either in Cairo or in London. </p>

                    <head>THE SERSINA ENQUIRY. </head>
                    <p>Although nothing has been made public to the result of the enquiry held by
                        the British military authorities into the Sersina affair, we gather that the
                        Court has been unable to obtain any evidence whatever implicating the
                        British troops in the death of one inhabitant of Sersina and the wounding of
                        another. The medical evidence points to the fact that the Sersina fellah
                        found dead by the British patrol in the market place of the village was
                        killed by blow from a ‘fess,’ a-weapon which is not use in the British Army,
                        and the wounded man was struck by a bullet of a much larger calibre than the
                        Lee-Enfield carbine carried by the Mounted Infantry. </p>

                    <head>EGYPT’S TRADE. IMPORTS DURING MAY. </head>
                    <p>Judged merely by the Customs returns (says the Journal of the British Chamber
                        of Com- merce), the import trade daring May was in a distinctly flourishing
                        condition compared with the same period last year, for we find on examining
                        the figures that only three categories, viz., live stock, textiles, and
                        tobacco, were lower than in 1905. The remaining twelve classifications all
                        showed increased clearances varying from about L.E. 2,600 in leather to over
                        L.E. 127,300 in metals. </p>
                    <p>The total returns daring May were given at LE 1,897,123, being a gain of LE.
                        363,444 over the figures for the same month last year. The gross value of
                        Egypt’s imports since the 1st January now amount to LE. 7,974,388. in 1905,
                        the expansion in trade being thus LE. 893,278. </p>
                    <p>Every item in the metal classification showed increased shipments, the
                        largest gains being those of LE. 56,762 in iron goods, L.E 24,966 railway
                        and tramway rolling stock, and LE. 23,780 in machinery (excluding
                        locomotives and agricultural machines). All the locomotives —valued at L.E.
                        30,720—which came into Egypt daring the month were credited to Germany,
                        there having been no clearance from England. In iron and iron good, Belgium
                        with LE. 49,741 nearly doubled her 1905 figures, whilst England's returns
                        rose from LE. 42,000 L.E. 60,000. </p>
                    <p>A slight set-back in cereals during April was fully compensated by again of
                        L.E. 66,006 May. Maize was higher by LE. 33,724, the bulk of the month’s
                        shipments coming from America. Nearly twelve and a halt million kilograms of
                        floor reached Egypt daring May, the increase being one of 940,062 kilos. It
                        is interesting to note that the total value of the cereal imports since the
                        commencement of the present year has now passed the million mark, the exact
                        figures being LE. 1,076,684. </p>
                    <p>The coal and timber classification was np by LE. 61,990, the main increase
                        being LE. 56,173 in the latter article. The total clearances in timber
                        amounted to LE. 100,915, the principal sources of supply being Romania LE.
                        27,136, Austria LE. 23.852, and England LE. 18,358. With regard to coal,
                        98,468 tons were received daring May, against 79,462 last year. </p>
                    <p>The sugar and coffee returns were higher by L E. 28.871 and L R 8,746
                        respectively. In the former case, Austria and Germany supplied nearly the
                        whole market, the latter country having now obtained a footing here in
                        consequence of Russia's internal troubles. The following table compares the
                        sugar returns from Germany and Russia during the first five months of 1905
                        and 1906 : </p>
                    <p>The liquor |and ail class was LE. 18,885 to the good, mainly due to
                        additional arrivals of petroleum to the extent of L.E. 12,578. With the
                        exception on LE. 1,784 from America, the whole of the petroleum shipments,
                        valued at LB. 42,518, came from Russia. </p>
                    <p>In soap, the increase was one of 319,377 kilos, valued at LE. 6,577, compared
                        with May 1905. The bulk of the trade was done with Turkey. </p>
                    <p>May was a very quiet month for Manchester goods, the returns being L.E.
                        13,738 lower than last year. The majority of the clothing classifications,
                        however, showed increases, but textiles as a division were LE. 6,782 to the
                        bad on the month. </p>
                    <p>The imports of live stock dropped over L.E. 20.CC0 during May compared with I
                        905. </p>
                    <p>Although it is true that England's clearances for May were LR 61,510 higher
                        than daring the same month last year, such increase cannot altogether be
                        termed satisfactory, since it merely represents about 14 % of the total
                        expension. </p>
                    <p>England’s largest movements on the credit side were those of L E. 18,301 in
                        iron goods and L.E. 13,300 in timber, whilst her principal loss was L.E.
                        20,913 in Manchester goods. </p>
                    <p>As already mentioned, none of the home country t orders for locomotives were
                        cleared daring May. On the other hand, however, she shipped railway and
                        tramway rolling stock to the value of L.E. 19^457, against L.E. 13,874 by
                        Belgium, whilst last year the figures for the two countries were
                        respectively L.E. 1,534 and LE 7,584, </p>
                    <p>The coal returns were np by L.E. 7,094, hat this was almost counterbalanced
                        by the drop LE. 6,699 in English furniture imports. </p>

                    <p>A painful tragedy was enacted yesterday evening at the foot of the hill on
                        which stands the Government Hospital, and exactly opposite Victoria
                        College</p>
                    <p>At about 6.15 p.m., a young married couple, ofHellenic nationality,
                        accompanied by their year-old child, were walking close to the tramway line,
                        when the approach of a tramcar frightened the child, who ran on to the
                        line</p>
                    <p>Seeing the danger in which his child stood, the lather, a young man of 28,
                        rushed to save him, but it was too late. Almost instantaneously, the oar
                        came upon them and the man met instant death in the presence of his
                        distracted wife. The wheels of the car passed over his head and he was
                        horribly mutilated. It was with some difficulty that his body was extricated
                        from under the car, which had meantime been brought to a standstill. </p>
                    <p>By what seemed to be a miracle, the child’s life was saved, the injuries it
                        received through the car passing over it being slight. The father’s name was
                        Anastassi Stimation. The driver of the ear by which he met his death, a
                        native of 19, was arrested. He asserts it was quite impossible for him to

                    <p>After the final decision of the Mixed Tribunal at Cairo, delivered on the 3rd
                        ultimo, approving of the reconstruction scheme of the Social Generale des
                        Sucreies et Raffinerie d'Egypte, it was somewhat disconcerting to read
                        recently in the “Berliner Tageblatt” that there are three rival groups of
                        financiers, English, French and German, all competing for a required advance
                        of £200,000 to £250,0C0 to the company, to be secured on its stocks of
                        sugar. The ‘Financial Times” is now asked to state that this information is
                        inaccurate and that there can be no question of any such international
                        rivalry. The decision of the Mixed Tribunal fixed the Daira Sanieh. Sugar
                        Corporation’s claim on the debtor company at £800,000, and provided at the
                        same time for an issue of £800,000 in Five per Cent, bonds, secured by the
                        mortgage of the company’s entire assets. At the same time, our contemporary
                        is informed, the Egyptian Government paid the company £400,000 for its
                        railway line*, which sum was to he applied to the extinction of half the
                        Sugar Corporation’s claim, the other £400,COO to be met out of the new bond
                        issue, which leaves the company with a working capital of £400,000. All
                        British claims are thus provided for. The French creditors are, firstly, the
                        old bondholders, and, secondly, the bankers, who hold some 24,000,000 francs
                        of the company’s hills. By the decision of the Court, the old bonds are to
                        be exchanged for new ones, bearing a variable interest, according to the
                        earning of the financial year, and guarantee at R frano on the 400 frano
                        bond for the first three years by an intervening group, while the bill-
                        holders are paid by a distribution of privileged shares in the reconstruct d
                        company. All claims being thus adjusted and the required money found, all
                        talk of the Anglo-Egyptian rivalry or intervention of the German Banque
                        d'Orient is, according to information, quite beside the point.</p>

                    <p>This match was played yesterday in very hot weather and resulted in a good
                        finish. Peel and Maclaren opened the innings of the Club XL, and after Peel
                        had been caught off a risingball Maclaren and H. P. Carver scored fairly
                        freely. Both were occasionally in difficulties with Mastard’s off breaks,
                        and when the score reached 48, Carver was bowled in trying a forcing stroke
                        off a short ball. E. T. Peel and the brothers Maclaren had only added a few
                        when Maclaren, after being missed three times off four balls—two of which he
                        hit for four—tempted fate once too often. B.T. Peel fell to a fine running,
                        catch at long off, and eight wickets were down for 108, but at this point De
                        Rongemont and Bailey added 37 and the innings closed for a better total than
                        at one time seemed probable. Mustard and Aubrey were always hard to play and
                        both secured good analysis. </p>
                    <p>The Rest started badly, losing Marsden at 6. Cheeaman and Henley then played
                        with confidence, but with undau discretion, letting off a Dumber of
                        over-pitched balls from Graves, who took some time to find his length. At 63
                        Cheeaman was bowled and five wickets were down for 75. Aubrey and Biythman
                        made a usefal stand and took the 8C3re to 113, but at this point the la four
                        wickets fell to Bailey and Graves in quick succession, and the innings
                        closed for 123, the club winning by 29 runs. The fielding on both sides was
                        good, Marsden, Mainprice, and J. C. Maclaren bringing off good catches. </p>

                    <p>The second of the races in the private match between the Delikanli and the
                        Coot took place on Tuesday last, the 10:h inst. The course was an inside one
                        and consequently the superiority in the open sea which the Delikanli had
                        shown in the previous race was of no avail to her. The wind, which at the
                        commencement of the race was a good sailing breeze, died away rather towards
                        the end but not sufficiently to prevent the time for the full course being
                        quite good. The following was the result: Boat. Start. Finish. Sailed by.

                        The Coot thus crossed the line 12 minutes ahead and after allowing for the 8
                        minute handicap agreed on, won by four minutes. </p>

                    <head>THE OUTBREAK IN EGYPT. OPINIONS OF THE PRESS- </head>
                    <p>The following are the leading comments of the home Press on Sir Edward Grey’s
                        speech on the situation in Egypt:-- </p>
                    <p> “Times.” </p>
                    <p>Sir Edward Grey’s short speech on Egypt last night formed the most impressive
                        feature of the debate. He made a statement or rather an appeal to the House
                        not to embark on discussion of the Denishwai outrage and the punishments
                        inflicted for it until they were in full possession of the facts. The facts
                        have already been made appreciably dearer by the answers which Sir Edward -
                        Grey has given in reply to questions in the House, and also by the very
                        informing and categorical telegram from our correspondent which we published
                        yesterday. The Foreign Secretary carried matters a stage further last night.
                        He was able to remove altogether, from facts in his possession, any painful
                        impression that may have been created by the report of the executions
                        transmitted a telegram from Cairo. He reminded the House how liable to error
                        such short telegraphic accounts are, and how much need there is for fairness
                        in passing a judgment on persons concerned. Already Captain Machell’s name
                        has been referred to in the House of Commons in. a manner that doss little
                        credit to the dignity, generosity, or common sense of his fellow-countrymen.
                        But Sir Edward Grey has made inquiries of Lord Cromer, and he is informed
                        that there is probably no European in Egypt who is more popular, and
                        deservedly popular, with the natives than Captain Machell. </p>
                    <p> “Telegraph.” </p>
                    <p>We should be glad to think, though we are not sanguine enough to hope, that
                        we have heard the last in Parliament of the just and summary punishment
                        meted out to the murderers of Captain Bull in Egypt. Sir Edward Grey pleaded
                        yesterday for a suspension of discassion on the subject until he was in a
                        position to lay fall papers on the table. From his answers to questions,
                        however, and from the important speech he made on the Foreign Office vote,
                        it is clear that after consultation with Lord Cromer he is satisfied with
                        the action of the Executive in Egypt. The Irish Nationalists, of course,
                        though supporting Ministers generally, in anticipation of favours to come,
                        never hesitate in disparaging the honour-of British officers, or in
                        endeavouring to lower the prestige of Great Britain at any moment or in any
                        part of the Empire. One of these open enemies of the British Empire
                        described Captain Machell the other night as a “brute,” just as his
                        predecessors twenty years or more ago applied even more offensive epithets
                        to Lord Spencer, Sir George Trevelyan, and even Mr. Gladstone himself,
                        because they declined to regard cold-blooded assassination as a legitimate
                        political weapon. As to Mr. Keir Hardie, who, of coarse, demoness the
                        execution of assassins in what he imagines to be the Sudan, just as he
                        declared that thousands of natives have been massacred in Natal on the,
                        pretext of “a rebellion that does not exist, '] it is only necessary to say
                        that we do not believe that an honest working-man in the country attaches
                        the slightest importance to his aftercares. </p>
                    <p> “Standard.” </p>
                    <p>This, perhaps, is not the time to discuss the quarter from which the
                        Pan-Islam sedition has been fanned almost into flame. The intrigues have
                        been carefully watched by oar administrators, and it was necessary to make a
                        condign example of the first instance of open disaffection. If it should
                        turn out that in the manner of inflicting punishment there was any disregard
                        of humanity, those who are responsible will, in doe course, be called to
                        account. Bat it is necessary to await a fall report lest in ordeal for meroy
                        we commit a gross injustice. Meanwhile, Sir Edward Grey, speaking with a
                        full sense of official responsibility, showed that any weakness or
                        hesitation displayed by the Egyptian authorities might lead this country
                        into operations of a more serious nature than some of the ignorant
                        enthusiasts on the Radical benches would regard with equanimity. Sir Edward
                        Grey, like Lord Rosebery, has won a good record for the Liberal party in the
                        valley of the Nile, and he will not spoil it for the sake of humouring a few
                        sentimental cranks</p>
                    <p>“Pall Mall Gazette.” No fall report had yet been received, although such
                        report may, perhaps, have reached the Foreign Office this morning, inasmuch
                        as we ourselves are able to publish a fall account of the executions to-day.
                        Sir Edward was able, however, do remove, in the judgment of all unprejudiced
                        persons, the false impression created by an early telegraphic account to
                        which the Press has given publicity. He vindicated the character of Captain
                        Machell, an officer who has been foully aspersed fly the malicious
                        irresponsibility of Radical critics of1 the baser sort.</p>
                    <p>“Westminster Gazette.” No Secretary of State in any House of Commons could
                        possibly make such an appeal as Sir Edward Grey made yesterday without
                        receiving an immediate response from all parties. Whatever party is in
                        power, the House is always susceptible to an appeal made by a Minister who
                        pleads the public safety for postponing discussion or deferring an answer to
                        a question. On those terms alone is it possible for a democracy to govern an
                        Empire, and we have not the slightest fear that any Home of Commons will
                        desire to depart from them. A wise Minister will, of course, be very sparing
                        in his use of the Parliamentary truce, and when he uses it he will feel
                        himself under the deepest obligation to do everything of his own initiative
                        which could possibly be suggested to him by public discussion. In both
                        respects we may have the fullest confidence in Sir Edward Grey. </p>
                    <p>“Daily Chronicle.” To weaken the authority of an executive officer, or of a
                        constituted Government, in the midst of arduous and critical circumstances,
                        is to incur a serious responsibility. It should never be undertaken except
                        after the fullest consideration of all the conditions. Above all, there
                        should be no disposition to pat the worse construction and accept the least
                        favourable presumption, whenever the notion of a British official in a
                        distant dependency or colony is concerned. ‘My country, right or wrong,’ may
                        not be the best maxim ; but my countryman beyond the seas, therefore wrong,
                        is a worse. </p>
                    <p> “Advertiser.” Some of Sir E. Grey's nominal supporters do not share his view
                        of the right way of dealing 'with rumors which impute something
                        discreditable to their fellow-countrymen abroad. At the least hint they are
                        ready to assume that anything in which an Englishman may be supposed to have
                        had a hand moat have been wicked and disgraceful, and they proceed to deluge
                        the Minister concerned with questions the main object of which seems to be
                        to display the deepest possible sympathy with anything that may be construed
                        as a revolt against British rale. Against this temper and these exhibitions
                        of it Sir E Grey found himself forced to protest. </p>
                    <p>Globe ” The outrage upon British officers was, in fact, another symptom of
                        the general unrest which is more or less in evidence at the present time in
                        every Mahometan country ; and it was properly punished, with legitimate bat
                        not by any means excessive severity. Farther evidence of the disturbance of
                        the Moslem population was given in the Tabah incident, which was settled by
                        Sir Edward Grey’s firm ness in dealing with the Sultan and the salutary
                        presence of British troops on the spot That oar prompt action had much to do
                        with the speedy end of Turkish aggression and the checking of the Egyptian
                        agitation is evident, bat the danger is not yet over. </p>

                    <head>ENGLAND AND RUSSIA</head>
                    <p>There has been a great deal of talk of late, especially on the Continent
                        about an Anglo- Russian alliance, and the German point of view is the one
                        that has usually been taken. Bat there is, it may be remarked, an English
                        point of view as well, and in this month's “Empire Review” Mr. Edward Dicey
                        summarises the disadvantages which would arise from the suggested
                        Anglo-Russian entente. France is very anxious that it should be brought into
                        the range of practical politics because it would isolate Germany, and
                        perhaps lead to the restoration of Alsace- Lorraine to France or the
                        conversion of those two provinces into a neutral state. Russia would also
                        welcome an understanding which might tend indirectly to detach ns from oar
                        alliance with Japan, and which would confer moral power on her after her
                        disastrous defeats in Manohnria and her unrest and disturbance at home. Bat
                        the advantages which it would/bring to ns are, to say the least, dubious.
                        England is sound in finance, repute, ^and administration, while Russia
                        emphatically is not, and therefore the reciprocity—as the Irishman
                        said—would be all on one side, and that side not the English. Moreover,
                        without wishing to be unpleasant to Russia, it is only common prudence to
                        remember that her record for good faith in keeping her engagements is by no
                        means unimpeachable. She has always broken her engagements when she has seen
                        an opportunity of doing so with impunity, and the only advantage she could
                        offer would be a doubtful guarantee not to approach the North-Western
                        frontiers of our Indian Empire. It is hardly sufficient security. (“Globe.”)

                    <head>EGYPTIAN COTTON IN SIND. HIGHLY FAVOURABLE EXPERIMENTS. </head>
                    <p>The favourable issue of the three years’ careful and systematic trial of
                        Egyptian cotton in Sind, which has been assured by the sales in Manchester
                        of the produce of last year’s sowings, is of worldwide interest and
                        importance. Not only is a vista of increasing prosperity opened to the
                        cultivator, but the manufacturers and their hundreds of thousands of
                        employees are effected by the ultimate increased steadiness of the cotton
                        industry, which in tarn influences many other interests that stand or totter
                        with the fluctuations of the source of a large wage supply. Since 1900, when
                        the organized movement for the product of Empire grown cotton was set on
                        foot by the British Cotton-Growing Association, as a measure of
                        self-protection against the restriction and manipulations of the American
                        cotton-growers and speculators, particular attention has been given
                        throughout India to the improvement of the indigenous flue, long-stapled
                        varieties. Bat even where the selection and hybridization of the plants are
                        in the hands of trained experts some time mast elapse before marked
                        improvement is reached in this direction. There is also the other, and
                        greater, difficulty of upsetting the established custom of ages, which has
                        wedded the ryot to the cultivation of the coarse, hardy, short-fibred
                        varieties, which yield prolific crops that can be harvested after five
                        months’ rapid growth instead of eight months to mature, as is the case with
                        the finer kinds. </p>
                    <p>From time to time daring the last century exotic cottons have been introduced
                        into India, frequently under the direction of experts from America and other
                        countries, but with one exception they met only with failure, and about
                        thirty years ago these experiments were abandoned. In September, 1903, Mr.
                        Fletcher, who had been Second Assistant Principal of the Egyptian College of
                        Agriculture, went to India as Deputy Director of Agriculture to the
                        Government of Bombay, and he soon formed the impression that the conditions
                        in Sind, from the nature of the soil, its dry climate, and the excellent
                        irrigation, were peculiarly favour able for the cultivation of Egyptian
                        cotton. The native cotton of the province is the worst in India, worth not
                        more than three pence a pound. Many of the cultivators were colonists from
                        the Panjab, and there would not be so great a difficulty in making a change
                        as if they had been for generations bound by tradition and use to the
                        systems in vogue. One advantage the country has over Egypt, where the Nile
                        is lowest at the cotton season, and there is often a deficiency of water tor
                        the crop; at that time the Indus is at its highest</p>
                    <p>By the first year’s experiments on twenty acres at Dhoro Naro, Mr. Fletcher
                        was satisfied that, on perennially irrigated areas in Sind, Egyptian cotton
                        would grow normally, and that with care in following the methods of the
                        country of its origin the yield would be equally large. He found, however,
                        that to avoid the risk of the early frosts of December it would be necessary
                        to sow in February and March, and the importance of his work led the
                        Government to keep the Jamrao Canal open throughout last year, though under
                        the rules it should have been closed daring Maroh and April for the annual
                        cleansing. Ten tons of Egyptian seed were distributed among the Zemindars
                        along the canal, and about 1,500 acres scatters 1 over a district of 2,000
                        square miles were sown. The 500 bales produced have been found in Manchester
                        to be of such excellent quality that they have realised nine pense a pound,
                        and an eager market is assured for any quantity of the same class that India
                        can send. The Lancashire manufacturers, encouraged by the large profits of
                        last year, when the return was more than 20 per cent on the capital
                        invested, have recently erected over 2,000,000 additional spindles for
                        treating Egyptian cotton, and as in the opinion of experts the limit of
                        production in Egypt has been reached, there is every prospect of the present
                        remunerative prices being maintained for some years. </p>

                    <head>LETTERS TO THE EDITOR. </head>
                    <p>We do not hold ourselves responsible for the opinions expressed by our
                        correspondents, but we wish, in a spirit of fair play to all, to

                    <p>Sunbeams Limited</p>
                    <p>To the Editor of the “Egyptian Gazette.” </p>
                    <p>Mr. Editor,—Daring the last three or tour days the “Old Gentleman” has,
                        apparently, had all hands at work below, “stoking up,” with a view to the
                        interests of my company, which sufficiently accounts for the printer’s devil
                        converting “Barnett” into “Barnett ” “Lagado” into “Lagodo,” and “singe”
                        into “tinge,” in my last letter. </p>
                    <p>The singeing of the professor’s beard was, doubtless, due to a want of care
                        in gazing into the month of the sunbeam phial; a danger Against which I
                        should have specially cautioned my future bottlers in Alexandria, where,
                        daring the present month, they might easily deprive themselves of the whole
                        appendage in the same way. </p>
                    <p>When I declared myself a patriot, I should, also, have craved the indulgence
                        of a section of the Cairo Press, which I trust will, kindly, look upon me as
                        the exception allowed to prove the truth of the apothegm of oar greatest
                        lexicographer : “Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel.”—I am,
                        &amp;o., </p>
