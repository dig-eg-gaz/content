                        <p>Much speculation has been indulged in of late in Khartoum, as to the
                            exact site of the future central railway station which will be erected
                            after the new bridge shall have been completed. According to the
                            origiual plans this station was to be to the South-West of the town, but
                            as these plans are subject to various modifications nothing can be
                            certain as to the exact site. One thing seems to be certain and that is
                            that for the new station a very large area will be railed in.</p>

                        <head> The English Bar In Egypt. </head>
                        <p>A question of some interest to the members of the English Bar practising
                            in Egypt is dealt with in the Bar Council’s annual report. The Council
                            ruled during the past year that a member of the English Bar, who is also
                            a member of a legal firm in a Colony in which there is no distinction
                            between barristers and solicitors, ought not to practise as an English
                            barrister while he remains a member of the Colonial firm. Although
                            Colonies are only attended to in this ruling of the Council, it is to be
                            presumed that it would also apply to barristers practising in Egypt and

                        <p>Sheikh Mohamed Shaker, President of the Ulema Board of Alexandria, has
                            published his report for last year respecting the theological school
                            under his directorship. The report contains full details of the
                            religious studies and the latest arrangements adopted by the Ulema Board
                            for improving the schools in question. The number of the students of
                            those schools was 576 up to the end of last year. 531 of the number
                            offered themselves for the annual examination in which 429 students were
                            successful. Sheikh Shaker refers to the prosperity of the Ulema Board
                            Schools being due to the valuable assistance and encouragement given by
                            the Khedive. He asks the Mohamedans of Egypt not to disdain but to
                            support their religious education which they should consider as the
                            basis of enlightment and prosperity, and which would enable them as a
                            nation to vie with the civilised world</p>

                    <byline>( Gazette's Special Service. )</byline>
                    <dateline>London, Wednesday.</dateline>
                    <p>In the leading article of to-day’s “Daily Telegraph” referring to Lord
                        Cromer’s remarks anent the entente cordiale, the writer says that from the
                        date of the signing of the Anglo- French convention Sultan Abdul Hamid has
                        worked through Mussulman agencies to create what is called the “national
                        movement” in Egypt. He has had one warning of the daugers of this course and
                        he may yet require another. It may be that nothing short of the appearance
                        of a British fleet under the park walls of Yildiz will ever convince him of
                        the fatal folly of interfering with our position in Egypt.</p>

                <div type="item">
                    <head>CAISSE DE LA DETTE. A USEFUL INNOVATION.</head>
                    <p>The National Bank of Egypt has come to an agreement with the Egyptian
                        Government and the Caisse de la Dette, whereby the receipts from the land
                        tax and other sources of revenue hypothecated to the Caisse de la Dette will
                        be henceforward paid to the local agents of the National Bank. As these sums
                        are paid in, the National Bank at Alexandria will pass that amount to the
                        Credit Lyonnais at Alexandria to the Credit of the Caisse de la Dette. This
                        new arrangement will have an important result, for it will cause the money
                        to circulate much more rapidly than has hitherto been practicable during the
                        busy cotton season, and should be of material assistance in helping to put
                        an end to one of the chief causes of the locking up of gold, such as was
                        experienced during the acute money famine, which raged with such intensity
                        and caused so much inconvenience throughout the whole country during the
                        past autumn.</p>
                    <p>At present the branches of the National Bank throughout the provinces are
                        constant buyers of cheque on Alexandria of the agents of the big cotton
                        buyers here. To provide funds for that, the branch of the National Bank at
                        Alexandria has to send specie to its provincial agencies. Under the system
                        recently inaugurated, by receiving this money from the Caisse de la Dette,
                        there will be no longer any necessity, to send up so much specie to the
                        provincial çentres, and this same money will perform the double
                        transaction.</p>

                    <head>THE ROYAL VISIT. REVIEW AT ABBASSIEH. </head>
                    <p>Yesterday morning H.R.H. the Duke of Connaught reviewed the troops of the
                        Cairo British garrison on the parade ground at Abbassieh. Half past ten was
                        the time fixed for the review and some time before that hour the Abbassieh
                        road was crowded with people anxious to witness the parade. A postponement
                        of half an hour had been made, however, and at eleven o’clock the Duchess of
                        Connaught and Princess Patricia arrived, being accompanied by Lewa Watson
                        Pasha, and escorted by a bodyguard of Inniskilling Dragoons. On their
                        arrival the National Anthem was played by the massed bands.</p>
                    <p>Less than a quarter of an hour later the Duke of Connaught arrived on the
                        scene, the troops coming to “Present,” and the bands again playing “God Save
                        the King.”</p>
                    <p>When his Royal Highness had taken up his position at the saluting point, the
                        parade marched past in the following order: – Major General Bullock and
                        Staff, “U” Battery Royal Horse Artillery, 6th Inniskilling Dragoons (3
                        Squadrons), Mounted Infantry, Royal Engineers, 3rd Bn. Coldstream Guard (8
                        companies), 2nd Bn. Inniskilling Fusiliers (7 companies), 1st Bn. King’s Own
                        Scottish Borderers. The Infantry Brigade under the Command of Col. Grenville
                        Smith (Coldstream Guards) marched past in quarter column and again in line
                        of quarter column. The Royal Horse Artillery gallopped past in splendid
                        line, followed by the 6th Inniskilling Dragoons at the “charge.” The Parade
                        then reformed in extended line and advanced to within 30 yards and saluted,
                        while the massed bands under Bandmaster Watson Ramsey, Inniskilling
                        Fusiliers, played the National Anthem.</p>

                    <dateline>Port Said, Tuesday.</dateline>
                    <p>As I wired you this morning the bunkering Arabs have come out on strike in
                        sympathy with the coal-discharging men who left work without notice on
                        Thursday night. Throughout yesterday things were looking black, the Arabs
                        taking from 1 to 4 hours to get from the Arab town to the ship, and when
                        they did arrive they were very slow in getting to work. Late last night they
                        refused to work, and there have been some 12 or 15 ships whose crews have
                        had to set to and coal for themselves.</p>
                    <p>It is reported that the sheikhs are having a much trouble as well as the
                        “blacklegs,’’and last night the mounted police had to be called out to keep
                        order in the Arab town.</p>
                    <p>Everything in the European quarter is quiet and the police are ready to deal
                        with any disturbances which may arrive.</p>
                    <p>Colliers continue to arrive and the discharging basin is now full. Four
                        vessels with a total tonnage of over 21,000 tons have arrived within the
                        last two days.</p>
                    <p>I understand that the owners are trying to engage labour from Cyprus, but
                        that nothing has yet been fixed.</p>

                    <p>The P. &amp; O mail S.S. Egypt has arrived and is coaling with her crew.
                        Large crowds of Arabs along the quay are watching the coaling
                        operations.</p>

                    <p>On Monday evening John Marshall, a seaman of the S.S. Aleppo, while returning
                        to his ship with a shipmate, stumbled and fell into the water. He was
                        speedily rescued and conveyed to the German Hospital, where it was found
                        that his state was precarious and he succumbed eight hours later. Marshall
                        was 31 years old and a native of Sheffiold ifa Yorkshire. The inquest was

                    <p>For many years past classical chronologists have been at loggerheads about
                        the exact date of the decisive battle of Chrysopolis (now Scutari) wherein
                        Constantine the Great defeated Licini s, the master of the East and thus
                        became sole ruler of the Empire. Some fragments of Greek papyri recently
                        discovered at Theadelphia near the Fayoum, and brought to the Cairo Museum,
                        have been found to fix the date of the battle at 324 of our era.</p>
                    <p>M Cledac, the partner of M. Clermont-Ganneau, in the excavation now
                        proceeding at Assouan, has discovered the site of the Necropolis of the rams
                        of Khnoum, the god of Elephantine. Fifteen of these gods have been brought
                        to light and the greater number are in good preservation. The mummies have
                        unfortunately very few inscriptions on them.</p>
                    <p>The inscriptions of the Greek and Roman eras discovered in Egypt, and
                        published during 1906 have been very few. Four come from the Fayoum, one
                        from Mahemdiat, and one from Tehneh. Three of the Fayoum ones, however, are
                        legal documents engrossed upon wax preserved in Roman writing tablets and
                        are of much importance for the theory of Roman law. Three of the Roman
                        Governors or Prefects are mentioned in the various new texts, T. Hateritis
                        Nepos Q Corvius Flaccus, and M. Petronius Honoratus.</p>

                    <p>Mr. James Dennis, of Baltimore, an associate director of the work of
                        excavation in Egypt conducted by the Egyptian Exploration Fund, has sent a
                        letter to those interested in the work in Baltimore, under date of the 15th
                        ulto. from Luxor, setting forth what has recently been accomplished. In the
                        course of it he says :</p>
                    <p>“The work of the expedition this year has been confined chiefly to opening
                        the shaft found last year that was presumed to lead into the tomb of King
                        Mentu-Hotep, Ra Neb Hapet, of the eleventh dynasty (about 2700 B.C.), and to
                        clearing the western court of the temple built by that king at Der el Bahri,
                        on the west bank of the Nile, in old Thebes.</p>
                    <p>The opening and clearing of this shaft have now been completed. The shaft
                        itself consisted of a long, inclined passage way, cut through the solid
                        rock, extending for nearly six hundred feet into the cliffs surrounding Dier
                        el Bahri. For about one-third of the way the shaft is roofed by cyclopean
                        blocks of sandstone, meeting in an arch at the top. Beyond this shaft is a
                        chamber about twenty feet long, at the end of which a flight of shallow
                        steps leads to the tomb chamber, the entrance to which is faced with large
                        granite blocks.</p>
                    <p>The roof of the tomb chamber, which is about sixteen feet high and twelve or
                        fourteen feet square, consists of large slabs of granite, meeting in a point
                        at the top, and not curved, as in the shaft. Three fourths of this chamber
                        is occupied by a great shrine, in which the sarcophagus containing the body
                        was placed. This shrine is built entirely of large blocks of alabaster,
                        except the roof, which consists of a granite monolith overlaid with
                        alabaster ; the inner sides are pierced with numerous holes, to contain pegs
                        for holding the coffin lid, and its exterior is modelled after the style of
                        a temple pylon. In front of this shrine was a large quantity of mummy cloth,
                        mixed with which we found the bones of the king, some portions of the skull,
                        jawbone aud the larger leg and arm bones ; the rest had crumbled to dust
                        ages ago.</p>
                    <p>Besides these fragments of the body of King Mentu-Hotep we found a large
                        number of models of sacred boats, wooden statuettes, figures of persons
                        engaged in various occupations, many war bows and arrows, the latter being
                        of a type hitherto unknown in Egypt ; two large heads in wood that formed
                        the covers for canopic jars and one of the gilded sandals of the king, part
                        of a gilded sceptre, several parts of chairs and thrones, and many other
                        fragments too badly injured by their forty-six centuries of interment to be
                        valuable.</p>
                    <p>The greatest interest connected with this discovery lies in the fact that the
                        temple and tomb of Mentu-Hotep are older by about a thousand years than any
                        monument heretofore found on the site of ancient Thebes, while the finding
                        of a royal body in its tomb, though not unprecedented has occurred only
                        three times in the history of Egyptian exploration. The temple itself is
                        unique in its architecture, and represents a transition period between the
                        pyramid type of interment and that practised in later times.</p>
                    <p>Many statues of the King have been found lately in front of the temple, and
                        within a week we have found the remains of a finely paiuted shrine of
                        Rameses the Great, showing that from about 2700 BC. to 1200 B.C. the temple
                        was known and revered as the last resting place of the greatest that Egypt
                        has ever had.</p>

                    <head> ITALIAN VESSEL WRECKED. FOUR MEN DROWNED. RESCUE BY A MOSS BOAT. </head>
                    <p>The Moss Liner Moeris Captain F. Dunnett), arrived from Glasgow, reports the
                        following incident:–  </p>
                    <p>On the morning of the 17th March, off Cape Finisterre, she came up with the
                        Italian steamer Industria, (980 Tons, of Genoa) in a sinking condition,
                        bound from Falmouth to Buenos Ayres with a cargo of iron and coal.</p>
                    <p>Some of her crew had already left and were observed clinging to the bottom of
                        a capsized boat. A south-westerly gale was blowing at the time and the
                        Moeris promptly lowered one of her boats, which, in charge of the chief
                        officer, Mr. J. James, first rescued the men from the overturned boat and
                        then approached the sinking steamer, those who remained aboard having to
                        jump into the sea and be picked up by the salvors. Four men refused to leave
                        and were seen to go down with the unfortunate vessel, which broke in half
                        immediately afterwards. Fourteen men were saved, including the English
                        captain and chief engineer, and were landed at Gibraltar</p>
                    <p>Great credit is due to Captain Dunnett, officers and men for a smart rescue
                        under very difficult aud risky conditions.</p>

                        de chemin de fer sera établie dans cette rue. Il est bien en entendu que
