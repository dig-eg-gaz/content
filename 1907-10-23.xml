                        other ancient ruins and the Venetian fortifications, the finest in the

                    <head>ORIENTAL NATIONALISM.</head>
                    <p>The great success of an Asiatic people in Japan is being turned to good
                        account by Indians in their current magazines. In the "Modern Review" there
                        is a well-drawn con trast between education in Japan and India</p>
                    <p>The mere figures contrasted are by no means inoculated to stimulate our
                        national self-complaincy;--</p>
                    <p>The popalation of Japan is 46 or 47 millions It approaches most closely to
                        Madras in area and the United Provinces in population, whilst British India
                        asa whole bas a population five times as large. But while Japan spends at
                        least five millions sterling out of her public funds on education, the cost
                        to the public revenues in British India is less than a million and » half,
                        To make the expenditure equal to that of Japan, it should have been at least
                        27 millions, or eighteen times as much as it now is. In fact, the State and
                        the local an- thorities in British India spend. less on educa- tion in all
                        its aspedts than what the tiny king- dom of the Mikado spends on
                        educational</p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p>buildings alone, aod the latter amounts to only 26 per cent. of the total
                        dost of education in Japan. The State expenditure on education is Rs. 1-12-4
                        pies per head in Japan, in British Indian it is a little over an anna! Even
                        the small State of Baroda spends seven annas per head on education. That
                        Japan is not excep tionally liberal in this respect will appear from the
                        tact that Germany spends Ra. 5-7-2 pies . France, Rs. 3-18-11 pies; Re 3
                        Spain, Rs. 1-74 pies; and Italy Rs.1-1-11 pies, per head on education. The
                        smaller States of Europe spend even more.</p>
                    <p>To us if seems that different results in Japan and in India can only be
                        accounted for by the difference in the policy of the respective Governments
                        which control education in the two countries. The sim of the one is to tum
                        out perfect and complete man, strong and self-reliant, that ot the other is
                        to create subor dinates in Government and mercantile offices, so as to
                        render the work of forgein administra tion and exploitation possible</p>
                    <p>Mr. Alfred Stead in the "Hindustan Review," expounds to our Indian
                        fellow-subject the glories of Japanese patriotism. He says that the
                        continuous devotion of the Japanese to their deceased ancestors and to their
                        Em- peror as the embodiment of all that is venerated in the nation's past
                        has been going on for over 2,500 years. If thoughts have power, what power,
                        he asks, must not these thousands of years have generated ! The veneration
                        reaches the present day with accumulative force im possible of
                        comprehension, and create in the Japanese people a patriotic and loyal force
                        of inconceivable magnitude. He finds that in religious matters the Western
                        world may learn from Japan the dangers of a State Church, the elimination of
                        politics from religion, tolerange and a desire to seek out and help on the
                        best in all creeds, and an insistence on practical and philosophical
                        religion</p>

                    <p>In the "Modern Review" the India of to-day is contrasted with France in the
                        period preced- ing the Revolution. The writer urges that the same causes
                        which were responsible for famine in France before the Revolution exist in
                        India to-day. Indian self-government has been an nihilated or reduced to
                        ithpotende, even as was the case in France. An article on how the epoy is
                        housed contrasts the official optimism f the supreme Indian anthorities with
                        the very unsatisfactory reports tendered by the district principal medical
                        officers. There cer tainly is a strong case made out for barrack reform.</p>
                    <p>Mr. S. C. Mookerjee insists that with the India of to-day prostrate under the
                        heel of the foreigner, her national gospel must be that of sorrow, also that
                        of repentance for national failings in respect of polytheism, easte degrada
                        tion of woman, lisentiousness and an ignorant priesthood, He insists that it
                        is necessary for the English people to be at the helm in India They are a
                        superior race, and Indians must aspire to be their equal in manly
                        virtues</p>
                    <p>In the "American Review of Reviews," Mr. W. M. Zumbro, President of the Ameri
                        can College in Madura, writes that India is a nation in the making. The
                        trouble prevailing there at present is simply the of birth There are three
                        dominant notes ip marmor of discontent—one political, nother industrial, the
                        third religiovs and social. The industrial discontent is due to the fact
                        that scientific and industrial education has been almost wholly neglected,
                        and the educated classes kept sloof from industrial parsuits. 'The result on
                        agri- cultare is painful to contemplate. The net vrea of the land that is
                        cropped is only about 37-5 per cent. of the total area, while more than 18
                        per cent. of the total area that can be cul tivated is left waste. The old
                        industries are declining, and "caste exclusiveness, suspicion and lack of
                        business integrity make it as yet impossible, save among the Parsees, for
                        the people to organise commercial enterprises." He recognises that England
                        means to do the fair thing with India, sometimes slowly and gra dually, but
                        in the long ren determined thet India shall have a square deal, and in time
                        a government of her own</p>

                        <p>The New York bankers and financiers are conferring to devise steps to
                            check a panic. The "Daily Telegraph" says that two ways are open. One is
                            to form a fifty million dollars pool to support the market and to import
                            gold to the extent of three to five millions sterling. The second is to
                            issue clearing house certi- ficates. The latter seems to meet with
                            favour. It is anticipated that another trust company will be in
                            difficulties. The best informed bankers say that Wall Street needs fifty
                            mil lion dollars to face the situation.</p>

                            or connected with, the work. Special cars had been reserved on the 8
                            o'clock train from Cairo on Saturday evening, and an excellent dinner
                            was served by the Wagon Lits Company. On their arrival at Khargeh
                            junction at 7 o'clock on Sunday morning one of the trains of the Western
                            Oases Railway, gaily decorated with bunting, was waiting to convey the
                            party to Qara, where the fete was to be held. The féte ground was gay
                            with multi-coloured streamers and Chinese lanterns and a crowd of
                            upwards of 5,000 natives were already thronging the Most of these men
                            had actually been engaged the formation work. All the surronnding
                            villages were represented by their omdehs and sheikhs, some having
                            travelled all the way Yrom distant Khargeh The sports programme, which
                            comprised events for both Europeans and natives, was carried out without
                            a hitch, the camel race (natives) being keenly contested. Several of the
                            Awassim Bedouins gave a very interesting display of horsemanship, and a
                            troupe of dancing girls performed at intervals</p>
                        <p>The menus provided for lunch and dinner were excellent. At the dinner
                            Johnson Pasha, speaking in French, proposed the toast of Messrs. Gusman
                            and Dentamaro and expressed the satisfaction which the directors felt at
                            the manner in which the work had been carried out, Mr. Dentamaro
                            replying on behalf of his firm. Mr. Gusman is at present in Europe but
                            his secretary, Mr. Pleimes, responded on his be- half, and proposed
                            'Success to the Corpora- tion" coupling the name of Mr W.C. Horn- blower
                            with the toast, which was received with acclamation. After dinner there
                            was @ pyro- technic disp'ay, one large set piece flanked on either side
                            by the English and Italian flags and reading, "Viva C. W. EB. Limited
                            and F. G. and E. D." being very fine</p>
                        <p>On Monday the guests were taken for a trip into the desert on the new
                            railway, returning to Cairo by the night train in the special car-
                            riages which had been awaiting them on the aiding at Kharga junction
                            since their arrival on Sunday morning</p>
                        <p>Messrs. Gusman and Dentamaro are to be congratulated upon the way in
                            which they have avcomplished the difficult work with which they were
                            entrusted, the greater part of which was done under the personal
                            superintend. ence of Mr. Dentamaro. The road, though only a narrow guage
                            one, offered more difficulties in construction that any other in Egypt,
                            the ground over whieh it had to be laid rendering it impossible to
                            obtain material for the forma tion near at hand in a large number of
                            places, and it required all the through organization, which was
                            fortunately in evidence, to keep labourers at work during the hot months
                            of the summer when the hardest part of the work was in hand.</p>
                        <p>The fantasia was a fitting termination to a successfal work, and all the
                            parties concerned are to be congratulated on the admirable way in which
                            the arrangements were carried out from start to finish, The catering and
                            sleeping arrangements on the Wagon Lits were in all respects perfect</p>

                        <p>A PACKED HOUSE.</p>
                        <p>Truly the house which greeted Mustapha Pasha Kamel yesterday evening was
                            packed to overflowing by an enthusiastic crowd of sheikhs and students,
                            and a fairly large assembly of the man in the street, while not a few
                            Syrians, Jews, and representatives of Buropean nations were present to
                            hear the great discourse of the illustrions Pasha. His entrance on the
                            stage was the signal for an outburst of applanse and as the leader of
                            the Nationalist party stood before the table, on which was placed at
                            either end a candle to illuminate his beaming countenance, the hall
                            reechoed with the cheers of a multitade of ardent nationali When the
                            cheering had subsided the speaker thanked his audience for their hearty
                            greeting, and in response came a shout of "Ya ashab al watan," while
                            others cried "long ive Mustapha Pasha Kamel." Throughout his speech the
                            Pasha was so londly applauded that he had to appeal to his audience to
                            restrain their exuberance, but he must have been somewhat diseoncerted
                            by the fact that the applause came at inopportune momenta, Indeed, the
                            audience became so lax that it was necessary for the Pasha to exclaim at
                            more than one part of his speech "Now you may cheer and clap." The
                            speech lasted an hour and a half, and we cannot but record that as the
                            time passed away the audience appeared to tire and the applause became
                            less and less frequent. Despite his eloquence Kamel was unable to hold
                            his andievee, though this is hardly suprising in view of its
                            composition, for, as far we could judge, no' politician or Egyptian of
                            note was present to sapport the would-be leader of a national movement.
                            His ardour, none the less, was unabated and he spoke with fervour
                            emphasised by excited gesture. Though speaking with eloquence, we must
                            accuse our vonfrere of vain repetition. The keynote of his speech was
                            "Were I not an Egyptian, I would haveliked to be an Egyptian for the
                            Egyptian's sake." Would it be unfair at such a moment to cast a doubt
                            upon the true Egyptian descent of the pseudo-patriot?</p>
                        <p>In the course of his speech he dealt with the Lambert and Denishwai
                            affaira, Lord Cromer and his policy, Mr. Dunlop's misdeeds, ete. He
                            alluded indirectly to the Syrian colony in Egypt by warning his hearers
                            against the tricks of that section of the inhabitants of Egypt, who had
                            come here hungry and withoat resources and in spite of the kindness with
                            which they had been received they acted in a treacherous manner.
                            Kamelearnestly impressed on his audience the necessity for rallying
                            around him as their leadér. He of course did not neglect to deal with
                            religion and dwelt with great reiteration on the vital necestity for
                            religious education in the schools. He concluded that there was no need
                            to despair as there was no doubt of the ultimate inde pendence of
                            Egypt</p>

                        <p>The statement due here to-day may show adminstration both in the

                    <p>"WITHDRAWAL" OF MALET.</p>
                    <p>Our readers will have observed from our special service telegrams of the
                        12th, 16th, and 19th. inst., that Sir Rdward Malet has exposed Mr. Blant to
                        the world as an historian of very imperfect acourracy, and one who would
                        rather mislead a reader than present to him an anbiassed chronicle of facta,
                        should it be possible thereby to cast discredit on the nation of which he is
                        an unworthy subject. What- ever interpretation he may now choose to pot upon
                        his references to Sir Edward Malet in his latest book, "Secret History of
                        the English Occupation of Egypt", it cannot be denied that the conclusion
                        most likely drawn from those references are that Sir Edward Malet was
                        withdrawn from Cairo at the insti- gation of Mr. Blont. This is most clearly
                        shown by the thee (1882) British Agent and Consul- General in his letter to
                        the "Times", the full text th we now have before us. As a selfavowed
                        traitor to his country and an intimate friend and influential counsellor of
                        Arabi Pasha, it was not surprising that Mr. Blunt should do his utmost to
                        mar the career and irretrievably damage in the eyes of the public one who
                        strove to maintain the interests of his Empire land respond to the calls of
                        a nation which was threatened with disaster. Mr. Blant, as nucleus of the
                        Arabi rebellion, could hardly have been expected to write in generous terms
                        of so honest and open-minded a man as Sir Edwrad Malet, and his charges of
                        ignorance, incapacity, and treachery came las no surprise to those who had
                        followed the trend of events ; bat, as Sir Edward Malet points oat, Mr.
                        Blont has contributed in no small degree to "misguided history" by stating
                        that at the most critical moment of the rebellion Sir Edward Malét was
                        ordered on board ship by her Majesty's Government at his instigation. On the
                        15th of June, Mr. Blunt, who was engaged in London at the time in his
                        intrigue in support of Arabi, received from Sabunji, his agent in Egypt, a
                        telegram which lcontatned the following :—"Recall Malet, for God's sake. All
                        carse and will nvurder him if he continues," and in his diary Mr. Blunt re-
                        marks "I went at once to Eddy Hamilton [Mr. Gladstone's private secretary]
                        and implored him to get Malet removed on board ship." He theo speaks of Sir
                        Edward Malet "having been withdrawn" and later mentions the "re moval of
                        Malet," and to put aside all doubt as to what Mr. Blunt intended the public
                        to infer we torn to the index, where, under the heading "Malet", we find
                        "Author gets him ordered lon board ship (p. 886)." Bat no such order was
                        ever given. Fearing that his life was in grave danger Lord Granville did
                        telegraph to Edward -Malet advising him to go on board ip (he was at this
                        time in Alexandria) and to conduct his business from the harbour, but the
                        British Agent realised what panic might result from such aetion on his part
                        and so lhe stuck to his guns. He received from Lord Dufferin, who 'was at
                        Constantinople, the following telegram: "You seem to be the only man in
                        Egypt who has not lost bis head. I have watched all you have done with the
                        greatest admiration." On June 17th, Sir Ed- ward Malet was struck down by a
                        mysterious fever (the resalt of poisoning) of which he nearly died, but at
                        midnight on the 18th the fever passed away as mysteriously as it came,
                        thongh leaving the patient prostrate. (On the 23rd he was carried on board
                        the "Mongolia" land on his arrival at London on the 10th of July he was told
                        by Lord Granville that the Government were only anxious that he should get
                        well as speedily as possible in order that he might return to Egypt and
                        resume his duties.</p>
                    <p>Such is the trne history of the "withdrawal" of Sir Edward Malet at the
                        instigation of Mr Blunt. But can we be surprised at such distor tion of
                        facts by the pen of one to whom the spirit of Little-Englandism is the
                        breath of life? Proud of his considerable share in the rebellion of 1882,
                        proud of the terrible carnage and loss of property of which he was the main
                        cause, for without his incitement it is very doubtful whether Arabi would
                        have had the courage to lead a rebellion, Mr. Blont makes use of his too
                        ready pen to contribute di storted facts to 'misguided history" aud to cast
                        undeserved ignominy upon his contem- poranean politicians, Such men we
                        cannot but consider as self-interested. Unable to gain fame, M. Blunt mast
                        needs seek notoriety, and with such an end in view he uses Arabi Pasha asa
                        tool with which to grind his own axe. He has, indeed, secured bis goal.
                        Foremost among Little Englanders, he has gained that notoriety which any
                        man, deserving of the name, would seorn. He can delight in the applause of
                        his country's enemies, and it is to hima pleasure to be despised by his
                        compatriots. We cannot believe that such men as Mr. Blunt truly desire the
                        betterment of their fellow-beings or the uplifting of enfeebled races.
                        Anti-patriots well know that the power of speech or pen earns for them a
                        despicable notoriety, flashes their names be useful to alien countries in
                        the future, and in such they glory. It is their proad boast that they have
                        made every effortto poison the nation which has nursed them, and with such
                        an object in view they welcome with avidity evidence which they know to be
                        of merely apparent veracity, witch can be readily confounded by scratching
                        the mengre veneer which makes it presentable to the world. In all his
                        writings Mr. Blont has shown himself eager to accept the most baseless
                        testimony available, and this is eapedially evident in his version of the
                        deplorable Denishwai incident. Therein he twists and turns facts to
                        represent the view he, in the full spirit of Little-England- <cb n="5"/> ism
                        wishes to offer to the public, and so it is with his "Secret History of the
                        English Occu- pation of Egypt." Ever eager to prove his country in the
                        wrong, always ready to discredit a faithful servant of the State, he has
                        recorded the events of 1882 with a marvellous disregard of accuracy and
                        recorded as facts what the light of day proves to be inventions. We cannot
                        but welcome Sir Edward Malet's empathetic denial of Mr. Blunt's statements,
                        for by such utter descredit is cast upon a volume which should never have
                        been written, and which is a lasting disgrace to the hand that penned
                        it.</p>

                    <head>DEPORTATION OF CRIMINALS.</head>
                    <p>Woulf it be advisable to introduce a law whereby the Egyptian Government
                        would be vested with the power of deporting criminals? This proposal, which
                        is carried would be likely to be infinitely far reaching in its results, in
                        being mooted at the present time, and on the whole it appears that public
                        opinion is inclined to support it, though no definite scheme has yet been
                        arrived at.</p>
                    <p>In our opinion such a law, as applying to specail cases and under special
                        circumstances, would have a distinctly beneficial effect, the dread of
                        banishment being certainly calcuated to produce a most salutary impression
                        on the minds of evil doers</p>
                    <p>It is, however, a step which will require the most careful consideration, the
                        drastic nature of the proposal making it inevitable that it would, in the
                        majority of cases followed by results as active as the measure taken to pro-
                        sure them, and it is a full appreciation of this fact which we must
                        endeaveur to absorb before making such a law absolute.</p>
                    <p>It would necessitate the formation of a special court to investiagte such
                        cases as would seem to warrant the application of the new code, and this
                        court, once formed, whould be granted the most absolute power and freedom
                        possible in dealing with such cases as it would be called upon decide</p>
                    <p>It would be impossible, or to say the least inevitable, to form any schedule
                        of crimes which would, or would not, come within the jurisdiction of the new
                        law. Each case would have to be tried on its individual cha- racteristics,
                        the previous record, associations, temperament, and even hereitary, of the
                        accused looked upon as factors in the case, and the law, if made at all
                        should be made applic able to all crime irrespective of its nature.</p>
                    <p>The habitual thier, who has perhaps never stolen goods to the value of more
                        than a few piastes at a time, and who is yet never out of prison but what he
                        is at his old work again, the confirmed drunkard, and the mob of worthless
                        idlers who hang about the street courses of our large towns, these men
                        should be equally liable to deportationas well as those who have commit ted
                        greater crimes; indeed it is with the former class that such a law would be
                        principally called upon to deal</p>
                    <p>A contemporary has affirmed that no di munition of crime would result in the
                        event of the law being brought into effect. It argues that a criminal when
                        committing a crime does so in the hope that his action will remain un
                        discovered, and that therefore the thought of deportation would hold no
                        terrors for him</p>
                    <p>It is a pity that this wonderful discovery was not made before; it would have
                        saved the nations much time and money; but even now we venture to diagree,
                        and to suggest that were man taken from his particular walk of crime and
                        deported beyond the seas, his com rades would be almost tempted to forego
                        the gains of petty thefts on which they had form erly thriven, and might
                        even seek to ward off the pange of hunger by a little wholesome work in
                        preference to taking a compulsory trip to a strange land of which they know
                        nothing</p>
                    <p>It is the ease in which this class lives that brings it its ever increasing
                        number of recruits. Prison is looked upon after a time as just one of the
                        interludes of life, unpleasant perhaps, but not half as unpleasant as
                        regular work would probably be, but remove the man from the associations of
                        his former life, place him in a spot where it is necessary to his own well
                        being that he should work, instil into his mind the fact that a relapse into
                        his former habits would but mean an extension of the time he will be forced
                        to spend in an alien land, and the change wrought would be likely to prove
                        of a lasting character, even after his return to his own country</p>
                    <p>We say that the law, put before the country on a proper basis, and with full
                        powers is a thoroughly sound one and worthy of immediate consideration.
                        Excercise the maximum amount of care in the choosing of the officals in
                        whose hands the administration of the law would lie, and we image that it
                        would, even beofre its first case had been tried, prove of benefit to the
                        country</p>

                        insinuated that "The Great Emir" is one of that class of persons, who
                        sacrfice their dignity for their pleasure and are willing to put up with end
                        less insults, which renders them contemptible in the eyes of their friends,

                    <p>"Al Moayad" believes that these insinua tions are directed against no less a
                        person than the Khedive. Kamel is severly taken to task for his audacity,
                        but the latter refuses to reply. After having quoted various sentences from
                        "Al Lewa" wherein stress is laid on the enormous expenses, which the country
                        has been put to by the Khedival family. "Al Moayard" remarks that many
                        people are repeating phrases used by Kamel, which bear a striking similarity
                        to the words attributed to Arabi Pasha in 1882</p>

                    <p>On Saturday ladt at Gabbary, beofre a large number of spectators, the 60
                        yards juniors' and 110 yeards seniors' championships of the Club were
                        decided. The juniors were represnted by the following :-- A.E.R. Ecclestone,
                        age 6 last birthday, R.F. Ecclestone, age 10 last birthday, W. Keill, age 15
                        last birthday, H. Taylor, age 14 last birthday, D. A. Hamilton, age 15 last
                        birthday, J.H. Mitchinson, age 15 last birthday.</p>
                    <p>Michinson led from the start followed close ly by Hamilton; the former
                        however gradually increased his lead and won a good race by about 7ft.
                        Keill, who was only taught to swim during the latter part of this season,
                        was 3rd, some 3yds behind Hamilton</p>
                    <p>For the seniors rcae the following lined up:-- A.A Ecclestone, F.E. Howard,
                        E. A. darton, C.E.L. Randall, P. Psycha, C.H. Lloyd, and A. Metzger. This
                        proved a most exciting and interesting struggle; the bath was lengthen ed so
                        that the competitors had to swim 3 lengths. The first four named were level
                        at the 1st length, but Howard drew away and led by about a foot from Randall
                        with Eccle stone and Dartona yard behind. The turn of the 2nd length found
                        Howard a yard in fornt, but Randall (raied from the junior section last
                        season) putting on a grand spurt drew level about 25 yards from home and
                        eventually won by a yard and a half from Howard. There was a great struggle
                        for thrid palce Darton (last year's winner) just beating Ecclestone by a
                        touch, 2 yards behind Ho ward. It has been suffering somewhat from
                        bronchitis lately, and was therefore not in his best form. After some
                        capital dives by the juniors the club team met a team of the King's Royal
                        Rifles in a 360 yards team race (each man swimming 60 yards) and won rather
                        easily by about half a length. Also a polo match took place between the
                        K.R.R and the club team. The K.R.R led at half time by one to nil, scored by
                        Newton. At the re-start two of the Club team retired, their places being
                        taken by Inglott and Martin, and the latter proving too hot for the opposing
                        team contributed 4 goals in quick succession, the other goals being scored
                        by Ecclestone (3) and Howard (2) to 1 by Newton for K.R.R</p>
                    <p>Result A.S.C 8 K.R.R 2</p>

                        <p>The sayings and doings of Mr. Winston Churchill have been the
                            all-engrossing topic of ingerest here during the past week. 1t would
                            seem as if every possible section of the eom- munity, representing every
                            phase of activity and shade of politics had been presented to him. He
                            appears, moreover, to have received the numerous deputations with
                            unvarying courtesy and, while paying careful attention to the manifold
                            addresses and speselies deliver- ed; tohave nde it 'quite clear by his
                            replies what the views of the British Government are, or what-line of
                            action he was disposed to re- commend. His utterances were reasonably
                            definite and ontapoken, and seem for that: very reason, rather more,
                            perhaps, than for the matter expressed,'to have left a good impres-
                            sion. The hope 1s generally entertained that as a result of his visita
                            cleser personal interest in Oypras affairs will now manifest itself at
                            the Colonial office in its dealings with this de pendecy</p>
                        <p>Mr. Churchill spent Friday last at Kyrenia, and was able to find time to
                            visit from there the beantiful rained monastery of Bella Pais He also
                            drove through the Nicosia bazaar ; inspected the central prison, saw the
                            artesian wall boring machinery at work, and paid a visit |to'the white
                            monastery of Kykko on the the outekirts of the town. He wasalso afford-
                            ed opportunities of bevoming personally acquainted with a few English
                            officials.</p>
                        <p>On Sunday morning (13th) he drove to Larnaca, where he was met by the
                            Acting Commiasioner and the local authorities. After discharging various
                            functions he rejoined H.M.S. "Venus," which had steamed over from
                            Famagusta to be in readiness for him. He then proceeded to Limassol.</p>
                        <p>Some of the officers of H.M.S. "Venus" came up last week for a few days'

                        <p>On such oceasions as this one fells the. need of an English local
                            newspaper. The ordinary English resident or visitor is only able to
                            glean information of what is happening in the Island either from
                            hearssy, which is mostly unre- liable, or by wading painfully through
                            the verbose col of the native press. Sach a newspaper, the "Cyprus
                            Herald," was started and carried on for a time in the early eighties,
                            but for want of support, it was 'ere long aban doned and its place has

                            Museum This committee exists for the purpose of administering the funds
                            raised during the Jubilee year with the object of erecting a museum,
                            wherein Cypriot objects of antiquity and archeological remains may find
                            a suitable resting place, and at the same time be open to public
                            inspection. A central site has been selected for the building, on land
                            given by Government, the plans have been approved and the foundations
                            are now being begun. It is intended that the building now commenced
                            shall be of modest dimensions, but so planned as to be capable of
                            extension later as circum stances may require and funds permit.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Bertrand Shadwell, of Chicago, has devoted part of his time to
                            thinking about English people, and a poem ia the result of this pleasant
                            oceupation. He composed three stanzas eight years ago; he has since been
                            prompted to add another. The result of his contemplations may be
                            gathered from the title of his verses. "There's Something in the Eng.

                        <p>Though the half of Europe hates them, and would joy in their decline, Yet
                            there's something in the English after all: They may scorn the scanty

                            after all: For they know that from the colonel to the drum mer in the

                        <p>Some weeks ago, whilst waiting near the Ramleh station for a Mex tram, I
                            observed a lady on the opposite canseway also waiting for someone or
                            something, We eventually travelled on this same tram. She was young,
                            good-look ing and well-dressed —in aword "chic." She was wearing a white
                            skirt and blouse, small and dajnty white doe-skin shoes and a black
                            straw hat trimmed with pose-coloured chiffon (I think it is termed) also
                            a chatelaine from which depended several curious silver ornaments or
                            weapons of the toilette. When the tram was slowly threading the slums of
                            Gabbari I became curioas as to her destination. After consulting her

                            my curiosity had I chosen to do so but it was, after all, no business of
                            mine, and I trust they enjoyed the sunset which was particularly fine
                            that evening. At this more modern casino, besides the attraction of
                            sea-bathing, an excel lent meal may be obtained at a moderate figure and
                            the proprietor stocks good cigars and claret. There are also I believe,

                        <p>After leaving the old Casino yesterday I wended my way between several
                            Bedouin tents to the brow of the quarry opposite, which, with its
                            lime-kilns and blasting operations, is a hive of industry. To the left,
                            under the lee of the cliff, some of the Army of Occupation are encamped
                            in their usual summer quacters, than which none could be healthier. In
                            front stretches the great Salt Lake from which the concessionaires have
                            recently, in a few weeks, extracted over 50,000 tons of salt. The lake
                            appears to be about 1 3/4 miles across at this point and extends some 19
                            miles in a S.W. direction. The surface bears the appearance of a sheet
                            of ice on which snow has partially melted and frozen again. To those in
                            search of novelty I would suggest,</p>

                            concessionaires. I could imagine nothing more delightful than a spin
                            over the lake in the moonlight, there being no obstacles to bar the way.
                            Writing of moter cars and obstacles reminds me of the clas sifieation

                    <p>BEYOND THE CITY GATES.</p>
                    <p>By Artuur Delany</p>
                    <p>The bustle of the town becomes appalling at times; the gilt nauseous; then in
                        a modern train—with primitive instincts, we leayg the "idly busy" world of
                        Cairo, and allow the green fields to envelope us with no parting regret.</p>
                    <p>Peeping above the trees, the sails of Arab dhows apon the Nile are seen, and
                        through fields of maize and cotton we pursue our way. The minarets of the
                        numerous mosques gradu ally disappear from view, except the two, lofty and
                        elegant, that guard the mosque of Mehe- met Ali, and are still to be seen
                        against the old Mokattams long after the other works of man have been hidden
                        by nature.</p>
                    <p>The length of the journey is sufficient to permit ns to moralise upon the
                        city left behind, and what is the mental picture? We find that, as with
                        other great cities, where life holds a strange incongraous mixture, from
                        which men of all tastes can be satisfied in the observance of men and their
                        ways, so it is with Cairo, but there is, however, in Egypt's capital the
                        addi- tion of many races to supplement the study of humanity.</p>
                    <p>We may see the ostentatious finery of some gilded youth, and the loose
                        flowing galabieh that partly hides, the slouch of the native There, is the
                        pantomime of life. The leer of the sensnalist ; the unstained beauty of the
                        child. The hard look of the money-grubber ; the contented face of the man,
                        who, by his gabardine, tells us the follies of this earth have been
                        renounced. All are there! Pursuing their different courses tending either to
                        good, or evil</p>
                    <p>"East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet"- bat they
                        nearly do in Cairo. The Occident, however, is winning a victory. and the
                        Orient must succamb. For the moment the blend is adulterated. As grandeur
                        rashes by resplendant in the modera lanary of the latest automobile, a
                        native omnibus pursues the even tenor of its way drawn by animals fast
                        approaching the stage, if they have not already reached it, which terminates
                        in beef-essence. Nowhere is the sublime so neatly allied to the ridiculous,
                        as in Cairo.</p>
                    <p>But we mast stop moralising, and leave the city behind, for Matarieh bas been
                        reached — "the place belonging to the sun." Near by is old Heliopolis, that
                        was before Abraham, and the eternalpyramids,—"the city of thé sun"— and thus
                        Matarieh derived its name.</p>
                    <p>Evading the donkey boys, which requires as much skill as would bring an army
                        to victory, we break from the human tracks. The extent of force which
                        environment has upon character is amply felt here. Where everything speaks
                        of peace we feel perforce that we must be at peace with the world. There is
                        no sonnd save that made by the birds, who apparently are no less happy than
                        ourselves. Through an avenue of sycamore, orange, palm, and banana trees we
                        pass into the open, where further progress is stayed by the approach of an
                        old friend. He is the loeal guide, and on our original visit told more
                        untruths regarding the traditions of Matarieh, than we have since learned of
                        the actual truth We always havea chat, because philosophy bubbles over in
                        bim. Kant, Sehel- ling, or Bacon, would perhaps, have blushed at Arab
                        philosophy, but to us it is as "caviare to the General." Our friend's left
                        eye showed unmistakeable signs of having been tampered with ; in fect ; it
                        was in a state of disrepair. It exhausted a lot of persuasive power to learn
                        that he had lost the day (and, incidently, nearly his,eye) in a quarrel, but
                        the inherent philosophy ot his kind did not forsake him, and readily wonld
                        the subject have been disinis- sed by the Arabic word, which is equivalent
                        to "never mind" in our language, had we not suggested that the damaged eye
                        looked as if it would be closed for along time. This afforded him an
                        opportunity, and with an almost im perceptible wink in the other, he
                        remarked "Yea, but it will reopen again for the tourist season."</p>
                    <p>Speaking of Arabian philosophy calls to mind that ofan Arab chieftain, one of
                        the most powerfal of the prinoes of the desert, who, for the first time,
                        beheld a steamship. Much at tention was paid to him, and every facility
                        affomded for sis inspestion of every part of the vessel What- impression the
                        sight made upon him it was impossible to judge ; no indications of surprise
                        escaped him; every muscle pre served its wonted calmnéss of expression ; and
                        on quitting he merely observed. "It is well bat you have not brought a man
                        to life yet."</p>
                    <p>Let us retarn from this digression Matarieh is an absorbing place to those
                        who permit tradition to pass unquestioned, but</p>
                    <p>"Who shall decide, when dootors disagree" "And soundest casuists duubt, like
                        you, and me"</p>
                    <p>The tale of our friend, the guide, to en thusiastic Americans, who gaze at
                        the historic tree which is supposed to have sheltered the Virgin and Child
                        aftet their flight into Egypt, now protected by railings from the Yankee
                        penknife, differs considerably from the in formation to be obtained from the
                        Synaxaires of the Copts, — very old works. And there.is a divergence of
                        opinion among writers, old and modern, as to thetrath ofthe current
                        traditions, and whether Old Cairo, as it is now called, or Matarieh, had the
                        honour of harbouring the Virgin and Child during the two years they lived in
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>Formerly, the garden, in which one may be- hold interesting biblical
                        monoments, was known aa the "Jardin de Baume." but the balm has !ong sinee
                        disappeared. The opinion of the time was, that the plant would not grow
                        without the aid of water from the neigh- boaring well, supposed to be
                        miraculous as being the bathing: place of the infant Child.</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>Whatever there may beinthe trailitions of Matarieh, the fact remains they are
                        strengthen- ed by constant reference through the course of successive
                        centuries ; so we must not be too sceptical, but leave "the place belonging

                    <p>DEAR MR. SPICER- The work of which you s send me phots is certainly of very
                        high quality and I have rarely seen Heads mounted with such skill and
                        finish. Only an Artist could bestow the amount of care and modelling which
                        appear in the face of Deer, and in your work you are so highly successful
                        there is little left to be desired. Yours very truly, J.R Hillats</p>

                    <p>(Aujourd'hui à midì)</p>
                    <p>Toute l'attention de notre marché a été con centreé, comme hier, sur le
                        Comptoir Finan cier et Commercial (Campos). On évalue à environ un millier
                        le nombre de titres qui ont changv de mains. C'est le Caire quivend, ainsi
                        que le démonstre l'activité des arbitra gistes, et sur norte place c'est
                        principalement la petite spéculation qui achéte, sur le bruit que la
                        prochaine assemblée de la société en tendrait un rapport des plus
                        satisfaisants. Grâce à l'absorption rapide des petits paquets mis en vente,
                        le prix a progressé de 2 29/32 à 3 1/8 l'ancienne action, de 2 31/32 à 3
                        3/16 la nouvelle et de 2 à 2 1 8 la part de fonda teur. Il a été vendu aux
                        enchéres publiques 25 actions anciennes au prix de 3 1/32.</p>
                    <p>Des transaction ont été également effec tuées, mais en quantité et nombre
                        insigni fiants, sur la National Bank. Ces derniers, étant offerts, ont
                        fléchi de 9/16 à 1/2. La National Bank béneficie de 1/16 à 21 13/16;
                        l'Agricole reste stationaire à 8 1/4; et la Delta Land est un peu plus
                        faible à 1 7/16.</p>
                    <p>Toujours sur la rumeur d'un bon coupon, l'Ordinary Khedivial Mail a été
                        recherchve durant toute la matinée, mais sans veudeurs. Le cours a monté de
                        ce chef de 22/6 à 23/3. Vers la fin les Nungovich Hotels ont été l'ob jet
                        d'une poussée de 16 3/4 à 17 3/8, sans qu'il y ait-eu d'échanges. Au
                        contraire, de offres ont ramené encore la Béhéra de 23 1/4 à 23.</p>
                    <p>C'est &amp; peu prés tout ce que la séance de ce matin a offert de saillant.
                        Comme on le voit, les affaires, excepts en Comptoir, ont été pres- que
                        nulles. Aussi led fluctuations de la cote n'ont-elles pas eu d'envergure</p>
                    <p>A part celles déjà signaleées, les Privilégiées Tramways rétrogradent de 141
                        à 140, les Jouissance Eaux du Caire de 192 à 190, la Daïra de 13 5/8 à 13
                        1/2, les Markets de 26/- 25/6, la Salt &amp; Soda de 18/- 4 17/9, Aboukir de
                        28/6 &amp; 28/-, et la fondateur Allotment de 60 &amp; 58 P.T., tandis que
                        l'Obligation nouvelle Crédit Foncier avance de 253 à 253 1/2, et l'Union
                        Foncitte de 4 8/4 &amp; 4 13/16.</p>
                    <p>Sur le reste de la cote, il n'y a pas de change- ment à signaler. La tendapce
                        est indécise, car on ne peat considérer l'activité circonscrite an Comptior
                        comme l'indice d'une amélioration générale. L'ensemble de la spéculation
                        reste sur ses positions, dan l'attente d'une direction venant des places
                        dirigeantes, ou malheureuse ment la baisse des valeurs américanes exerce la
                        plus pernicieuse influence. De plus, le taux privé d'escompte vient d'étre
                        élevé en Angle terre à 4 1/2%. Bien que ec soit là un événe ment préyu pour
                        la saison, il a néanmoins un certain effet déprimant, lorqu'il est accom
                        pagné d'autres circonstances.</p>

                    <p>Au Stock-Exchange, le Consolidé anglais a haussé hier de 1/8 à 88 3/8.
                        L'Unifiée a été ferme à 102 3/4. La National Bank et l'Agricole ont été
                        soutenues à 22 et 8 3/8 respectivement. La Daira s'est maintenue à 13 3/4 et

                        &amp; 168.</p>
                    <p>Ici, ainsi nots le faisions remarquer heir, le marché parait s'orienter vers
                        une légtre repreise, et la néance d'aujourd'hui peut étre taxée sans
                        exagération de séance de consolida tion. En effet, l'ouverture a été
                        relativement animée at si peu aprés le salme s'est rétabli, la cloture a
                        enregistré néanmoins un raffermisse ment sur nombre de valuers. Les
                        transactions ont égalament montré un léger progrés, ce qui donne à penser
                        que les liquidaations intempes tives de ces derniers jours s'arrétant le
                        marché pourreit facilement prendre une allure haus siére. Cels n'aurait, du
                        reste, rien d'excessif pour certains titres, vu l'état prospére de leur
                        affaires</p>
                    <p>Dans le compartiement de Banques, la Na tional Bank garde non cours d'heir à

                        118-119. La Cassa diSconto reprend 2 francs à 50-51. Le Comptoir Finan cier
                        et Commercial se reléve à 2 15/16-3. Les H. de Vries and Boutigny Ltd./ ont
                        un fort courant de transactions qui les fait cloturer trés demandées à un
                        cours légérement supérieur à celui d'hier.</p>
                    <p>La Daira Sanieh recule à 13 1/2-9/16. Le Crédit Foncier Egyptien se raffermit
                        à 690, son obligation ancienne es demandée à 297-298 tandis que la nouvelle
                        est plutot offerte à 253. La Béhéra rétrograde à 23 1/4 et son obliga tion à

                        dissait la-bas que le Groupe Harriman allait congédier 20,000 employés de
                        ses lignes et se voyait forcé d'adopter d'austres grandes économies. On
                        trouve étonnant que la Haute Banque n'ait pas mieux cherché a sou tenir la
                        cote, et un éminent critique financier estime que la situation peut devenir
                        bien grave, si l'on n'organise pas immédiatement au soutien énergique; il
                        ajoute que les conditions présentes se prétent a de sérieux troubles, ce qui

                        more prominent being sleeplessness, sense of prostration or weariness,
                        depression of spirits and want of energy for all the ordinary affairs of
                        life. Now, what alone is absolutely essential in all such cases is increased

                        conditions, in either sex; and it is difficult to imagine a case of disease
                        or derangement, whose main features are those of debility, that will not be
                        speedily and permanently benefited by this never-failing recuperative
                        essence, which is destined to cast into oblivion everything that had
                        preceded it for this wide-spread and numerous class of human ailments.</p>
