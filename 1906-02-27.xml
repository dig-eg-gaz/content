                    <head>Turks and Germans</head>
                    <p>We gather that there are no German officers at Akaba, and should like to
                        remind our correspondent who questione us and our readers on this point,
                        that the number of German officers employed in the Turkish army is very
                        small, and that the Ottoman Government has never given any high comman in
                        the field to offiers of foreign armies since the Russo-Turkish was General
                        von der Goltz and other distinguished German officers have been members of
                        teh General Staff and in that capacity have drawn up plans of campaign,
                        schemes for mobilisation, and proposals for strategic railways, which ahve
                        been adopted or pigeon-holed according to the humour of their employers. But
                        their functions have been almost entirely advisoray and their advice has
                        often been followed. If a large number of Geramn officers held executive
                        commands in the Ottoman army that would doubtless be an even more formidable
                        opponent than it now is, but it is doubtful whether, pace Major von
                        Bruchausen, the Padishah will choose to fall in with all the suggestions
                        that Berlin has to offer. In our opinion, the Turkish Governement has acted
                        on its own initiative in the Akaba affair, as it acted last year on the Aden
                        frontier. It does not wish to quarrel with Egyot and Great Britain, but it
                        cannot resist the opportunity of trying to extend its boundaries by a few
                        square miles, even though they consist of "very light soil." </p>

                    <p>The pupils of the School of Law have struck, and we are threatened, so it is
                        stated with strikes by pupils of the School of Medicine and the Polytechnic,
                        who appear anxious to risk their careers over questions that concern them
                        most remotely, if at all. Meantime, the Governemnt has declared that the
                        courses at the Law School will not reopen till Saturday next, and that if
                        the strikers continue to be defiant they will be exlcuded for good from the
                        School of Law, which will then be closed to await the arrival of a newer and
                        wiser generation. The complaints of the pupils will, we are sure, be
                        examined by the Governement if properly and respectfully brought before the
                        authorities. General strikes by persons of teh strike us as being silly

                    <byline>(From our special correspondent)</byline>
                    <dateline> Constantinople , Feb 20.</dateline>
                    <p>According to th« Tnrkisb version, of the Akaba affair, wbi h I »’cho with all
                        uecessary reserve,when the matter was mentioned to the Khedive his H ghness
                        professed* his complete ignorance of the incident. \ </p>
                    <p> The Turkish apology, that the yr,usha>hi of the battalion had mis-speD hi*
                        written orders is on a par with the aforesaid version ; exoei t that it is
                        ingenious. It is a method that the Bawab-Aali often employs in conrexion
                        with doonments legalizing property belonging, say, to some unhappy rayah.
                        Bnt applied to diplomacy, it is not so effectual in concealing frand.
                        Moreover, precedent on the borders of Aden and, recently, of Pers;a, tend to
                        show that Turkey's policy regarding international landmarks is a trifle
                        hazy. </p>
                    <p> The incident has raised considerable comment. at d there is nothing else but
                        ’he oocnpa tion of Akaba by Turks baing talked aboat.the Stambonl public
                        being totally oblivions of the faot that the said port, of Salomonic fame,
                        has had a Turki-h garrison sine? the ratification of the Firman of Wij, and
                        that it is Tabah, an insignificant townlet, 8 miles to the we-t of the line
                        of de marcation, which has been ho onred by the pre-ence of a century of the
                        Soltan’s military ’atterdemalions. Perhaps ignorance is bliss when
                        international landmarks are concerned. </p>
                    <p> However, it is nevertheless interesting to determine why Turkey f-hould be
                        so provocative just now. Some say that the intrigue is a oonnter-move to the
                        opening of Port Sudan, whioh will increase Arglo-Egyptian inflaenoe on the
                        Red Sea. Others that she seeks an ont- po^ on the Sinaitio Peninsnla for
                        Akaba. whose strategical value will be greatly enhanced with the completion
                        of the H djie Railway. While the third hypothecs, which I prefer, is that
                        Turkey has done this to secure some con oesBioti against her eventual
                        withdrawal from territory which she describes as being under the private
                        administration of the Khedive. </p>
                    <p> (FROM OUR COR*ESPONDENNT). </p>
                    <p> Pera, February 20. </p>
                    <p> The CO’ fl ct between England at d the Porte regarding the ; kaba territory
                        is taking a very 8*riot8 torn. E iglai d has sent a Note to Tor- y
                        intimating a naval demonstration in the Red Sea, in front of the Sinai
                        Peninsula. The Note was handed to the Porte on the 12th inst. The Porte
                        still rejects the delimitation of frontiers at the point of Akaba, between
                        Egypt and Syria, whioh is a«ked for by E gland. In his last interview with
                        Sir Nioholas O’Oonor, British Ambassador, Te»fik Pachs, Minister for Foreign
                        Aff rirs, is said to have declined to enter into any discns8:on, on the
                        ground that there was not even any need to consider the question, Syria and
                        Egypt forming an integral pvrt of the Ottoman Empire. The Turkish population
                        here is g eatly exoited over the conflict between the Porte and Great
                        Britain. </p>

                        <p>In consequence of the growth of the tr«td$ and the increase of the wealth
                            in Egypt, and the consequent raising of the standard of living among all
                            classes, and the steady inorease in the-population, the bailding
                            industry in Egypt has been extraprdioarilymotive within recent years;
                            and it is reasonable to sppose that the activity will be at least well
                            maintaned, if not increased; in the future. Engineering and, building
                            operations of all kinds are in progress throughout the country. Large
                            sums of money are to be expended on public works. Private houses, flats
                            and offices are on all sides being erected, and the demand for such
                            buldings is ever increasing. </p>
                        <p>The following is an extract from the note by the Financial Advisor on the
                            Budget for 1906:-- </p>
                        <p> • Roughly apealtiug, it- may bo said that Egypt is actually spending
                            troin L.E. 300,0X1 to L. E. 400,000 Annually on public buildings ; not,
                            I think, an extravagant sum, haying toward to the revenue of the country
                            and the fact that everything has to be provided ab initio, hospitals,
                            post offices, prisomiTasydums, schools, police stations, to icy nothing
                            ot Gouvernorats, and other Government buildings of practically every
                            description. \ •</p>
                        <p>“Of course is the above figures are not inoliiaed groat works of publio
                            utility of a remunerative nature, which are charged to Reserve Fund." 1
                            , t </p>
                        <p> With the working capital at its command, the Company will be in a
                            position to take full advantage of the increasing prosperity of the
                            country, and to undertake engineering and building contracts of the
                            largest kind. Hitherto it has been found that where any works of
                            magnitude have beon executed in Egypt, the preponderance of oontraots
                            has bean seoUred by European firms. As regards the erection of
                            buildings, as distinguished from other works, the Company will be in the
                            favourable position of being able to oomplete them from basement to
                            roof, including their equipment throughout with eleotrioal and sanitary
                            appliances ; thus the profits on minor contracts can be secured to the
                            Company. There is a great demand for small residential houses in Cviro
                            aud Alexandria, and a wide field is open to the Company to ereot small
                            houses in suitable localities, according to the plans aud requirements
                            of purchasers, and to have the cost of erection seoured by Mortgages
                            payable in instalments, with the usual interest thereon, extending over
                            a period to suit the convenience of clients. .</p>
                        <p> The Company will in the first instanoe acquire aud amalgamate the
                            businesses carried on by the well-known firms of Engineers, Contractors
                            and Builders, Messrs. MoClure Dorling, of Alexandria, and Messrs. Q. L.

                        Lecture.</head>
                    <p>Prof. Flinders Petrie gave the second of his leotnrea on Egyptian Art at the
                        Continental Hotel, Cairo, yesterday afternoon. The snbjeot was that of the
                        age of Conscions or S.hdastio Art in the Xllth and XVIIIth dynasties. Alter
                        the decay of the art of the pyramid builders, which continued till the me of
                        the Xlth dynasty, a new feeling arose based on oarefal study and restrained
                        expression. The statuary is rather hard and wiry but vigorous : the relief
                        sculpture is low and fall of delicate detail in the surface*. In the Xllth
                        dynasty this became more businesslike in the handling of it, but at the same
                        time formalised. The excellence in taMe and gradual decline during the Xllth
                        dynasty is well shewn by the splendid inlaid pectorals from Dahshur in the
                        Cairo Museum. In the XHIth dynasty the work was still pood, and thesoulpture
                        well maintained; but the style is weak and timid. The question of whether we
                        have any Hyksos portraits is very doubtful ; the figures with names of those
                        kings may be all la*e appropriations of older works and certainly their
                        style has no affinity with what came before or after. In the XVIIIth
                        dynasty, very stiff and formal work prevailed at first, bat gradually
                        softened and became more life like under the Thothme* kings So far, the old
                        traditions of the Xllth dynasty had been carried on. Bat the immense infl
                        lencss of Syria, brought in by the conquests of Thothmes III.,
                        revolutionised Egyptian taste : and soon after the powerful style of
                        prehistoric Greece led to new experiments in Egypt. The heads of Queen Thyi
                        are the most vital and refined sculptures known, since the earliest days of
                        the kingdom. The large growth of the middle classes in the XVIIIth dynasty
                        led to a popularity of small artistic objeots of the toilet and genre work.
                        The tastefal and delicate fi ores of girls are a special (development 6f
                        thi* age ; the most perfect of such being the little figure of a negress
                        oirved in ebony, found a few yjars ago at Thebes. The portrait heads carved
                        in wood at this period are also excellent in the modelling and power of
                        character. In drawing, the Egyptians had an extraordinary facility for fine
                        and powerful line. The perfect firmness and artistic truth of the long
                        outlines of limbs, or even whole figures, is unrivalled by any modern
                        school. The be*t examples are seen in Foma of the unfinished tombs and in
                        pome smaller pieces such as a clever figure of a perf inning girl, now at
                        Turin. The new ideas of Syria and Greece had practically killed the native
                        growth of Egypt. After the artistic intoxication of the new wine there was
                        only left an imitation cf the older models. Under Sety I at Abydos is seen a
                        most laborious and highly finished style which has lost all originality. And
                        even the cold gracs of this disappears under IUma8es the Great^of whom there
                        is bat one single work of genius, the black granite figure in Tarin.
                        Henceforward there was nothing but mere imitation, such as has been
                        described in the lecture of last wrek. </p>

                        of the fiueat period, that of the pyramid builders. </p>

                    <p>The lectures delivered by M. Edouard Naville at the College France, under th«
                        Fondation Miohonis, were well attended, and derived peoabar interest from
                        the fact that the lecturer was the first foreigner who h*s been admitted to
                        hold forth within the walls conseoratei to learning by Franois I He choee M
                        his subject the religion of ancient Egypt. His idea of the origin of what we
                        call the Egyptian civilization is that Egypt was inhabited in Nsolitbio
                        times by a white race, the ancestors of the classical Libyans and modern
                        Berbers, who were arohers living in wicker huts, aDd had for domesticated
                        animals fhe deer aud the ««t.ich. These were the “Ancr” or “Teheunu” who as
                        early as the Fifth Dynasty occupied Darfur and Kordofan, and the only hint
                        we get of their religion is contained in the standard panted within the
                        stockade cf the village which perhaps formed the totem of the tribe. The
                        race, in M. Naville’s opinion, was corquered by Menes and his followers, who
                        came from Punt, or Somaliland, by way ot South Arabia and Abyssinia. He does
                        not think that the culture of the conqaerore owed anything to Mesopotamia,
                        but holds that it included writing and building with bricks. As to their
                        religion, each invading tribe had a totem, that of the royal tribe being a
                        falcon, the emblem of Horns, with whom the king was always identified. They
                        also believed in existence of a double or , immaterial counterpart, of whioh
                        the fan carried behind the monarch was the emblem and even under the Thinite
                        dynasties tbeir religion had become anthropomorphio. The lectures frill be
                        published, it is hoped, consecutively in the R*vue del'Histoire des fteli-
                        yrm, where the inaugural one has just appeared, and later will form part of
                        one of the publications of the Masfee Gaimet.</p>

                        <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>

                        <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers
                            the accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by
                            which they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange
                            them as accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that
                            none of them are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home
                            there are several things to be considered. To begin with there is the
                            difference in climate between Egypt and the various points at which you
                            may arrive in Europe.</p>

                        <cb n="2"/>

                        <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                            January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so
                            warm as Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more
                            uniformly warm than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt
                            far too early in the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is
                            perfect. The warmest place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>

                        <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent
                            at sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on
                            each of the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of
                            Europe.</p>

                        <cb n="3"/>

                        <p>They are as follows:-</p>

                        <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth,
                            Southhampton, London or Liverpool—occupy about 4 days. The short ones
                            are as follows:—</p>

                        <cb n="4"/>

                        <p>The steamers, of the P.andamp;O. North German Lloyd, Orient and
                            Messageriea Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and
                            Bibby Lines are also excellent, and their steamers are largely
                            patronised by travellers to Egypt.</p>

                        <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to
                            Alexandria, without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made
                            without change in 4 1/2 hours.</p>

                        <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                            Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German
                            Levant line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>

                        <cb n="5"/>

                        <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by
                            P.andamp;O. Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd
                            Trieste Vienna express from Alexandria.</p>

                        <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little
                            luggage is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several
                            good and responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed
                            charge to deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>

                        <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by
                            the fast Mail Steamers “Osiris" and “Isis” to Brindisi. One of these
                            leaves port Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the
                            Indian <cb n="6"/>mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>

                        <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                            attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats"
                            having been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to
                            Brindisi. If you are going straight through to England you will find the
                            train waiting at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without
                            changing. It has complete arrangements for sleeping and eating on board,
                            and you should arrive in London on the fifth day from leaving Port
                            Said.</p>

                        <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.’s steamers
                            which leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to
                            TAORMENA, one of the most charming and popular places on the island.
                            Giardini is the station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina
                            is most delightful, occupying about one hour. In and around the town is
                            much to interest the visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but
                            restored under the Romans. CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent
                            of Etna and here also is a fine Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and
                            Saracenic remains that are found all over the island, are an endless
                            sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting history, having been a
                            Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C. 413, and taken by
                            the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb is to be
                            seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                            about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                            delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city.
                            The Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of
                            S. Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The
                            Cathedral, Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also
                            worth a visit.</p>

                        <head>CENTRAL ITALY.</head>

                        <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every
                            Wednesday during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3
                            days.</p>

                        <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino
                            Co.’s steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave
                            it without wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely
                            places on its bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that
                            takes you to Sorrento [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>

                        <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can
                            will devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and
                            interesting portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are
                            too well-known to need comment here.</p>

                        <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five
                            hours brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent
                            admiring the City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence
                            itself the churches and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the
                            local promenades and excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is
                            the most attractive and fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the
                            Viale dei Colli, one of the finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago,
                            goes winding up through the hills a distance of four miles. The most
                            delightful excursion outside Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its
                            Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea level. This is made first by ordinary
                            train from Florence to St. Ellero, thence by cog-wheel railway to
                            Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks takes an hour, and most
                            striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>

                        <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; hero there is a
                            fine Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night
                            should if possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile
                            at sunset.</p>

                        <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near
                            Pisa and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient

                        <head>NORTHERN ITALY</head>

                        <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy,
                            with the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European
                            cities and a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and
                            deliciously cool breezes from the surrounding mountains and the
                            Mediterranean in summer.</p>

                        <p>The patriarchal home of Italy’s most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                            gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings,
                            are a constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn
                            in Genoa. Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches
                            containing exquisite marble columns and historical paintings, and the
                            incomparable Campo Santo filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>

                        <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>

                        <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                            Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful
                            windows illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and
                            the monumental cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>

                        <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                            SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal
                            springs, change trains at Borgo San Donino and in half-an-hour you are
                            at Salsomaggiore.</p>

                        <head>NORTHERN ITALY (Continued) and The ITALIAN LAKES.</head>

                        <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                            delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                            vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage
                            or bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every
                            turn. The approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any
                            other sea port. The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of
                            the sea, no hills behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of
                            Campaniles appear above the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering
                            town rises like a fairy mirage out of the calm lagoon.</p>

                        <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                            lakes.</p>

                        <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in
                            one-and-a-quarter hours by train by way of Monza :</p>

                        <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is
                            very beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                            enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo,
                            Cadenabbia, and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio
                            opposite. The walk from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio
                            is most enjoyable. A steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake
                            Lugano in three-quarters of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in
                            two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                        <p>Switzerland, the heart of Europe, has been described as "A cluster of
                            delights and grandeurs."</p>

                        <p>LUGANO is some 20 miles from Como and reached by train in one-and-a-half
                            hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated
                            on the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M.
                            San Salvatore, M. de Caprino.and M. Generoso.</p>

                        <p>LOCARNO, may be reached by rail from Bellinzona in forty minutes. This
                            pretty town, situated at the top of lake Maggiore has a mild climate and
                            is an excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated
                            above the town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings,
                            “Entombment," by Ciseri, and ‘Tho Flight into Egypt,” by Bramantion.</p>

                        <p>LUCERNE—A striking picture on the Lake of Lucerne facing the Rigi and
                            Pilatus and the snow-clad Alps.</p>

                        <p>In and around the town the walks are charming, and the excursions to be
                            made from Lucerne by boat, rail, etc., are very numerous.</p>

                        <p>The Lake of Lucerne abounds in delightful excursions, those to the Rigi,
                            Pilatus, Burgenstock and Sonnenberg needing a special visit each. Other
                            excursions on the lake can be made by steamer, and the ever-changing
                            scenery on the trip from Lucerne, to Fluelen is a source of delight to
                            the lover of nature.</p>

                        <p>BRUNNEN, charmingly situated on the most beautiful part of the Lake of
                            Lucerne, commands magnificent views of lake and mountain scenery. Along
                            the Lake of Uri from Brunnen to Fluelen runs the famous Axentrasse</p>

                        <p>A delightful exeption from Lucerne is that to ENGELBERG. Take boat to
                            Stansstad and from Stansstad it is about 1 hour and 40 min. by Electric
                            Railway, with delightful scenery en route. The ascent of Titlis, is made
                            from here, and the panoramic view of the Alps is grand; extending from
                            Monte Rosa to the Black Forest, and from the Santis to the
                            Matterhorn.</p>

                        <p>THE BERNESE OBERHAND.-INTERLAKEN a favourite summer resort and the best
                            centre for making excursions in the Oberland, abounding in fine walks
