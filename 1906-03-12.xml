                <div type="item"><head>DOMESTIC ECONOMY IN CYPRUS.</head>
                    <p>It is a common but very erroneous supposition that Cyprus is a happy land
                        where all the ordinary needs of the body are to be had almost without money
                        and without price, and where an ample and comfortable standard of living is
                        compatible with a very low rate of expenditure. Previous to the British
                        Occupation this, no doubt, was true enough, and British officials then
                        residing there, and in receipt of ordinary rates of pay, must have found it
                        possible to live well within their official incomes. Even now the standard
                        of living among the native Cypriots remains very largely what it always was,
                        and, with the exception of some few who have travelled or resided abroad and
                        have acquired Western ideas, the domestic economy of the average native is
                        on a far humbler scale than that of the same class"in European countries.
                        The fact that prices of household commodities have risen does not materially
                        affect, therefore, the Cypriot. It should be understood that the bulk of the
                        Cypriots are either agricultural producers or merchants, and even the few
                        professional men are also mostly owners of chiftliks, and therefore all
                        classes of the native community are more or less directly benefited by an
                        increase in the price of locally raised commodities.</p> <p>This rise in the prices of articles of local production, while directly benefiting the native
                        producer and merchant, is a very serious matter indeed to the unfortunate
                        British offi­ </p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p>cial, to whose altruistic labours in the past this improvement in trade, with
                        its accompanying advance in market values, is principally due. Cyprus has
                        come to be regarded by British officials in other colonies as a veritable
                        Paradise towards which they cast longing eyes, and in which they are willing
                        to accept service at half the rate of pay which obtains in other parts of
                        the Empire. It may be a kindness to them to point out that this is entirely
                        a fiction. Those residents with fixed incomes, such as officials dependent
                        on their pay, have a most anxious and difficult task in making both ends
                        meet There is probably no Crown Colony in which the pay of Government
                        officials is on so low a scale, and yet what are the ruling prices to-day of
                        some of the leading articles of consumption ? For the benefit of those
                        unacquainted with the local coinage the English equivalent is given:—(the
                        oke equals 2 4/5 lbs.) Beef 1s. 4d. per oke ; mutton 1s.</p>
                    <p>6 1/2d. per oke; eggs three for 1 1/4d.; wood and fuel, unchopped, 7s. per
                        donkey load, chopping 1s. extra; butter 2s. 3d. to 2s. 8d. per lb.;
                        servants’ wages: cooks £2 to £3 per month; houseboys 30s. to 50s. per month,
                        exclusive of food which is always supplied to them. House rent ranges from
                        £25 to £60 per annum; scarcely a house can be found outside the town for
                        less than £30 p.a., and for sanitary reasons most English object to living
                        within the city walls. The above prices may not appear' high to those
                        accustomed to European prioes, and with incomes commensurate to a higher
                        rate of living, but they are considerably higher than they were at the time
                        the present rate of official salaries was fixed, and not only so but for
                        purposes of comparison the quality of the goods must be taken into account.
                        Good meat is rarely obtainable, and the botchers have no knowledge of their
                        work. Beef is rot often to be found at all, and is usually so tough (the
                        carcases of worn-out draught animals) as to be barely eatable. At this
                        season lamb is sold as mutton, and the joints, which are minute, oonsist of
                        bone and gristle, all of which is charged for at full rates. The lambs are
                        killed so young that they have no flesh on their bones whatever.</p>
                    <p>As regards domestio servants, many of the older ones are well acquainted with
                        their work, but the younger servants who have everything to learn are
                        certainly dear at the price, and with increasing values all round the
                        tendency is for their wages to be raised. To put the case moderately it is
                        just possible for an Englishman and his Wife to live in reasonable comfort
                        on an income of £225 a year. This presupposes constant care and vigilance on
                        the part of the housewife, and that she is sufficiently acquainted with the
                        language and with the many arts and dodges of the wily native, not to be
                        imposed upon by her servants and tradespeople; a condition of things which
                        is naturally rarely met with. This allows no margin whatever for sickness,
                        or for travelling expenses to and from England on leave of absence, and
                        certainly allows no opportunity of saving, such as every official should be
                        able to do. It may be added that a large number of official posts in Cyprus
                        of good status worth from £500 to £800 a year elsewhere and held by English
                        gentlemen accustomed to the ordinary standard of living which obtains in
                        England, carry salaries ranging only from £150 to £300 per annum.</p>
                    <p>It should be stated that the cost of living is many times greater than it was
                        in the early lays ot the occupation, after the first rush had subsided, when
                        day labour was obtainable at 2 1/2 piastres (3d.) a day, instead of 1s. a
                        day as now, and when meat was at 3 to 5 piastres (4d. to 6 1/2d.) an oke.
                        The enhanced prioes betoken the development of the trade of the country, but
                        it surely must be time for the salaries of the unfortunate officials to be
                        reconsidered, as has lately been done here in Egypt</p>
                    <p>From the foregoing it will be seen that while living may still be regarded as
                        cheap in that Island for those whose inoomes are from, say, £400 upwards, it
                        is quite the reverse for those who, transplanted from countries where the
                        standard of living whioh they have been born and bred in is high, now find
                        themselves in positions of trust and responsibility and onerous work and in
                        receipt of salaries inadequate to meet the necessary claims upon them.</p>

                    <p>AN ULTIMATUM.</p>
                    <p>THREAT OF ANOTHER STRIKE. </p>
                    <p>We regret to hear that the pupils of the Khedivial Law School have not
                        profited by their recent experiences. An ultimatum was sent to the Ministry
                        of Public Instruction last week demanding the reinstatement of the four
                        expelled pupils and threatening another strike if the Ministry refused to
                        comply. The demand, was refused by the Ministry and the official reply read
                        to the students, who made no demonstration.</p>
                    <p>It is to be hoped that they will have the sense to see that any farther
                        outbreaks must lead to the dosing of the Law School and to the permanent
                        injury of their careers. We should like to point out to those of them who
                        are not above taking European advice that their guides have not been
                        ge­nuine educational reformers, but political wire-pullers whom—in a fatal
                        moment for themselves—they allowed to take over the direction of the
                        movement. Is it worth their while to handicap themselves and inflict great
                        inconvenience on their parents to enable Mustapha Pacha Kamel to pose as the
                        leader of the Egyptian youth? But perhaps that energetic patriot has
                        promised them all places as printer’s devils and proof-readers in the office
                        of the "Lewa.”</p>

                    <p>We are still in the dark about the frontier. The Turkish troops, despite the
                        assurances of the home Press, are still in possession of Tabah and the Nekb
                        el-Akaba, the Turkish delegates. Miralai Muzaffer Bey and Bimbashi Fehmi,
                        have departed without a word, and we hear that one of the Egyptian delegates
                        is now mournfully surveying a complete camping outfit which he acquired on

                        The Diana remains off Akaba, and Mr. Bramley awaits events at Nakhl.
                        Meantime the probability of an increase in the Turkish forces on the
                        frontier grows greater day by day, and with it the necessity of a complete
                        delimitation of the frontier which will prevent the recurrence of similar
                        incidents.</p>

                    <p>THE APPEAL CASE.</p>
                    <p>PLEADINGS FOR THE CONCORDAT. </p>
                    <p>This morning, the appeal of the Societe des Sucreries et de la Ruffinerie
                        d’Egypte came on for hearing before the First Chamber of the Mixed Appeal
                        Court, under the presidency of Judge de Korizmics. Maitre Carton de Wiart
                        opened the ease with a masterly review of the whole history of the affair.
                        He began with the efforts of Ismail Pacha to encourage the cultivation of
                        the sugar cane in Egypt and dealt with the history of the rise and
                        development of the Company, the suicide and bank­ruptcy of M. Cronier, and
                        the subsequent crisis, with the details of which our readers are well
                        acquainted. The eminent counsel went on to show that if the bankruptcy had
                        been declared at the time of the Cronier crash, the Daira Sugar Corporation
                        could have absorbed almost the whole of the Sucreries and the bondholders
                        would have received thirty or forty per cent., while the shareholders would
                        have received nothing. On the 19th September the Cairo Court selected the
                        experts and the report of those gentlemen was undoubtedly considerably
                        influenced by the tendencies of a section of public opinion. The former
                        employes of the company also foment­ed a fierce agitation against the
                        Suoreries. The result was that the experts were un­doubtedly influenced by
                        these tendencies while French experts, on the other hand, were in favour of
                        the reconstitution of the company, and their opinion was maintained by such
                        authorities as Harari Pacha and Boghos Pacha Nubar, who were ready to join
                        the board of a reconstituted company. As to the report of the Cairo experts,
                        it was nothing more nor less than a “ requisitoire. ” They had declared that
                        the company was neither un­fortunate nor of good faith. When the counsel for
                        the company wished to reply to the experts, the Court refused to grant him a
                        hearing. Meanwhile at Paris an agreement had been arrived at by all the
                        parties interested to accept a “Concordat preventif,” The agreement was that
                        of the total debt, £850,600, no less than £400,00 would be wiped off by
                        accepting the offer of the Egyptian Govern­ment to take over the company’s
                        line of rail­way, £400,000 would be covered by the issue of debenture stock,
                        and £400,000 by a further issue which would extinguish the small balance of
                        debt remaining and enable the company to proceed with its business. The
                        attitude of the "Ministere Public” at Cairo was utterly incomprehensible and
                        the point of view of that gentleman was curious in the extreme. Why, when
                        everybody, creditors and shareholders alike, was unanimous in demand­ing a
                        “concordat,” how came it that the Mi­nistere Public sprang upon an
                        astonished world the preposterous demand for bankruptcy When Maitre Padoa
                        Bey, counsel for the creditors, rose to reply, as he had the right to for
                        the pronouncement of the Ministere Public was a “demande nouvelle” and also
                        contained some erroneous points, the Court refused him a hearing. As to the
                        finding of the lower Court, Maitre Carton not only claimed that the Court of
                        Appeal should quash the judgment but that it should decree the “homologation
                        du concordat.” The important point was that the bad faith of the board of
                        directors should be established, if bankruptcy was to be declared. This
                        important point the experts had failed to substantiate sati-factorily.</p>
                    <p>They had confined themselves to taking the opinions of the petty employes of
                        the company and never once had asked the ad vice of their chiefs. Moreover,
                        the several reports of these gentlemen were contradictory, and in order that
                        they should present a joint report to the Tribunal they had simply struck a
                        mean between their variouspoints of view. Maitre Carton indignantly
                        stigmatised such conduct, especially in such a case, when the honour of the
                        directors, the future of the company, and a most im­portant industry in
                        Egypt were at stake. Leaving out Cronier, de la Bouglise, and Leroux, who
                        alone can be accused of complicity, the others could not be accused of bad
                        faith. The lower Court in its judgment declared that the shareholders had
                        abdicat­ed their rights on the pretext that the com­pany’s meetings were
                        specially attended by the shareholders, but this line of argument was
                        illogical, as no less than 300,000 shares of a total of 825,000 were held in
                        France. At many company meetings a quorum is not attained but this is not
                        equivalent to an abrogation of their rights by the share holders. The two
                        “arrets” of a Belgian Court, in which the Cairo Tribunal based its
                        judg­ment. rather supported his own contention, said Maitre Carton, than
                        that of the Court. The first of these “arrets” declared that bankruptcy
                        ought to ensue, but among the "attendus” there was one to the effect that
                        bank­ruptcy was in the interests of the creditors.</p>
                    <p>Maitre Padoa Bey than spoke for the creditors and showed that a concordat
                        should be granted in the interests of the creditors.</p>
                    <p>M. Borchgrevink, Procureur General, de­clared that the Board had been guilty
                        of carelessness and grave negligence for years past. He disputed the
                        validity of the “arbitrage” and concluded that inasmuch as the Board and the
                        general meetings are the recognised instruments whereby the company acts, it
                        is logical that the company should be held responsible for the deeds of its
                        Board, and he was consequently in favour of confirming the judgment of the
                        lower Court.</p>
                    <p>Judgment will be given on the 21st inst. </p>

                    <p>PICTURESQUE AND GAY SCENE.</p>
                    <p>SOME OF THE COSTUMES WORN.</p>
                    <p>The present season at Helouan has been one of the best on record. On Friday
                        last, the Grand Hotel Helouan, which has always taken the leading part in
                        providing amuse­ments for visitors, presented a wonderfully picturesque and
                        gay scene, the special oc­casion being a fancy-dress ball. To Mr. Petry, the
                        courteous manager, a special feeling of thanks most have been felt by all
                        present for the excellent way in which the prepa­rations had been made. The
                        floor, which is undoubtedly one of the best in Egypt, was in splendid order
                        and the buffet provided was laden with delicacies. The music was supplied by
                        Bracale’s Band, who kept ex­cellent time and had to pay penalty by numerous
                        “encores.” Many dinner parties had been given. Among those entertaining were
                        Mr. and Mrs. R. H. Shelmerdine, Mrs. Bell White, Capt. and Mrs. Slazanger,
                        Mr. and Mrs. Sargent, Mrs. Warren, Dr. Llewellyn Phillips, Capt. Adams and
                        others. Dr. and Miss Hobson entertained Miss Babington Jones, Mr. Trimen,
                        Mr. Nesbit and Mr.Dickenson at dinner before the dance, and Dr. Bentley came
                        with a large party from the Tewfik Palace Hotel. The visitors from Cairo who
                        were present, through the courtesy of Captain Adams, were able to return to
                        Cairo by special train at 1.30 a.m.</p>
                    <p>Helouan has often been accused of being full of invalids, and being far too
                        dull for sound and healthy persons. If that is so, such a statement was
                        entirely disproved on Friday night. The opening dance provided an ex­tremely
                        pretty eight, for the costumes, many of which were extremely clever,
                        presented a kaleidoscope of colours and the scene was watched with interest
                        by numbers of non-dancing visitors from the different hotels and pensions
                        who had been cordially invited. The following are some of the costumes. Miss
                        Zabotkine wore one of the prettiest costaues of the evening, appearing ae a
                        pierette in red, and white, and her sister was a baby in a long lace robe,
                        Miss Warren,early Viotorian; Miss Jones, Mrs. Warren and Miss Totenham,
                        Gipsies; Miss Fawcett, a dainty Geisha ; Miss Darley and Miss Duncan looked
                        charming, the former as a rose, the latter as Duchess of Devonshire; Miss
                        Babington J. Jones as a lady of the last century and her pretty young sister
                        represent­ing Cherry Ripe; Miss Hobson a school-girl of unknown date ; Miss
                        Kirkbright was much noticed as Folly; Mrs. Beckett, Poudre ; Miss Gladys
                        Phillips, dainty Chinese Lady ; Miss Bentley, milkmaid; Miss Philipps, a
                        flower girl. Mr. Mannel and Seligman amused their many friends as Casino
                        girls in somewhat gaudy dresses. Mr. Shelmerdine, chef. Mr. Firth a donkey
                        boy. Dr. Bremner a tennis player fitted with all requirements. Capt. Outran,

                        countryman in a blue smock respectively. Dr. Bentley looked very well as a
                        sheikh, Mr. Bentley jockey; Mr. Sawyer, doctor of music ; Mr. de Cosson,Sir
                        Walter Raleigh, Dr Phillips; 18th Centnry Beau; Mr. Trimers and Mr.
                        Dic­kenson, Anglo- 'mericans; Mr. Nesbit’s costume was particularly striking
                        as a stately Bedouin. Dr. O. Hobson’s costume as Winter was ex­tremely
                        effective Mr. Warren and many others added to the gay scene. In evening
                        dress we noticed Mrs. and Miss Crofton, Capt. Adams, the Messrs. Bennet, Mr.
                        Loftua. Cant. Gordon Cumming, Mr. and Mrs. Firth. Mr. and Mrs. Straker, who
                        were all indefatigable dancers.</p>

                    <p>FORMAL OPENING CEREMONY.</p>
                <p>CLUB COMMITTEE “AT HOME.”</p>
                <p>When, a few months since, the idea origin­ated of presenting a British Club to
                    Alexandria, no one dared hope that the scheme would meet with the success it
                    has. Merchants bankers, shipping companies, and individuals all came to the
                    front with valuable aid, with the result that last Saturday afternoon the
                    committee were enabled to formally open the club.</p>
                <p>The committee were "At Home’’ from 4.30 to 7.80 p.m., during which time many
                    hundreds of persons availed themselves of the opportunity of inspecting the
                    club’s beautiful premises, which are very handsomely equipped. The
                    billiard-rooms are second to none, the card- room and lounge are appropriately
                    furnished, and the electric installation is perfect The floral decorations,
                    which were very tasteful and gave a bright appearance to the club, were very
                    kindly arranged by Mrs. Gould, wife of the Consul-General, and donations of
                    flowers were kindly made by Mr. Percy Carver and Mrs. Crafton. Refreshments were
                    served continuously during the At Home and suitable music was furnished by
                    D’Ambra’s orchestra.</p>
                <p>Amongst the many present we noticed Sir Massle and Lady Blomfield, Mr. and Mrs.
                    E. B. Gould, Mr. Percy Carver, Mr. and Mrs. Sidney Carver, Mr. and Mrs. Crafton,
                    Canon and Mrs. Ward, Rev. H. P. and Mrs. Reid and many others, too numerous to
                    mention, all of whom were conducted through the premises by the committee, and
                    the same flattering remarks were heard on all sides, viz., that the club far
                    surpassed all anti­cipations.</p>
                <p>A general meeting of members was held at 9 p.m., Mr. J. Davies Bryan in the
                    chair, when the new rules were passed. Mr. Kerr was elected hon. auditor, and
                    Mr. Francis Leveaux hon. legal adviser to the club.</p>
                <p>Mr. P. W. Carver, as hon. treasurer, gave a brief outline of the present finances
                    of the club. There are now 223 members, of whom 205 are ordinary and country
                    members, and 18 have given special annual subscriptions amounting to L.E. 100
                    Donations collected are L.E. 921. The expenditure has been care­fully made end a
                    credit balance of about L.E. 240 exists at the Anglo-Egyptian Bank, besides £200
                    of Unified. There is, however, a further outlay in prospect to complete the
                    furnishing, and the second portion of the rent, L.E. 220, to be met. Enough was
                    shown to satisfy the meeting that the club is on a sound financial basis.</p>
                <p>Votes of thanks were accorded to Sir Massie Blomfield, chairman of the original
                    committee, Mr, Percy Carver, the hon. treasurer, Mr. Arthur Purvis, the hon
                    seoretaiy, Mr. Davies Bryan, chairman of the committee, Mr. Geo. Morris, late
                    chairman of the house committee, and Mr. Walter Sarjeant, present chairman of
                    the house committee.</p>
                <p>So ended a very pleasant and memorable occasion. The club, so much needed and now
                    so auspiciously inaugurated, is now at the disposal of those it was intended
                    for. The committee have done their work well ; it only now remains for the
                    members to support it</p>

                    <p>The Right Rev. Robert Brindle, D.S.O., Roman Catholic Bishop of Nottingham,
                        who officiated at the conversion of Princess Ena, had a long career as
                        military chaplain before the Cardinal Vaughan made him an auxiliary bishop
                        in the Archdiocese of Westminster. He was with Lord Kitchener in the final
                        conquest of the Sudan and recited a prayer of his own composition at the
                        memorial service for General Gordon in Khartoum. It so impressed Lord
                        Kitchener that he had a number of copies struck off. Lord Kitchener and
                        previous commanders in the Sudan had a high opinion of Father Brindle’s
                        judgment, and often consulted him.</p>

                <div type="item"><head>A COLLECTION OF WATER COLOUR SKETCHES.</head>
                    <p>Mr. A. O. Lamplough, A.M.S.K., has re­turned from his trip to the Fayoum,
                        and has added various fresh and altogether delightful sketches to those
                        already on view at the National Hotel. Mr. Lamplough has been particularly
                        happy in catching the Egyptian atmosphere, and more especially so in gauging
                        both that translucent colouring and mist effect which make our morning and
                        our evening glory. There are two delightful bits of Fayonm town, which are
                        worth remember­ing and are very delicately handled, and there is a hot sunny
                        stretch of road with huts at one side and some cool grey palms in the mid
                        distance which is also very good. The lovely fisher hut on Lake Kurn, where
                        duty is levied on the fish caught therein,is not without its charm, and
                        there are many who would appreciate that lovely stretch of Libyan desert
                        with nothing but its rocks to break its drear monotony.</p>
                    <p>It is rather late to speak of the collection of pictures which has already
                        been on view now for some weeks, but there is much merit in these
                        water-colours, and they deserve appreciation. The stretches of the river
                        about Luxor, whether in the morning cool, midday sun, or sunset, are full of
                        charm, and there is a wealth of colour in No. 10. where the sun is tinging
                        the low hills with its glow, and the dababeah is floating down the shallow
                        reaches. The mist effects on the Nile and in the desert are treated with
                        great simplicity and effect, and there are various views of the country in
                        which the Pyramids appear as background. A very careful piece of drawing
                        with masterly treatment of reflected shadows is to be seen in No. 25, “Court
                        of the Nile Temple,’’ at Medinet Haba. A similar picture to this was bought
                        last year by H.R.H. Princess Henry of Battenberg, who has favoured Mr. Lamp-
                        lough on several occasion*. Those who are interested in the country and who
                        have a keen appreciation of its beauties should not miss this opportunity of
                        seeing this charming collection.</p>
