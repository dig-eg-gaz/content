                        <p>GOVERNMENT AND RESERVISTS.</p>
                        <p>At the recent meeting of the National Association for the Employment of
                            Reservists and Discharged Soldiers it came out that daring a the last
                            twelve months only nine of these men have found berths in the lower
                            grades of the public service, with the exception of the War Office. The
                            Duke of Connaught, who presided, and Lord Roberts, who moved the annual
                            report, had full cause to censure such a discreditable condition of
                            affairs. Year after year, official pledges have been given to set aside
                            a reasonable percentage of depart mental employment for soldiers after
                            the completion of colour service. Every effort would be made, the nation
                            received reiterated assurance, to provide permanent careers for the rank
                            and file, whether in the Reserve or passed through it. And the
                            fulfilment of these Ministerial undertakings is what we have just stated
                            ; the Post Office and the other chief employing departments, excepting
                            that in Pall-mall, have actually contrived to make room for nine of the
                            country's military defenders in a year! Lord Roberts stigmatised the
                            miserable shortage as "most lamentable." while the Duke deeply regretted
                            that the Government had not been able to give more employment to those
                            deserving men. Last year, out of 15,006 applicants on the list,
                            considerably more than half were furnished through its instrumentality
                            with permanent berths. And what does that high authority, Sir Charles
                            Sootter, say about the men thus scouted by jacks-in-office? The
                            South-Western Railways is so thoroughly satisfied with the conscientious
                            and intelligent way in which they perform their duties that in the last
                            three years it has nearly doubled the number in its employ; 'they found
                            from' long experience, "Sir Charles deposes, “that ex soldiers an
                            steady, sober, honorable, and reliable."</p>

                        <p>Fighting was continuous during yesterday. Until now there are 8 killed
                            and 100 wounded. The disturbances originated in an organised attack of
                            Jewish Socialists armed with axes on the Jewish disorderly houses.
                            Doors, windows and furniture were smashed. The fighting was most
                            sanguinary : knives and revolvers were freely used. The police were
                            passive spectators. (Reuter.)</p>

                        <p>An Egyptian correspondent, writing to a London Contemporary on the
                            celebration of the centenary of Mohamed Aly, remarks, “The Municipality
                            of Alexandria have proposed, as a public commemoration, the construction
                            of a lunatic asylum. The idea has found but little favor in Egypt, where
                            a work of the kind is regarded as solely the business of the Government,
                            which, indeed, has already decided upon the building of a lunatic
                            asylum, though not in the vicinity of Alexandria. It is unlikely that
                            the Municipality scheme will survive the criticism bestowed upon it, and
                            a more felicitous kind of monument will probably have to be adopted."

                    <p>Another very successful and most enjoyable concert was held at the above
                        institute on Thursday evening, which, judging from the numerous encores
                        demanded by the audience and so kindly granted by the performers, equalled,
                        if it did not surpass, the former one held a month ago. The well-arranged
                        programme, in which the vocal and instrumental performances were well
                        balanced, was carried out in a most thorough style. The songs of Mrs.Gamble
                        and Miss MunGavin were, as on the previous occasion, highly appreciated, and
                        the pianoforte solos of Mrs. Gordon thoroughly merited the applause accorded
                        to them. Miss M. K. Gibson's rendering of the “Intermezzo" from Caballeria
                        Rusticana was something to be remembered, and was received with one long and
                        continued call for an encore. Which was given in this talented lady’s best
                        style as was also her other, item, with its encore. The mandoline solos of
                        Professor Rizzitano were excellent, exhibiting taste and feeling, combined
                        with faultless execution. Two novelties; in the shape of an imitation of
                        church bell ringing, given by Mr. O. S. Heaton, and a masterly exhibition of
                        club swinging by Gunner S. Hall, R.G.A., made a delightful variation in the
                        entertainment. The recitation by Drummer Peace and the pianoforte solo by
                        Private Russell well earned the praise awarded them, while Mr. Dodwell’s two
                        songs and three encores proved the power of a good comic song, well sung, to
                        amuse both old and young. The proceedings closed with a vote of thanks to
                        the performers, and to Mrs. Lawrence for organising so successlul an
                        entertainment; and although there was no formal vote of thanks given, yet we
                        are sure that all present felt that the success of the evening was greatly
                        enhanced by the admirable manner in which Major Gamble precided. The hall,
                        which was prettily decorated with flowers kindly sent by Mr. John Ross, was
                        well filled with an audience in which the military formed a good proportion,
                        our now friends of the R. G. A. showing a good muster. Amongst those present
                        we noticed Major and Mrs. Gamble, Capt. and Mrs. Gordon, Mrs. Moore, Rev. R.

                    <p>June 1 will he an important date in the history of the industrial development
                        of Egypt’s commercial capital for on Thursday next the Rosetta and
                        Alexandria Rice Mills Company will be launched. As is well known, Rosetta
                        for many years past has been the seat of the Egyptian rice industry, and
                        rice milling is in fact the only staple of that interesting but decayed old
                        city of Lower Egypt. There are, however, many disadvantages in this site,
                        for the railway communication with Rosetta leaves much to be desired, and
                        the transport by sea and canal is antiquated, hazardous, and tedious. It is
                        obvious therefore that Alexandria oil era far more scope for dealing with a
                        commodity of such general importance to the inhabitants of Egypt and of the
                        Levant generally, for the trade is developing rapidly every year. </p>
                    <p>Consequently an important group of capitalists, embracing many well-known
                        persons of Alexandria, Trieste, and Marseilles, have combined together to
                        start the Rosetta and Alexandria Rice Mills Company. The first step will be
                        the erection at Alexandria of what is destined to be by far the largest rice
                        mill in Egypt, and on Thursday next the foundations of the building will be
                        laid. An advantageous site has been chosen on the Mahmoudieh Canal, between
                        the Asphalte Company's works and Messrs. Abou Chanab's oil mills. The
                        superficies of the site is about four feddans, and on this a large
                        six-storey mill and two warehouses will be built by Mr. P. A. Gerakis, the
                        contractor, after the design of Mr. Stienon. </p>
                    <p>The company intends taking over Messrs. Behrend’s rice mill at Rosetta, and
                        the managing directorate will be in the hands of Messrs.Behrend &amp;
                        Company. The capital of the company is £60,000, all of which has been
                        privately subscribed, and there will therefore be nopublic issue. </p>
                    <p>The machinery will be of the very latest description. It will be entirely
                        automatic, and will be capable of turning out one hundred tons of cleaned
                        rice every day, as against an average turn-out of a Rosetta mill of seven to
                        eight tons per day. Every type of rice will be turned out, from the simple
                        decorticated variety to the highly glazed finished article. The wants of the
                        Egyptian fellah will to carefully attended to, and special attention will be
                        directed to the manufacture of the “Maksous” or salted variety of rice,
                        which native consumption specially affects. </p>
                    <p>When the Egyptian rice crop ends about March, the mill will turn its
                        attention to Rangoon rice, which can be imported in either the rough or
                        cleaned state as suits the mill's requirements. In the latter case the
                        cleaned rice would undergo the glazing process. </p>
                    <p>The advantages which the new mill possesses are obvious, and the result will
                        be that the rice trade, which has hitherto been concentrated at Rosetta,
                        must necessarily find its way toAlexandria, and the last nail will be
                        thereby driven in the coffin of Rosetta’s whilom prosperity to the benefit
                        of Alexandria. </p>
                    <p>The mill is to be ready for work in about ten or eleven months’ time. </p>

                        <p>I am glad to be in a position to state that the united efforts of the
                            Parquet authorities and of the officials of the Ministry of the Interior
                            have succeeded in discovering the whereabouts of the valuables stolen by
                            the brigands. They were found in a village hard by the desert that
                            intervenes between the provinces of Fayoum and Beni-Souef. Six men
                            implicated in the brigandage are now under arrest and energetic efforts
                            are being made to lay hands on the brigand chief and other members of
                            his nefarious gang. The Inspector of the Ministry of the Interior and
                            the Moudir of the Fayoum are working day and night to unravel this case,
                            and it is to be hoped that their efforts will be crowned with the
                            success they deserve in bringing the ruffians within the meshes of the
                            law. </p>

                            Light Railway. I was recently informed by a late employe of the company
                            that there is a decrease of £10 per diem in the receipts of this
                            railway, and he also declared that the present receipts of the line
                            scarce suffice to pay the expenses. Of course I do not vouch for the
                            truth of this information, but all accounts tend to show that the
                            progress of the company is not rapid, nor can its future prospects be
                            characterised as in any degree promising. </p>

                    <p>Sir Ernest Cassel's travelling ophthalmic hospital, which has been visiting
                        the 1 Fayoum province, is to be transferred hence I to Damietta. Dr. A.
                        Ferguson MacCallan, who is the ophthalmist in charge of the hospital, left
                        this week for Cairo. His assistant, Tahir Effendi, leaves with the tents and
                        all the hospital paraphernalia next week. During the stay of the hospital
                        here no less than 12,402 visits have been paid by patients. Of these 637
                        were operated on for trichiosis, irridoctomy, cataract, and other ophthalmic
                        complaints so common in this country. I used to visit Dr. MacCallan as a
                        confrere, and I can state from my own experience that his success in the
                        treatment of soft and senile cataract was most remarkable, and during his
                        stay here he has alleviated a very large amount of suffering among the
                        people. In the name of the inhabitants of the Fayoum I beg to thank Sir
                        Ernest Cassel and the skilful physician in charge of his hospital, for the
                        good that has been done in this province by the hospital. </p>
                    <p>The following passages from Dr. MacCallan's interesting report on his last
                        year's work are worth quoting:— </p>
                    <p>“At the inception of the scheme, there was some doubt as to its probable
                        success, and as to the readiness of the fellaheen to take advantage of it.
                        All doubt has, however, been, set at rest by its immediate and complete
                        success. There has never been the smallest hesitation on the part of the
                        people to visit the hospital as patients, nor to submit themselves to
                        whatever operation I have advised. The large proportion of women patients
                        has been especially noteworthy. Both at Menonf and Damietta, the number of
                        would-be patients has been much larger than the surgical staff of the
                        hospital could cope with. It was no uncommon thing to find in the morning
                        200 people anxious to obtain admission, and the same condition of affaire
                        now obtains at Galionb." </p>
                    <p>"All patients are treated free of charge, and are given bottles of drops and
                        lotions for use at home when necessary. By far the larger proportion of the
                        patients who attend the hospital have every appearance of poverty, and if
                        there are more patients on any day than can be seen, the poorer patients are
                        given preference. </p>
                    <p>Dr. MacCallan concludes his report with the following words :— </p>
                    <p>“The extension of the travelling ophthalmic hospital scheme throughout the
                        country would, I feel certain; be as successful from an economic as from a
                        philanthropic point of view. The number of inefficient workers due to the
                        ravages of trachoma is enormous, and every child who now obtains relief at
                        the camps is a worker saved from the ban of inefficiency." </p>
                    <p>Lord Cromer remarks as follows on this report:— </p>
                    <p>“One of the results of the absence of means of ophthalmic relief in the rural
                        districts is the multiplication of quacks, who often do more harm than good
                        to their patients. The establishment of the travelling hospitals will in
                        some degree mitigate this evil, but the remedy so far applied has
                        necessarily been only very partial. It is a well-known fact which is
                        confirmed by Dr. Mac Callan, that a large proportion of the children who
                        attend the Government schools require skilled medical treatment for their
                        eyes." </p>
                    <p>And in regard to Dr. MacCallan’s conclusion his lordship says:— </p>
                    <p>"I do not doubt that Dr. MacCallan is quite right. In view of the very large
                        number of subjects which call for the attention of the Government in this
                        country, and of the further fact that the resources of the State do not
                        admit of all these subjects being treated at the same time and immediately,
                        I am always somewhat unwilling to state beforehand when it will be possible
                        to take in hand any particular project for reform. I have, however, no
                        hesitation in expresing a strong hope that before long it will be possible
                        for the Government to provide means for extending the excellent system
                        which, under Sir Ernest Cassel’s auspices has now been inaugurated.” </p>

                    <head>REPORT FOR 1904.</head>
                    <p>In reviewing the Medical Mission work of the past twelve, months, we, cannot
                        but feel that 1904 has been a year of advance. A comparison of the
                        statistics of the two last years shows marked progress in numbers. For
                        instance, in 1903 we were glad to record 19,730 as the total number of
                        outpatient visits to our Dispensary. Last year the number rose to 25,057.
                        Again, the number of patients has risen from 864 to 1,767, while our total
                        receipts in fees, etc. have been nearly doubled, thus enabling us to defray
                        all expenses, save missionary allowances, and to end the year with a
                        substantial balance.</p>
                    <p>With regard to spiritual results, which man cannot estimate, one can say that
                        there have been evidences of a deepened spirit of enquiry and more earnest
                        interest. Tangible spiritual results are few indeed, and were these our only
                        guarantee of success, and were it not for the knowledge that results are in
                        higher hands, it would be truly hard, having put one’s hand to the plough,
                        not to look back. </p>
                    <p>Manifest tokens of God’s blearing, however, are not wanting. Some weeks ago
                        we had a Sudanese, woman in hospital who was admitted for the treatment of a
                        rare form of malignant growth on the foot. Sad to say, the disease has
                        recurred repeatedly elsewhere, and will sooner or later almost certainly
                        lead to a fatal issue. The patient was under Dr. Pains' care and I will
                        quote his account of her:—</p>
                    <p>"She came here because, as she put it, she had seen, in a dream, someone come
                        and say to her: Go to the English Hospital in Old Cairo. Very soon after
                        admission she showed great interest in the Gospel story, and expressed
                        herself as certain that the one she had seen in her dream was Christ
                        Himself. She has been daily taught and learns rapidly with the full
                        intention of being baptised, after she has put her affairs in order. She has
                        some land she wants to sell, in order that it, as is most likely after
                        baptism, she is cast out by her people, she may have wherewith to live. She
                        quite recognises the probability of persecution, but says she will say to
                        her son: “‘We have been on the wrong road. Christ has found me and put me on
                        the right one. Will you come with me along it? Even if you won't, I must
                        keep on it’”</p>
                    <p>Another encouraging case is that of a printer, a Cairo man, who had
                        previously worked for our Mission, and had been influenced by contact with
                        the missionaries and through the subject matter he had been employed to
                        print. Strangely enough he also, while in hospital, dreamed that he saw
                        Christ, who touched his hand and told him that he would soon recover. On
                        waking, he aroused the other Moslems in the ward and warned them against
                        opposing the Gospel, relating to them his vision. He was much impressed by
                        the teaching he received, and the last report I heard of him was to the
                        effect that he was doing all in his power to serve the Mission, in the face
                        of considerable difficulties. He himself told me not many days ago that he
                        was persuading some of the Moslems who work in the same press to attend the
                        C.M.S evangelistic meetings in Cairo.</p>
                    <p>There are other cases too which might be mentioned. One is that of a Moslem
                        woman who is now working as a dresser in hospital; another a patient on the
                        men's side who was with us many months. For a time he showed real
                        earnestness and it was thought well to give hint some private instruction
                        over and above the teaching he received in hospital. Later, however, we were
                        led to suspect that his keenness in learning was prompted by ulterior
                        motives. However that may have been, I have recently heard from the
                        catechist who visited his village that he is still taking an interest in the
                        Gospel, and the Bible which was given to him when he left us is being read
                        in his house. </p>
                    <p>While one writes one is reminded of a man who attended the dispensary for
                        some time. I well remember him as rather noisy opponent of the truth, and on
                        one occasion had to interfere on behalf of the catechist, who was the object
                        of his attacks. There are few now who are more kindly disposed towards the
                        mission than this man. He professes to believe in Christ and I believe his
                        professions are genuine. May he in due time be given grace to confess them
                        before men.</p>
                    <p>Other concrete examples of encouragement one might quote, but perhaps one of
                        the most cheering signs in the work is the deep interest with which the
                        Gospel message is received. There are always some in one’s audiences who
                        seem to drink in the story of salvation, and one feels that the seed is
                        falling on good ground. The fruit may be long in coming, but it is in the
                        hands of Him who alone can give the increase.</p>
                    <p>Early in the year (1904) a temporary ward to accommodate thirteen men was
                        built in the hospital compound, at a cost of about £70, which was derived
                        from the balance of a sum given some years ago by Cairo residents for the
                        erection of dormitories for Egyptian anemia patients. The ward has proved of
                        the greatest benefit and has enabled us to get the greatest possible amount
                        of use out of each bed in the hospital; as soon as a patient ia
                        admitted,—supposing it is a surgical case— he takes up his abod: in the
                        temporary ward until the day fixed for his operation. He is then transferred
                        to one of the beds in the hospital proper; but as soon as be recovers from
                        his operation sufficiently to enable him to get about a little, he returns
                        once more to the so called "Noah's Ark”. There he stops until he is allowed
                        to go home. So the hospital bed during the past months have been changing
                        occupants very quickly; and supporters of beds and cots can be assured that
                        their subscript XXXX are thus put to good account. (To be continued).</p>

                    <p>General Lord Grenfell G.C.B., G.C.M.G., who is already a Colonel Commandant
                        of the King's Royal Ride Corps (the 60th), has been selected for the
                        colonelcy of 2nd Life Guards, rendered vacant by the death of General Lord
                        Chelmsford, G.C.B., G.C.V.O By virtue of this appointment, Lord Grenfell
                        will become one of the three “Gold Sticks,” who take turns to be “in
                        waiting” on the King.</p>
                    <p>The whole of Lord Grenfell's regimental service was passed in the 60th, which
                        he joined as an ensign in 1859. He has held many staff appointments,
                        including that of Commander- in-Chief in Ireland, to which he was appointed
                        just a year ago ; and his war services include Griqualand West, in 1875 ;
                        the Zulu War, 1879 ; the Boer War, 1881; Egypt, 1882; Nile, 1884-5 ; and
                        Sudan, 1885-6-8-9. He has been seven times mentioned in despatches, and has
                        received many honors and rewards for his services.</p>
                    <p>Lieutenant Colonel W M. Duckett, A.P.D., has been formally appointed District
                        Pay master in Egypt, where he has been serving for some time.</p>
                    <p>When the Indian mail last left the 2nd Battalion King's Royal Rifle Corps had
                        moved from Bareilly to Ranikhet. Lieutenant Colonel Walpole S. Kays,
                        commanding that battalion, has been promoted brevet-colonel He has worn the
                        “green-jacket” for over a quarter of a century and has the Ashanti

                    <p>Lieutenant Charles Howard, Royal Berkshire Regiment, who recently figured in
                        a case of alleged assault on the police in Dublin, has been removed from the
                        army for absence without leave. It is understood that he went to Canada
                        before his trial came off.</p>
                    <p>As soon as the first class cruiser "Carnarvon” is ready for commission she
                        will proceed to the Mediterranean Station to replace the "King Alfred" which
                        has taken the place of the "Aboukir" pro. tem. Captain Sir George J. S.
                        Warrender, Bart, brother-in law of the Earl of Shaftesbury, has been
                        appointed to the command of the “Carnarvon.” The "Carnarvon” is a cruiser of
                        the "County" class.</p>
                    <p>The 9.2 gun, several of which were recently sent out to our coaling stations
                        in the Far East, is a very fine weapon of long range and ballistic energy.
                        It weighs 25 tons unmounted and throws a projectile of 380 lbs weight. This
                        combined shot and shell is propelled to its destination by a charge of 63
                        lbs of cordite, which gives it a muzzle energy of 2,347 feet per second and
                        an effective range of eight miles. At 3,000 yards the “nine point two" can
                        perforate 18 inches of wrought iron. Half a dozen men can work it.</p>
                    <p>The projected manoeuvres of the Eastern Fleet—the East Indies, China and
                        Australian Squadrons—have been cancelled and properly so. With
                        Rodjestvensky's Pacific Squadron knocking about in the Far Eastern sees
                        there would be every chance of another “regrettable incident," in which the
                        gallant Russian gunners would hardly come off so well as they did in their
                        historic encounter with the Dogger Bank Trawling Fleet and the phantom
                        torpedo boats. There are some very straight shooting ships of ours in those
                        waters.</p>
                    <p>A good deal of fun is still being poked at the Army Council on account of the
                        minute regulations it issues on very trifling subjects. The fault lies in
                        the publicity given to them in the Press, for many are matters of such minor
                        detail that they need not go beyond the subordinates to whom they are
                        addressed. Only that restless desire to comment on the action of the
                        military authorities can explain why all the world should be told that nails
                        must be extricated from worn-out mop heads before they are retained into
                        store, or that the time-honored expression "By order” should no longer be
                        appended to the instructions given out in the name of officers commanding by
                        their staff. The energies of the military members of Council are perhaps
                        running to waste for want of freer outlet. According to current reports the
                        business of the War Office is greatly hampered and impeded just now by too
                        disinclination of the supreme chief to give definite decisions on questions
                        pending. So much uncertainty prevails as to the larger measures of
                        reconstruction still in abeyance that small matters of very necessary
                        routine are often neglected inconveniently.</p>
                    <p>If the public were not, at this time or day. ase-hardened to the exploits of
                        the British War Office, there would be a tremendous explosion of national
                        indignation over the official statement of the amount of stores and supplies
                        "destroyed locally” in South Africa between 1899 and 1901. Not only does the
                        loss in money amount to £293,937, but the loss is borne entirely by the
                        public. Not a single firm of contractors is a penny the worse for all this
                        fearful waste, and as to more than one-third of the total value, the War
                        Office calmly declares that it does not know whence the goods came. Besides
                        that proportion, there are other stone as to which the date of the supply
                        “cannot now be ascertained." Why, in the name of common-sense, cannot the
                        date be ascertained, and, therewith, the name of every firm that ever
                        supplied a single cartridge or a tin of preserved meat? Such a confession as
                        this is enough to make the most invincible optimist despair of any effectual
                        improvement of War Office methods. To our mind it is simply inconceivable
                        that the necessary information "cannot be ascertained;” but, if that be
                        really the case, somebody else, besides the public, ought to be made to
                        suffer for it.</p>

                    <head>GERMAN INTEREST IN EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>(From The “Berlin Post.”)</p>
                    <p>Business circles in Germany are beginning to direct their attention to Egypt
                        more than ever. There is no doubt that during the last 20 years that country
                        has made great strides. German imports from Egypt have risen from 13 million
                        marks in 1894 to 57 million marks in 1903. while the exports from Germany to
                        Egypt have risen from 7 to 23 million marks. It is not generally known that
                        Egypt exports enormous quantities of raw cotton to Germany. In 1903 alone
                        this amounted to 48 million marks. The increase of German traffic through
                        the Suez Canal, on the one hand, and the high price of English coal on the
                        other, have caused German shipowners to establish a coal depot at Port Said
                        which has been a great success, and has considerably increased the
                        importation of German coal into Egypt test year, 63 million tons were
                        exported to Egypt, most of which was consigned to this depot Seventy German
                        ships, of 150,000 tons, trade between this country and Alexandria, the chief
                        port of Egypt test year the Norddeutecher Lloyd ran a regular service
                        between Marseilles, Naples, and Alexandria, thus affording excellent
                        communica- between Europe and Egypt. The great increase of passengers by
                        this line has abundantly proved its necessity and justified its existence. A
                        German bank, a branch of the Orient Bank established at Athens, is about to
                        be opened in Alexandria, and the Hamburg-Amerika Line has arranged to start
                        a service of six river boats on the Nile carrying both passengers and
                        freight. All these arrangements prove, firstly, the existence of great
                        German commercial interests, and, secondly, these new departures show that
                        Egypt is a country of great possibilities, meriting more attention than it
                        has hitherto received. In consequence of this new service it will be
                        possible to open new German goods depots, and to form new commercial
                        centres. This undertaking will be supported by the already large foreign
                        trade, and the German concerns in Syria and Egypt will be able to lend each
                        other a helping hand and give mutual support. And there are yet other
                        opportunities for peaceful commercial enterprise.</p>

                    <head>THE SECRET OF THE WORLDS.</head>
                    <p>When we see what we have done and what we are on the point of doing, writes
                        Manrice Maeterlinck in the "New York Tribune," it is not absurd to hope that
                        some day we shall lay hold of that essential secret of the worlds which for
                        the time being we have called the law of gravitation.</p>
                    <p>There is nothing mad in supposing that the secret of this sovereign force
                        lies hidden within us, or around us, within reach of our hand.</p>
                    <p>It is perhaps tractable and docile even as light and electricity. It is
                        perhaps wholly spiritual, and depends upon a very simple cause which the
                        displacing of an object may reveal to us. The discovery of an unexpected
                        property of matter analogous to that which has just disclosed to us the
                        disconcerting qualities of radium may lead us straight to the very sources
                        of the energy and the life of the stars, and from that moment man's lot
                        would be changed, and the earth, definitely saved, would become eternal.</p>

                        heat and light, it would flee from worn-out suns and go in search of the
                        unsuspected fluids, forces, and lives in the orbit of virgin and
                        inexhaustible worlds.</p>

                    <p>The greatest danger the General on the battle-field has to face, is the
                        cutting-off of food supplies: it means the starvation of his troops, and
                        ultimate disaster. In just the same way, your greatest danger is the failure
                        of the liver and stomach to change your food into nourishment for the blood,
                        bones and tissue.</p>
                    <p>This is why liver and stomach trouble is so serious ; it means that no matter
                        how much you eat, you are being slowly starved ; every nerve and organ is
                        being robbed of its' proper nourishment; the blood is poor and lacking in
                        redness, the lips and cheeks become pale, the eyes yellow, the expression
                        haggard. You grow thin and weak, feel heavy and list less. These symptoms
                        are the digestive organs' cry for help, and Doan’s dinner pills should be
                        used regularly until every sign of the trouble has gone, otherwise you will
                        be in danger of anemia, constipation, chronic indigestion, biliousness,
                        dyspepsia, and congestion of the liver. Doan's dinner pills are made from
                        pure roots and herbs that help the liver, stomach and bowels, restoring a
                        natural action and a healthy digestion of food. This medicine ought to be in
                        every, home, and a does at once by any one who is unwell.</p>

                    <p>“As I laye a thinkynge" Ingoldsby</p>
                    <p>While there is much in the recent address of Sir Frederick Treves on “the
                        physical effects of the use of alcohol" that may well be taken to heart and
                        acted upon, I cannot help thinking that in some passages he rather overshot
                        the mark, and made statements that he would find it very difficult to
                        substantiate.</p>
                    <p>Take for example, the following assertion: "The great and laudable ambition
                        of all, and especially of young man, to be 'it’ could not possibly be
                        achieved if they took alcohol. It was simply preposterous to suppose that
                        any young healthy person needed any alcohol whatever ; and, indeed, he was
                        much better without the smallest amount of it"</p>
                    <p>It needs no elaborate research to find examples in the lives of eminent men
                        that completely disprove this assertion, and justify the term reckless being
                        applied to it. Two very prominent instances of men in every sense fit and
                        capable strike me at once, Mr. Gladstone and the Earl of Shaftesbury, the
                        one the most distinguished statesman of the 19th century, the other a man of
                        equal prominence as a philanthropist .</p>
                    <p>Neither of those men were total abstainers. Neither must be judged merely by
                        the physical results on their bodies of taking alcohol but as public men by
                        the effect of their example upon those within the sphere of their influence,
                        especially that of the latter, whose life-work lay among the poor and
                        illiterate classes of London.</p>
                    <p>A few, years ago I made a careful study of Lord Shaftesbury's life, mainly
                        for the purpose of trying to determine in my own mind the following
                        question:— Great as the good achieved by his lordship undoubtedly was, would
                        it have been still further increased if he had been an advocate of total
                        abstinence from intoxicating liquors</p>
                    <p>The conclusion I formed was that instead of doing more good he would have
                        done less, because he would have to a very great extent imposed limits upon
                        himself, and raised up what would have in very many cases proved an
                        impassable barrier between himself and the people he did so much to
                        benefit.</p>
                    <p>No one would, I should imagine, seriously contend that, Mr. Gladstone in any
                        way dimmed the brilliance of his marvellous intellect by taking a glass of
                        wine with his dinner, or in the least degree lowered his high moral
                        character because he was a strictly moderate drinker.</p>
                    <p>Another thing that impressed me in this address by Sir F. Treves was that it
                        was limited to the effect that alcohol has on the system. One would almost
                        fancy from it that alcohol pun and simple was imbibed and that it was taken
                        without admixture with such other ingredients as malt and hops in ale, or
                        grape juice in a glass of wine. The sense of proportion is entirely lost
                        sight of, and it is simply classed with such well-known poisons as arsenic,
                        opium, or strychnia. Is this fair? I think not.</p>
                    <p>In taking this line, however, the speaker simply followed that usually
                        followed by propagandists, and it seems almost out of the question to expect
                        fair and impartial treatment at their hands, of any subject of which they
                        have undertaken the advocacy. It is always best to bear this in mind when
                        estimating the value of the assertions made from various platforms—and
                        pulpits.</p>
                    <p>But there are exceptions to every rule, and one of the most notable of these
                        came under my notice in London a few years ago. An eminent Christian
                        preacher, when referring to some of the sayings of Christ that are somewhat
                        hard to understand, “turning the other cheek," “giving the cloke also," and
                        so on, expressed his opinion that Jesus only did what other propagandists
                        did, viz, overstated his subject.</p>
                    <p>This was a somewhat bold step on the preacher's part, but it is an extremely
                        significant fact that advanced religious teachers are not afraid to grapple
                        with difficulties, and look for reasonable solutions of them, rather than
                        take shelter behind walls so many deem impregnable, (and which popular
                        prejudice helps to make so), when the voice of reason makes itself heard in
                        the attack on traditional belief.</p>
                    <p>So if the good people who devote themselves to philanthropic effort for the
                        good of man- kind do overstep the mark, they do so in good company, and if
                        Sir F. Treves did present a somewhat one-sided view of a great question
                        there is every reason to hope that he may have effected a great deal of
                        good, by bringing so prominently forward the value of temperance, and the
                        fact that the consumption of alcoholic drinks is enormously in excess of
                        what it should be.</p>
                    <p>The vegetarians, in my opinion, have a still stronger cue than the total
                        abstainers, for in addition to the undoubtedly injurious effects of an
                        excess of animal food, and the possibly ill effects (in some cases) of even
                        a moderate consumption of flesh food, there is the hideous amount of
                        suffering indicted on animals prior to their being killed, to be considered,
                        apart entirely from the question of taking animal life to provide food for
                        man.</p>
                    <p>The latter considerations carry far greater weight with me than the former. I
                        have seen so much preventive cruelty, and road of so much more, that I feel
                        persuaded that if the public in general were only better informed, and gave
                        more thought to the terrible sufferings borne by the animals which furnish
                        the meat-eater's daily food, the ranks of the vegetarians would be greatly
                        swelled.</p>
                    <p>But the question of personal health is no trivial one, and when it is fully
                        realised, as analysis amply proves, that far more nutriment may be obtained
                        from vegetable than from animal sources, the much greater freedom from
                        disease that the abstainer from flesh food enjoys as compared with his
                        meat-eating fellow man will be better appreciated.</p>
                    <p>Many would-be vegetarians are under the impression that it is impossible to
                        obtain the nourishment they require without eating animal food. They give
                        the vegetarian system a trial, but from an imperfect understanding of the
                        kind of food they should eat, and the proper proportion of heat, flesh,
                        brain; bone and nerve forming foods, — in other words the want of a
                        sufficiently scientific experiment,—they rash to the conclusion that the new
                        system is unsuited to their requirements.</p>
                    <p>Those who have perserved and endeavoured to understand the conditions
                        necessary to success, tell a different tale, and speak only of the benefit
                        gained by the change they have made; but still it must ever be borne in mind
                        that constitutions like everything else greatly differ, and that what is
                        meat to one man is poison to another.</p>
                    <p>It is this great central fact that propagandists are so prone to ignore. They
                        rash to the conclusion that what benefits one must be good for another, and
                        although they are instrumental in effecting great good, they are too apt to
                        lose sight of the great diversity of requirements to be found among “all
                        sorts and conditions of men," — bodily, mental and spiritual.</p>
                    <p>To the man or woman seeking spiritual unfoldment, and who, in order to attain
                        this end, is prepared to “mortify the lasts of the body," no better advice
                        can be given than to seek by pure diet and clean living to bring it about.
                        That it is possible to become at once, and without injurious bodily result a
                        total abstainer from flesh food, alcoholic drinks, and tobacco, after a
                        life-long indulgence in these habits up to beyond 50 years of age, I can,
                        from personal experience, testify, while nothing could be more marked than
                        the resultant quickening effects upon the mental and spiritual faculties. T.

                    <head>ORIENTAL STUDY IN ENGLAND.</head>
                    <p>The Council of the Royal Asiatic Society takes up a very strong position when
                        urging the necessity of bringing into active being a State institution for
                        the promotion of Oriental study, it is certainly not creditable to a country
                        ruling over more Asiatic subjects than all the other European and American
                        nations combined that such studies can be much better carried on at Berlin
                        or Paris. The report states that Anglo-Indian officers frequently take
                        furlough to one or the other of those capitals instead of going to London,
                        solely became the facilities for learning what they want to learn are so
                        highly superior. There would be no lack of competent teachers were the Royal
                        Asiatic Society's aspiration fulfilled ; we are amply supplied with
                        Orientalists of the highest attainments. But, as in many other matters,
                        England is satisfied with the arrangements which served well enough to keep
                        her in the front rank when foreign competition did not seem likely ever to
                        smirch her laurels. That being no longer the case, the Royal Asiatic Society
                        should not appeal in vain for the founding and endowment of a London centre
                        for Oriental study not inferior in learned competency to those at Paris and
                        Berlin. As it would be of great benefit to India, directly and indirectly,
                        the cost might be equally shared between the two Treasuries. Both spend
                        freely enough on objects not nearly so much wanted for the renown of the
                        greatest of Asiatic Powers.</p>

                    <head>TRADE IN THE LEVANT.</head>
                    <head>SYRIAN TRADE.</head>
                    <p>Reporting from Aleppo, Mr. ConsUl Barnham says The year opened under
                        exceptionally favorable auspices. The rise in the price of cotton had
                        brought much money into the country. There was the prospect of a fall
                        harvest, with abundant pasture, and, consequently, a successful wool season.
                        During the first six months, indeed, these hopes were fully justified, trade
                        being unusually brisk, money plentiful and credit good. Then came a sudden
                        fall in the price of cotton, which completely changed the aspect of
                        things.</p>
                    <p>In Beyrout and Alexandretta important houses which had speculated in cotton
                        stopped payment, while in Aleppo, though there was only one failure, many of
                        the merchants were heavy losers through the failures which occurred
                        elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>The farmers also and nomad Arabs lost heavily owing to the spread of cattle
                        plague, and in a less degree from an outbreak of foot- and-mouth
                        disease.</p>
                    <p>The export trade through Alexandretta shows an increase of £239,573. The
                        import trade through Alexandretta shows a decrease of £264,321.</p>
                    <p>The importation of manufactured goods fell in volume 367 tons and in value
                        £294,450. This was due to the fail in the price of cotton and to the
                        existence of large stocks remaining over from the previous season. The
                        market is still suffering from this state of things, and dealers are often
                        compelled to dispose of their goods at wholesale prices. The imports of
                        Manchester cotton goods declined 377 tons in volume and £219,378 in value.
                        Other countries, however, show a similar decrease, notably Italy.</p>
                    <p>Three British lines—the Khedivial, Bell’s Asia Minor and Prince Line— have
                        carried on a regular service during the year. The Khedivial Company is, I
                        understand, about to establish another service connecting Constantinople
                        with the porta of Anatolia, Caramania, Syria and Egypt.</p>
                    <p>The exports being £1,376,207, show a decrease of £424,167. The imports amount
                        to £592,228, being a decrease of £37,222 on those of the previous year.</p>
                    <p>The exports to the United Kingdom and Cyprus have risen from £124,513 during
                        the year 1903 to £303,382 during 1904, showing thus an increase of £78,869.
                        There is a slight decrease amounting to £2,254 in the imports of the past
                        year from the United Kingdom and Cyprus, the figures being £93,137, as
                        against £95,381 for the year 1903. The general comparative conclusion is
                        decidedly favourable to the United Kingdom. Although, in common with other
                        nations, her share of the import trade has slightly decreased, the United
                        Kingdom has easily out-distanced other nations in the increase of her share
                        of the export trade.</p>
                    <p>THE CYCLADES.</p>
                    <p>In a report on the trade of the Cyclades for last year, Mr. Consul Cottrell
                        states that the trade and commerce of Syria and the other islands of the
                        Cyclades in 1904 showed unmis takable signs of steady decline in comparison
                        with the preceding years, and the commercial depression still continues. The
                        volume of trade of tire port of Syra represented a total value of £363,255
                        against £375,138 in 1903 and £124,363 in 1902. It is feared no hopes can be
                        entertained of any substantial amelioration for the future, in view of the
                        industrial resources of the neighbouring port of the Piraeus, together with
                        the fact that the construction of railways in continental Greece is having a
                        deteriorating effect on Syra, which in former years was a large distributing
                        centre of commerce for nearly the whole of the Levant. Even the improvement
                        in the money market last year, resulting from the exceptional fall in
                        exchange, apparently engendered no stimulus in the purchasing powers of the
                        local traders, although the question of the depreciation of forced currency
                        has for many years greatly hampered the commercial dealings with foreign
                        countries. Business in shipping circles again suffered severely last year
                        from the persistence of few freights. As elsewhere, the available tonnage
                        was a long way in excess of the demand, and the Black Sea and Danube trade,
                        in which nearly all Greek steamers find employment, proved a disappointing
                        and unprofitable market. Several vessels were in consequence lying idle in
                        harbour for months at a stretch : even those that were engaged at current
                        freights, except perhaps the few on time charter, barely recovered their
                        working expenses, notwithstanding that Greek ships are run more economically
                        than those under any other flag afloat. The Black Sea freights to
                        Mediterranean and northern ports averaged 6s and 8s. per ton respectively,
                        and outward freights from the United Kingdom, with coal only obtainable,
                        were as low as 4s. 6d. per ton. Tho prospects also for 1905 are not very
                        encouraging, and shipowners are becoming disheartened, after having invested
                        so much local capital on this in preference to any other industry.</p>
                    <p>GREEK TRADE</p>
                    <p>Reporting on the Greek province of Thessaly for 1904, Mr. Consul Merlin
                        says:-- There has been a small falling off in the number of British merchant
                        steamers which entered the port of Volo in the year 1904 as compared with
                        the preceding year, the total number being 33 vessels of 36,138 aggregate
                        net tons register, as against 25 vessels in 1903 of 39,615 tons register.
                        The vessels which arrived in the past year discharged 9,037 tons of cargo,
                        of the total estimated value of £39,191.</p>
                    <p>In 1903 14,965 tons of similar merchandise were discharged from British
                        bottoms of £46,839 total estimated value. Although the quantity and value of
                        cargo of British origin brought in British vessels in 1904 is less than in
                        the preceding year, the deficit is more apparent than real, as two foreign
                        steamships, one Austro-Hungarian and one Norwegian, came from Cardiff
                        bringing 6,450 tons of coal and patent fuel, valued at £6,200.</p>
                    <p>The trade in commodities of British origin in 1904 shows an increase over
                        that of the preceding year, and may therefore be regarded as satisfactory
                        under existing circumstances . It is true that the demand for articles of
                        foreign manufacture shows comparatively little fluctuation from year to
                        year, nor could it be reasonably expected to do otherwise, considering that
                        Thessaly is a strictly agricultural province, the development of which must
                        necessarily proceed slowly. All that can be expected under present
                        conditions is that the proportion of British products annually imported
                        should be maintained and show no falling-off.</p>
                    <p>Although in the aggregate a considerale trade is done in articles of British
                        manufacturers, no commission agent or trader of British nationality is at
                        present carrying on business in Thessaly, and the trade is therefore
                        entirely maintained owing to the high estimation of the quality of the
                        products which is very generally entertained throughout this district. I am
                        frequently told that when an article of first-rate quality is desired the
                        customer almost invariably insists that it shall be of British
                        manufacture.</p>
                    <p>Within the past 18 months the gold voice of the forced paper currency has
                        increased about 30 per cent. From a theoretical point of view this must be
                        taken as a most satisfactory sign of the improved financial position of the
                        country, but practically the effect locally has not been entirely
                        satisfactory.</p>

                        ago my constitution seemed broken down and I cared little whether I lived or
                        died. I had taken so much medicine that the sight of a bottle made me sick.
                        I had read about Peruna curing women, and I though perhaps it would help me.
                        I bought a bottle and before it was finished I felt better. I kept on taking
                        it, and after three months' faithful use I was a well woman and able to do
                        the work and undergo the strain of younger days."-- Elizabeth Ferguson.</p>
                    <p>In view of the great multitude of women suffering from some form of female
                        disease and yet unable to find any cure, Dr. Hartman, the renowned
                        gynecologist has announced his willingness to direct the treatment of as
                        many cases as make application to him during the summer months without
                        charge.</p>
                    <p>The treatment will be conducted by correspondence. The doctor will prescribe
                        all medicines, applications, hyglenic and dietary regulations necessary to
                        complete a cure. The medicines prescribed can be obtained at all drug
                        stores. This offer will hold good only during the summer months. Any woman
                        can become a regular patient by sending a written statement of her age,
                        condition of life, history and symptoms of her derangements. </p>
                    <p>All cases of female diseases, including menstrual irregularities,
                        displacements, ulcerations, inflammations, discharges, irritation of the
                        ovaries, tumors and dropsy of the abdomen, should apply at once and become
                        registered as regular patients. All correspondence will be held strictly
                        confidential.</p>
                    <p>As is well known, Dr. Hartman is the president of the Hartman Sanitarium, an
                        institution which has a department devoted exclusively to the treatment of
                        female diseases. He is thus brought to see thousands of such cases every
                        year, the most of whom return to their homes to be treated by
                        correspondence. The principal remedy he relies upon in such cases is Peruna,
                        which every woman should have who has any affection of this kind. Those
                        wishing to become patients should address Dr. S. B. Hartman, Columbus,
                        Ohio.</p>
                    <p>No one knows better than Dr. Hartman how much the women suffer with diseases
                        peculiar to their sex. No one knows better than he does how many of them
                        suffer with such diseases. Patiently, hopefully, wearily; and often
                        silently, they eke ont a miserable existence, year after year.</p>
                    <p>No martyr in poetry or heroine in romance makes a more touching appeal to
                        human sympathy than the woman burdened with the cares of a family trying to
                        carry the extra load of some tormenting and ever present female disease.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Hartman's sympathy for such is unbounded, and his willingness to help
                        them limited only to his power.</p>
                    <p>For directions everyone should read "The Ills of Life", a copy of which
                        surrounds such bottle. Peruna is for sale by all chemists and druggists at
                        five shillings per bottle or six bottles for twenty five shillings.</p>
                    <p>Those wishing direct correspondence with Dr. Hartman and can wait the
                        necessary delay in receiving a reply should address Dr. S. B. HARTMAN,
                        Columbus, Ohio, U.S.A.</p>

                    <head>ITALY AND TRIPOLI.</head>
                    <byline>(From Our Correspondent).</byline>
                    <p>Rome, May 21.- Perhaps more than any other country Italy has periods of
                        excitement over certain things, and now for about four weeks the whole
                        attention has been absorbed by foreign politics, especially by the question
                        of Tripoli, with revelations of all kinds, interpellations in the Senate
                        interrogations in the Chamber, and discussions of the Foreign Budget; so
                        that of those who are not accustomed to the nature of the country it might
                        seem that the Peninsula is going to declare war on the whole world, while in
                        reality in a fortnight all will be over. The question of Tripoli is,
                        however, very interesting, as Italy, seeing herself threatened with being
                        surrounded in the Mediterranean, succeeded in agreeing with England and
                        France that the only part of North Africa still belonging to the Sultan
                        should be left to her influence. Still, the will not occupy Tripoli, not
                        desiring to imitate what Franco did with Algiers and Tunis, and England with
                        Egypt, for many reasons, chiefly because, especially after the war with
                        Abyssinia, there is in Italy a very strong party against colonial
                        enterprise, and because a war with Turkey, no matter how easy, would
                        represent the loss of several millions, which might upset that balance of
                        the Budget of which the Italians are so proud. Besides, Italy at present is
                        allied with Germany and Austria, has reestablished the most friendly
                        relations with France, continues to have with England the traditional bonds,
                        and will do nothing to come to a rupture with the recluse of Yildiz Kiosk.
                        Therefore, the descendants of Macchiavelli have thought of a very curious
                        policy, that of warning the other Powers that no one can go to Tripoli
                        except Italy, who, however, will not use force to occupy it, except in case
                        her preferential rights are threatened ; but wishes to establish herself
                        between Egypt and Tunis in accord with the present owner of that territory,
                        making Conntantinople understand that if the Turk fought he would lore
                        Tripoli and a lot of money and men ; while, by coming to an understanding,
                        he may preserve important privileges there, save all his men, and get a
                        large indemnity or a considerable yearly income.</p>

                        causes (for they are almost numberless), its symptoms are much the same; the
                        more prominent being sleeplessness, sense of prostration or weariness,
                        depression of spirits and want of energy for all the ordinary affairs of
                        life. Now, what alone is absolutely essential in all such cases is increased

                    <p>London, May 1O.</p>
                    <p>It is satisfactory to notice that Mr. Balfour's tactful speech on the defence
                        of the country has excited no resentment in France. Every nation must in the
                        necessity of things consider the possibility of war with every other'
                        nation, and the taking of precautions against it is no evidence of
                        unfriendliness. The Liberte among other journals, notes that Mr. Balfour was
                        only speaking in the abstract in taking France as a test case. But it was
                        done so delicately by the Premier that no other interference could have been
                        made from his remarks.</p>
                    <p>Says the “Times" :— This country has no reason to be dissatisfied with the
                        reception accorded abroad to Mr. Balfour's speech upon Imperial defence.
                        Justice has been generally done to the purely defensive character of his
                        whole survey of the situation, and to the total absence of anything that
                        might savour, however remotely, of designs against the interests of any
                        other country. Reasonable men every where are aware that our temper, our
                        policy, and our large commercial interests combine to render us extremely
                        averse from aggression or provocative adventure. For defence we can rely
                        upon a united people at home, and upon the co-operation of our
                        fellow-subjects all over the world, while invasion of the rights of others
                        would be profoundly unpopular throughout the whole Empire. Indeed, it may be
                        said that, if ever England should endanger the peace of the world, it would
                        be by her weakness, not by her strength; by offering temptations to
                        cupidity, not by exciting legitimate fears of aggression. A feebly detended
                        British Empire would be the greatest of perils to the general tranquillity.
                        The spoils would be too rich and too varied to be left to any single
                        aggressor, and the division of the inheritance would involve the civilised
                        world in sanguinary struggles. We have examples always before our eyes in
                        Turkey and in China of the dangers to peace involved in the combination of
                        weakness with coveted possessions. Our possessions doubt less excite envy in
                        some quarters, and our free institutions are highly obnoxious to rulers who
                        desire to impose their arbitrary will upou the millions who own their sway.
                        But the instinct of awakening peoples is on the other side. Collectively
                        they see in our democratic institutions the ideal of their political
                        imagination and individually they find in the British Empire opportunities
                        equal to those of Englishmen and infinitely greater than they could expect
                        were our possessions to fall into the hands of those who most actively
                        desire to take our place. The British Empire, like the United States, is
                        open on equal terms to all men of whatever nationality who give fair promise
                        of being decent citizens, and offers to all a degree of freedom and
                        prosperity which they could not enjoy more folly, and in many cases would
                        enjoy less fully, wore the flag that under which they were born.</p>
                    <p>The king of Spain is so pleased at the King of England's courtesy in
                        appointing him a General in the British Army that he has conferred upon him
                        the rank of an honorary Admiral in the Spanish Navy. Such exchange of
                        courtesies symbolical of international friendship is peculiarly pleasing to
                        the imagination of the Spaniards, and it will, therefore, serve an a proper
                        prelude to King Alfonso’s approaching visit to this country. The young King
                        is, furthermore, a Royal Celebs in search of a wife, or so, at least, one
                        gathers from his reply to the address of the President of the Congress, in
                        which his Majesty expressed his earnest wish for the speedy arrival of the
                        "happy event for our country and my home" to which Senor Romero Robledo had
                        referred. Inasmuch as “'tis love that makes the world go round," and royal
                        weddings do not happen every day of the week, there will be no lack of
                        speculation as to what the young King's visits to France and to England may
                        end in. For the present, however, it would be premature to express any
                        opinion as to the probabilities. All we know is that there is a crown
                        waiting for some fair and gracious head to wear. May it speedily find a
                        wearer.</p>
                    <p>Self centred as they have hitherto been, the Tibetans evidently know their
                        own interest when; they see it. The welcome news comes that they are
                        accepting the new condition of affairs under the British agreement in a
                        peaceable spirit, and are even cordial in the relations with the British. So
                        far as the people of Tibet are concerned, this attitude has characterised
                        them almost from the beginning of our connection with them. Historians of
                        the famous expedition tell us that the people were always agreeable except
                        when the fear of the Llama and his mistaken advisers compelled them to adopt
                        an offensive front. They were glad to welcome the intrepid strangers, seeing
                        in them those infinite possibilities which men groaning under evil rule tore
                        so quick to grasp. They even embarrassed the Englishmen by hanging too much
                        on their skirts and refusing to depart. Now that the dread of punishment
                        from their own vindictive authorities has been removed, it is only to be
                        expected that they should continue to regard our temporary occupation with a
                        friendly eye. For we bring hope to those who have walked in darkness for
                        long years. </p>
                    <p>All sensible people will earnestly hope that I measures will be taken to put
                        a stop to the proposed march of huge armies of the unemployed upon London.
                        We really cannot afford deliberately to produce a serious public danger just
                        because the Independent Labour Party happens to be in want of an
                        advertisement, and the proposal is as much objected to by the Labour members
                        themselves as by the representatives of any other class. The reason alleged
                        for the suggested demonstration, namely, the supposed inactivity of the
                        Government with reference to the Unemployed Bill, is mainly fictitious, and
                        would, in any case, be quite inadequate. London has her own unemployed
                        problem to solve, and no one but Mr. Keir Hardie would imagine that the
                        solution could be made easier by pouring into the capital some thousands
                        more of the out-of-works, many, perhaps most, of whom will remain to make
                        the difficulty of obtaining employment greater than ever.</p>
                    <p>The delinquencies of motor-cars have already occupied the House of Commons
                        two or three times lately in a desultory way. A more serious treatment is
                        now proposed, and Mr. Arthur Stanley has given notice of application for an
                        early date for the discussion, which will be pivoted on the vote for the
                        Local Government Board. The move will not be a premature one. Excesses of
                        speed are to form the text of the debate, but there are other points which
                        may be thrashed out with profit One is a common yet very dangerous
                        infraction of the rules of the road by "cutting corners.” Motor- cars,
                        hansom cabs, and Royal Mail vans are the chief offenders in this respect,
                        and of the three the first, by virtue of their speed alone, create
                        infinitely the heaviest danger. Another matter which is almost certain to be
                        discussed is the allocation of responsibility between owner and chauffeur.
                        We might do worse than take a hint from Germany. There the owner bears the
                        entire responsibility of anything that happens, irrespective of whether be
                        himself is on the car or not. Such a regulation makes for caution bo‘h in
                        the selection of the driver and in the methods of the employs whose master,
                        thus penalised, will himself exact the utmost penalty for any dereliction. </p>
                    <p>What cannot fail to prove a most important development in the system of
                        University education is to be introduced in the autumm at Princetown
                        University, U.S.A. A special fund of £500,000 is being raised, and the
                        intention is to devote this sum chiefly to the employment of a number of
                        additional tutors, who will get into close touch with the men and give to
                        each a real and personal attention. "An approximation to the praotice in
                        English universities"— so an American paper innocently characterises the
                        scheme. How ironical the words must sound to anyone with experience of the
                        aforesaid practice! Perhaps one of the weakest spots in our own university
                        system is to be found in the very point to which, America is about to devote
                        its reforming energies. The haphazard way in which the young and probably
                        not over-curious student is allowed to find out for himself the details of
                        his studies, sometimes even the very list of the subjects which he is to
                        take up, is, in many colleges at any rate, one of the things that render our
                        university tutorial system a very whited sepulchre of emptiness. It is we
                        who, once more, will have to learn from America, instead of the other way
                        round.</p>
                    <p>If Mr. Kipling is to be believed—and we see do reason why he should not be
                        believed—'it's Tommy this, and Tommy that, and Tommy, how's your soul?"
                        According to a writer in a London paper, who signs himself “Corporal," it is
                        rather the body of the private soldier which needs attention from the
                        authorities. The King's uniform, he says, should create pride in a man.
                        Indeed, he has not a word to say against it as a uniform. In his regiment,
                        he declares, 'it is not the uniform we object to, but being obliged to
                        squeeze ourselves into a garment which no man who cared for his health would
                        willingly wear for five minutes." He proceeds to details. “How many 10st.
                        7lbs. civilians would care to be laced into a 30-inch waist, which is the
                        average size for 5ft. 6ins. to 5ft. 7ins. soldiers?" Very few, we should be
                        disposed to imagine. It certainly seems more than a little hard that the
                        Army, which has done its share in making us Englishmen what we are, should
                        not be allowed to breathe, it is the birthright of every Briton to be
                        permitted to expand his chest. There may be some reason why thirty inches
                        should be considered the ideal waist measurement of a military man, but we
                        cannot imagine the reason. There is something in the idea of a British
                        soldier being crammed into a uniform too tight for him which is repugnant to
                        one’s notion of freedom. We hope that the authorities will stretch a point
                        or two.</p>
                    <p>"John Strange Winter," (Mrs. Henrietta E. V. Stannard,) sends the following
                        letter to the "Morning Post," dated May 12th :—</p>
                    <p>It may interest your readers to know that yesterday morning I saw a lady
                        wearing a crinoline go by Albert Gate into the Park. It was not a mere
                        stiffening about the hem of her garments, but was unmistakably a series of
                        hoops of steel, apparently made on precisely the same model as those which
                        went out with the siege of Paris in 1870. It undulated and it jerked, and as
                        the wearer was a very fine woman with a small waist, and an extremely smart,
                        rather large French hat, it gave an air of vulgarity almost incredible to
                        believe. Meantime pledges against this hideous fashion are still pouring in
                        upon me, and I shall be only too glad to receive more and more; as a proof
                        that all women are not willing to allow themselves to be driven into the
                        dangerous and the grotesque at the instance of commercial enterprise.</p>
                    <p>All users of the telephone must at one time or another have been struck with
                        the possibility of danger of infection, from the telephone mouthpieces,
                        particularly, in the various public call offices, and it is, therefore, very
                        reassuring to have a report from the medical officer of health of the City
                        on the subject. Dr. Klein, the eminent bacteriologist, has carried out
                        experiments with the sanction of the Telephone Company with most
                        satisfactory results. In none of the mouthpieces tested were there any
                        tubercule bacilli present, and we are told that there is no real risk in the
                        use of the public call offices.</p>
                    <p>For the last ten years the doctors have been searching for the cause of that
                        increase in appendicitis which Sir Frederick Treves has described as the
                        most remarkable medical phenomenon of the closing years of the last century.
                        Now Professor Symes- Thompson has come forward with a suggestion that it is
                        due to neglected teeth, became the same organisms which are found in the
                        septic tooth are also found in the appendix. It seems curious, if this be
                        the fact, that the disease should be prevalent among those classes whose
                        care of the teeth amounts almost to a religion.</p>
                    <p>The first of the two theatres which are to adorn the island carved out by the
                        new thoroughfares, Kingsway and Aldwych, is now finished, and will be opened
                        to the public on Monday next. Splendid in itself, the Waldorl Theatre is
                        really only an earnest of what is to be done architecturally on the imposing
                        boulevard behind the new Gaiety. A comprehensive scheme has been adopted
                        whereby the Waldorf and Mr. Hicks's theatres, with the big Waldorf Hotel
                        which is to separate them, will be uniform in their classic design, and the
                        whole facade in white Portland stone, softened by well-designed allegorical
                        groups, promises to be one of the show theatre of London. The theatre now
                        rising on the easterly side of the island will, indeed, almost be a
                        duplicate of the Waldorf externally, although internal similarity, even if
                        desired, will be out of the question, seeing that the County Council has
                        decided that the Waldorf is to be the last three-tier theatre built in
                        London.</p>
                    <p>As might have been anticipated, Lord Ave- bury's Bill for the closing of
                        shops and prohibition of street trading on Sundays has met with a
                        considerable opposition from the Jewish members of the community. The latter
                        claim that if they close their shops on the Jewish Sabbath they ought to be
                        allowed to open on Sundays. Nor is the argument confined to the Jews. It is
                        maintained that unless some such arrangement be recognised everything would
                        come to a complete standstill on the seventh day. There would be no taking a
                        holiday if there were no trains and buses, for instance. A complete
                        dislocation of this kind no doubt would commend itself to a section. At a
                        meeting of the Lord's Day Observance Society yesterday, at least one
                        reverend speaker expressed the view that leaving London for a day in the
                        country on Sunday was a highly reprehensible act.</p>
                    <p>Scotland has suffered so long from the reproach of being a “drinking" nation
                        that it is satisfactory to glean some evidence of a reformation in this
                        respect. The report of the Prison Commissioners, just issued, states that
                        cases of breach of the peace and drunkenness show a large redaction. The
                        average number of committals for these offences during the previous five
                        years was 38,848. In 1904 they were 32,959, a decrease equal to 15 per
                        cent</p>
                    <p>A reviewer of books in a daily paper has been looking into the matter of the
                        Society novel, and has come to the conclusion that, if the novelists are to
                        be relied on, there is a marked scarcity of decent people in the fashionable
                        world. In three books, professing to reflect with accuracy the manners and
                        customs of the Best People, we find no fewer than nine of the characters
                        (including the hero and heroine of one of the books) cheating at Bridge. To
                        judge from the modern author, the standard of card-morality in Belgravia
                        would appear to be lower than that in a Bowery saloon.</p>
                    <p>After its gigantic size, the thing that impresses one most in "Diplodocus
                        Carnegii,” whose model is now to be seen at South Kensington, is the
                        extraordinary smallness of the mouth and head. To keep such a huge body
                        supplied with the necessary nutriment through such a comparatively tiny
                        mouth, Diplodocus most have been eating all day long. He must have been a
                        comparatively peaceful beast, for he can never have had time to do anything
                        but eat between his intervals of sleep, and his brain was so minute that he
                        can hardly have had the sense to outwit or outfight any serious
                        combatant.</p>
                    <p>It is suggested that vegetation in prehistoric times may have been more
                        nutritions than in our day, and that a greater amount of nitrogen may have
                        been assimilated in a given mass of food. Size is the result of feeding, and
                        it is certainly remarkable that these enormous animals tend to disappear
                        with the lapse of ages. Even in creatures in which the mouth is small the
                        rest of the body appears to have been well developed, proving that they bad
                        time to produce this development by exercise, it may be that the power of
                        the soil in producing vegetation has been to some extent worked out</p>
