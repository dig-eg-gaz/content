                            Aly the name of Cairo has been linked with the history of the progress
                            of electrical science by the fact that not only was the electric light
                            installation which he had erected in his gardens at Shoubra the first to
                            be erected in Africa, but it even placed Cairo ahead of London and Paris
                            themselves in this respect. Now, after the lapse of many years, Cairo
                            has again secured for itself a place in the history of electrical
                            science, having established it record as the first town or station in
                            the African continent to adopt electricity as an aid in the signalling
                            of its railways. This was done on Saturday last, when Mr. James- Punter,
                            the chief of the Signalling Department of the State Railways
                            Administration, presided with his accustomed vim and tireless energy at
                            the inauguration of the first section of the new electric-pneumatic
                            signalling installation that has just been completed under his
                            supervision. </p>
                        <p>As our readers are aware, the Railway Commission which lately issued its
                            report upon the administration of the State Railways, in a somewhat
                            doubtful and hesitating way, expressed the opinion that this new
                            installation was an unnecessary luxury, but we are satisfied that if the
                            Commission could have had a really sufficient opportunity of studying
                            the question they would, so far from even hinting at disapproval, have
                            warmly commended the wise foresight the Administration have displayed in
                            the adoption of this system of signalling for the Cairo station. How
                            wise that foresight has been only time can fully show, but the truth is
                            that if only needs a fair knowledge of the merits of the system, and of
                            the circumstances which specially call for its application, to see that
                            Cairo is a station which urgently required the adoption of this or some
                            nearly equivalent system. It is of course quite outside of our scope to
                            go into anything like technical details here, but we may say that,
                            taking only one of the great advantages that the system offers, our
                            readers can judge for themselves of its utility. The advantage to which
                            we refer is the economy of space. Cairo station is, owing to the
                            peculiar circumstances under which it has developed from its first
                            primitive and very limited form, from the railway man’s point of view, a
                            most awkward station. The main through line connecting the Lower and
                            Upper Egypt lines winds from the terminus platform to the riverside in a
                            serpentine fashion that opposes great difficulty to effective
                            signalling; and to make the matter worse, to provide for its constantly
                            growing need of room for locomotive sheds, carriage depots, goods
                            platforms, sidings, repairing shops, and other necessary and absolutely
                            indispensable conveniences of the service, it has had to branch off from
                            this main line a number of sidings and line leading to these various
                            sheds and depots, etc., both above and below the terminus platforms,
                            every available inch of space being utilised in some form or other. The
                            station has thus become a long, straggling, winding line with a number
                            of branches springing from it and leading to large areas of auxiliary
                            lines, and thus in addition to the eighty or so passenger trains
                            arriving or starting from the terminus, there is
                            <!-- unable to read this word due to smudging --> the day and most of
                            the night a restless bustling to and fro of engines and carriages and
                            goods wagons passing from one part of the station to another in
                            accordance with the exigencies of the service, and all this traffic has
                            to be conducted under grave difficulties as to the signalling due to the
                            irregular curving of the lines and the resulting impossibility of
                            engine-drivers seeing signals until quite close to them. This fact alone
                            shows how necessary it is in this station to adopt the most efficient
                            method of signalling attainable. But to this complexity a most important
                            feature of the ease to be added, is the scanty room that the main lines
                            and auxiliary branches have. This is so small indeed as to be almost
                            prohibitive of any attempt to provide effective signalling by the use of
                            the ordinary mechanical apparatus, for this demands a very large amount
                            of space, the necessary connecting rods, eta, for the working of the
                            points and signals at some spots needing almost as much ground space as
                            the lines themselves. Here the advantage of the electric-pneumatic
                            system speaks for itself, for by this system, instead of a series of
                            iron rods occupying at least as many feet of space in width as there are
                            rods, the electric system employs only an air pipe and an electric cable
                            carrying the necessary wires, all of which can be laid in an accessible
                            and secure form in the space of a little more than what a couple of iron
                            connecting rods would require. This fact alone quite justifies the
                            adoption of this system for Cairo station. </p>
                        <p>There are several other advantages that this system of signalling offers,
                            but space forbids our dealing with these at present, and the same
                            imperative reason prevents our attempting to give our readers any idea
                            of the nature, construction, or working of the apparatus it employs.
                            This however we hope to be able to do in connection with the completion
                            of the installation, which is now not very far off, and we must
                            therefore now content ourselves with congratulating the Administration
                            upon the success that has amended its enterprise and upon the efficiency
                            of its Signalling Depart merit, which, under the direction of its chief,
                            who is a specially trained expert in railway signalling, is very
                            evidently accomplishing very valuable work. It is, we believe, an
                            accepted axiom of railway work in the present day that the efficiency of
                            the services rendered by any given line must to a very large extent be
                            dependent upon the efficiency of its signalling this efficiency being,
                            when all has been said and done, the one really possible means of
                            increasing the working power of a line, since it is obviously useless
                            for a railway administration to provide extra power or vehicles to meet
                            increasing traffic, if, owing to defective or insufficient signalling,
                            the free movement of these is impeded as it must be when the signalling
                            is riot up to the highest modern standard in all respects. </p>

                    <p>Maternity Home.</p>
                    <p>The 'Xmas Tree fête organised in aid of that deserving charity, the
                        Alexandria Maternity Home, which took place at the Khedivial Hotel on
                        Saturday last, was a most brilliant and successful function. It was
                        at¬tended by a bewildering number of fair members of Alexandria Society and
                        an army of little ones, whose happy faces and charming costumes formed a
                        very pleasing and harmonious coup d’ ceil. The 'Xmas Tree was, of course,
                        the centre of attraction, and it provided abundance of delight to the little
                        folks. Dancing, too, was engaged in, to the strains of the band of the Royal
                        Dublin Fusiliers (kindly lent for the occasion), which also discoursed a few
                        well-chosen selections of music. A native con¬juror gave a display of his
                        ability without fee or charge, and a buffet was placed at the disposal of
                        the children, who did ample justice to its contents. Altogether, the
                        gather¬ing was of a most enjoyable character, and will long be remembered by
                        the little ones who were fortunate enough to be present. </p>

                    <p>We are officially authorised to contradiot the rumour emanating from

                        post at the further end of the bay of Bomba, 250 kilometres to the west of
                        Sollum. </p>
                    <p>The report is believed to be inspired either by Anglophobes who wish to alarm
                        Turkey and perhaps Italy by tales of British designs on Bomba, or by those
                        Egyptophobes, unhappily too numerous in Turkish official circles, who are
                        prone to show their annoyance at the progress Egypt has made with British
                        help in the last 20 years, by attributing the most amazing designs to
                        Egyptians of importance and by arresting or insulting Egyptian visitors to
                        Syria and the Turkish ports. </p>

                        battleships which attempted to run the blockade at Port Arthur, and
                        subsequently took refuge at Kiouchaw owing to the serious damages she
                        sustain¬ed at the hands of Togo’s fleet. </p>

                    <p>(FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT).</p>
                    <p>Port-Said, Sunday.</p>
                    <p>We are informed that the new premises of the local branch of the Bank of
                        Egypt Ltd., which have been under construction for some time will be
                        occupied from the commencement of the New Year. </p>
                    <p>The building is on a fine scale and very ornamental. We understand, however,
                        that most of the interior fittings, electric lighting, etc, will take a
                        further five to six weeks to complete </p>
                    <p>When finished it will be considered one of the finest public buildings in
                        Port Said. </p>

                    <head>“ANTAR” AT THE KHEDIVIAL.</head>
                    <p>Such was the chill and draught, so wide¬spread the coughing and sneezing,
                        that even the Bedouin dresses, the shepherds, the ad¬jurations to the sun
                        and desert, etc., could not hide the presence of winter—nor could we catch
                        more than about two fifths of the play. It is the well-known Antar story,
                        sen¬timentalized, for the real Antar was a great fighter, had a reasonably
                        long married life, and died in battle. As a play the piece hangs fire from
                        time to time, and does not quite “fit” here and there, in its various
                        stages. So far as we could hear them, there were some good lines and fine
                        phrases, chiefly in the longer passages; in dialogue the author occasionally
                        tripped, and even tumbled down now and again. M. Daragon’s figure and voice
                        were highly suitable. Mme Moreno was less successful, rather strident at
                        times, and if we may venture so far, not nearly so attractive as usual, not
                        befog a brunette by nature. M. Monteux’s measured, almost drawl¬ing, tones
                        were effective, much more so than the sustained war cries of the others.
                        These three are undoubtedly a class above the rest in their knowledge of the
                        voice and its re¬sources—not necessarily its force. We hope to see Mr.
                        Chekri Ganem’s play again once, or twice, if possible under quieter
                        conditions, so as to form a more adequate opinion. After all an oriental
                        production should obtain more attention than the average 1850 drama which so
                        often holds the Cairo stage. </p>

                    <p>The total quantity of cigarettes exported from Egypt last month was 60,475
                        kilos, as compared with 54,035 kilos in November of last year, an increase
                        of 6,440 kilos. The exports for the eleven months of the year totalled
                        630,046 kilos, which is an increase of 70,816 kilos on the figures for the
                        same period of 1904. Coming to importing countries, the largest increase was
                        under the head of Germa¬ny, which increased her imports by 47,388 kilos. The
                        next largest increase was in the case of France (10,829 kilos). Other
                        increases are shown under the heads of British possessions in the Far East,
                        Austria, Hungary, China, Holland, Italy, Sweden and Norway, etc. England
                        imported 7,118 kilos less than last year, and other countries which showed
                        decreases were Belgium, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland, America, and British
                        Mediterranean posses¬sions. </p>

                    <p>POLICY OF THE DIRECTORS.</p>
                    <p>THE UNEXPENDED CAPITAL.</p>
                    <p>The ordinary general meeting of the Egyp¬tian Delta Land and Investment
                        Company, Limited, was held on the 21st inst. at Winches¬ter House, Old Broad
                        Street, E C., Sir Auckland Colvin, K C.S.I., K.C.M.G., C.I.E. (chairman of
                        the company), presiding. </p>
                    <p>The secretary (Mr. F. J. Horne) having read the notice calling the meeting. </p>
                    <p>The Chairman said: The accounts show that we have not yet effected any sales
                        of land and that we still have a large proportion of our capital uninvested,
                        but this most not be held to mean that we could not either have sold our
                        present holdings at a profit or increased them to the full extent of our
                        re¬sources if we had felt it to our interest to do so. We are not a merely
                        speculative com¬pany, baying and selling as opportunity may offer, or
                        looking to snatch immediate profits as the means of our prosperity. We
                        regard the company as having for its object the placing of sound investments
                        in land or similar property, which may require time to yield a good return,
                        but which, with due care and development, are reasonably sore to give us
                        adequate profits. Taking first the properties we have acquired, their
                        development has de¬pended and does depend in many cases upon the
                        arrangements to be made by the Egyptian State Railway or the Delta Light
                        Railways, but these are now for the most part sufficient¬ly known to enable
                        this work to be taken in hand, and arrangements are being made accordingly.
                        It is stated in the report that some 479 feddans or acres of land have been
                        purchased. It is necessary to explain that some 45 feddans are favorably
                        situated in Cairo, Tantah and other towns, while the rest may be regarded as
                        suburban. In addition to these purchases we have aquired a l-6th interest in
                        a land purchase effected by another company, which is contiguous to a large
                        area which again we hope to purchase in partnership when certain existing
                        difficulties are removed. The earliest lots which we are about to take in
                        hand are those in Cairo and its immediate vicinity, and here the company
                        will shortly proceed to offer plots for Bale for build¬ing purposes and to
                        build on its own account. It is proposed to offer a few of the said plots
                        for sale by auction, in the first instance at a low upset price, but if
                        certain properties we have purchased in the neighbourhood of the Helouan
                        Railway prove as attractive as we have reason to hope, we may expect
                        substantial profits from their development This may probably involve our
                        building some villa resi¬dences, or aiding purchasers to erect their own
                        buildings thereon. In Cairo and other important towns it will also probably
                        prove most advantageous to build shops and offices and flats on land which
                        we have purchased. These will certainly procure good rentals. A considerable
                        portion of our unexpended capital is thus likely to be brought into use, but
                        the main reason of this being so much larger at present than was anticipated
                        is chiefly because greater delay than we could have expected has occurred in
                        the definite making over to the Delta Light Railways of the Menoufieh
                        Provinces. As yon are probably aware, the price of land in our sphere of
                        operations has increased so rapidly since this company started that whatever
                        might prove to be its ultimate value it was clear to us that no immediate
                        profit could be reckoned upon by purchases effect¬ed during a period of
                        inflation, and the directors have hesitated to look up funds for an
                        indefinite period with the possibility of a considerable reaction in the
                        property market. You will have observed from the profit and loss account
                        that the working charges of the company have been kept very low, but we
                        consider that the time has now arrived when the Land Company should somewhat
                        enlarge its staff, and some farther appointments will have to be made to
                        cope with the work now to be entered upon. I may add that under
                        arrange¬ments made by the Egyptian Delta Light Railways your financial year
                        will terminate in future at March 31st, so the next accounts will be for a
                        half-year only, and will be present¬ed to you six months hence, when I hope
                        there will be increased signs of progress. I now move: </p>
                    <p>"That the report of the directors dated December 1st, 1905, together with
                        statement of accounts and balance-sheet for the year ended September 30th,

                    <p>THE DAISY CHAIN.</p>
                    <p>NOTABLE DISPLAY OF TALENT.</p>
                    <p>The concert given in the Parish Room, Bulkeley, in aid of the Church Expenses
                        Fond of All Saints', Ramleh, on Friday last, was an ample guarantee of the
                        existence of real amateur talent in the neighbourhood. The performance was
                        opened with Mendelssohn’s No. I Trio, for violin, piano, and violincello,
                        played by Messrs. Artelli, Ehrlich and Ruffer respectively. The well-known
                        andante move¬ment of this trio was rendered with much taste and feeling and
                        was immensely appre¬ciated by the large audience assembled. The next item
                        were two little songs sang by Mrs. Edward Moss, whose exceptionally
                        cultivated style and beautiful tones were heard to foil advantage Her
                        sympathetic and graceful ren¬dering of the second song "My Treasure,” was
                        received with all the appreciation it deserved. Mr. H. V. Hall next appeared
                        with two violin solos, one of which, the well-known "Simple Aveu," received
                        a due acknowledgment of its graceful harmonies and contrasts. We were next
                        favoured with a very old but none the less welcome friend in Mendelssohn’s
                        "Greeting,” sang with much taste by Mrs. Violet Alderson and Miss Harden,
                        and this was follow¬ed by a song from Mr. K. Macaulay, who gave a really
                        delightful rendering of “I’ll sing thee songs of Araby.’’ Mr. E. Ehrlich was
                        announced to sing, but unfortunately was prevented from doing so by a bad
                        cold. Mrs. Edward Moss was again heard in a song entitled “Sunbeams," which
                        was sung with snob spirit and feeling that the audience were clamorous in
                        their demands for an encore, which was duly accorded. The final movement of
                        Trio No. I was next played and seemed to give even greater satisfaction than
                        its predecessor. It was played with a vigour and precision that quite
                        stirred up the audience and at its termi¬nation it was received with a storm
                        of applause. The next item, a song by Mr. Macaulay, “Hybrias the Cretan,"
                        though sang with great vigour, did not bring out the exceptional qua¬lity of
                        his middle tones as his former song did. The programme was concluded by Mr.
                        H. V. Hall, who played Raff's “Cavatina.’’ In this he gave genuine pleasure,
                        and it was evident that where his bowing lacked precision it was far more
                        due to that nervousness which so often plays havoc with amateur violinists,
                        than from any lack of musical and technical ability. It only remains to say
                        that a concert which dis played such exceptional amateur talent has, by the
                        verdict of all who enjoyed it, seldom been given. </p>
