                        <p>The weather yesterday was, to say the least, extraordinary for the month
                            of May. Dark, threatening clouds, instead of the usual bright sunshine,
                            prevailed in the early morning, and this was followed by rather heavy
                            downpours of rain. In the afternoon the weather cleared up, but about 8
                            p.m. the wind veered to the west and a severe thunderstorm, accompanied
                            by frequent and extraordinarily vivid flashes of lightning, passed over
                            the town. Strong gales prevailed during the night, the force of the
                            anemometer reaching 81 kil. The forecast for to-day is bright and warm,
                            with probably showers and wind. </p>

                            A-noDg Europeans the general feeling is that
                            British prestige will be greatly enhanced in the
                            Ottoman Empire and indeed in all Moslem
                            countries, Egypt included, and that the British
                            Government and its representatives will reap
                            a gratifying reward for their firmness. Whether

                            the frontier of the Firman of 1892 was
                            unknown at the time of writing, bat it was
                            generally believed that these concessions and
                            any others demanded by Great Britain in the
                            ultimatum—or "pen-ultimatum” — would be
                            granted by the Porte.
                            Rumours went about Cairo on Saturday
                            prophesying rioting and what not on Sunday
                            or Monday. There was little direct evidence
                            that any outbreak or demonstration had been
                            organised. As a rule the stories were based on
                            the blood-curdling hints of Berbereen who had
                            bean found sharpening knives or the more
                            appalling language of cabmer, but there can be
                            no doubt that then was a certain amount of
                            onrest on one side and a certain amount of
                            apprehension on the other. To guard against
                            any possibilities of the sort the British military
                            authorities kept their troops confined to bar-
                            racks and ready for instant work, but the quiet
                            of a dull and lowering day was unbroken by the
                            very slightest disturbance.
                            The statement recently made by a con-
                            temporary that a force was setting cut for
                            El Arish is quite ins oo a rate. Kaimakam
                            Parker Bey, who left for the frontier a few
                            days ago, is the only addition to the garrison
                            of the little border town, though perhaps our
                            contrère wishes to point out that the gallant
                            cffioer might be described as a host io himself.
                            The Nekhl force numbered 100 coastguards.
                            and leu than 40 soldiers, with two Maxims and
                            a Krupp. The statement that certain units had
                            been warned for service in the Sinai is, we are
                            informed, inaccurate, and it was never intend-

                            A considerable amount of speculation has
                            been aroused by the surrender of the Porte as
                            to the probable effect of recent events en the
                            prestige of the Sultan. In our opinion it will
                            suffer terribly. The Sultan and Khalif has been
                            led by incompetent advisers into an impasse
                            from which he has had to retire with difficulty
                            and without dignity. Previous surrenders to
                            naval demonstrations or threats of demonstra-
                            tion had been made before the overwhelming
                            force of the European Concert or in trifling
                            commercial disputes or affaire connected, as a
                            rule, with the status of protected subjects. Bat
                            in the present dispute Abdul Hamid Khan has
                            been compelled to give way before the pressure
                            of a single Power, and though public opinion
                            in Turkey is usually dormant, it may prove
                            that the wounded pride of the Osmanli ruling
                            caste may avenge itself on advisers of their
                            sovereign. In Arabia, where the Sultan s
                            authority is by no means firmly established,
                            the news of the withdrawal from Tabah before
                            a show of force will encourage the Yemen
                            rebels and the Wahabis of Nejd. Yet if the
                            Porte, abandoning a policy of useless aggres-
                            sion at the expense of its neighbours, make a
                            genuine attempt to improve the internal condi-
                            tion of the Empire and to place its disorganised
                            finances upon a sound basis, the Tabah inci-
                            | dent may prove the beginning of a new and
                            happier era for the last great independent
                            Moslem State. We wish we could look with
                            any confidence to such a result.</p>

                    our readers will remember, contained in the

                    The Porte’s answer to this demand is expected

                    Tabah question from Constantinople — </p>
                    <p>“As the occupation of Tabah by the Turkish
                    troops was only intended to preserve the
                    status quo in the Sinaitio Peninsola by pre-
                    venting the erection of military fortifications,
                    and as ths necessary guarantees have finally
                    been received, the Ottoman Government
                    has consequently issued orders to the Turk-

                         the Hedjaz Railway, which is a vital vein
                        in the body of the Ottoman Empire.</p>
                        <p>"Al Moayad,” while hoping that Tarkey
                        has preserved her dignity in the arrangement
                        concluded, is satisfied at the speedy solution
                        of the Sinai question, owing to the relations
                        of the Egyptians with the Occupation, whioh
                        is predominant in this country, and on the other
                        band, owing to the religious and political ties
                        which bind them to Turkey, with which they
                        have great sympathies. Had the crisis become
                        more acute, concludes our contemporary,
                        God knows what the consequences might
                        have been.</p>
                        <p>Reuter’s telegrams, remarks "Al-Ommeh,”
                        give one to understand that the Sublime
                        Porte has agreed to evacuate Tabah unconditionally,
                         but this is not in accordance with the
                        real facts of the case. Sir E. Grey, the British
                        Minister for Foreign Affairs, has declared that
                        an international commission must be appointed 
                        to define the boundaries of the Sinai peninsula,
                         and at the same time the Turkish troops
                        will withdraw from Tabah. It seems, continues
                        our contemporary, that the Ottoman Government
                         believes that her rights will be
                        preserved by arbitration, if the news of the
                        temporary evacuation of Tabah by the Turkish
                        troops is true. “The Sublime Porte,” concludes
                         “Al-Ommeh,” “would not Surrender so
                        easily in snoh a serious question anless its
                        object were attained.”</p>

                <p>Now that the frontier incident is over El
                    Arish will lapse again into the insignificance of
                    a desert frontier town. It has occasionally
                    figured in history and had once to do with
                    General Bonaparte. On the 17th of February,
                    1799, the Frenoh force engaged in the invasion
                    of Syria arrived before it. Three days later the
                    Turkish general surrendered. Gaza fell after a
                    feeble defence, and some 800 of the El Arish
                    garrison, who, it was alleged, had broken their
                    parole, were included in the shooting of Jaffa.
                    It was at El Arish, also, that Kléber and Sir
                    Sydney Smith concluded, in the following year,
                    that convention which was not to take effect.
                    For Kléber, with his remnant of 12,000, fell
                    upon the 70,000 Turks who were enveloping
                    him, and ‘ in the most amazing fight the sun
                    of Egypt ever saw,” swept that army out of
                    existence.</p>

                    <p>LONDON, Monday.</p>
                    <p>The “Daily Telegraph’s” Constantinople
                    correspondent says that the Sultan was practically
                     alone in opposing the British demands,
                    no Turk of position or intelligence supporting
                    him. All wish that England had come, not
                    only to settle the Tabah question but to
                    occupy Turkey.</p>
                    <p>The "Telegraph,” in its leading article, says
                    that Great Britain stands guard in Egypt for
                    two purposes — first, to defend the rights conferred
                    upon her by unsurpassed works of constructive
                     statesmanship which she has accomplished
                     single-handed in the interests of the
                    Egyptian people, and, secondly, the British
                    regime on the Nile is a new guarantee of the
                    interests of civilisation in the whole Pan-
                    Islamic sphere. It is useless of “Yildiz" to
                    dream of reconquering Cairo, and the Sultan,
                    by continuing to work against Great Britain,
                    can only end by bringing the whole of the
                    elaborate fabric of his late policy to the ground.</p>
                    <p>The two Notes addressed in 1892 by Lord
                    Cromer (then Sir Evelyn Baring) to Tigrane
                    Pasha, Egyptian Minister for Foreign Affairs,
                    and the Grand Vizier’s telegram to the Khedive,
                    elucidating the terms of the Sultan’s Firman
                    of Investiture, contain the statement of rights
                    which the British Government has been upholding
                     on behalf of Egypt and of Great
                    Britain against the Porte. On the accession
                     of the present Khedive in 1892 the
                    customary Firman of Investiture from the
                    8ultan was found to differ from that issued to
                    the late Khedive, Tewfik Pacha. As "no alteration
                    can be made in the Firmans regulating
                    the relations between the Sublime Porte and
                    Egypt without the consent of the British
                    Government,” Lord Cromer at once took up
                    the subject with Tigrane Pasha, and a correspondence
                     followed.</p>
                    <p>Previous firmans recognised the ancient limits of Egypt and the regions
                        thereto annexed. The firman of 1892 omitted all mention of the regions
                        annexed clause. The result of the correspondence is clearly and plainly set
                        forth by Lord Cromer in his closing letter to Tigrane Pasha. The following
                        passage sufficiently emphasises Great Britain’s position : — </p>
                        <p>“The late
                        Firman, if read by itself, appeared j to imply that the Sinai peninsula
                        would for the future depend administratively, not on the Khedivate of Egypt,
                        but on the Vilayet of the Hedjaz.</p>
                    <p>“Her Majesty's Government signified to
                    the Sublime Porte some weeks ago, through

                     their willingness to assent to this

                    <head>MUKTAR PASHA.</head>
                    <p>Haydar Midhat Bey, in a letter to the
                    “Tribune” remarks : — What astonishes me
                    is that Lord Cromer, who, as I can affirm
                    from an interview I had with him in the
                    month of November or December, 1899, refused
                    to recognize that Mukhtar Pasha enjoyed
                    any other quality than that of a simple private
                    gentleman of distinction living at Cairo, permitted
                    him to treat with the Khedive a question
                     in which the prestige of Great Britain was
                    at stake, and, above all, that he permitted him
                    to do so without him (Lord Cromer) being
                    present.</p>

                    <head>BRITISH PRESTIGE.</head>
                    <p>The Bey continues :— Now, the question is
                    whether that prestige will be restored in the
                    East to what it was formerly by the Sultan’s
                    yielding once more to the threats of a great
                    Power. It is permissible to doubt it. At the
                    time when the influence of England was preponderant
                     in Turkey, Great Britain, in the
                    eyes of the Turks, was of all the Powers the
                    one which, by her constant efforts, proved best
                    the interest she took in the moral and material
                    regeneration of Turkey. At that time England
                    considered that it was one of her greatest interests
                     to preserve the independence of a
                    Turkey regenerated by her aid. Is that the
                    case to-day ? Is it logical to hope that a demonstration,
                     of whioh one of the principal
                    objects would not be the liberation of the
                    Turks from a regime which weighs so heavily
                    on them, will enlist the sympathies of the
                    Turkish people ? Let those who in England
                    protest against the oppression of peoples reply
                    for me.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Balfour, rising at the olose of questions
                    in the House of Commons last Monday, said :
                    As the Secretary for Foreign Affairs is in his
                    place, perhaps be will allow me to ask him a
                    question with regard to the Egyptian Frontier.
                    We on this side have been scrupulously oareful
                    not to embarrass the Government by questions
                    —(cheers) - but if it is consistent with the
                    interests of the public service for the right hon.
                    gentleman to give the House and the country
                    information on the subject I am sure it will
                    cause very general satisfaction. (Hear, hear.)</p>
                    <p>Sir E. Grey —I quite agree that after all that
                    has appeared in the Press, and in view of the
                    fact that a similar question is to be put in
                    another place to-day, there should be some
                    answer given to the House. The British
                    Ambassador on Thursday last presented a
                    Note to the Porte inviting the Sultan to
                    agree to demarcation by Great Britain and
                    Turkey of the line from El Rafeb to the
                    head of the Gulf of Akaba on the basis
                    of a telegram from the Grand Vizier to the
                    Khedive of April 8, 1892, and pending a
                    settlement to withdraw the troops from Tabah.
                    In order to explain the Note 1 think I
                    ought to give a short summary of what actually
                    preceded it. Early in the year the Egyptian
                    troops were sent in the ordinary course to
                    occupy certain posts in the interior of
                    the Sinai Peninsula, including Tabah on
                    the western coast of the Gulf. On arrival
                    at the latter post it was found that 150
                    Turkish troops were already in occupation.
                    His Majesty's Government protested against
                    the occupation by the Turks of Tabah,
                    a place unquestionably within the Sinai Pen-
                    insula, and poinfed out to the Porte that
                    if any doubt existed as to the frontier line
                    a Joint Delimitation Commission seemed the
                    best solution of the question. On February
                    13 Lord Cromer reported that the Turkish
                    Commandant at Akaba was demanding the
                    withdrawal of the Egyptian troops from
                    Faroun Island. This island is in the northern
                    part of the Gulf of Akaba. His Majesty’s
                    ship Diana was instraoted to proceed to
                    Faroun to proteot the Egyptian post there.
                    After farther representations the Saltan decided
                     to send two officers from Constantinope
                     to inquire into the matter, and they
                    left for Egypt on February 20. It was hoped
                    that the Commissioners would discuss the
                    matter ot forming part of a Joint Delimitation
                     Commission. These Commissioners, however,
                     left Cairo and proceeded to Beyront
                    without having communicated with the Egyp-
                    tian Government, the Khedive, or Lord
                    Cromer. On March 21 the Turkish Ambassador
                     made a communication to the effect
                    that as Tabah was a dependency of Akaba
                    no objection could naturally be made to the
                    presence three of Turkish troops, and that it
                    was consequently unnecessary to send officials
                    from Egypt to institute an inquiry into the
                    question. The Saltan now authorised Mukhtar
                    Pacha to negotiate with the Government of
                    Egypt, and his Majesty’s Governmeat agreed
                    to negotiations takiDg plaoe at Cairo. Mukhtar
                    Pacha had an interview with the Khedive
                    and demanded on behalf of his Government
                    that the boundary of the Sinai Peninsula
                    should ran from El Rafeh to Suez and from
                    Suez to Akaba. The Khedive’s reply to these
                    representations suggested that the telegram of
                    April 8, 1892, should be taken as the basis
                    of settlement, that the line should run from
                    El Rafeh to Akaba, joining the ooast three
                    miles west of Fort Akabs, and that the
                    remainder of the line of frontier should be
                    determined by competent surveyors. The
                    Grand Vizier’s reply to the Khedive was to the
                    effect (1) that the Gulf of Akaba and the Sinai
                    Peninsnla were outside the territory defined
                    iu the Imperial Finnan ; that the telegram
                    of April 8, 1892, only referred to the western
                    side of the Sinai Peninsula ; (3) that the interpretation
                     of that telegram was a matter which
                    only ooncerned the Imperial Ottoman Government;
                      (4) that Akaba had been adopted as the
                    headquarters of the Mutessarfieh of Akaba, and
                    the hope was expressed that no occasion would
                    be afforded for interference by any other
                    Power. The delay, the extent of the demands
                    which have been put forward, and the tone
                    and character of the Tarkish communications
                    to the Khedive have made it impossible to
                    defer a settlement indefinitely. We are now
                    pressing our original demand for a joint delimitation.
                     The Note to which I have referred was
                    drawn up before the violation of Egyptian
                    territory at El Rafah. I stated on Tuesday
                    that his Majesty’s ship Minerva had been sent
                    to El Arish to ascertain whether the boundary
                    pillars at El Rafeh had actually been disturbed.
                    I regret to say that the report of the removal
                    of the pillars has keen confirmed by the captain
                    of the Minerva ; but as the Grand Vizier
                    informed Sir Nioholas O’Conor that a Commission
                     would be sent to replace the pillars had
                    they been disturbed it does not appear neccesary
                     to make any representation on that subject.
                    I need hardly remind the House that the
                    prime determining cause of the occupation of
                    Egypt in 1882 was that the condition of unrest
                    in that country threatened danger to the Suez
                    Canal, and it is not to be supposed that having
                    thus intervened to protect the Canal from
                    danger coming from the western side, we shall
                    now, 24 years after these events, be indifferent
                    to similar dangers arising on the eastern side
                    of the waterway. (Cheers.) I think I may claim
                    on behalf if the Government that they have
                    shown great patienoe and moderation ; but the
                    latest development of the Turkish demands
                    would, if admitted, place Turkey in a position
                    which would be a real danger not only to the
                    Suez Canal bnt also to the liberty of Egypt and
                    the Khedivial Dynasty. His Majes'y’s Government
                     cannot, therefore, be indifferent to such
                    issues, and the importance of them makes it
                    necessary to press for a settlement on the lines
                    of the frontier of Egypt as it existed undisputed
                     for many years.</p>

                    <head>SUAKIN NOTES. RAILWAY TRAFFIC RETURNS</head>
                    <p>(FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT</p>
                    <p>Suakin, May 9.</p>
                    <p>The traffic returns of the Sudan Government
                    Railways for March, 1908, are about L.B.
                    15.000, which is nearly doable the amount
                    for the corresponding month last year. A new
                    large sambuk (dhow) was launched a few days
                    ago from Graham’s Point belonging to A wad
                    El Kareim Bew Shenawi, head of the Dative
                    merchants here. This sambuk was started
                    before the railways put the first rail down for
                    the Suakin-Arbara line but the line was completed
                    a good many months before the sambuk.
                    Several of the prinoipal merchants were present
                    at the launch.</p>
                    <p>The British steamer Celtic Princess arrived
                    here on the 6th inst. from England with a
                    special consignment of cement for the Sudan
                    Government Railways and left again on the
                    8th inst for India.</p>
                    <p>The Sudan Customs are erecting some
                        wooden sheds and offices at Graham’s Point
                        opposite the piers, so that merchants can discharge
                        their cargo on the piers and get them
                        loaded direct into railway trucks for Khartoum
                        toumand elsewhere, thus saving the enormous
                        cost of porterage by having to take the merchandise
                        to the town Custom House.</p>
                    <p>The following gentlemen went on their
                    summer leave by the last Khedivial Mail liner
                    Dakahlieh : Miralai Hawker Bey, Governor of
                    the Red Sea Provinces ; Bimbashi Dunbar,
                    Slavery Dept.; Mr. Mackenzie, Superintendent
                    E.T.C., Suakin branch.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Bonnici, the wife of Mr. J. Bonnici
                        (Maltese, British subject), Asst. Distriot Loco.
                        Supt., Suakin, gave birth to a sou at Graham's
                        Point, and his name was registered at the
                        Suakin Moadirieh as George Graham, born at
                        Graham’s Point. This is the fourth birth registered
                        at Graham’s Point, viz, 1 British, 1 Austrian, 1 Greek, and 1 Egyptian.</p>

                    <head>CAIRO "ZOO."</head>
                    <p>We have been favoured with a copy of the
                        report of the Zoological Gardens of Ghizeh
                        for 1905, which, as the report describes it, was
                        the most important so far in the history of
                        these gardens. The Government increased the
                        subsidy by L.E.2,000, and this enabled certain
                        long-wished for reforms to be carried out. The
                        price of admission was lowered, and 177,587
                        people visited the gardens, 112,876 more than
                        in any previous year, the gate receipts being
                        L.E. 1,402. The stock of animals has been
                        increased by over 200 head, including several
                        very interesting species ; while the number of
                        deaths was 255, as compared to 267 daring
                        1901. The collection of monkeys and lemurs,
                        numbering 147 specimens representing 33
                        species, is probably one of the finest in the
                        world. Another important feature is the large
                        lawn on which the following characteristic Nile
                        birds live together in a state of comparative
                        freedom : whale-headed stork (3), saddle-billed
                        stork (2), sacred ibis, crowned crane, demoiselle
                        crane, grey crane, flamingoe, Egyptian
                        goose, spur winged goose and brown-necked
                        raven. On the 31st of March three very fine
                        trees (Australian silk-oaks) were struck by
                        lightning and killed : and in the last week in
                        December much damage was done to thou-
                        sands of the plants by frost, many of the
                        showier tropical shrubs being destroyed.
                        The finances of the "Zoo” are excellent, the
                        accounts closing with a surplus. The list of
                        donors is a long one, including names of Lord
                        Carzon, Sir Vincent Corbett, Crookshank Fakry,
                        Pacha, Sir William Garstin, Hussein Pacha

                        Lady O’Conor, Sir Edward Zohrab Pacha, etc.
                        The satisfactory financial state of the institution
                        and the good progress of the last year
                        speak volumes for the administrative capabilities

                    in the course of the excavations connected with
                    the new quays, near Victoria College. This
                    antique construction, moreover, has been
                    examined, and a plan made of it, which the
                    society intend to publish, with photographs by
                    Ed. Simond Bey and Dr. Breccia. The bulletin
                    contains an able contribution from Mr. Edgar
                    on a vase in the Cairo Museum found at
                    Mendes.and another by Mr. Lefèvre on fourteen
                    epitaphs by Alexandrian monks found at
                    Dekhela, and now in the Alexandria Museum.

                    his excavations at Aboussir el Malak; one
                    from Messrs. Grenfell and Hunt on their
                    papyrus finds at Oxhyrynchus; a third from
                    Admiral Sir Massie Blomfield embodying an
                    exhaustive and thoughtful study of the complicated
                    problem of Alexandrian topography,
                    while Dr. Breooia throws much light on the
                    rains of Hadra, the Chatby Necropolis, the
                    discoveries of Prince Toussoun at Maamourah
