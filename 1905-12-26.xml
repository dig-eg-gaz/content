                    <p>Financial Adviser's Note</p>
                    <p>The Financial Adviser's Note on the 1906
                        Budget, part of which we publish in our issue
                        of to-day, is an ably conceived and admirably
                        worded document, warning the public, as it
                        does, against certain tendencies towards over-
                        speculation which may in the future impede
                        the development of the financial resources of
                        the country and at the same time showing the
                        remarkable financial progress actually made,
                        especially in the last few years. We will deal
                        later with the budgets of the various Ministries
                        and State Departments. The preliminary re-
                        marks, which we give in full, are most interest-
                        ing reading. The recent abnormal rise of prices,
                        speculation, cotton, the recent and popular
                        reduction in taxation, the question of salaries
                        and pensions, and the Daira Sanieh liquida-
                        tion, in which the Government's share of the
                        profits amount to over L.E. 3,000,000, are all
                        discudded and are all well worth reading.</p>
                    <p>There are two passages in <persName>Sir Vincent Cor-
                    bett</persName>'s Note which we venture to criticise. In
                    dealing with the question of speculation he
                    takes, we imagine, slightly pessimistic view
                    of the general effects of any reaction against
                    over-speculation. We admit that unwary
                    investors may suffer, but what proport on do
                    those who will go to the wall bear to the
                    wholepopulation of Egypt. In our opinion
                    the general prosperity of the country, if affect-
                    ed at all by their collapse, will be affected very
                    slightly, for there is a very large majority
                    composed of men of means, mostly natives,
                    that has not yet begun to indulge in specula-
                    tion to any great extent. If the natice land
                    owners begin as a body to emulate some of
                    our fellow citizens who speculate in the hands
                    on incomes of 150 a year, then we admit the 
                    country will suffer; but have we reached
                    that point yet? None the less the warning against
                    overspeculation containes excellent adivce to
                    all who may be bitten bu the fever, and
                    while we differ in our estimate of the gravity
                    of the results of over-speculation, we are ready
                    to acknowledge that facts may yet prove us to
                    have underrated the evil and minimised the
                    danger. There is one other point which we
                    should like to criticise. <persName>Sir Vincent Corbett</persName>
                    remarks, in dealing with salaries and pensions,
                    that "it will be no more possible to amass a
                    fortune in the Government service in the future 
                    than in the past." Did not Government officials
                    in <persName>Ismad</persName>'s days at times achieve the impos-
                    sible> But perhaps that period may be regard-
                    ed as buried in oblivion, and the average offi-
                    cial who has not made fortunes in recent days
                    will, we hope, appreciate the Financial Advi-
                    ser's remarks on the necessity of ameliorating
                    the conditions of his service.</p>
                    <p>A capital defence of the Railway Adminis-
                    tration is another feature of the report. We shall
                    revert to this on another occassion, but for the
                    present we need only say that the quoudam
                    Cinderella among the Government Depart-
                    ments is now being criticised because, having
                    come into millions, she does not expend every
                    piastre of them at once. The Financial Adviser
                    points out that our energetic importers forget
                    that there are taxpayers in whose defence the
                    authorities must attempt to get the best value
                    for the large sums they are now expending,
                    and that, unlike the heroine of the fairy tale
                    who dounf herself in the possession of all that
                    she desired the instant she wedded the Prince,
                    the Railway Administration has to wait for
                    its quays to be widened, its lines to be doubled,
                    and its warehouses to be built. <persName>Sir Vincent
                    Corbett</persName> and his predecessors have done great
                    things, but they have not learnt to create build-
                    ings and public works by a stroke of the pen.</p>

                    <head>DISCOVERY OF HIS TOMB.</head>

                    <head>an IMPORTANT find at Thebes</head>

                    <p>(From our own Correspondent). Luxor, Sunday.</p>

                    <p>A discovery of the utmost importance has just been made by the well-known
                        American Egyptologist, Mr. <persName>Theodore M. Davis</persName>, who has discovered in the
                        valley of the <placeName>Tombs of the Kings</placeName>, the tomb of <persName>Mer-en Ptah</persName>, a pharaoh of the
                        19th dynasty. The tomb is beautifully painted, but no antiquities were
                        found.</p>

                    <p>This pharaoh, who is also known as <persName>Meneptab</persName>, is thought by many to have been
                        the pharaoh of the Exodus. His mummy was found in the tomb of <persName>Amenhotep II</persName>
                        at Thebes. He suppressed the revolt of the Libyans, which broke out in the
                        fifth year of his reign. His "Hymn of Triumph" is out on the back of a large
                        stele, which is now in the <placeName>Egyptian Museum at Thebes</placeName>.</p>

                        was studied under the Emperors.</p>

                        for Egypt of the "Cavalry Journal," a new quarterly publication, which is
                        intended for the circulation of information concerning cavalry matters in
                        the British and other armies, and to bring the various branches of our
                        mounted troops, both at home and in the Colonies, into closer touch with
                        each other by encouraging the develepment and interchange of ideas.</p>

                    <p>"Egyptian Rubber Concessions." A usually wide-awake jobber in the Egyptian
                        section of the Mining markets was (in London financial contemporary states)
                        last week made the victim of an old, old hoax. Although a very experienced
                        member, he was induced to make a market in 'Egyptian Rubber Conces- sions,"
                        and he must have been delegated to find business so brisk. The joke was well
                        planned and executed. It was not long before the jobber found himself short
                        of several hundred shares, the price being bid up against him, but about an
                        hour elapsed before he came to realise that the concern had only an
                        imaginary existence.</p>

                    <p>The Shrager Bankruptcy. On the 19th inst. at the <placeName>London Bankruptcy Court</placeName>, a
                        sitting for public examination was held under the failure of Shrager
                        Brothers merchants, trading at <placeName>Lloyd’s avenue, E.C.</placeName> also at <placeName>Calcutta</placeName>
                        <placeName>Colombo</placeName>, <placeName>Singapore</placeName>, <placeName>Alexandria</placeName>, and elsewhere. The debtors’ affairs are
                        being wound up in bankruptcy, and the failure appears to be of considerable
                        magnitude, tbe joint account di-closing liabilities to the amount of
                        £76,899, of which £64,518 are expected to rank, with assets which are esti-
                        mated to realise £4,089, book debts (£58,805) being treated as unrealisable.
                        The deficiency is accounted for to the extent of £53,955 by an estimated
                        loss on contracts made on beb. If of Schrager Brothers, of Calcutta.—The

                    <p>The accused were defended by <persName>Ali Bey As- sem</persName>, whose defence was based on the
                        following points: The originators of the trouble were low-class Greeks and
                        the natives were there as spectators. The mob, which was composed of dif-
                        ferent nationalities, was not an unusual gather- ing, as the day was a
                        Sunday and all the people were idling on that day. The natives took no part
                        in the outrages under any circumstances, as can be seen from the fact that a
                        small number of detectives was sufficient to arrest these 104 persons, who
                        made no resistance after the mob was dispersed, and while the authorities
                        were holding an enquiry into the matter at the <placeName>Menshieh Caracol</placeName>. Only 22
                        persons of different nationalities were slightly injured among the enormous
                        crowd, but these ware not attacked by the unfortunate accused, against whom
                        there is no evidence. Even the detectives did not declare before the Court
                        that the accused had injured people. The witnesses for the defence spoke the
                        truth, while no other witnesses could charge these 104 natives with
                        committing any crime. Article 207 of the Penal Code, which the Parquet
                        required to be taken as a base fur a verdict against the accused, was not
                        appli- cable in the case of these men. There people gathered together in the
                        Grand Square out of curiosity. If there had been any fanaticism the disorder
                        could not have been suppressed with such ease by a small body of police, nor
                        would a fire hose have been sufficient to disperse them. The detectives who
                        arrested these 104 persons out of a crowd of 15,000 people could not
                        identify them as the real evildoers. Public security in Alexandria has never
                        been menaced, nor must some of the European newspapers be believed, who for
                        their own purposes have misled their readers by stating that fanaticism was
                        at the bottom of the outbreak. The question is very simple. Some Greeks,
                        under the aegis of the Capitulations, fired at one another on a Sunday, when
                        most people have nothing to do. A crowd of sight- seers gathered together,
                        composed of men and women of every race and nation, in order to see what was
                        going on, and the upshot was "a storm in a teacup."</p>

                    <p>The above was the gist of the speech of the counsel for the defence.</p>

                    <p>The Parquet called upon the Court to punish the accused in accordance with
                        Article 207 of the Penal Code, and in the case of those who had previous
                        convictions against them, in accordance with Articles 48 and 49, and the
                        boys in accordance with Article 61 of the same code.</p>

                    <p>At 7.46 p.m. yesterday evening the Court gave its judgment on the 104
                        accused, acquit- ting 28, sentencing 53 to three months' im- prisonment with
                        hard labour, 13 to six months' imprisonment with hard labour, 3 t0 be
                        whipped with ten strokes each (these being boys), and 7 to twelve months'
                        imprisonment with hard labour.</p>

                    <head>NEW ORGAN FOR ST. GEORGE'S</head>

                    <p>The new organ, the gift of the congregation worshipping in H.B.M.'s Garrison
                        C<placeName>hurch of St. George, Mustapha Pasha</placeName>, in 1904-5, was dedicated to the
                        service of Almighty God and for the use of the Church of England troops, on
                        Friday last, at a special service, by the <persName>Rev. F. B. N. Norman-Lee, C.F.</persName> and
                        chaplain in charge. <persName>Canon Ward</persName> read the lesson and gave a very helpful
                        address on verse 6 of Psalm 95. Alter the service <persName>Mr. Heaton</persName>, organist of
                        <placeName>St. Mark’s</placeName>, gave a recital of seven sacred pieces, showing the beautiful
                        combination of the various stops.</p>

                    <p>The organ has a rich and full tone, and its sound was fully appreciated by
                        the congregation. It is of tubular pneumatic action throughout, and has a
                        double bass (Casson’s patent), which enables any one to play the pedal notes
                        on the key-board, the lowest note only sounding. The effect of a second
                        manual is obtained by the melodic stop, whereby the melody of a hymn or
                        voluntary is made to stand out above the accompaniment. The entire organ has
                        been specially constructed to suit the climate.</p>

                    <p>On Saturday last the third performance of La Tosca was given and drew, as
                        usual, a vast and highly appreciative audience. It was an excellent
                        representation from first to last, one calculated to cause ecstacies of
                        rapturous emotion. <persName>Signs. Bellincioni</persName> overpowered us by her forcible and
                        gifted acting, coupled with exquisite singing, a combination which never
                        fails to convey the pathos which this difficult role demands. Her notes were
                        pure and pene- trating as ever, though not quite so powerful as on the last
                        occasion we witnessed this opera, and for this the damp weather will no
                        doubt have been to blame. <persName>Sig. Palet</persName>, as Mario, again sang with fervour,
                        dignity, and distinction, while <persName>Sig. Polese</persName> repeated his remarkably fine
                        interpretation of the heavy part of Scarpia. <persName>Sig Gisnoli</persName> took great pains to
                        give full effect to the role of the Sagrestano. The orchestra, under <persName>Sig.
                        Zuccani</persName>, left nothing to be desired.</p>

                    <head>THE WEATHER COLD.</head>

                    <head>FESTIVITIES AT THE HOTELS.</head>

                    <p>At <placeName>Cairo</placeName>on ’Xmas Day the usual services were held at the Protestant and
                        Roman Ca- tholic churches, and in the evening a small dance was given at
                        <placeName>Shepheard’s</placeName>, where every- thing went as merrily as the date demanded and
                        dancing lasted till very late. The banks were dosed, the British Government
                        officials took holiday, and the Europeans in general affected to be
                        satisfied with the weather on the ground that 'Xmas ought to be cold.</p>

                    <p>On 'Xmas Eve an imposing ’Xmas Tree was to be seen in the <placeName>Grand Continental
                        Hotel</placeName>. The little ones were delighted and the grown ups enjoyed a small
                        dance that followed to the full. The ball-room was crowded and dancing
                        lasted till those present could wish "a merry ’Xmas" to one another before
                        they went home.</p>

                    <p>SHEPHEARD’S CHRISTMAS TREE.</p>

                    <p>A large and merry crowd of children with a still larger attendance of
                        "grown-ups" collect- ed in the outer hall of <placeName>Shepheard’s Hotel</placeName> on Sunday
                        afternoon to await the drawing aside of the curtains and the revelation of a
                        magni- ficent Christmas Tree in the "Egyptian Hall.” From half-past four to
                        half-past five the guests arrived in ever-increasing numbers, and save for
                        the occasional protest of a few infant voices at not being allowed immediate
                        entrance to the fairy-laud within, all were gay and happy from beginning to
                        end. But the infants turned from teats to cries of enjoyment and babbling
                        laughter as the curtains parted and the throng slowly pressed into the hall
                        and surrounded the gorgeously decorated and illuminated tree, and tiny hands
                        were stretch- ed out to the master of the ceremonies to receive a coveted
                        ticket which would ensure a memento of this Christmas party. The presents
                        were laid out in the billiard room, the tables of which were burdened with
                        books and toys of every description (without even a word of protest from
                        their guardian angel, Percy), and every little guest departed with a heart
                        gladdened by a beautiful gift. The Tzigane orchestra played selections of
                        music during the afternoon, and the buffets, which were abundantly furnished
                        with teas, cakes, ices, and all sorts of good things, were well patronised.
                        <persName>Mr. Baehler</persName> ana most generously, and his party was greatly enjoyed by the
                        several hundreds of guests who were present.</p>

                    <p>Seldom or never has the terrae of <placeName>Mena House Hotel</placeName> been so crowded as on the
                        afternoon of 'Xmas Eve. It was really sur- prising when everybody is
                        supposed to be up by the <placeName>Nile</placeName>, to find such a large gathering of smart
                        people at <placeName>Mena House</placeName>. At 4.8 p.m. the charming dining-hall was filled with a
                        select audience for the carol singing by the staff choir. Unfortunately,
                        however, they were unable to complete the programme, which consisted of six
                        items, on account of the well- deserved encores of the carol singers. These
                        quaint old German songs were alone well worth the trip to Mena, and the
                        zither accom- paniment and the "echo" effect of "Teure Heimat" were very
                        good. The dining hall itself with its 'Xmas Tree and the illuminated models
                        of the <placeName>Sultan Hassan Mosque</placeName> and some ancient temple produced, with the
                        candles and electric light, quite a fairy scene.</p>

                    <head>CYRANO DE BERGERAC.</head>

                    <p>It is a distinct pleasure to be able to attempt a serious criticism instead
                        of the usual resume of the play and list of the actors on to whose names are
                        tacked "sustained the role of," "his known verve," etc. For the performance
                        of Cyrano will quite bear criticism, even compari- son,to a certain degree,
                        with more famous repre- sentations of the same play, in Paris. It is a play
                        with two parts—possibly three, if we count Ragueneau, and it proved in
                        consequence not beyond the reach of the company. <persName>Mme Moreno</persName> played Roxane,
                        and achieved most accurately the exact "precieuse plus beauty" note: a
                        thankless note indeed hered for it allows of very little passion or emotion:
                        it has but affectation and a certain delicate egoism. <persName>M Daragon</persName> was Cyrano,
                        and after the first two acts proved good; in the balcony scene, the journey
                        to the moon, and the last act of all he was really excellent. The ballads
                        duel in the first act was well done: but for the greater part of this and
                        the second, he missed, or exaggerated, his chances: he suggested the
                        schoolboy anxious to get through his Virgi repetition, or on the other hand
                        he relied on one or two intonations to carry off all points. Now the points
                        all through are many, subtle, various; one has only to see <persName>Coquelin</persName> to
                        discover that. His gestures were good all through; but the “make-up," except
                        in the last act, was not at all right; where was the nose. Scarcely in
                        evidence, and certainly not "stalking before me, half a league ahead.” The
                        other parts were good after their kind except . de Guiche. <persName>M. Monteux</persName> lacked
                        dignity and restraint and was too excited for the "grand seigneur" he was
                        supposed to represent. The staging of the "siege of Arrus" scene was not
                        good; and the effect of the supers charging down the steps was absurd. It is
                        some six years since we saw it in Paris, but if we remember right the supers
                        hardly appeared at all; only their heads showed, the Gasoons' post being on
                        an eminence above them. Well, to sum up, it might have been much worse, and
                        even if it wasn’t “Paris," it was safely above the "provin- cial" mark.</p>

                    <p>Your Highness, — I have the honour to present this letter of credence from
                        the Presi- dent, accrediting me to the Egyptian Govern- nent as American
                        Agent and Consul General. I am charged to renew to Your Highness the

                        and to emphasize the hope that this friendship may become even closer. It is
                        a pleasure to me personally to act as the American representative in <placeName>Cairo</placeName>,
                        and I ask, and feel sure that I shall receive, the support and encouragement
                        of your Highness in the care which I shall give to American interests in
                        Egypt, commercial and otherwise. Allow me to offer my best wishes for the
                        health and happiness of Your Highness, and for the pros- perity of your
                        country and its people.</p>

                    <p>His Highness replied as follows:— Monsieur l’Agent,—Je reçois avec un vif
                        plaisir la lettre que vous me remettez et suis heureux des sentiments que

                    <p>Our Akhmin Correspondent writes : - Fif- teen kuttabs will soon be ready for
                        use in the near future for our markaz. The distribution of grants-in-aid to
                        the fikis and arifs of the Akhmin kuttabs took place on Wednesday in the
                        hall of the markaz, under the presidency of the <persName>Moudir of Guirgeh, Ibrahim
                            Bey Na- breh</persName>, who came from <placeName>Sohag</placeName> for the purpose, accompanied by the wakil
                        el Moudirieh, <persName>Wassif Bey</persName>, the Hakimdar, and the inspector of Ghirgeh
                        province kuttabs.</p>

                    <p>The moudir delivered an address to the omdehs and notables on the building of
                        kuttabs in the surrounding villages and exhorted the fikis to have a
                        whole-hearted devo- tion to their calling. The inspector of kuttabs then
                        gave an address, after which the grants- in-aid were distributed.</p>

                    <p>Our Minet el-Kamh Correspondent writes:— Last Monday was appointed for the
                        distribution of the grants-in-aid to the fikis and arifs of the kuttabs in
                        our district, which took place at 11.30 a.m. in a big tent near the markez
                        office under the presidency of the <persName>Moudir of Charkieh</persName> and in presence of a
                        Public Instruc- tion inspector and the notables of the district. The moudir
                        spoke for about half an hour and thanked the notables of the Charkieh
                        province for their generosity. The inspector of kuttabs, the <persName>Omdeh of
                        Bakkashin</persName>, and a clever fiki made excellent speeches on the benefits of
                        kuttabs. The grants-in-aid were then given by the moudir to the fikis, who
                        were very g’ad to receive them.</p>

                    <head>11TH MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS</head>

                    <head>AFFAIR SENT BEFORE TRIBUNALS.</head>

                    <p>At 3.30 p.m. on Saturday the eleventh meeting of the creditors of the Société
                        de- Sucreries et de la Raffinerie d'Egypte took place at the <placeName>Commercial
                        Chamber of the Mixed Tribunals Cairo</placeName>, under the presidency of <persName>Judge Tuck</persName>.
                        <persName>Me. Carton de Wiart</persName>, whose lameness prevented him from rising, was grant- ed
                        permission to speak sitting, and opened the ball with a plea for a farther
                        postponement. He stated that the proposals made under the concordat had been
                        sent to <placeName>Paris</placeName> and that a wire had been received from <placeName>Paris</placeName> begging for a
                        postponement of their publication till the 19th inst. Since then certain
                        modifications had been insisted on by the shareholders, and matters were not
                        yet finally settled. This being so, he begged for a week's postponement, and
                        expressed the hope that the juge-commis- would be induced, in deference to
                        the wishes of the whole body of creditors, to withdraw from his
                        determination already expressed to send the affair before the Tribunals.</p>

                    <p><persName>Me. St. Plancat</persName> and <persName>Me. Bakri</persName>, representing <persName>Me. Padoa Bey</persName>, joined in the
                        demand, but <persName>Judge Tuck</persName> was inexorable as Rhadamanthus. He remarked that the
                        cessation of payments took place on September 7. The judgment authorising
                        the application of the concordat préventif was given on September 19. The
                        first meeting of creditors took place on October 4, when the first report of
                        the experts was read. The Sucreries asked for a postponement on account of
                        the shareholders’ meeting. The next meeting accordingly took place on
                        October 18, and since then matters had made no progress, in spite of eleven
                        meetings. Conse- quently he saw no alternative but to send the case before
                        the Tribunal on Saturday next.</p>

                    <p>The avocats protested in vain. "You will bring your proposals before the
                        Tribunal,” quoth the judge, “far more rapidly. Here we have nothing but
                        requests for new postpone- ments and promises for the next time, but I have
                        not had any communication of the pro- posals made to me." <persName>Me. Carton de
                        Wiart</persName> remarked that the proposals had been sent to Paris. <persName>Judge Tuck</persName>
                        observed that they had not been made before him. <persName>Me. St. Plancat</persName> then asked
                        whether the proposals might be discussed before the Tribunal. An emphatic
                        negative from <persName>Judge Tuck</persName>, who pointed out that the Tribunal simply had to
                        decide whether the company was to be ad- mitted to the privileges of the
                        concordat pre- ventif. For his part he would not keep the responsibility of
                        the affair on his shoulders for 48 hours.</p>

                    <p>The greffier, <persName>M. Zigliara</persName>, then read the following note from the experts, <persName>Sir
                        W. Will- cocks</persName>, <persName>Fourneron Bey</persName>, and <persName>Prof. Sampaolo</persName> :-</p>

                    <p>Monsieur le Juge Commis,</p>

                    <p>Nous avons l'honneur de vous informer que nons avons fait notre estimation du
                        bilan dec Sucreries en admettant qu'avant la fin de novembre l'avenir de
                        cette Société serait défini- tivement résolu.</p>

                    <p>Les renvois successifs demandés font que nous sommes á fin décembre et
                        qu'auoune dé- cision n'a été prise.</p>

                    <p>Nous considéron que la culture de la canne pour l'exercice 1906 1907 est déja
                        compromise. car les cultivateurs ne peuvent pas faire des arrangements pour
                        les cultures de l'anuée pro- chaine, sans ê re certains que lears
                        productions seront schetées.</p>

                    <p>Nous vous avons d'ailleurs monsieur le juge commis, mis an courant de cerre
                        situation dans notre première entrevue en octobre dernier.</p>

                    <p>Nous croyons donc devoir vous informer que notre estimation des usines,
                        matériel et pièces de rechange, etc. a été fixée pensant qu'une décision
                        définitive serait prise immédiatement après le dépôt de notre troisième
                        rapport; mais industriellement parlant ces prix devraient déjà être diminués
                        et si cette décision devait encore tarder, la valeur industrielle des
                        usines, etc. deviendrait fort deuteuse, à moins que MM. les controleurs et
                        administrateurs, ayant pris en considération l’avis que nous avons donné le
                        23 novembre, aient déjà traité avec les propriétaires de la Hante-Egypte
                        afin d’as- surer aux usines de la Société la canne néces- saire et en
                        quantité sufficante pour une période- de 4 années.</p>

                    <head>PICTURE EXHIBITION.</head>

                    <p>On Saturday last <persName>M. Warton Mahokian</persName> open- ed the exhibition of his paintings
                        at the Immeu- ble Bitter in Opera-square, Cairo, and though the weather was
                        bitterly cold and rain fell occasionally, quite a number of people visited
                        the rooms, where there were over a hundred oil paintings on view. Though all
                        of these were not to our taste, they were all well painted, and it was
                        evident that the work had been done by a real artist. Seascapes were the
                        principal fea- tures of the exhibition and the painting of sea scenes
                        certainly seem to be <persName>M. Mahokian</persName>’s forte, whilst of his landscape his winter
                        scenes were the best. Of these latter, two were espe- cially effective and
                        realistic, a winter’s evening in <placeName>Russia</placeName> and a similar scene in the environs
                        of <placeName>Berlin</placeName> (Nos. 84 and 71), and of other land- scapes a picture of a
                        brigands’ resting place in the <placeName>Caucasus</placeName> (No. 47) was remarkable for its
                        boldness and excellent colour effects; there was also a very fine painting
                        of a woodland scene (No. 11) in which the colouring was very true to nature.
                        Among the seascapes there were several fine sunsets, notably on the <placeName>Jutland
                        shores</placeName> (No. 24) and on the <placeName>Swedish shores</placeName> (No. 94), and some splendid
                        paintings of stormy seas. We certainly recommend our read- ers to pay this
                        excellent exhibition a visit.</p>

                    <p>On Friday, 15th inst., a football match was played between Boulac Railway
                        Institute and the R.E. The home team won the toss and de- fended Embabeh
                        end. There were considerably more than 150 spectators on the club veran-
                        dah. The play during the first half was of a very even character and neither
                        side scored. Twenty minutes after the restarting the R.E. had the good
                        fortune of being awarded a penalty kick, from which they scored. The
                        visitors added another goal before the game was over, and thus were left
                        victors by 2-0. A heavy wind, which at periods amounted to a gale, blew
                        during the second half, and greatly hindered accurate football.</p>

<head>BARRICADES BOMBARDED.</head>

<head>SEVERE FIGHTING.</head>

<head>5,000 KILLED, 14,000 WOUNDED.</head>

<p><placeName>St. Petersburg</placeName>, December 23.
The whole strength of the strike is centred
at <placeName>Moscow</placeName>, at which city the Government is
strenuously fighting against it. The represent-
atives of strikers, while dismissing their final
plans in a large building yesterday evening,
were summoned to surrender. They replied
with bombs and revolvers, upon which the
artillery shelled the building until they capi-
tulated. Barricades have been erected, but the
troops have stormed several them.</p>

<p><placeName>Moscow</placeName>, December 23.
Severe fighting has taken place between the
dragoons and the strikers. Barricades have
been destroyed. 40 strikers, 5 officers, and 13
soldiers have bean killed or wounded. (H.)</p>

<p><placeName>Moscow</placeName>, December 24..
A regular pitched battle is engaged in in the
streets here. Yesterday afternoon there was
incessant firing in all quarters of the city,
which was still progressing at ten o’clock in the
evening. It is impossible to estimate the num-
ber of casualties.</p>

<p>Apparently the revolutionary party is not
yet crushed. Guns posted in a commanding
position at a monastery and in a square in
the heart of the city opened a hot fire on the
barricades during the afternoon, while quick
firers swept the boulevards which debouch on
the square. Fire was concentrated on the
barricades on <placeName>Tverskykastreet</placeName>, destroying
them. Meanwhile a large force of infantry kept
up an incessant rifle fire, and sharpshooters
posted in the belfry of the monastery picked
off insurgents. Different parts of the town are
isolated, and insurgents, who are supplied
with arms and ammunition, are erecting fresh
barricades, and are still holding some districts.</p>

<p>(5.0 p.m.)
Artillery, rifle, and revolver fire continued
during the whole day. The guns bombarded
barricade after barricade, charges of dragoons
followed the cannonade. The debris was then
burned. The area of the fighting is extending
and is now proceeding in the suburbs, with
losses on both sides.</p>

<p>The revolutionary party is apparently not
yet disheartened, though the wounded alone
on Saturday are estimated at 500. They scored
a few minor successes by means of ambuscades
and bombs, in one case killing or wounding 20
gendarmes. All the hospitals and doctors’ resi-
dences are full of wounded.	(Reuter)</p>

Until an early hour on Monday morning
there were 5,000 killed and 14,00 wounded
in the fighting here. The cannonading was
proceeding on Monday night in several parts
of the city. The barricades are being desper-
ately defended. Many harmless people have
been killed. The city is beginning to feel the
lack of provisions.	(Reuter)</p></div>

                <div type= "item"><head>THE EMANCIPATION OF EGYPT</head>

<p>IV.
In approaching his "Ultimate considerations”
our author takes us somewhat more into his
confidence and says that he is addressing us in
a loftier strain, and is drawn into speaking of
religions beliefs. He is conscious that he is
treading on tender ground. There we quite
agree with him, and as we shall endeavor to show
in our concluding remarks, he is doing so in a
manner which is not only useless, but danger-
ous. We shall therefore not make any further
allusion to his concluding pages, so far as they
touch religious questions ; we only quote a few
paragraphs from them.</p>

                    <p>In a book referring only to <placeName>Egypt</placeName> it appears
to us quite useless to again rake up the tragedy
of American colonisation. We never heard that
in these more enlightened times there was ever
any risk that such proceedings were likely to
occur in Egypt.</p>

                    <p>As to our author’s concluding sentence, we
will merely say that we do not consider that
the arguments advanced in the latter part of
his book are either dictated by political lure
rest, by the voice of humanity, or even by that
of simple expediency.</p>

                    <p>The disjointed extracts which we have given
may not convey a good idea of the book as a
whole, but we think they justify us in having
said that it is a remarkable book; it should be
read to be appreciated, and it is Well worth
reading. Up to a certain point we entirely agree
with the opinions expressed by the author,
then we come, almost imperceptibly, to a parting
of the ways, which leads at last to extreme
divergence of opinion like two lines of railway
whose separation is at first almost impercepti-
ble, but which end by going in nearly opposite
directions. The book is written in an irreproach-
able style, the arguments are all exceedingly
moderate; it is with regret, and only from a
sense of duty to the land we love, that we feel
obliged to express some opinions contrary to
those of the author. For the translator, we
have nothing but praise : the book is written
from end to end in flowing periods and well-
balanced sentences, which contrast favorably
with much of the slipshod English we have to
put up with now-a-days. There is not, as is
so usual in translations, any taint of foreign
idiom.</p>

                    <p>To a man so well informed as the author,
we cannot help thinking that it must be a
matter of regret to have written the pages he
devotes to Russian influence. It seems extra-
ordinary to read this in a book fresh from the
press in the latter end of this year of grace
1905, now that the brass giant formerly called
the Holy Russian Empire has been proved to
have feet of clay. It reminds us of the flood of
literature, emanating any time the last forty
years, from the pens of educated Russian
bureaucrats, as to the objects and aims of
their nation, these writings had about as
intimate an acquaintance with the real nation
they referred to, as the fishes in the ocean
have with the first-class passengers on board
a luxurious liner. Unless we are much mista-
ken the near future of Russia will prove to
our author that it is not wise for any nation
to associate the religions element too closely
with civil government, and this is the direction
towards which the parting of the ways fatally
leads him.</p>

                    <p>No one respects the religions element in
national life more than we do, but in such a
cosmopolitan country as Egypt where so
many foreign colonies of different religions
have from time immemorial acquired rights,
which give them, in the beautiful words of
Kipling, "freedom to live by no man’s leave
underneath the law," this is the first con-
sideration ; it is what we have now, and it is
what we mean - to keep if we can.</p>

                    <p>Civil laws made and enforced for the good of
the whole country should be carefully separated
from the religions element, and still leave
everyone perfectly free to worship God in any
way which either nationality, association, or
inclination may dictate, and that without
interfering in any way with his rights of citizen-
ship.</p>

                    <p>Our author has led up to the question of
the emancipation or nationalism of Egypt
in many ways. He goes back far enough to call
our attention to the rise, decline, and fall of
the British power in the <placeName>Ionian islands</placeName> ; he
refers to other historical matters, all of which
appear to us to have little to do with Egypt ;
he devotes a whole chapter to the "false posi-
tion of Great Britain in Egypt.” Without
going much into detail, we do not consider this
position a false one ; we think that England is
still doing, and will continue to do, yeoman’s
work in Egypt, not only in her own interest
but to the benefit of the world in general. The
most remarkable point about this book is the
extraordinary metamorphosis which the au-
thor’s opinion seems to us to go through within
the limits of its pages. He begins by being the
greatest apologist we have yet heard of. Eng-
land’s occupation of Egypt; he praises it in
such lofty language that at times we were
tempted to recall the prophet of old, who,
looking down from the barren hills of <placeName>Moab</placeName>, on
the fertile plains and valleys on the other side of
<placeName>Jordan</placeName>, said, almost in spite of himself, "How
beautiful are thy tents, O Israel." Unlike the
seer of Bible history our anthor has apparently
been induced to change his opinion when about
half-way through with his work.</p>

                    <p>To any intelligent person who has watched
the course of events in this country for the
last thirty years, it must be evident that
Egypt always has required, and will still for a
very long time require, some external restrain-
ing influence. This has been clearly shown
over and over again whenever anything has
tended to ruffle the surface of everyday life.</p>

were commenced on Monday week by the

No. 51 Egyptian Constitution, it happens to
be the first of the Masonic year, and is always
looked forward to.</p>

<persName>H. E. A. B. Brewster Bey</persName> (W. M. elect),
<persName>General Mahmoud Tewfik</persName>, and many others.
<persName>Bro. M. Kenneth-Scott</persName> was duly affiliated, and
<persName>Mr. Howard</persName>, a candidate for initiation, was
admitted and duly received his first insight
into the mysteries. The following distinguished
brethren were appointed to fill the various
offices for the occasion, via: <persName>W. Bros. Chinn</persName>. S
W., <persName>W.J. King</persName>, J W., <persName>Button</persName>, <persName>S. D. Pattison</persName>,
<persName>J. D. Drechsler</persName>, I. G., and <persName>Plunkett</persName>, as
D. of C.</p>

    <p>The lodge being opened in the next degree,
the W.M. elect swore allegiance to the duties
of the post, and on being opened in the 3rd
the M. W. the Grand Master of Egypt, his
Excellency <persName>Idris bey Razheb</persName>, entered the lodge
and was duly received in accordance with
ancient custom and saluted as befitted his
exalted rank; the gavil being banded him by
the W. M., the G Master requested the W. M.
to carry on the work. A board of installed
Masters having been formed, the W. M. elect
was further instructed and was placed in the
hair of K.S. in accordance with custom. On
the return of the brethren to the lodge <persName>W.
Bro. Brewster Bey</persName> was proclaimed and sainted
from the usual position. The charter, constitu-
tions and bye-laws having been presented, <persName>W.
Bro. Beale</persName>, I. M. called, the brethren to order
while he read a communication he had received
from the Grand Lodge, in which was a decree
appointing the newly-installed W. M. as Past
Grand Warden of Egypt. The M. W. Grand
Master heartily congratulated Rt <persName>Wor. Brewster
Bey</persName> on the appointment. The W. M. cordially
thanked him for the high honor conferred
upon him. The G M. then requested permis-
sion to retire. The W M. was saluted with the
honors due to his rank, and then appointed
his officers for the year as follows:— I. P. M.,
<persName>Wor. Bro. Beale</persName>; S. W. Bro. <persName>W. H Latailla</persName> ;
J. W., Bro. <persName>D Macdonald</persName>; Treas., W. Bro. <persName>W
H. Brockway</persName>, Sec, Bro. <persName>R. Snelling</persName>; S D.,
Bro <persName>B W. Jordan</persName> ; J.D , W. Bro. <persName>W. Button</persName> ;
D. of C.. Bro. <persName>F. Leonard</persName>; Asst ditto, Bro.
<persName>Haseldine</persName>; XX I. G., Bro <persName>W Barnes</persName>, and
Guardians, Bros. <persName>Canning</persName> and <persName>Yacoub</persName>. W.
Bro. <persName>Ahmed Nasrat Bey</persName> organist, V Wor. Bro
<persName>F. B. N. Norman-Le</persName>, chaplain, Bros <persName>L Leon</persName>
and <persName>Jordan Smith</persName>, stewards.</p>

    <p>The installation ceremony being completed,
the W. M., rising, said a few words regarding
the manner in which the installing Master
had carried out the ceremony and expressed
his pleasure in being now entitled to present
the P. M. jewel unanimously voted by the
lodge, and added that, although it was only a
very small thing and could not adequately
represent the feelings that the I.P.M. had
raised in the breasts of the members of the
lodge for the manner in which the duties
in the lodge has been carried out, it was
meant as a mark of esteem and appreciation.
The L. P. M,. replying, felt proud to be a
P.M. of the <placeName>Ragheb Lodge</placeName> and would ever
do his utmost to further its interests. He said
how grateful he felt to all the members for their
cordial and loyal support, during his year of
office, and asked that the same might be
extended to his successor. He felt sure that
at the close of this and following years the
bond of friendship, would be found to have
grown stronger and stronger.</p>

    <p>The balance sheet showed a very substantial
cash balance at the bank, and it was proposed
to send a further donation to the <placeName>Blind Insti-
tution at Zeitoun</placeName> of 1O. This was agreed to
with acclamation. It was pointed out that
this excellent institution received candidates
irrespective of religion, nationality, or stand-
ing, and that it deserved every encouragement,
as it was now supported by subscriptions and
contributions similar to that now put before,
the meeting. The charity bag being circulat-
ed produced a very handsome sum for this
and similar benevolent purposes.</p>

    <p>Before closing the lodge congratulations
were conveyed to the W. M. from the lodges
in Egypt and from all parts of the globe for a
happy and successful year of office.</p>

    <p>The members then adjourned to the <placeName>Grand
Continental Hotel</placeName>, where a very handsomely
decorated table testified to the great care
which is given to these festivities by its genial
manager, Bro. <persName>A. Klingler</persName>. The chef was
called for and heartily congratulated on the
manner in which the good things provided
were served up.</p>

    <p>The usual loyal and Masonic toasts were
given with musical honors and heartily re-
ceived the toast of the evening being that of
the W.M., who, in replying, amidst storms of
auplanse, signified his intention to make the
lodge as great a success, if not greater than his
predecessor. The manner in which this was
received testified to the happiness that sur-
rounded the W.M. &amp; augors well for the
future of the lodge, and the cementing of the
fraternal bonds.</p>

    <p>The following brethren helped to make the
evening a very pleasant one with songs,
recitations, selections, &amp; W. Bro. <persName>Button</persName>,
<persName>Powell</persName>, Bros. <persName>Dr. Madden</persName>, <persName>Waller</persName>, <persName>Barnes</persName>,
<persName>Latailla</persName>, &amp; </p>

    <p>By kind permission of the commanding offi-
cer and officers the Royal Inniskilling Fusilier-
a portion of the band played selections during
the banquet, which were greatly appreciated.</p>

<head>THE 1906 BUDGET.</head>
<head>FINANCIAL ADVISERS NOTE.</head>
<head>EGYPT’S CONTINUED PROSPERITY.</head>

<p>My last Budget Note drew attention to the
rapid advance in prosperity which had charac-
terised the two preceding years. That prosperity
has to all outward appearance been maintained.</p>

<p>In spite of a low Nile flood in 1904, and of
the remission during the last three years of
taxation, amounting in the aggregate to L.E.
490,000, the figures of revenue for those years
have been as follows:—</p>

<p>
1903 ... ... ... ... ... L.E. 12,248,000
1904	... ... ... ... ... ,, 13,690,000
1905 (approximate) ...	...	„ 14,500,000</p>

<p>These results have encouraged the Govern-
ment to take a somewhat more sanguine view
than would have been prudent hitherto of the
probable results of the next financial year; these,
after allowing for a further reduction to the
extent of L.E. 332,000, have been calculated
at L.E. 13,500,000, an estimate which can
hardly be considered too bold seeing that,
even when the above reduction is taken into
account, it still falls short of the probable
receipts for 1905 by LE. 768,000.</p>

<p>The estimated Receipts and Expenditure for
1906	as compared with 1905 are as follows : —</p>
<p>
                    1906          1905        Increase
Receipts......... 13,500,000     12,255,000   1,245,000
Expenditure
Ordinary...12,317,000             11,308,000
                      13,000,000              11,755,000  1,240,000
Special ...680,000                447,000
Estimated surplus in both
cases......... L.E. 500,000</p>

<p>Allowing then for a surplus next year of
L.E. 500,000, there remains an estimated
expenditure in 1906 of L.E. 1,245,000 more
than that for 1905.</p>

<p>This increase, though considerable, must not
be taken to imply any new or extravagant
departure on the part of the Egyptian Govern-
ment.</p>

<p>The enormous appreciation in the value of
land, and sudden acquisition of unexpected
wealth by large sections of the community, has
sent up the prices of the necessaries of life*
at such a rate as to render inevitable a largely
increased expenditure not only on such items as
forage, maintenance of prisoners, hospital
patients, and the like, but also on the wages of
temporary employees and daily labourers in Go-
vernment employ and consequently on the cost
of execut on of all Government works. To this
must be added a sum of L.E. 120,000, inscribed
in the "Budget for improving the position of
the “cadreé officials, the lesser of whom can no
longer live on their pay, while the higher have
seen, what were formerly considered adequate
incomes yearly diminishing in purchasing power
to the point of absolute hardship. The total
increase in estimated expenditure directly
attributable to the rise in prices may be
calculated at not less than L.E. 370,000.</p>

<p>The following table shows the variations in
the retail prices of certain commodities during
the past five years. The figures give the
average price for the year in each case: -</p>

<p>The rise since last year in the contract prices
of provisions for certain Government Depart-
ments is shown by the following examples:</p>
<p>
                           1904      1906

Rice " oke ... ... ...      1.1       1.3
Meat " " ... ... ...        4.5       5.8</p>

<p>Since writing the above and while this
Note was passing through the press the fact
that the scarcity and consequent cost of
unskilled labour is becoming a factor of the
gravest import in connection with the ex-
penditure on all public works, has been brought
to my notice with disagreeable directness. I
learn from the Irrigation authorities that the
cost of construction of earthworks has risen
within the last three years by at least 60 %
and that consequently the estimates for the
conversion next year of the basin lands in
Upper Egypt will probably have to be in-
creased by some L.E 100,000.]</p>

<p>Although the revenue returns of the last
few years appear amply to justify this increase
in the national expenditure, nevertheless the
economical situation is not such as would</p>

<p>*The price of some descriptions of urban land has remained
proportions which can only be described as fabulous east of
purelt agricultural land has increased in 5 years to at least 40%
and is now selling in many places at L.E. 160 per acre and
even more.</p></div>

<p>warrant us in blindly counting on permanent

well be that the wave of prosperity is not

calculate on its volume being increased or
indeed maintained indefinitely.</p>

(Approximate)</p>

<p>The effect of the high prices ruling for
cotton from the 1902-1903 season onwards
is very well marked by the increased value
of the exports since 1901, and by a corres-
ponding upward movement in the volume of
the imports, commencing in 1903 and con-
tinuing progressively to the present time.
The value of the imports of merchandise
for the current year bids fair largely to
exceed that for 1904, as against a setback
in the value of the exports due to the sensibly
lower price of cotton last season.</p>

<p>The fact that during the past two years
the imports of merchandise and specie taken
together have greatly outbalanced the exports,
notwithstanding the constant heavy charge
for the service of the foreign debt, constitutes
a phenomenon which calls for reflection. A
readjustment in the direction of normal
equilibrium must come about sooner or later,
and if we are paying for our imports with
capital provided by the foreign investor,
this operation, though by no means necessarily
unsound at present, cannot be indefinitely
continued.</p></div>

    <head>SPECULATION IN EGYPT.</head>

<p>Here, with a full sense of the responsibility
attaching to an expression of opinion which
cannot but have something of an ex cathedra
character, I desire to sound a note of warning
to those who look on Egypt as an El Dorado
for investors- and speculators.</p>

<p>The sudden secession of wealth and com-
mercial activity in this country has been
attended by features that are only too often
its concomitants. The tendency to discount
the future is nowhere more evident, and during
the past two years the value of property
both in land and in local stocks and shares,
has, in many cases, been forced up to levels
which even prospective results can hardly
prove to be remunerative. It is to be feared
that these inflated values are not infrequently
based on speculative purchases which have
been facilitated by the profuse introduction of
loanable capital into the country, either in
the form of new banking, finance, and land
companies, or in that of large increases in the
capital of the old institutions. The gambling
fever is rife in the community and oppor-
tunities to speculate are at hard for all.</p>

<p>This situation contains within it the elements
of reaction. It depends, first and foremost,
on the maintenance of the price of cotton
at the high level of the past three years,
a level due to causes which are almost entirely
adventitious as far as this country is concerned.
And, even assuming that the conditions of the
world’s supply of and demand for cotton will
not vary within very wide limits for the next
few years, or that the demand for the Egyptian
product will continually outstrip the supply,
there remains the danger of the results which
invariably attend over speculation. Lately signs
of uneasiness have not been wanting; there
is a slackening of activity on the local Bourses
and quotations have declined perceptibly from
their former maxims.</p>

<p>A movement towards the elimination of the
speculative factor in the situation, which in
the long run is inevitable, may, and I believe
will, work itself out without injury to the real
interests of the country, but it will hardly do
so without causing a considerate perturbation
of the share market, with serious results to
the unwary investor.</p>

<p>I may as well mention here that all
Egyptian companies are incorporated by
Khedivial Decree, and that such decree merely
implies that the company in question has
conformed with certain rules and is amenable
to a certain jurisdiction. It in no way implies
that the Khedivial Government either approves
its object or guarantees its solvency.</p></div>

<div type="item"> 
<head>COTTON.</head>

<p>The area devoted to cotton during the pre-
sent season has exceeded that of any preceding</p>

<p>*The figures in this column represent only 90% of the
market value of the exports, having been deducted by the
Customs before leaving export duty.</p>


<p>year, especially in Upper Egypt. The climatic
conditions during the early part of the season
were very favorable and the crop promised
to be a record one. Unfortunately in September
and October much damage was done, more
particularly in Upper Egypt, by the prevalence
of "Boll worm," whose ravages this year were
more pronounced than usual and far more in-
jurious than those of the more generally feared
"Cotton worm." During the season much
valuable information regarding this pest has
been obtained by the Khedivial Agricultural
Society which it is hoped may subsequently
be turned to practical account.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that while the area devoted
to cotton during recent years has steadily in-
creased, there has been no increase in total
crop production.</p>

<p>Total Crops (interior gross weight)
1897	-	1898  6,543,128 kantars.
1898	- 1899	5,589,314	"
1899  - 1900	6,510,050 "
1900	—	1901	5,427,338 "
1901	—	1902	6,371,643	"
1902	—	1903	6,508,090 "
1903	—	1904	6,508,947 "
1904  - 1905	6,351,879 "</p>

<p>This is a matter for serious consideration,
especially when taken in connection with the
fact that quality also has left much to be
desired. The tendency is now to grow cotton on
the same land every two years, instead of once
in three years, as was formerly the case, and
the results of this system should not be ignor-
red by the cultivator, not only because of possi-
ble injury to the cotton-growing industry, which
is in itself a sufficient reason, but also in view
of its possible deleterious effects on the general
productivity of the soil. The question of the
seed employed is intimately connected with
the qnuality of the resulting crop and is receiv-
ing careful consideration by the Khedivial
Agricultural Society. Prices continue to rule
high.</p></div>

<div type="item"><head>REDUCTION OF TAXATION.</head>

<p>The following taxes are abolished or reduced

                              L.S. 332,000 </p>


<p>The Government Salt Monopoly established
in 1879 for revenue purposes, was ceded in
1899 to the "Salt &amp; Soda Company," when
the price was reduced from L.E. 8 to L.E. 5
per ton. In a country like Egypt, in many parts
of which salt is a natural product which
anyone can pick up for himself, the existence
of a monopoly with its accompanying restric-
tions enforced by fines and imprisonment
could not be other than highly vexatious, and
in now sweeping it away the Khedivial Govern-
ment has, it is believed, effected a reform which
will be a blessing to the country at large and
especially to the very poor.</p>

<p>The Salt and Soda Company was entitled to
a six months’ notice of the termination of the
Monopoly. This right it has consented to waive,
while the Government on its side has engaged
not to work any new salines, nor let them to
others for a period of six years. Further the
Company has undertaken to reduce the price
of salt from L.E. 5 per ton to L.E. 2, (i. e. from
5 milliemes to 2 milliemes per kilo.) and to
maintain distributing agencies wherever they
now exist.</p>

<p>Licences for sea-fishing boats were formerly
delivered on payment of an annual tax varying
between L.E. 1 3/4 to L.E. 1O according to size
and equipment. They will now be delivered
free of charge.</p>

<p>The Perry Tax is abolished, except in the
case of ferries at or near large centres. The
tentative abolition of some of these latter was
not a success, on the contrary it led to quarrels
and disturbances on the part of rival claimants.
Moreover it is necessary in places where there
is heavy traffic that the public should have
some guarantee of a satisfactory service, which
can only be obtained by letting the ferrying
right out to some responsible person.</p>

<p>The Lighthouse does in the <placeName>Red Sea</placeName> have
been reduced from 14 milliemes to 10 mill. per
ton for ships under 800 tons and from 7
milliemes to 5 milliemes for ships over that
tonnage, reductions which it is hoped will
prove satisfactory to international shipping.</p>

<p>An all-around ad valorem, Customs Duty on
imports of 8 % constitutes the general tariff
of the <placeName>Turkish Empire</placeName>, and consequently of
<placeName>Egypt</placeName>, and no higher duty can be imposed
except by International Agreement. In the
case of Egypt a surtax exists on tobacco and
tobacco only. For the first time, I believe, in
history, a province of the Empire bound by
this tariff, has, of its own initiative, lowered
the import duty on a whole series of articles
of first necessity. The experiment will be
watched with interest not only in Egypt but
throughout the world and it is the confident
hope of the Khedive’s advisers that the reduc-
tion, while it can hardly fail to benefit the
consumer, will not, in the long run, prove
detrimental to the Treasury.</p>

<p>As has already been stated, the Budget for
1906 includes a sum of no less than L.E.
120,000 for the improvement in the salaries of
the Cadre officials, which for reasons given
above have diminished in purchasing power to
a distressing extent. In the case of the minor
officials their pay no longer constitutes a living
wage, and when vacancies occur no candidates
are forthcoming to fill them. As the causes which
produce this effect are precisely those that
pour an increasing stream of wealth into the
coffers of the State, it seemed but right that a
portion of the same should be employed in
ameliorating the lot of the Government servants.
A good many salaries, especially of technical
officials, have already been spasmodically rais-
ed from time to time in order to retain the
services of men who would otherwise have
found it worth while to quit the Government
service and even sacrifice their pension for the
more lucrative prospects held out by private
employers. It is now proposed to readjust the
whole scale on a uniform basis. A Cadre
Committee of experienced officials sat during
the early months of the year and produced an
interesting and careful report. The pressure
of work which always occurs in the autumn
has made it impossible to proceed further with
the matter this year, but with the beginning
of the new year it will be taken up again, and
it is hoped that a month or two will suffice to
rearrange the system on a sounder basis, such
rearrangement to have effect from January
1st, 1906.</p>

<p>It is perhaps well that I should here men-
tion that the sum of L. E. 120,000 set aside
for this purpose, considerable as it is, will not,
I fear, suffice to realise, the dreams of those
who imagine that a golden age is approaching.
It will be no more possible to amass a fortune
in the Government service in the future than
it was in the past. An equitable readjustment
is all that is and can be aimed at, and I may
add that efficient work and probably longer
hours will be required in return for increas-
ed pay.</p>

<p>In close connection with the reorganisation
of the cadre is the question of a new Pension
Law which is naow being taken seriously in
hand under expert actuarial advice from Eng-
land. The present law is admittedly had,
but a scientific pension law in a country
where the officials are partly Christian, partly
native and partly foreign, presents enormous
difficulties, and it is impossible to say when
the project will be sufficiently advanced to be
submitted to the Council of Ministers. Here,
again, interested parties must not be too
sanguine. It would be easy for the Khedive's
present advisers to promulgate a pension law
which would meet with popular favour. The
results during the first ten years might be
highly satisfactory; they would hardly be so
much longer. In framing a pension lew it is
necessary to calculate the cost not only for the
present generation but for the next.</p></div>

<div type="item"><head>DAIRA SANIEH LIQUIDATION.</head>

<p>One of the most important financial events
of the year was the liquidation of the Daira
Administration, which was practically brought
to an end in the course of 1905.</p>

<p>A summary of the question may not be
uninteresting.</p>

<p>The settlement of the Financial situation of
Egypt in November, 1876, took no account of
the debt of the "Daira Sanieh," a special
administration charged with the management
of certain properties acquired by the late
<persName>Khedive Ismail</persName>. With a view to paying off
that debt an arrangement was made in 1877
by Messrs. <persName>Goschen</persName> &amp; <persName>Joubert</persName> to float a loan
having a first mortgage on the Daira Sanieh
properties. The Khedivial Treasury engaged
to make good any deficiency in the annual
budget of the Daira Sanieh Administration
after payment of the interest charge. The
surplus revenue as well as the proceeds of
sales, were assigned to the redemption of the
debt.</p>

<p>Later on the Daira properties were ceded to
the Government. The Law of Liquidation, in
confirming the cession, maintained the same
arrangement.</p>

<p>In 1890, the loan was converted, the
balance of the debt standing at 7,299,860.</p>

<p>In 1898 the Government entered into an
agreement with a group of financiers who
undertook to realise the assets of the Daira,
to pay off the balance of the debt, and to share
the possible eventual profits equally with the
Government. The venture turned out unex-
pectedly successful for both parties.</p>

<p>Since 1898 all the properties of the Daira
Sanieh have been sold, mostly to native land-
owners, at a total price of about 12,100,000.</p>

<p>The excess of revenue of the Daira Adminis-
tration, including that of 1905, amounted to
nearly 1,200,000, making a grand total of
13,300,000. Deducting the loan outstanding
in Hune 1898 viz; 6,431,000, the profit to be
divided between the Government and the
company, with some equitable deductions in
favor of the latter, may be estimated at
6,800.</p>

<p>The balance of the loan still in circulation
on the 15th October, 1905, viz., 4,444,340,
has been paid off.</p></div>

<head>TRIBUNAL DE COMMERCE MIXTE</head>

<p>L’Affaire du "Cairo"</p>

<p>La tribunal Mixte de Commerce d’Alaxan-
dria vient de prononcer son jugement dans
l'affaire du “Cairo”.</p>

<p>En voici les principaux attendus.</p>

<p>Attendu que la Societe Generale de Navi-
gation Italieone F<persName>lorio Rubattino</persName> ayant fait
abandon du navire et du fret, les demandeurs
ont conolu a la nomination du Sieur Prencipi
deja nomme tiers consiguataire du navire
“Cairo” par ordonnance du nrefere du 21 mars
1905, liquidateur judiciaire pour la repartition
amiable entre parties sauf a porter toute con-
testation devant ce tribunal; quils demandent
en meme temps la fixation du montant du
pejudice materiel et moral subi par suite du
nanfrage;</p>

<p>Attendu que la Societe <persName>Florio Rubattino</persName>
declare que par suite de l’abandon elle n’a
pas de conclusions a prendre du chef de la
liquidation des sommes reclamees a titre de
dommages-interets et qu'elle adhere-a la nomi-
nation du liquidateur judiciaire dans les
termes de la demande ; qu’il y a lieu de lui
donner acte de cette declaration.</p>

<p>Attendu que le Comire des assureurs mari-
time de Genes tout en contestant les dom-
mages moraux declare s’eu referer a justice
pour le reste ;</p>

<p>Attendu en ce qui concerne les dommages-
interets que les demandeurs font valoir le
prejudice materiel resultant de la perte d
leurs effets et le prejudice moral a eux cause
par les angoisses et souffrances eprouvees
pendant le naufrage; qu’en l’espece l-element
moral etant de nature imponderable et par
suits non susceptible d’etre apprecie en argent
le tribunal estime qu'il n’y a pas lieu de
prendre en consideration le pretendu prejudice
moral et se borne a l'evaluation du prejudice
materiel ;</p>

<p>Attendu que le serment “in litem" propose
par une partie des demandeurs n’est pas
admissible, un tel serment n’etant prevu par
auoun article du Code de Procedure ; que
les demandes paraissant pour la plupart etre
exagerees, le tribunal en tenant compte de
la situation respective des demandeurs dout
une partie formait une troupe d’artistes
dramatiques et les autres etaient passagers
de 3me classe, pour la majeure partie de
profession inconnue et apres avoir procede
a une reduction taut proportionnelle que
progressive a fixe ex sequo et bono les sommes
plus bas indiquees en estimant qu'elles cons-
tituaieut une auffisante reparation.</p>

<p>Par ces motifs:

Statuant publiquement et contradictoire-
ment, le Ministere Public entendu, ecartant
toutes conclusions plus amples ou contraires;
joint les affaires insorites au Role General sub
N' 3036 jusqu’a 3034, 3056, 3058, 5295 jusqu’a
5324 de la XXXeme annee et statuant par un
seal et meme jugement;</p>

<p>Donne acte aux Sieurs <persName>Edward L. Lawrence</persName>,
<persName>De Blauche L. Lawrence</persName>, <persName>De Vve Elizabeth C.
Whiting</persName>, S<persName>ieur von Alten</persName>, <persName>Dr Hugo Wernicke</persName>
de leur intervention ;</p>

<p>Donne acte a la Societe Generale de Na-
vigation Italienne <persName>Florio Rubattino</persName> qu’elle
n'a pas de conclusions a prendre sur la liqui-
dation des creances des demandeurs du chef de
la perte de leurs effets ou dommages moraux
et qu’elle adhere a la nomination d’un liquida-
teur dans les conditions de la demande;</p>

<p>Nomme sur accord des parties le Sieur A.
Prencipe liquidateur judiciaire pour la reparti-
tion du net produit du navire echoue “Cairo"
et du fret abandonne;</p>

<p>Liquide les creances des demandeurs et des
intervenants <persName>von Alten et Wernicke</persName> en les re-
duisant aux sommes suivantes... (suit une
liste complete et detaillee des demandeurs
avec le montant de leurs indemnites respec-
tives).</p>

<p>Dit que pour les sommes sus-enoncees les
sus-nommes seront admis a la repartition con-
fiee an liquidateur;</p>

<p>Renvoie led parties a faire compte devant
le liquidateur; dit que faute d’entente amiable
entre parties sur toute question relative a la
repartition notamment en ce qni concerne
la determination du fret abandonne, les frais
du sauvetage et les droits eventuels de
privilege ou de preference entre passagers
et chargeurs, les contestations seront portees
devant ce tribunal pour y etre statue ulte-
rieurement sur requete de la partie la plus
diligente.</p>

<p>Depens a la charge de la liquidation.</p>

<p>Le President

(Signe De Zoltan.

Ce jugement accorde a <persName>Ermete Novelli</persName>
une somme de 75000 francs et a <persName>Olga Giannini</persName>

general des indemnites est d’environ 200,000
francs.</p></div>

<div type="item"><head>LES HABITATIONS ECONOMIQUES</head>

<p>On nous communique la traduction suivante
d'un article du Messagiere Egiziano :</p>

<p>C'est avec une reelle satisfaction et un ferme
espoir de reussite que le public de notre ville
a appris qua la Municipalite a pris en serieuse
consideration le projet des "habitations eco-
nomiques" presente par la Commission Inter-
nationale des Locataires, at a, seance tenante,
afin de mieux etudier, apprecier et resoudre
la question vitale des loyers, nomme un
Comite special compose de <persName>MM. Fenderl</persName>,
<persName>Mansour Bey Youssef</persName>, <persName>Zervudachi et Chataway
Bey</persName>.</p>

<p>Ce faisant, la Municipalite d’Alexandrie,
consciente des justes plaintss qui a’elevent
journellement de la blasse ouvriere-cette
derniere est celle, en effet, qui se ressant le
plus des augmentations tonjours croissantes
des loyers—vient d’accomplir, par sa louable
determination, une ceuvre hautement huma-
nitaire, qui lui vaudra non seulement la
reconnaissance de la population ouvriere de
la ville, mais encore la satisfaction d'avoir
soulage un nombre considerable de families
qui souvent sont obligees de se priver de
manger pour pouvoir arriver a payer leur
terme.</p>

<p>Nous vivona dans nn siflole ot le progrts
est a l’ordre du jour, et necessite pour l’homme
une juste recompense de ses fatigues. Il doit,
sans exiger le superflu, avoir le necessaire,
afin de demeurer sain et robuste, actif et
laborieux et par suite honnete et bon.</p>

<p>Il existe ici des personnes, qui ne manquent
ni de coeur ni d’intelligence, et qui n’etant
pas egoistes, out compris que le pays a le droit
d’evoluer vers le progres et la civilisation.</p>

<p>Les membres dont se compose le Comite
d’etude nomme parsla Commission sont plei-
nement a la hauteur de la mission qui leur a
ete confiee, et c'est-plains d’espoir dans leur
reussite que nous attendons avec impatience
le jour ou la villa entiere se fera un devoir de
remercier publiquement les personnes qui
auront participe a un tel relevement econo-
mique.</p>

<p>Vous, donc, Messieurs, qui avez ete choisis
pour resoudre une question sur et pour le bien
general, nos voeux les plus sinceres vous
accompagnent. Accomplissez votre haute mis-
siou de facon a ce qu’on puisse, dans la suite,
vons citer comme example de conseillers
honnetes, capables et philanthropiques.</p>

<p>Avant de terminer, permettez moi, a titre de
reconnaissance, de remercier chaudement cha-
que membre en particulier de la Commission
des Locataires. Sans etre rebutes par les
fatiques, les desillusions, affrontant toutes
especes de difficultes, et confiants dans leurs
bonnes actions et leur devoir ils ont su lutter
avec une energie indomptable, contre tous
ceux qui s’opposerent a leurs desseins, mon-
trant a cette classe ouvriere et laborieuse,
dont ils avaient assume la defense, qu’ils
etaient toujours la pour proteger ses interets
vitaux.</p>

<p>Sans a’attarder aux mesquines insinuations
qui ont ete faites a ce sujet, la louable deci-
sion de la Municipalite y a mis un terme
et c’est avec impatience que le public eu attend
le resultat.</p></div>

<p>"The Egyptian Gazette" Series
is the most artistic collection to be found
in Egypt.</p></div>


<div type="item"><head>Vade Mecum for the Homeward Bound</head>

<head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>

<p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure
in presenting to its subscribers the accompany-
ing description of some of the many interesting
routes by which they may travel homewards.
Great care had been taken to arrange them as
accurately and concisely as possible, and it
will be found that none of them are fraught
with difficulty. In Choosing the route home
there are several things to be considered. To
there are several things to be considered. To
begin with there is the difference in climate
between Egypt and the various points at which
you may arrive in Europe.</p>

<p>This depends partly upon the month in
which you leave Egypt, for <placeName>Cairo</placeName> in January
may be a little warmer than the <placeName>Riviera</placeName>, and
possibly not so warm as <placeName>Sicily</placeName>, but in March
it will be warmer than <placeName>Rome</placeName>, and more uni-
formly warm than many other places in Europe.
Many people leave Egypt far too early in the
year; for as a rule the weather in April and
May is perfect. The warmest place to go to
on leaving Egypt is <placeName>Sicily</placeName>.</p>

<p>Some will want to take into consideration
the number of days to be spent at sea, and we
therefore subjoin a list showing the time oc-
cupied on each of the various routes between
Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>

<p>They are as follows :-</p>

<p>The long sea routes-from <placeName>Port Said</placeName> or
<placeName>Alexandria</placeName> to <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>, <placeName>Southampton</placeName>, <placeName>London</placeName>
or <placeName>Liverpool</placeName>-occupy about 14 days. The
short ones are as follows:-</p>

<p>Port Said or ALexandria to <placeName>Brindisi</placeName>   3 days
Alexandria to <placeName>Messina</placeName>... ... ...      3 "
Port Said or Alexandria to <placeName>Marseilles</placeName> 5 "
Alexandria to <placeName>Venice</placeName> and <placeName>Trieste</placeName>      4 "
Alexandria to <placeName>Naples</placeName>... ...           3 "
Port Said to <placeName>Genoa</placeName>  ... ... ...       5 "
Port Said to <placeName>Naples</placeName>... ... ...        4 "
Alexandria to <placeName>Constantinople</placeName> ...      4 "
Alexandria to <placeName>Piraeus</placeName> ... ... ...     2 "
Port Said to <placeName>Gibraltar</placeName>... ... ...     7 "</p>

<p>The steamers, of the P. &amp; 0. North German
Lloyd, Orient and Messageries Mari times
are the largest. The Anchor, British India,
and Bibby Lines are also excellent, and their
steamers are largely patronised by travellers
to Egypt.</p>

<p>As regards the train journeys from <placeName>Cairo</placeName>,
the shortest is that to <placeName>Alexandria</placeName>, without
change (3 hours). That to <placeName>Port Said</placeName>, can now
be made without change in 4 1/2 hours.</p>

<p>The least expensive way to England is by
the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and Westcott
lines of steamers from <placeName>Alexandria</placeName> to <placeName>Liverpool</placeName>.
The German Levant line has also good steamers
from <placeName>Alexandria</placeName> to <placeName>Hamburg</placeName>.</p>

<p>The most expensive but quickest through
Continental routes are by P. &amp; O. Brindisi
express from Port Said, and the Austrian
Lloyd Trieste-Vienna express from Alexandria.</p>

<p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne
in mind that very little luggage is allowed
free on the railways of Europe, but there are
several good and responsible forwarding agents
in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>

<p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe
from Port Said is undoubtedly by the fast
Mail Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis" to <placeName>Brindisi</placeName>.
One of these leaves Port Said every week, as
soon as possible after receiving the Indian
mails from the great liner arrived from <placeName>Bombay</placeName>.</p>

<p>These small but comfortable ships have
enormously powerful engines, and attain a
very high rate of speed. They are called the
"ferry boats," having been specially built to
carry the British mail from <placeName>Port Said</placeName> to
<placeName>Brindisi</placeName>. If you are going straight through to
<placeName>England</placeName> you will find the train waiting at
<placeName>Brindisi</placeName> which will take you to <placeName>Calais</placeName> without
changing. It has complete arrangements for
sleeping and eating on board, and you should
arrive in London on the fifth day from leaving
<placeName>Port Said</placeName>.</p></div>

<div type="item"><head>SICILY.</head>

<p>The direct route to <placeName>Sicily</placeName> is by the Florio-
Rubattino Co.'s steamers which leave <placeName>Alex-
andria</placeName> weekly for <placeName>MESSINA</placeName>, where one takes
train to <placeName>TAORMINA</placeName>, one of the most charm-
ing and popular places on the island. <placeName>Giardini</placeName>
is he station at which to alight, and the drive
up to <placeName>Taormina</placeName> is most delightful, occupying
about one hour. In and around the town is
much to interest the visitor. The theatre is of
Greek origin, but restored under the Romans.
<placeName>CATANIA</placeName> is the starting place for the ascent
of <placeName>Etna</placeName> and here also is a fine Cathedral. The
Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that
are found all over the island, are an endless
sources of pleasure. <placeName>SYRACUSE</placeName> has an
interesting history, having been a Greek
city, which was designed by Demostheues in
B.C. 413, and taken by the Romans in b.c. 212,
when Archimedes was slain in his tomb is to be
seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan
temple. <placeName>PALERMO</placeName>, with about 300,000
inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and
enjoys a delightful climate. Much of interest
is to be found in this fine city. The <placeName>Polazzo
Reale</placeName> is of Saracenic origin and close to it the
<placeName>church of S Giovannia degli Eremiti</placeName> with its
picturesque cloisters. The <placeName>Cathedral Museum</placeName>,
<placeName>Botanic Gardens</placeName>, <placeName>Villa Giulia</placeName> and <placeName>Royal Park
 are also worth a visit.</placeName></p></div>
    
    <div type="item">
<head>CENTRAL ITALY.</head>

<p>The fine steamers of the North German
Lloyd leave <placeName>Alexandria</placeName> every Wednesday
during the season for <placeName>Naples</placeName>, the voyage
being only 3 days.</p>

<p><placeName>NAPLES</placeName> is also reached in 10 hours from
<placeName>Palermo</placeName> by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steam-
ers, which leave daily. One cannot approach
<placeName>Naples</placeName> or leave it without wishing to explore
some of its island, besides the lovely places
on its Bay— <placeName>Castellamare</placeName> and <placeName>Sorrento</placeName>. The
small steamer that takes you to <placeName>Sorrento</placeName> [you
can drive too] will take you on to <placeName>Capri</placeName>.</p>

<p>From <placeName>Naples</placeName> to <placeName>ROME</placeName> is a train journey of
but five hours. All who can will devote at
least one week to visiting the many historical
and interesting portions of the <placeName>Eternal City</placeName>,
whose charms and beauties are too well-known
to need comment here.</p>

<p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret,
a railway journey of five hours brings you to
<placeName>FLORENCE</placeName>, where another week can well be
spent admiring the City of Flowers and its
surrounding country. In <placeName>Florence</placeName> itself the
churches and galleries are of absorbing inte-
rest, whilst the local promenades and excur-
sions should not be omitted. <placeName>The Cascine</placeName> is
the most attractive and fashionable promenade
in <placeName>Florence</placeName>, whilst the <placeName>Viale dei Colli</placeName>, one of
the finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years
ago, goes winding up through the hills a
distance of four miles. The most delightful
excursion outside <placeName>Florence</placeName> is that to Vallom-
brosa; with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the
sea level. This is made first by ordinary train
from <placeName>Florence</placeName> to <placeName>St. Ellero</placeName>, thence by cog-
wheel railway to <placeName>Saltino</placeName>. The ascent through
groves of oaks takes an hour, and most
striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>

<p><placeName>PISA</placeName> is easily reached from <placeName>Florence</placeName> in
about 2 hours ; here there is a fine <placeName>Cathedral</placeName>
and the <placeName>Leaning Tower</placeName>. A stay of at least one
night should if possible be made, in order to
enjoy the view from the <placeName>Campanile</placeName> at sunset.</p>

<p><placeName>VIAREGGIO</placeName>. One of the most delightful
places on the <placeName>Italian Riviera</placeName> near <placeName>Pisa</placeName> and on
the main line from <placeName>Rome</placeName> to <placeName>Genoa</placeName>. It is a
very convenient half-way house between Egypt
and England, and where living is reasonable
and the air and surroundings exceptionally
good.</p></div>

<div type="item"><head>NORTHERN ITALY</head>

<p><placeName>GENOA</placeName> (La Superba).—The most
picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
the record of having one of the lowest
death averages of European cities and a
phenomenally equable temperature—warm in
winter and deliciously cool breezes from the
surrounding mountains and the <placeName>Mediterranean</placeName>
in summer.</p>

<p>The patriarchal home of Italy’s most an-
eient nobility, whose palaces, gardens, and
famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and
paintings, are a constant delight to thousands
of travellers who annually sojourn in <placeName>Genoa</placeName>.
Then there are the superbly decorated medie-
val churches containing exquisite marble
columns and historical paintings, and the in-
comparable <placeName>Campo Santo</placeName> filled with its won-
derful tombs.</p>

<p>From <placeName>Genoa</placeName> to <placeName>Milan</placeName> is a matter of only
three hours by rail.</p>

<p><placeName>MILAN</placeName> is a good centre for Northern Italy
before making the tour of the Lakes. The
Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its
beautiful windows illustrating the History of
the Bible. The public gardens and the monu-
mental cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>

<p>Between <placeName>Bologna</placeName> and <placeName>Milan</placeName> and only an
hour and-a-half from <placeName>Milan</placeName> is <placeName>SALSOMAG-
GIORE</placeName>, a renowned health resort on account
of its thermal springs, change trains at <placeName>Borgo
San Domingo</placeName> and in half-an-hour you are at
<placeName>Salsomaggiore</placeName>.</p>



<p>NORTHERN ITALY (continued)
and
The ITALIAN LAKES.</p>

<p><placeName>VENICE</placeName> is a 5 hours journey by rail from
<placeName>Milan</placeName>, and one of the most delightful places
imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total
absence of vehicular traffic strikes one as very
strange; no horse, cart, carriage or bicycle is
to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life
at every turn. The approach to <placeName>Venice</placeName> from
<placeName>the Adriatic</placeName> is unlike that of any other sea-
port. The town seems to be gradually, like
Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills behind, no
stretches of rock, but the first the tops of <placeName>Cam-
paniles</placeName> appear above the horizon, then slowly
the whole glittering town rises like a fairy
mirage out of the calm lagoon.</p>

<p>Going northwards from <placeName>Milan</placeName> you make the
tour of the beautiful Italian lakes.</p>

<p><placeName>COMO</placeName>, the birthplace of the younger Pliny,
is reached in one-and-a-quarter hours by train
by way of <placeName>Monza</placeName>.</p>

<p>Boats leave <placeName>Como</placeName> frequently for the other
towns on the lake, which is very beautiful, and
the scenery on either side going up the lake is
most enchanting. <placeName>CERNOBBIO</placeName> is a charming
spot; then come <placeName>Tremezzo</placeName>, <placeName>Cadenabbia</placeName>, and
<placeName>Menaggio</placeName> with the prettily-situated town of
<placeName>Bellaggio</placeName> opposite. The walk from <placeName>Tremezzo</placeName>
along the shore of the lake to <placeName>Managgio</placeName> is most
enjoyable. A steam tram runs from <placeName>Menaggio</placeName>
to <placeName>Porlezza</placeName> on <placeName>Lake Lugano</placeName> in three-quarters
of an hour, then steamer to <placeName>Lugano</placeName> in two-and-
three-quarter hours.</p></div>

<div type="item"><head>SWITZERLAND</head>

<p><placeName>Switzerland</placeName>, the heart of Europe, has been
described as "A cluster of delights and
grandeurs."</p>

<p><placeName>LUGANO</placeName> is some 20 miles from <placeName>Como</placeName> and
reached by train in one-and-a-half- hours. It has
a population of 10,000 people and is charm-
ingly situated on the <placeName>Lake of Lugano</placeName>, amidst
lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise <placeName>M. San
Salvatore</placeName>, <placeName>M. de Caprino</placeName> and <placeName>M. Generoso</placeName>.</p>

<p><placeName>LOCARNO</placeName> may be reached by rail from
<placeName>Bellinzona</placeName> in forty minutes. This pretty town,
situated at the top of <placeName>Lake Maggiore</placeName>, has a
mild climate, and is an excellent winter resort.
The church <placeName>Madonna del Sasso</placeName>, situated above
the town, is worth a visit, as it contains interest-
ing paintings, "Entombment," by <persName>Ciseri</persName>, and
"The Flight into Egypt" by <persName>Bramantion</persName>.</p>

<p><placeName>LUCERNE</placeName>- A striking picture on the <placeName>Lake
of Lucerne</placeName> facing the <placeName>Rigi</placeName> and <placeName>Pilatus</placeName> and
the snow-clad <placeName>Alps</placeName>.</p>

<p>In and around the town the walks are
charming, and the excursions to be made from
<placeName>Lucerne</placeName> by boat, rail, etc., are very numerous.</p>

<p>The <placeName>Lake of Lucerne</placeName> abounds in delightful
excursions, those to the <placeName>Rigi</placeName>, <placeName>Pilatus</placeName>, <placeName>Burgen-
stock</placeName> and <placeName>Sonnenberg</placeName> needing a special visit
each. Other excursions on the lake can be
made by steamer, and the ever-changing
scenery on the trip from <placeName>Lucerne</placeName> to <placeName>Fluelen</placeName> is
a source of delight to the lover of nature.</p>

<p><placeName>BRUNNEN</placeName>, charmingly situated on the
most beautiful part of the <placeName>Lake of Lucerne</placeName>,
commands magnificent views of lake and
mountain scenery. Along the <placeName>Lake of Uri</placeName>
from <placeName>Brunnen</placeName> to <placeName>Fluelen</placeName> runs the famous
<placeName>Axentrasse</placeName>.</p>

<p>A delightful excursion from Lucerne is
that to <placeName>ENGELBERG</placeName>. Take boat to <placeName>Stansstad</placeName>
and from <placeName>Stansstad</placeName> it is about 1 hour and
40 min. by Electric Railway, with delightful
scenery en route. The ascent of <placeName>Titlis</placeName> is
made from here, and the panoramic view of
the <placeName>Alps</placeName> is grand; extending from <placeName>Monte
Rosa</placeName> to the <placeName>Black Forest</placeName>, and from the
<placeName>Santis</placeName> to the <placeName>Matterhous</placeName>.</p>

<p><placeName>THE BERNESE OBERLAND-INTER-
LAKEN</placeName> a favourite summer resort and the best
centre for making excursions in the <placeName>Oberland</placeName>,
abounding in fine walks and views. There is
a magnificent view of the <placeName>Jungfrau</placeName> from the
<placeName>Hoheweg</placeName>, a fine avenue of walnut trees the
chief resort of visitors. <placeName>Interlaken</placeName> is also not
far from the famous waterfalls, <placeName>Giessbach</placeName>,
<placeName>Trummelbach</placeName>, and <placeName>Staubbach</placeName>. Then also the
glaciers of <placeName>Grindelwald</placeName> and view from <placeName>Murren</placeName>
and the <placeName>Schynige Platte</placeName> are sights not to be
missed.</p>

<p><placeName>Chateau D'Oex</placeName>. 3500 ft. above the sea
on the new Electric Railway between <placeName>Montreaux</placeName>
and <placeName>Interlaken</placeName>, surrounded by magnificent
scenery, with pure dry air. Much frequented
by English people in Summer and Winter.</p></div>

<div type="item"><head>GREEK AND IONIAN ISLES</head>
<p>Many people visit <placeName>Greece</placeName> after wintering
in Egypt, as it is so easily reached from <placeName>Alex-
andria</placeName>; the climate in April is charming. The
best steamers are those of the Khedivial Mail
Co. and the Russian Steam Navigation Co.</p>

<p>If possible tourists should arrange to be in
<placeName>Athens</placeName> for the Orthodox Easter in order to
witness the Good Friday and Easter Eve
ceremonies, and to be present at the dancing
on the Easter Tuesday festival held at <placeName>Megara</placeName>
for which a special train is run from <placeName>Athens</placeName>.</p>

<p>It is worth while to spend a few days in
<placeName>CORPU</placeName> on account of the beauty of the
scenery. There is also good snipe and quail
shooting to be had.</p>
