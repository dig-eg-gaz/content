                        reading. The recent abnormal rise of prices, speculation, cotton, the recent
                        and popular reduction in taxation, the question of salaries and pensions,
                        and the Daira Sanieh liquida- tion, in which the Government's share of the
                        profits amount to over L.E. 3,000,000, are all discudded and are all well
                        worth reading.</p>
                    <p>There are two passages in <persName>Sir Vincent Cor- bett</persName>'s Note
                        which we venture to criticise. In dealing with the question of speculation
                        he takes, we imagine, slightly pessimistic view of the general effects of
                        any reaction against over-speculation. We admit that unwary investors may
                        suffer, but what proport on do those who will go to the wall bear to the
                        wholepopulation of Egypt. In our opinion the general prosperity of the
                        country, if affect- ed at all by their collapse, will be affected very
                        slightly, for there is a very large majority composed of men of means,
                        mostly natives, that has not yet begun to indulge in specula- tion to any
                        great extent. If the natice land owners begin as a body to emulate some of
                        our fellow citizens who speculate in the hands on incomes of 150 a year,
                        then we admit the country will suffer; but have we reached that point yet?
                        None the less the warning against overspeculation containes excellent adivce
                        to all who may be bitten bu the fever, and while we differ in our estimate
                        of the gravity of the results of over-speculation, we are ready to
                        acknowledge that facts may yet prove us to have underrated the evil and
                        minimised the danger. There is one other point which we should like to
                        criticise. <persName>Sir Vincent Corbett</persName> remarks, in dealing with
                        salaries and pensions, that "it will be no more possible to amass a fortune
                        in the Government service in the future than in the past." Did not
                        Government officials in <persName>Ismad</persName>'s days at times achieve
                        the impos- sible> But perhaps that period may be regard- ed as buried in
                        oblivion, and the average offi- cial who has not made fortunes in recent
                        days will, we hope, appreciate the Financial Advi- ser's remarks on the
                        necessity of ameliorating the conditions of his service.</p>
                    <p>A capital defence of the Railway Adminis- tration is another feature of the
                        report. We shall revert to this on another occassion, but for the present we
                        need only say that the quoudam Cinderella among the Government Depart- ments
                        is now being criticised because, having come into millions, she does not
                        expend every piastre of them at once. The Financial Adviser points out that
                        our energetic importers forget that there are taxpayers in whose defence the
                        authorities must attempt to get the best value for the large sums they are
                        now expending, and that, unlike the heroine of the fairy tale who dounf
                        herself in the possession of all that she desired the instant she wedded the
                        Prince, the Railway Administration has to wait for its quays to be widened,
                        its lines to be doubled, and its warehouses to be built. <persName>Sir
                            Vincent Corbett</persName> and his predecessors have done great things,
                        but they have not learnt to create build- ings and public works by a stroke

                    <p>(From our own Correspondent). Luxor, Sunday.</p>
                    <p>A discovery of the utmost importance has just been made by the well-known
                        American Egyptologist, Mr. <persName>Theodore M. Davis</persName>, who has
                        discovered in the valley of the <placeName>Tombs of the Kings</placeName>,
                        the tomb of <persName>Mer-en Ptah</persName>, a pharaoh of the 19th dynasty.
                        The tomb is beautifully painted, but no antiquities were found.</p>
                    <p>This pharaoh, who is also known as <persName>Meneptab</persName>, is thought
                        by many to have been the pharaoh of the Exodus. His mummy was found in the
                        tomb of <persName>Amenhotep II</persName> at Thebes. He suppressed the
                        revolt of the Libyans, which broke out in the fifth year of his reign. His
                        "Hymn of Triumph" is out on the back of a large stele, which is now in the

                    <p>"Egyptian Rubber Concessions." A usually wide-awake jobber in the Egyptian

                        last week made the victim of an old, old hoax. Although a very experienced
                        member, he was induced to make a market in 'Egyptian Rubber Conces- sions,"
                        and he must have been delegated to find business so brisk. The joke was well
                        planned and executed. It was not long before the jobber found himself short
                        of several hundred shares, the price being bid up against him, but about an
                        hour elapsed before he came to realise that the concern had only an
                        imaginary existence.</p>

                    <p>The <placeName>Alexandria Native Court</placeName> was again oc- cupied on
                        Sunday and yesterday with the proceedings against the first batch of persons
                        accused of participating in the recent distur- bance at Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>The accused were defended by <persName>Ali Bey As- sem</persName>, whose
                        defence was based on the following points: The originators of the trouble
                        were low-class Greeks and the natives were there as spectators. The mob,
                        which was composed of dif- ferent nationalities, was not an unusual gather-
                        ing, as the day was a Sunday and all the people were idling on that day. The
                        natives took no part in the outrages under any circumstances, as can be seen
                        from the fact that a small number of detectives was sufficient to arrest
                        these 104 persons, who made no resistance after the mob was dispersed, and
                        while the authorities were holding an enquiry into the matter at the
                            <placeName>Menshieh Caracol</placeName>. Only 22 persons of different
                        nationalities were slightly injured among the enormous crowd, but these ware
                        not attacked by the unfortunate accused, against whom there is no evidence.
                        Even the detectives did not declare before the Court that the accused had
                        injured people. The witnesses for the defence spoke the truth, while no
                        other witnesses could charge these 104 natives with committing any crime.
                        Article 207 of the Penal Code, which the Parquet required to be taken as a
                        base fur a verdict against the accused, was not appli- cable in the case of
                        these men. There people gathered together in the Grand Square out of
                        curiosity. If there had been any fanaticism the disorder could not have been
                        suppressed with such ease by a small body of police, nor would a fire hose
                        have been sufficient to disperse them. The detectives who arrested these 104
                        persons out of a crowd of 15,000 people could not identify them as the real
                        evildoers. Public security in Alexandria has never been menaced, nor must
                        some of the European newspapers be believed, who for their own purposes have
                        misled their readers by stating that fanaticism was at the bottom of the
                        outbreak. The question is very simple. Some Greeks, under the aegis of the
                        Capitulations, fired at one another on a Sunday, when most people have
                        nothing to do. A crowd of sight- seers gathered together, composed of men
                        and women of every race and nation, in order to see what was going on, and
                        the upshot was "a storm in a teacup."</p>
                    <p>The above was the gist of the speech of the counsel for the defence.</p>
                    <p>The Parquet called upon the Court to punish the accused in accordance with
                        Article 207 of the Penal Code, and in the case of those who had previous
                        convictions against them, in accordance with Articles 48 and 49, and the
                        boys in accordance with Article 61 of the same code.</p>
                    <p>At 7.46 p.m. yesterday evening the Court gave its judgment on the 104
                        accused, acquit- ting 28, sentencing 53 to three months' im- prisonment with
                        hard labour, 13 to six months' imprisonment with hard labour, 3 t0 be

                        recital of seven sacred pieces, showing the beautiful combination of the
                        various stops.</p>
                    <p>The organ has a rich and full tone, and its sound was fully appreciated by
                        the congregation. It is of tubular pneumatic action throughout, and has a
                        double bass (Casson’s patent), which enables any one to play the pedal notes
                        on the key-board, the lowest note only sounding. The effect of a second
                        manual is obtained by the melodic stop, whereby the melody of a hymn or
                        voluntary is made to stand out above the accompaniment. The entire organ has
                        been specially constructed to suit the climate.</p>

                    <p>On Saturday last the third performance of La Tosca was given and drew, as
                        usual, a vast and highly appreciative audience. It was an excellent
                        representation from first to last, one calculated to cause ecstacies of
                        rapturous emotion. <persName>Signs. Bellincioni</persName> overpowered us by
                        her forcible and gifted acting, coupled with exquisite singing, a
                        combination which never fails to convey the pathos which this difficult role
                        demands. Her notes were pure and pene- trating as ever, though not quite so
                        powerful as on the last occasion we witnessed this opera, and for this the
                        damp weather will no doubt have been to blame. <persName>Sig.
                            Palet</persName>, as Mario, again sang with fervour, dignity, and
                        distinction, while <persName>Sig. Polese</persName> repeated his remarkably
                        fine interpretation of the heavy part of Scarpia. <persName>Sig
                            Gisnoli</persName> took great pains to give full effect to the role of
                        the Sagrestano. The orchestra, under <persName>Sig. Zuccani</persName>, left
                        nothing to be desired.</p>

                    <p>At <placeName>Cairo</placeName>on ’Xmas Day the usual services were held at
                        the Protestant and Roman Ca- tholic churches, and in the evening a small
                        dance was given at <placeName>Shepheard’s</placeName>, where every- thing
                        went as merrily as the date demanded and dancing lasted till very late. The
                        banks were dosed, the British Government officials took holiday, and the
                        Europeans in general affected to be satisfied with the weather on the ground
                        that 'Xmas ought to be cold.</p>
                    <p>On 'Xmas Eve an imposing ’Xmas Tree was to be seen in the <placeName>Grand
                            Continental Hotel</placeName>. The little ones were delighted and the
                        grown ups enjoyed a small dance that followed to the full. The ball-room was
                        crowded and dancing lasted till those present could wish "a merry ’Xmas" to
                        one another before they went home.</p>
                    <p>SHEPHEARD’S CHRISTMAS TREE.</p>
                    <p>A large and merry crowd of children with a still larger attendance of
                        "grown-ups" collect- ed in the outer hall of <placeName>Shepheard’s
                            Hotel</placeName> on Sunday afternoon to await the drawing aside of the
                        curtains and the revelation of a magni- ficent Christmas Tree in the
                        "Egyptian Hall.” From half-past four to half-past five the guests arrived in
                        ever-increasing numbers, and save for the occasional protest of a few infant
                        voices at not being allowed immediate entrance to the fairy-laud within, all
                        were gay and happy from beginning to end. But the infants turned from teats
                        to cries of enjoyment and babbling laughter as the curtains parted and the
                        throng slowly pressed into the hall and surrounded the gorgeously decorated
                        and illuminated tree, and tiny hands were stretch- ed out to the master of
                        the ceremonies to receive a coveted ticket which would ensure a memento of
                        this Christmas party. The presents were laid out in the billiard room, the
                        tables of which were burdened with books and toys of every description
                        (without even a word of protest from their guardian angel, Percy), and every
                        little guest departed with a heart gladdened by a beautiful gift. The
                        Tzigane orchestra played selections of music during the afternoon, and the
                        buffets, which were abundantly furnished with teas, cakes, ices, and all
                        sorts of good things, were well patronised. <persName>Mr. Baehler</persName>
                        ana most generously, and his party was greatly enjoyed by the several
                        hundreds of guests who were present.</p>

                        been so crowded as on the afternoon of 'Xmas Eve. It was really sur- prising
                        when everybody is supposed to be up by the <placeName>Nile</placeName>, to
                        find such a large gathering of smart people at <placeName>Mena
                            House</placeName>. At 4.8 p.m. the charming dining-hall was filled with
                        a select audience for the carol singing by the staff choir. Unfortunately,
                        however, they were unable to complete the programme, which consisted of six
                        items, on account of the well- deserved encores of the carol singers. These
                        quaint old German songs were alone well worth the trip to Mena, and the
                        zither accom- paniment and the "echo" effect of "Teure Heimat" were very
                        good. The dining hall itself with its 'Xmas Tree and the illuminated models
                        of the <placeName>Sultan Hassan Mosque</placeName> and some ancient temple
                        produced, with the candles and electric light, quite a fairy scene.</p>

                    <head>CYRANO DE BERGERAC.</head>
                    <p>It is a distinct pleasure to be able to attempt a serious criticism instead
                        of the usual resume of the play and list of the actors on to whose names are
                        tacked "sustained the role of," "his known verve," etc. For the performance
                        of Cyrano will quite bear criticism, even compari- son,to a certain degree,
                        with more famous repre- sentations of the same play, in Paris. It is a play
                        with two parts—possibly three, if we count Ragueneau, and it proved in
                        consequence not beyond the reach of the company. <persName>Mme
                            Moreno</persName> played Roxane, and achieved most accurately the exact
                        "precieuse plus beauty" note: a thankless note indeed hered for it allows of
                        very little passion or emotion: it has but affectation and a certain
                        delicate egoism. <persName>M Daragon</persName> was Cyrano, and after the
                        first two acts proved good; in the balcony scene, the journey to the moon,
                        and the last act of all he was really excellent. The ballads duel in the
                        first act was well done: but for the greater part of this and the second, he
                        missed, or exaggerated, his chances: he suggested the schoolboy anxious to
                        get through his Virgi repetition, or on the other hand he relied on one or
                        two intonations to carry off all points. Now the points all through are
                        many, subtle, various; one has only to see <persName>Coquelin</persName> to
                        discover that. His gestures were good all through; but the “make-up," except
                        in the last act, was not at all right; where was the nose. Scarcely in
                        evidence, and certainly not "stalking before me, half a league ahead.” The
                        other parts were good after their kind except . de Guiche. <persName>M.
                            Monteux</persName> lacked dignity and restraint and was too excited for
                        the "grand seigneur" he was supposed to represent. The staging of the "siege
                        of Arrus" scene was not good; and the effect of the supers charging down the
                        steps was absurd. It is some six years since we saw it in Paris, but if we
                        remember right the supers hardly appeared at all; only their heads showed,
                        the Gasoons' post being on an eminence above them. Well, to sum up, it might
                        have been much worse, and even if it wasn’t “Paris," it was safely above the
                        "provin- cial" mark.</p>

                    <p>Your Highness, — I have the honour to present this letter of credence from
                        the Presi- dent, accrediting me to the Egyptian Govern- nent as American
                        Agent and Consul General. I am charged to renew to Your Highness the
                        assurance of the cordial feeling of friendship and respect with which the
                        President and the people of the United States regard this wonder- ful Egypt:
                        and to emphasize the hope that this friendship may become even closer. It is
                        a pleasure to me personally to act as the American representative in
                            <placeName>Cairo</placeName>, and I ask, and feel sure that I shall
                        receive, the support and encouragement of your Highness in the care which I
                        shall give to American interests in Egypt, commercial and otherwise. Allow
                        me to offer my best wishes for the health and happiness of Your Highness,
                        and for the pros- perity of your country and its people.</p>
                    <p>His Highness replied as follows:— Monsieur l’Agent,—Je reçois avec un vif
                        plaisir la lettre que vous me remettez et suis heureux des sentiments que

                        est confiée.</p>

                    <head>11TH MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS</head>
                    <head>AFFAIR SENT BEFORE TRIBUNALS.</head>
                    <p>At 3.30 p.m. on Saturday the eleventh meeting of the creditors of the Société
                        de- Sucreries et de la Raffinerie d'Egypte took place at the
                            <placeName>Commercial Chamber of the Mixed Tribunals Cairo</placeName>,
                        under the presidency of <persName>Judge Tuck</persName>. <persName>Me.
                            Carton de Wiart</persName>, whose lameness prevented him from rising,
                        was grant- ed permission to speak sitting, and opened the ball with a plea
                        for a farther postponement. He stated that the proposals made under the
                        concordat had been sent to <placeName>Paris</placeName> and that a wire had
                        been received from <placeName>Paris</placeName> begging for a postponement
                        of their publication till the 19th inst. Since then certain modifications
                        had been insisted on by the shareholders, and matters were not yet finally
                        settled. This being so, he begged for a week's postponement, and expressed
                        the hope that the juge-commis- would be induced, in deference to the wishes
                        of the whole body of creditors, to withdraw from his determination already
                        expressed to send the affair before the Tribunals.</p>
                    <p><persName>Me. St. Plancat</persName> and <persName>Me. Bakri</persName>,
                        representing <persName>Me. Padoa Bey</persName>, joined in the demand, but
                            <persName>Judge Tuck</persName> was inexorable as Rhadamanthus. He
                        remarked that the cessation of payments took place on September 7. The
                        judgment authorising the application of the concordat préventif was given on
                        September 19. The first meeting of creditors took place on October 4, when
                        the first report of the experts was read. The Sucreries asked for a
                        postponement on account of the shareholders’ meeting. The next meeting
                        accordingly took place on October 18, and since then matters had made no
                        progress, in spite of eleven meetings. Conse- quently he saw no alternative
                        but to send the case before the Tribunal on Saturday next.</p>
                    <p>The avocats protested in vain. "You will bring your proposals before the
                        Tribunal,” quoth the judge, “far more rapidly. Here we have nothing but
                        requests for new postpone- ments and promises for the next time, but I have
                        not had any communication of the pro- posals made to me." <persName>Me.
                            Carton de Wiart</persName> remarked that the proposals had been sent to
                        Paris. <persName>Judge Tuck</persName> observed that they had not been made
                        before him. <persName>Me. St. Plancat</persName> then asked whether the
                        proposals might be discussed before the Tribunal. An emphatic negative from
                            <persName>Judge Tuck</persName>, who pointed out that the Tribunal
                        simply had to decide whether the company was to be ad- mitted to the
                        privileges of the concordat pre- ventif. For his part he would not keep the
                        responsibility of the affair on his shoulders for 48 hours.</p>
                    <p>The greffier, <persName>M. Zigliara</persName>, then read the following note
                        from the experts, <persName>Sir W. Will- cocks</persName>,
                            <persName>Fourneron Bey</persName>, and <persName>Prof.
                            Sampaolo</persName> :-</p>
                    <p>Monsieur le Juge Commis,</p>
                    <p>Nous avons l'honneur de vous informer que nons avons fait notre estimation du
                        bilan dec Sucreries en admettant qu'avant la fin de novembre l'avenir de
                        cette Société serait défini- tivement résolu.</p>
                    <p>Les renvois successifs demandés font que nous sommes á fin décembre et
                        qu'auoune dé- cision n'a été prise.</p>
                    <p>Nous considéron que la culture de la canne pour l'exercice 1906 1907 est déja
                        compromise. car les cultivateurs ne peuvent pas faire des arrangements pour
                        les cultures de l'anuée pro- chaine, sans ê re certains que lears
                        productions seront schetées.</p>
                    <p>Nous vous avons d'ailleurs monsieur le juge commis, mis an courant de cerre
                        situation dans notre première entrevue en octobre dernier.</p>
                    <p>Nous croyons donc devoir vous informer que notre estimation des usines,
                        matériel et pièces de rechange, etc. a été fixée pensant qu'une décision
                        définitive serait prise immédiatement après le dépôt de notre troisième
                        rapport; mais industriellement parlant ces prix devraient déjà être diminués
                        et si cette décision devait encore tarder, la valeur industrielle des
                        usines, etc. deviendrait fort deuteuse, à moins que MM. les controleurs et
                        administrateurs, ayant pris en considération l’avis que nous avons donné le
                        23 novembre, aient déjà traité avec les propriétaires de la Hante-Egypte
                        afin d’as- surer aux usines de la Société la canne néces- saire et en
                        quantité sufficante pour une période- de 4 années.</p>

                    <head>PICTURE EXHIBITION.</head>
                    <p>On Saturday last <persName>M. Warton Mahokian</persName> open- ed the
                        exhibition of his paintings at the Immeu- ble Bitter in Opera-square, Cairo,
                        and though the weather was bitterly cold and rain fell occasionally, quite a
                        number of people visited the rooms, where there were over a hundred oil
                        paintings on view. Though all of these were not to our taste, they were all
                        well painted, and it was evident that the work had been done by a real
                        artist. Seascapes were the principal fea- tures of the exhibition and the
                        painting of sea scenes certainly seem to be <persName>M.
                        Mahokian</persName>’s forte, whilst of his landscape his winter scenes were
                        the best. Of these latter, two were espe- cially effective and realistic, a
                        winter’s evening in <placeName>Russia</placeName> and a similar scene in the
                        environs of <placeName>Berlin</placeName> (Nos. 84 and 71), and of other
                        land- scapes a picture of a brigands’ resting place in the
                            <placeName>Caucasus</placeName> (No. 47) was remarkable for its boldness
                        and excellent colour effects; there was also a very fine painting of a
                        woodland scene (No. 11) in which the colouring was very true to nature.
                        Among the seascapes there were several fine sunsets, notably on the
                            <placeName>Jutland shores</placeName> (No. 24) and on the
                            <placeName>Swedish shores</placeName> (No. 94), and some splendid
                        paintings of stormy seas. We certainly recommend our read- ers to pay this
                        excellent exhibition a visit.</p>

                    <head>FOOTBALL</head>
                    <p>On Friday, 15th inst., a football match was played between Boulac Railway
                        Institute and the R.E. The home team won the toss and de- fended Embabeh
                        end. There were considerably more than 150 spectators on the club veran-
                        dah. The play during the first half was of a very even character and neither
                        side scored. Twenty minutes after the restarting the R.E. had the good
                        fortune of being awarded a penalty kick, from which they scored. The
                        visitors added another goal before the game was over, and thus were left
                        victors by 2-0. A heavy wind, which at periods amounted to a gale, blew

                    <head>SEVERE FIGHTING.</head>
                    <head>5,000 KILLED, 14,000 WOUNDED.</head>
                    <p><placeName>St. Petersburg</placeName>, December 23. The whole strength of the
                        strike is centred at <placeName>Moscow</placeName>, at which city the
                        Government is strenuously fighting against it. The represent- atives of
                        strikers, while dismissing their final plans in a large building yesterday
                        evening, were summoned to surrender. They replied with bombs and revolvers,
                        upon which the artillery shelled the building until they capi- tulated.
                        Barricades have been erected, but the troops have stormed several them.</p>
                    <p><placeName>Moscow</placeName>, December 23. Severe fighting has taken place
                        between the dragoons and the strikers. Barricades have been destroyed. 40
                        strikers, 5 officers, and 13 soldiers have bean killed or wounded. (H.)</p>
                    <p><placeName>Moscow</placeName>, December 24.. A regular pitched battle is
                        engaged in in the streets here. Yesterday afternoon there was incessant
                        firing in all quarters of the city, which was still progressing at ten
                        o’clock in the evening. It is impossible to estimate the num- ber of
                        casualties.</p>
                    <p>Apparently the revolutionary party is not yet crushed. Guns posted in a
                        commanding position at a monastery and in a square in the heart of the city
                        opened a hot fire on the barricades during the afternoon, while quick firers
                        swept the boulevards which debouch on the square. Fire was concentrated on
                        the barricades on <placeName>Tverskykastreet</placeName>, destroying them.
                        Meanwhile a large force of infantry kept up an incessant rifle fire, and
                        sharpshooters posted in the belfry of the monastery picked off insurgents.
                        Different parts of the town are isolated, and insurgents, who are supplied
                        with arms and ammunition, are erecting fresh barricades, and are still
                        holding some districts.</p>
                    <p>(5.0 p.m.) Artillery, rifle, and revolver fire continued during the whole
                        day. The guns bombarded barricade after barricade, charges of dragoons
                        followed the cannonade. The debris was then burned. The area of the fighting
                        is extending and is now proceeding in the suburbs, with losses on both
                        sides.</p>
                    <p>The revolutionary party is apparently not yet disheartened, though the
                        wounded alone on Saturday are estimated at 500. They scored a few minor
                        successes by means of ambuscades and bombs, in one case killing or wounding
                        20 gendarmes. All the hospitals and doctors’ resi- dences are full of
                        wounded. (Reuter)</p>
                    <p><placeName>Moscow</placeName>, December 24. The artillery have bombarded the
                        barricades. The collisions are spreading. (Havas)</p>
                    <p><placeName>Moscow</placeName>, December 25. Fighting ceased at midnight.

                    <p><placeName>Moscow</placeName>, December 25. It is believed that the number of
                        people killed during the last few days amounts to 2,000. (Havas)</p>
                    <p><placeName>Moscow</placeName>, December 26. Until an early hour on Monday
                        morning there were 5,000 killed and 14,00 wounded in the fighting here. The
                        cannonading was proceeding on Monday night in several parts of the city. The
                        barricades are being desper- ately defended. Many harmless people have been
                        killed. The city is beginning to feel the lack of provisions. (Reuter)</p>

                        as they are without food. Sanguinary encoun- ters have taken place in which

                    <head>THE EMANCIPATION OF EGYPT</head>
                    <p>IV. In approaching his "Ultimate considerations” our author takes us somewhat
                        more into his confidence and says that he is addressing us in a loftier
                        strain, and is drawn into speaking of religions beliefs. He is conscious
                        that he is treading on tender ground. There we quite agree with him, and as
                        we shall endeavor to show in our concluding remarks, he is doing so in a
                        manner which is not only useless, but danger- ous. We shall therefore not
                        make any further allusion to his concluding pages, so far as they touch
                        religious questions ; we only quote a few paragraphs from them.</p>
                    <p>In a book referring only to <placeName>Egypt</placeName> it appears to us
                        quite useless to again rake up the tragedy of American colonisation. We
                        never heard that in these more enlightened times there was ever any risk
                        that such proceedings were likely to occur in Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As to our author’s concluding sentence, we will merely say that we do not
                        consider that the arguments advanced in the latter part of his book are
                        either dictated by political lure rest, by the voice of humanity, or even by
                        that of simple expediency.</p>
                    <p>The disjointed extracts which we have given may not convey a good idea of the
                        book as a whole, but we think they justify us in having said that it is a
                        remarkable book; it should be read to be appreciated, and it is Well worth
                        reading. Up to a certain point we entirely agree with the opinions expressed
                        by the author, then we come, almost imperceptibly, to a parting of the ways,
                        which leads at last to extreme divergence of opinion like two lines of
                        railway whose separation is at first almost impercepti- ble, but which end
                        by going in nearly opposite directions. The book is written in an
                        irreproach- able style, the arguments are all exceedingly moderate; it is
                        with regret, and only from a sense of duty to the land we love, that we feel
                        obliged to express some opinions contrary to those of the author. For the
                        translator, we have nothing but praise : the book is written from end to end
                        in flowing periods and well- balanced sentences, which contrast favorably
                        with much of the slipshod English we have to put up with now-a-days. There
                        is not, as is so usual in translations, any taint of foreign idiom.</p>
                    <p>To a man so well informed as the author, we cannot help thinking that it must
                        be a matter of regret to have written the pages he devotes to Russian
                        influence. It seems extra- ordinary to read this in a book fresh from the
                        press in the latter end of this year of grace 1905, now that the brass giant
                        formerly called the Holy Russian Empire has been proved to have feet of
                        clay. It reminds us of the flood of literature, emanating any time the last
                        forty years, from the pens of educated Russian bureaucrats, as to the
                        objects and aims of their nation, these writings had about as intimate an
                        acquaintance with the real nation they referred to, as the fishes in the
                        ocean have with the first-class passengers on board a luxurious liner.
                        Unless we are much mista- ken the near future of Russia will prove to our
                        author that it is not wise for any nation to associate the religions element
                        too closely with civil government, and this is the direction towards which
                        the parting of the ways fatally leads him.</p>
                    <p>No one respects the religions element in national life more than we do, but
                        in such a cosmopolitan country as Egypt where so many foreign colonies of
                        different religions have from time immemorial acquired rights, which give
                        them, in the beautiful words of Kipling, "freedom to live by no man’s leave
                        underneath the law," this is the first con- sideration ; it is what we have
                        now, and it is what we mean - to keep if we can.</p>
                    <p>Civil laws made and enforced for the good of the whole country should be
                        carefully separated from the religions element, and still leave everyone
                        perfectly free to worship God in any way which either nationality,
                        association, or inclination may dictate, and that without interfering in any
                        way with his rights of citizen- ship.</p>
                    <p>Our author has led up to the question of the emancipation or nationalism of
                        Egypt in many ways. He goes back far enough to call our attention to the
                        rise, decline, and fall of the British power in the <placeName>Ionian
                            islands</placeName> ; he refers to other historical matters, all of
                        which appear to us to have little to do with Egypt ; he devotes a whole
                        chapter to the "false posi- tion of Great Britain in Egypt.” Without going
                        much into detail, we do not consider this position a false one ; we think
                        that England is still doing, and will continue to do, yeoman’s work in
                        Egypt, not only in her own interest but to the benefit of the world in
                        general. The most remarkable point about this book is the extraordinary
                        metamorphosis which the au- thor’s opinion seems to us to go through within
                        the limits of its pages. He begins by being the greatest apologist we have
                        yet heard of. Eng- land’s occupation of Egypt; he praises it in such lofty
                        language that at times we were tempted to recall the prophet of old, who,
                        looking down from the barren hills of <placeName>Moab</placeName>, on the
                        fertile plains and valleys on the other side of
                            <placeName>Jordan</placeName>, said, almost in spite of himself, "How
                        beautiful are thy tents, O Israel." Unlike the seer of Bible history our
                        anthor has apparently been induced to change his opinion when about half-way
                        through with his work.</p>
                    <p>To any intelligent person who has watched the course of events in this
                        country for the last thirty years, it must be evident that Egypt always has
                        required, and will still for a very long time require, some external
                        restrain- ing influence. This has been clearly shown over and over again
                        whenever anything has tended to ruffle the surface of everyday life.</p>

                        admitted and duly received his first insight into the mysteries. The
                        following distinguished brethren were appointed to fill the various offices
                        for the occasion, via: <persName>W. Bros. Chinn</persName>. S W.,

                    <p>The lodge being opened in the next degree, the W.M. elect swore allegiance to
                        the duties of the post, and on being opened in the 3rd the M. W. the Grand
                        Master of Egypt, his Excellency <persName>Idris bey Razheb</persName>,
                        entered the lodge and was duly received in accordance with ancient custom
                        and saluted as befitted his exalted rank; the gavil being banded him by the
                        W. M., the G Master requested the W. M. to carry on the work. A board of
                        installed Masters having been formed, the W. M. elect was further instructed
                        and was placed in the hair of K.S. in accordance with custom. On the return
                        of the brethren to the lodge <persName>W. Bro. Brewster Bey</persName> was
                        proclaimed and sainted from the usual position. The charter, constitu- tions
                        and bye-laws having been presented, <persName>W. Bro. Beale</persName>, I.
                        M. called, the brethren to order while he read a communication he had
                        received from the Grand Lodge, in which was a decree appointing the
                        newly-installed W. M. as Past Grand Warden of Egypt. The M. W. Grand Master
                        heartily congratulated Rt <persName>Wor. Brewster Bey</persName> on the
                        appointment. The W. M. cordially thanked him for the high honor conferred
                        upon him. The G M. then requested permis- sion to retire. The W M. was
                        saluted with the honors due to his rank, and then appointed his officers for
                        the year as follows:— I. P. M., <persName>Wor. Bro. Beale</persName>; S. W.
                        Bro. <persName>W. H Latailla</persName> ; J. W., Bro. <persName>D

                            <persName>Yacoub</persName>. W. Bro. <persName>Ahmed Nasrat
                            Bey</persName> organist, V Wor. Bro <persName>F. B. N.
                            Norman-Le</persName>, chaplain, Bros <persName>L Leon</persName> and
                            <persName>Jordan Smith</persName>, stewards.</p>
                    <p>The installation ceremony being completed, the W. M., rising, said a few
                        words regarding the manner in which the installing Master had carried out
                        the ceremony and expressed his pleasure in being now entitled to present the
                        P. M. jewel unanimously voted by the lodge, and added that, although it was
                        only a very small thing and could not adequately represent the feelings that
                        the I.P.M. had raised in the breasts of the members of the lodge for the
                        manner in which the duties in the lodge has been carried out, it was meant
                        as a mark of esteem and appreciation. The L. P. M,. replying, felt proud to
                        be a P.M. of the <placeName>Ragheb Lodge</placeName> and would ever do his
                        utmost to further its interests. He said how grateful he felt to all the
                        members for their cordial and loyal support, during his year of office, and
                        asked that the same might be extended to his successor. He felt sure that at
                        the close of this and following years the bond of friendship, would be found
                        to have grown stronger and stronger.</p>
                    <p>The balance sheet showed a very substantial cash balance at the bank, and it
                        was proposed to send a further donation to the <placeName>Blind Insti-
                            tution at Zeitoun</placeName> of 1O. This was agreed to with
                        acclamation. It was pointed out that this excellent institution received
                        candidates irrespective of religion, nationality, or stand- ing, and that it
                        deserved every encouragement, as it was now supported by subscriptions and
                        contributions similar to that now put before, the meeting. The charity bag
                        being circulat- ed produced a very handsome sum for this and similar
                        benevolent purposes.</p>
                    <p>Before closing the lodge congratulations were conveyed to the W. M. from the
                        lodges in Egypt and from all parts of the globe for a happy and successful
                        year of office.</p>
                    <p>The members then adjourned to the <placeName>Grand Continental
                            Hotel</placeName>, where a very handsomely decorated table testified to
                        the great care which is given to these festivities by its genial manager,
                        Bro. <persName>A. Klingler</persName>. The chef was called for and heartily
                        congratulated on the manner in which the good things provided were served
                        up.</p>
                    <p>The usual loyal and Masonic toasts were given with musical honors and
                        heartily re- ceived the toast of the evening being that of the W.M., who, in
                        replying, amidst storms of auplanse, signified his intention to make the
                        lodge as great a success, if not greater than his predecessor. The manner in
                        which this was received testified to the happiness that sur- rounded the
                        W.M. &amp; augors well for the future of the lodge, and the cementing of the
                        fraternal bonds.</p>
                    <p>The following brethren helped to make the evening a very pleasant one with
                        songs, recitations, selections, &amp; W. Bro. <persName>Button</persName>,

                        Inniskilling Fusilier- a portion of the band played selections during the
                        banquet, which were greatly appreciated.</p>
                    <p>The M.W. Grand Master sent his excuses with regret at being unable to be
                        present at the banquet as he had been, and is still, in the hands of his
                        medical adviser. Hopes were expressed for a speedy return to health. He was
                        very able represented by W. Bro. <persName>A.C Garofallo</persName>, A.G

                    <head>THE 1906 BUDGET.</head>
                    <head>FINANCIAL ADVISERS NOTE.</head>
                    <head>EGYPT’S CONTINUED PROSPERITY.</head>
                    <p>My last Budget Note drew attention to the rapid advance in prosperity which
                        had charac- terised the two preceding years. That prosperity has to all
                        outward appearance been maintained.</p>
                    <p>In spite of a low Nile flood in 1904, and of the remission during the last
                        three years of taxation, amounting in the aggregate to L.E. 490,000, the
                        figures of revenue for those years have been as follows:—</p>
                    <p>1903 ... ... ... ... ... L.E. 12,248,000 1904 ... ... ... ... ... ,,
                        13,690,000 1905 (approximate) ... ... „ 14,500,000</p>
                    <p>These results have encouraged the Govern- ment to take a somewhat more
                        sanguine view than would have been prudent hitherto of the probable results
                        of the next financial year; these, after allowing for a further reduction to
                        the extent of L.E. 332,000, have been calculated at L.E. 13,500,000, an
                        estimate which can hardly be considered too bold seeing that, even when the
                        above reduction is taken into account, it still falls short of the probable
                        receipts for 1905 by LE. 768,000.</p>
                    <p>The estimated Receipts and Expenditure for 1906 as compared with 1905 are as
                        follows : —</p>
                    <p>1906 1905 Increase Receipts......... 13,500,000 12,255,000 1,245,000
                        Expenditure Ordinary...12,317,000 11,308,000 13,000,000 11,755,000 1,240,000
                        Special ...680,000 447,000 Estimated surplus in both cases......... L.E.
                        500,000</p>
                    <p>Allowing then for a surplus next year of L.E. 500,000, there remains an
                        estimated expenditure in 1906 of L.E. 1,245,000 more than that for 1905.</p>
                    <p>This increase, though considerable, must not be taken to imply any new or
                        extravagant departure on the part of the Egyptian Govern- ment.</p>
                    <p>The enormous appreciation in the value of land, and sudden acquisition of
                        unexpected wealth by large sections of the community, has sent up the prices
                        of the necessaries of life* at such a rate as to render inevitable a largely
                        increased expenditure not only on such items as forage, maintenance of
                        prisoners, hospital patients, and the like, but also on the wages of
                        temporary employees and daily labourers in Go- vernment employ and
                        consequently on the cost of execut on of all Government works. To this must
                        be added a sum of L.E. 120,000, inscribed in the "Budget for improving the
                        position of the “cadreé officials, the lesser of whom can no longer live on
                        their pay, while the higher have seen, what were formerly considered
                        adequate incomes yearly diminishing in purchasing power to the point of
                        absolute hardship. The total increase in estimated expenditure directly
                        attributable to the rise in prices may be calculated at not less than L.E.
                        370,000.</p>

                        commodities during the past five years. The figures give the average price
                        for the year in each case: -</p>

                    <p>The rise since last year in the contract prices of provisions for certain
                        Government Depart- ments is shown by the following examples:</p>

                    <p>Since writing the above and while this Note was passing through the press the
                        fact that the scarcity and consequent cost of unskilled labour is becoming a
                        factor of the gravest import in connection with the ex- penditure on all
                        public works, has been brought to my notice with disagreeable directness. I
                        learn from the Irrigation authorities that the cost of construction of
                        earthworks has risen within the last three years by at least 60 % and that
                        consequently the estimates for the conversion next year of the basin lands
                        in Upper Egypt will probably have to be in- creased by some L.E
                        100,000.]</p>
                    <p>Although the revenue returns of the last few years appear amply to justify
                        this increase in the national expenditure, nevertheless the economical
                        situation is not such as would</p>
                    <p>*The price of some descriptions of urban land has remained proportions which
                        can only be described as fabulous east of purelt agricultural land has
                        increased in 5 years to at least 40% and is now selling in many places at
                        L.E. 160 per acre and even more.</p>

                    <p>warrant us in blindly counting on permanent surpluses each as those of the
                        past. It may well be that the wave of prosperity is not yet spent, but it
                        would be foolhardy to calculate on its volume being increased or indeed
                        maintained indefinitely.</p>
                    <p>In this connection the figures of imports and exports for the last six years
                        as given by the Customs Returns deserve something more than a passing
                        notice. They are, as follows:-</p>

                        20,500,000 3,800,000 (Approximate)</p>
                    <p>The effect of the high prices ruling for cotton from the 1902-1903 season
                        onwards is very well marked by the increased value of the exports since
                        1901, and by a corres- ponding upward movement in the volume of the imports,
                        commencing in 1903 and con- tinuing progressively to the present time. The
                        value of the imports of merchandise for the current year bids fair largely
                        to exceed that for 1904, as against a setback in the value of the exports
                        due to the sensibly lower price of cotton last season.</p>
                    <p>The fact that during the past two years the imports of merchandise and specie
                        taken together have greatly outbalanced the exports, notwithstanding the
                        constant heavy charge for the service of the foreign debt, constitutes a
                        phenomenon which calls for reflection. A readjustment in the direction of
                        normal equilibrium must come about sooner or later, and if we are paying for
                        our imports with capital provided by the foreign investor, this operation,
                        though by no means necessarily unsound at present, cannot be indefinitely
                        continued.</p>

                    <head>SPECULATION IN EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>Here, with a full sense of the responsibility attaching to an expression of
                        opinion which cannot but have something of an ex cathedra character, I
                        desire to sound a note of warning to those who look on Egypt as an El Dorado
                        for investors- and speculators.</p>
                    <p>The sudden secession of wealth and com- mercial activity in this country has
                        been attended by features that are only too often its concomitants. The
                        tendency to discount the future is nowhere more evident, and during the past
                        two years the value of property both in land and in local stocks and shares,
                        has, in many cases, been forced up to levels which even prospective results
                        can hardly prove to be remunerative. It is to be feared that these inflated
                        values are not infrequently based on speculative purchases which have been
                        facilitated by the profuse introduction of loanable capital into the
                        country, either in the form of new banking, finance, and land companies, or
                        in that of large increases in the capital of the old institutions. The
                        gambling fever is rife in the community and oppor- tunities to speculate are
                        at hard for all.</p>
                    <p>This situation contains within it the elements of reaction. It depends, first
                        and foremost, on the maintenance of the price of cotton at the high level of
                        the past three years, a level due to causes which are almost entirely
                        adventitious as far as this country is concerned. And, even assuming that
                        the conditions of the world’s supply of and demand for cotton will not vary
                        within very wide limits for the next few years, or that the demand for the
                        Egyptian product will continually outstrip the supply, there remains the
                        danger of the results which invariably attend over speculation. Lately signs
                        of uneasiness have not been wanting; there is a slackening of activity on
                        the local Bourses and quotations have declined perceptibly from their former

                    <p>A movement towards the elimination of the speculative factor in the
                        situation, which in the long run is inevitable, may, and I believe will,
                        work itself out without injury to the real interests of the country, but it
                        will hardly do so without causing a considerate perturbation of the share
                        market, with serious results to the unwary investor.</p>
                    <p>I may as well mention here that all Egyptian companies are incorporated by
                        Khedivial Decree, and that such decree merely implies that the company in
                        question has conformed with certain rules and is amenable to a certain
                        jurisdiction. It in no way implies that the Khedivial Government either
                        approves its object or guarantees its solvency.</p>

                    <p>The area devoted to cotton during the pre- sent season has exceeded that of

                    <p>year, especially in Upper Egypt. The climatic conditions during the early
                        part of the season were very favorable and the crop promised to be a record
                        one. Unfortunately in September and October much damage was done, more
                        particularly in Upper Egypt, by the prevalence of "Boll worm," whose ravages
                        this year were more pronounced than usual and far more in- jurious than
                        those of the more generally feared "Cotton worm." During the season much
                        valuable information regarding this pest has been obtained by the Khedivial
                        Agricultural Society which it is hoped may subsequently be turned to
                        practical account.</p>
                    <p>It is noteworthy that while the area devoted to cotton during recent years
                        has steadily in- creased, there has been no increase in total crop
                        production.</p>

                    <p>This is a matter for serious consideration, especially when taken in
                        connection with the fact that quality also has left much to be desired. The
                        tendency is now to grow cotton on the same land every two years, instead of
                        once in three years, as was formerly the case, and the results of this
                        system should not be ignor- red by the cultivator, not only because of
                        possi- ble injury to the cotton-growing industry, which is in itself a
                        sufficient reason, but also in view of its possible deleterious effects on
                        the general productivity of the soil. The question of the seed employed is
                        intimately connected with the qnuality of the resulting crop and is receiv-
                        ing careful consideration by the Khedivial Agricultural Society. Prices
                        continue to rule high.</p>

                    <p>The Government Salt Monopoly established in 1879 for revenue purposes, was
                        ceded in 1899 to the "Salt &amp; Soda Company," when the price was reduced
                        from L.E. 8 to L.E. 5 per ton. In a country like Egypt, in many parts of
                        which salt is a natural product which anyone can pick up for himself, the
                        existence of a monopoly with its accompanying restric- tions enforced by
                        fines and imprisonment could not be other than highly vexatious, and in now
                        sweeping it away the Khedivial Govern- ment has, it is believed, effected a
                        reform which will be a blessing to the country at large and especially to
                        the very poor.</p>
                    <p>The Salt and Soda Company was entitled to a six months’ notice of the
                        termination of the Monopoly. This right it has consented to waive, while the
                        Government on its side has engaged not to work any new salines, nor let them
                        to others for a period of six years. Further the Company has undertaken to
                        reduce the price of salt from L.E. 5 per ton to L.E. 2, (i. e. from 5
                        milliemes to 2 milliemes per kilo.) and to maintain distributing agencies
                        wherever they now exist.</p>
                    <p>Licences for sea-fishing boats were formerly delivered on payment of an
                        annual tax varying between L.E. 1 3/4 to L.E. 1O according to size and
                        equipment. They will now be delivered free of charge.</p>
                    <p>The Perry Tax is abolished, except in the case of ferries at or near large
                        centres. The tentative abolition of some of these latter was not a success,
                        on the contrary it led to quarrels and disturbances on the part of rival
                        claimants. Moreover it is necessary in places where there is heavy traffic
                        that the public should have some guarantee of a satisfactory service, which
                        can only be obtained by letting the ferrying right out to some responsible
                        person.</p>
                    <p>The Lighthouse does in the <placeName>Red Sea</placeName> have been reduced
                        from 14 milliemes to 10 mill. per ton for ships under 800 tons and from 7
                        milliemes to 5 milliemes for ships over that tonnage, reductions which it is
                        hoped will prove satisfactory to international shipping.</p>
                    <p>An all-around ad valorem, Customs Duty on imports of 8 % constitutes the
                        general tariff of the <placeName>Turkish Empire</placeName>, and
                        consequently of <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, and no higher duty can be
                        imposed except by International Agreement. In the case of Egypt a surtax
                        exists on tobacco and tobacco only. For the first time, I believe, in
                        history, a province of the Empire bound by this tariff, has, of its own
                        initiative, lowered the import duty on a whole series of articles of first
                        necessity. The experiment will be watched with interest not only in Egypt
                        but throughout the world and it is the confident hope of the Khedive’s
                        advisers that the reduc- tion, while it can hardly fail to benefit the
                        consumer, will not, in the long run, prove detrimental to the Treasury.</p>
                    <p>As has already been stated, the Budget for 1906 includes a sum of no less
                        than L.E. 120,000 for the improvement in the salaries of the Cadre
                        officials, which for reasons given above have diminished in purchasing power
                        to a distressing extent. In the case of the minor officials their pay no
                        longer constitutes a living wage, and when vacancies occur no candidates are
                        forthcoming to fill them. As the causes which produce this effect are
                        precisely those that pour an increasing stream of wealth into the coffers of
                        the State, it seemed but right that a portion of the same should be employed
                        in ameliorating the lot of the Government servants. A good many salaries,
                        especially of technical officials, have already been spasmodically rais- ed
                        from time to time in order to retain the services of men who would otherwise
                        have found it worth while to quit the Government service and even sacrifice
                        their pension for the more lucrative prospects held out by private
                        employers. It is now proposed to readjust the whole scale on a uniform
                        basis. A Cadre Committee of experienced officials sat during the early
                        months of the year and produced an interesting and careful report. The
                        pressure of work which always occurs in the autumn has made it impossible to
                        proceed further with the matter this year, but with the beginning of the new
                        year it will be taken up again, and it is hoped that a month or two will
                        suffice to rearrange the system on a sounder basis, such rearrangement to
                        have effect from January 1st, 1906.</p>
                    <p>It is perhaps well that I should here men- tion that the sum of L. E. 120,000
                        set aside for this purpose, considerable as it is, will not, I fear, suffice
                        to realise, the dreams of those who imagine that a golden age is
                        approaching. It will be no more possible to amass a fortune in the
                        Government service in the future than it was in the past. An equitable
                        readjustment is all that is and can be aimed at, and I may add that
                        efficient work and probably longer hours will be required in return for
                        increas- ed pay.</p>
                    <p>In close connection with the reorganisation of the cadre is the question of a
                        new Pension Law which is naow being taken seriously in hand under expert
                        actuarial advice from Eng- land. The present law is admittedly had, but a
                        scientific pension law in a country where the officials are partly
                        Christian, partly native and partly foreign, presents enormous difficulties,
                        and it is impossible to say when the project will be sufficiently advanced
                        to be submitted to the Council of Ministers. Here, again, interested parties
                        must not be too sanguine. It would be easy for the Khedive's present
                        advisers to promulgate a pension law which would meet with popular favour.
                        The results during the first ten years might be highly satisfactory; they
                        would hardly be so much longer. In framing a pension lew it is necessary to
                        calculate the cost not only for the present generation but for the next.</p>

                    <head>DAIRA SANIEH LIQUIDATION.</head>
                    <p>One of the most important financial events of the year was the liquidation of
                        the Daira Administration, which was practically brought to an end in the
                        course of 1905.</p>
                    <p>A summary of the question may not be uninteresting.</p>
                    <p>The settlement of the Financial situation of Egypt in November, 1876, took no
                        account of the debt of the "Daira Sanieh," a special administration charged
                        with the management of certain properties acquired by the late
                            <persName>Khedive Ismail</persName>. With a view to paying off that debt
                        an arrangement was made in 1877 by Messrs. <persName>Goschen</persName>
                        &amp; <persName>Joubert</persName> to float a loan having a first mortgage
                        on the Daira Sanieh properties. The Khedivial Treasury engaged to make good
                        any deficiency in the annual budget of the Daira Sanieh Administration after
                        payment of the interest charge. The surplus revenue as well as the proceeds
                        of sales, were assigned to the redemption of the debt.</p>
                    <p>Later on the Daira properties were ceded to the Government. The Law of
                        Liquidation, in confirming the cession, maintained the same arrangement.</p>
                    <p>In 1890, the loan was converted, the balance of the debt standing at
                        7,299,860.</p>
                    <p>In 1898 the Government entered into an agreement with a group of financiers
                        who undertook to realise the assets of the Daira, to pay off the balance of
                        the debt, and to share the possible eventual profits equally with the
                        Government. The venture turned out unex- pectedly successful for both
                        parties.</p>
                    <p>Since 1898 all the properties of the Daira Sanieh have been sold, mostly to
                        native land- owners, at a total price of about 12,100,000.</p>
                    <p>The excess of revenue of the Daira Adminis- tration, including that of 1905,
                        amounted to nearly 1,200,000, making a grand total of 13,300,000. Deducting
                        the loan outstanding in Hune 1898 viz; 6,431,000, the profit to be divided
                        between the Government and the company, with some equitable deductions in
                        favor of the latter, may be estimated at 6,800.</p>
                    <p>The balance of the loan still in circulation on the 15th October, 1905, viz.,
                        4,444,340, has been paid off.</p>

                        nanfrage;</p>
                    <p>Attendu que la Societe <persName>Florio Rubattino</persName> declare que par

                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompany- ing description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care had been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In Choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To there are several things to be considered. To
                        begin with there is the difference in climate between Egypt and the various
                        points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>
                    <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for
                            <placeName>Cairo</placeName> in January may be a little warmer than the
                            <placeName>Riviera</placeName>, and possibly not so warm as
                            <placeName>Sicily</placeName>, but in March it will be warmer than
                            <placeName>Rome</placeName>, and more uni- formly warm than many other
                        places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in the year; for as
                        a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest place to go to
                        on leaving Egypt is <placeName>Sicily</placeName>.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                        sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time oc- cupied on each of
                        the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>
                    <p>They are as follows :-</p>
                    <p>The long sea routes-from <placeName>Port Said</placeName> or
                            <placeName>Alexandria</placeName> to <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>,
                            <placeName>Southampton</placeName>, <placeName>London</placeName> or
                            <placeName>Liverpool</placeName>-occupy about 14 days. The short ones
                        are as follows:-</p>
                    <p>Port Said or ALexandria to <placeName>Brindisi</placeName> 3 days Alexandria
                        to <placeName>Messina</placeName>... ... ... 3 " Port Said or Alexandria to
                            <placeName>Marseilles</placeName> 5 " Alexandria to
                            <placeName>Venice</placeName> and <placeName>Trieste</placeName> 4 "
                        Alexandria to <placeName>Naples</placeName>... ... 3 " Port Said to
                            <placeName>Genoa</placeName> ... ... ... 5 " Port Said to
                            <placeName>Naples</placeName>... ... ... 4 " Alexandria to
                            <placeName>Constantinople</placeName> ... 4 " Alexandria to
                            <placeName>Piraeus</placeName> ... ... ... 2 " Port Said to
                            <placeName>Gibraltar</placeName>... ... ... 7 "</p>
                    <p>The steamers, of the P. &amp; 0. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageries
                        Mari times are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines are
                        also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by travellers to
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from <placeName>Cairo</placeName>, the shortest
                        is that to <placeName>Alexandria</placeName>, without change (3 hours). That
                        to <placeName>Port Said</placeName>, can now be made without change in 4 1/2
                        hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from <placeName>Alexandria</placeName> to
                            <placeName>Liverpool</placeName>. The German Levant line has also good
                        steamers from <placeName>Alexandria</placeName> to
                            <placeName>Hamburg</placeName>.</p>
                    <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by P. &amp; O.
                        Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste-Vienna
                        express from Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis" to <placeName>Brindisi</placeName>.
                        One of these leaves Port Said every week, as soon as possible after
                        receiving the Indian mails from the great liner arrived from
                            <placeName>Bombay</placeName>.</p>
                    <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                        attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "ferry boats," having
                        been specially built to carry the British mail from <placeName>Port
                            Said</placeName> to <placeName>Brindisi</placeName>. If you are going
                        straight through to <placeName>England</placeName> you will find the train
                        waiting at <placeName>Brindisi</placeName> which will take you to
                            <placeName>Calais</placeName> without changing. It has complete
                        arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in
                        London on the fifth day from leaving <placeName>Port Said</placeName>.</p>

                        Demostheues in B.C. 413, and taken by the Romans in b.c. 212, when

                    <p><placeName>NAPLES</placeName> is also reached in 10 hours from
                            <placeName>Palermo</placeName> by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steam- ers,
                        which leave daily. One cannot approach <placeName>Naples</placeName> or
                        leave it without wishing to explore some of its island, besides the lovely
                        places on its Bay— <placeName>Castellamare</placeName> and
                            <placeName>Sorrento</placeName>. The small steamer that takes you to
                            <placeName>Sorrento</placeName> [you can drive too] will take you on to
                            <placeName>Capri</placeName>.</p>
                    <p>From <placeName>Naples</placeName> to <placeName>ROME</placeName> is a train
                        journey of but five hours. All who can will devote at least one week to
                        visiting the many historical and interesting portions of the
                            <placeName>Eternal City</placeName>, whose charms and beauties are too
                        well-known to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to <placeName>FLORENCE</placeName>, where another week can well
                        be spent admiring the City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In
                            <placeName>Florence</placeName> itself the churches and galleries are of
                        absorbing inte- rest, whilst the local promenades and excur- sions should
                        not be omitted. <placeName>The Cascine</placeName> is the most attractive
                        and fashionable promenade in <placeName>Florence</placeName>, whilst the
                            <placeName>Viale dei Colli</placeName>, one of the finest walks in
                        Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the hills a distance of
                        four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                            <placeName>Florence</placeName> is that to Vallom- brosa; with its
                        Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea level. This is made first by ordinary
                        train from <placeName>Florence</placeName> to <placeName>St.
                            Ellero</placeName>, thence by cog- wheel railway to
                            <placeName>Saltino</placeName>. The ascent through groves of oaks takes
                        an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p><placeName>PISA</placeName> is easily reached from
                            <placeName>Florence</placeName> in about 2 hours ; here there is a fine
                            <placeName>Cathedral</placeName> and the <placeName>Leaning
                            Tower</placeName>. A stay of at least one night should if possible be
                        made, in order to enjoy the view from the <placeName>Campanile</placeName>
                        at sunset.</p>
                    <p><placeName>VIAREGGIO</placeName>. One of the most delightful places on the
                            <placeName>Italian Riviera</placeName> near <placeName>Pisa</placeName>
                        and on the main line from <placeName>Rome</placeName> to
                            <placeName>Genoa</placeName>. It is a very convenient half-way house
                        between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air and
                        surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                        winter and deliciously cool breezes from the surrounding mountains and the
                            <placeName>Mediterranean</placeName> in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy’s most an- eient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in
                            <placeName>Genoa</placeName>. Then there are the superbly decorated
                        medie- val churches containing exquisite marble columns and historical
                        paintings, and the in- comparable <placeName>Campo Santo</placeName> filled
                        with its won- derful tombs.</p>
                    <p>From <placeName>Genoa</placeName> to <placeName>Milan</placeName> is a matter
                        of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p><placeName>MILAN</placeName> is a good centre for Northern Italy before
                        making the tour of the Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction,
                        with its beautiful windows illustrating the History of the Bible. The public
                        gardens and the monu- mental cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>

                        imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of vehicular traffic
                        strikes one as very strange; no horse, cart, carriage or bicycle is to be
                        seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The approach to
                            <placeName>Venice</placeName> from <placeName>the Adriatic</placeName>
                        is unlike that of any other sea- port. The town seems to be gradually, like
                        Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills behind, no stretches of rock, but the
                        first the tops of <placeName>Cam- paniles</placeName> appear above the
                        horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage out
                        of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from <placeName>Milan</placeName> you make the tour of the
                        beautiful Italian lakes.</p>
