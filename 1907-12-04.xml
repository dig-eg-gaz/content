                    <p>Trains run alongside the steamers on the quay, and passengers can be conveyed
                        to Famagusta, Nicosia, Morphou and intermediate stations. Good hotel
                        accommodation for tourists is provided at Famagusta, at the Savoy Hotel (Mr.
                        Najem Houry proprietor). Olympus Hotel, Mount Troodos, 6000 ft. above the
                        sea. Magnificent Scenery. Perfect climate. Season May to end of October. For

                        Cathedral (now a mosque) begun in 1300 and finished in 1312, together with
                        other ancient ruins and the Venetian fortifications, the finest in the
                        world. Also the tower or palace, the scene of "Othello'' and of Ford's
                        "Lover's Melancholy.'' The climate of Cyprus in the winter months is

                    <head>Isolation of American Banks</head>
                    <p>The peculiarities of the banking system in the United states are producing
                        some curious results in the present financial crisis. The country, as is
                        well known, has no institutions corresponding to our great joint-stock
                        banks— no companies with a head office in the metropolis and branches in
                        important centres. Every National bank is confined to a single building, and
                        every State bank to a single city, so that American banking is carried on in
                        water-tight compartments ; and in a period of strained credit each town is
                        dependent on its own resources, fending for itself, and protecting its own
                        store of money from the demands of outside bankers. Out of this peculiarity
                        has developed during the present crisis what is described as "a blockade of
                        domestic exchange," a picturesque phrase signifying that it is difficult, or
                        impossible, to transmit money from one city to another. The country banks
                        have been withdrawing their deposits from New York, so that a cheque from a
                        distance cannot be collected in New York without great delay, and is
                        consequently of very little value im the payment of debts. Some remarkable
                        examples of this difficalty have been quoted recently by the "Financial
                        News" correspondent, who tells us that cheques on Chicago cannot be
                        collected for New York merchants in leas than a month, and that cheques on
                        Philadelphia, which is only 90 miles distant, cannot be collected at all.
                        The financial connection between city and city has been suddenly snapped,
                        and the result is a dislocation of trade the importance of which can
                        scarcely he exaggerated. We are told that provincial manufacturers, whose
                        cheques have become valueless, cannot pay their workmen ; that New Yorkers
                        cannot get payment for debts of long standing, and that thousands of men are
                        being thrown out of employment. A telegram in Tharsday's "Times" states that
                        —</p>
                    <p>In Chicago 90 per cent. of the factories and shops have curtailed their
                        staffs and the hours of working. Forty per cent. of the building workers and
                        25 per cent. of the wood workers are idle. From Pittsburg it is reported
                        that manufactories within a radius of 50 miles have dismissed 48,000 men,
                        and that 2,000 railwaymen have been discharged. Large manufactories in
                        Indianopolis have dispensed with half their hands During the past two days
                        21 sawmills in Northern Wisconsin have closed, throwing out 6000 men. At
                        Wilmington 4,000 men have been discharged trom mills, and one firm has
                        reduced its pay-roll from $28,000 (£4.60) to $7,000 (£1,400).</p>
                    <p>Comment on these figures is unnecessary, but they confirm us in our belief
                        that a central bank is urgently needed in the United States. After their
                        bitter experieace of trusts, Americans are, not unnaturally, reluctant to
                        allow any more industries to be centralised, and there is no doubt a danger
                        that an institution on the lines of the Bank of England might be captured by
                        private interests. But the present system of "'each city for itself and
                        devil take the hindmost" does not work smoothly in time of panic. If
                        distances are too great to allow one bank to act for the whole of the
                        'States, it might be possible to divide the country. into sections with a
                        central institation in each. ("The Economist").</p>

                            party they may belong to, to know how recent events in this country are
                            viewed by the Radical sections of the Liberal Party, who have of late
                            shown such a lively interest in Egyptian politics The following
                            communication from a London Radical, who is following the march of
                            events here with keen interest, deserves reproduction and may cause the
                            followers of Mustapha Pasha Kamel to reflect on the wisdom of pursuing a
                            line of policy which will inevitably estrange all English sympathy, even
                            of the most advanced kind, from their aims. From our point of view we
                            cannot regard this estrangement between Kamel and that mischievoas
                            section of the Liberal Party with any bat a feeling of sincere
                            satistaction and Mustapha Pasha Kamel has most effectually served the
                            interests of Imperialistic policy in regard to Egypt by alienating Mr.

                            :—</p>
                        <p>This is the time of year when the lucky ones leave our inclement climate
                            and make tracks for Egypt, where meteorological conditions are kinder,
                            and where, if we are to believe reports and the pictorial advertisements
                            of the steamship companies, the sun shines all day long in the most
                            gratifying way. The means of reaching Cairo are nowadays simple. Egypt
                            looks very attractive in the pictures, a land seemingly of beauty and
                            poetry, fair ladies, and blue seas, yellow sands, romantic architecture,
                            end alot of other truly delightful accessories. A land without trouble,
                            of course. So the onlooker might think, but he would not be quite
                            absolutely correct. I have been favoured with a copy of "L'Etendard
                            Egyptien', coutaining a complete report of a lengthy speech by Mustapha
                            Pasha Kamel, a verbose gentleman whose "facgon d'agir" seems to stand
                            before the international fire and throw on fat. It does not seem to me
                            to be a particularly wise proceeding. Somebody seems to bave bid him
                            discourse, and he has done so with a vengeance.</p>
                        <p>"It is much more in your way than mine" was the remark ofthe man in
                            Pickwick who had got over the wall to his friend, who was still in the
                            lane, down which a mad bull was gaily stampeding Rhetoric is very much
                            in Musta pba Pasha Kamel's way, but surely he might have a little credit
                            here and there to the English. It seems a thousand pities to find that
                            England is so much in the wrong. People were realising that a better
                            understanding had come about and that thanks to the visit to this
                            country of the Sheikh Ali Bey Youssef and Hafiz Effendi Awad, there has
                            been a real and genuine increase of the even previously existing entente
                            cordiale between England and Egypt. I come now to another point. It is
                            to my mind a matter of grave disrespect to his Highness the Khedive, who
                            has friends in the Courts of Europe, and who is persona grata'at Windsor
                            and Buckingham Palace, to voice sentiments such as one finds in the
                            feverish harangue which I have before me. No; this speaker is no friend
                            of Egypt, no. loyal son of a great country, no sincere worker, to utter
                            what are really ineptitudes, and to indulge in "angry criticism, and
                            subversive speculation which if taken seriously might do irreparable
                            harm. The unthinking applause of an excited multitude, the fever of a
                            night, the dangerous emotions superinduced by a flow of words,are,maybe
                            momentarily fascinating things, but afterwards Aprés, messieurs, c'est
                            l'abime. Is it possible that a man should be so avid of the fleeting
                            distinction of a mob orator as to risk all, or does he forget the real
                            meaning of his words, their true significance? If he forgets, others do
                            not, others who are for prudent action and wise counsels. What does the
                            man want? War? Is it so? If for the sake of argument, that is the idea
                            at the back of his rhetorical brain, let him realise that the tub
                            thampers have a very short public career when trouble does come. Nobody
                            listens to them then. Oris he a farceur, a mere manipulater of words,
                            scornfully careless of what may be their effect ? In any case, may be
                            some wise friend will advise him as to the grievous mistakes of his
                            poliey —a policy so unfortunate as to make wen stare aghast. Fortunately
                            we live in' sounder, more philosophic times. But there have been hours,
                            periods of "Starm and Drang" in the history of nations when speeches
                            such as this: would have occasioned dire peril and rendered the "posear"
                            a real enemy to his race. No, this man who affects stern virtues does
                            not, canvot calmly realise the sharpness of the tools with which he
                            plays. Can he not be serionsly warnéd that he is really doing Egypt a
                            grave disservice ' He talks much of his cause and of the Egyptians. He
                            has borrowed a little of the cheaper French style of eloquence. But what
                            precisely is his cause? If he is really serious he is a most dangerous
                            man whose exuberance should be checked. Men who know the truth disregard
                            his utterances. That is well. Yet there are others who are always
                            susceptible to strident talking. One knows those others. They can be
                            imposed upon ; they can be led away. In every nationality their
                            representatives are to be found. Still there is this to be said. Maybe
                            the speaker deceives himself. To disregard all that has been and that
                            is, and to elaborate elementary theofies of patriotism. That is his plan
                            'Renaissance d'une nation," "ames généreuses"—one knows them all, all
                            these pet phrases of one who speaks before he thinks, but does not
                            trouble to think before he speaks. Then we have words, words. words ;
                            and the day for such bas gone by. Englishmen are not fools ; they are
                            not hypocrites, They deplore such appeals to elemental instincts.
                            Mustapha Pasfia Kamel declaims about national aspirations, with a <cb
                                n="2"/>reckless disregard of consequenses He recalls to one the days
                            when General Boulanger mistaking his role of a fair soldier,took to
                            sporting, as he thought, for his country's good. And yet there is good
                            in Mustapha Pasha Kamel, if he would forget self, be reasonable and
                            listen to others on occasion. He jas force, enterprise, energyall

                            well. But he could not be gentler in his treatment of England, releasing
                            it from the frightfully dark cloud under which the British Empire has

                        particle of truth in them, and on the contrary the Sanitary Department is
                        displaying great activity in the collection of any details which would be
                        likely to assist the commission in their work. The first work undertaken by
                        the commission was the examination of previous reports on the subject of
                        their investigation and holding as we do some confidence in the abilities of
                        the members of this commission we hardly con- sider it probable that their
                        decision will be based upon anything but actual experiments, valuable as the
                        complete knowledge of former reports undoubtedly is.</p>
                    <p>If the water of the Rhodah Farag wells is unfit for drinking purposes, we
                        imagine that the public need have no canse to fear that they will not be
                        informed ot the fact, and that immediate steps will be taken to remedy the
                        matter. If on the other hand the commission find that the water is pure and
                        fit for consamption, we may be equally sure of the validity of their
                        decision. The commission is formed of learned men who know their business
                        and not of those likely to be blinded by the suppression of a report, as
                        some of the inhabitants of Cairo would apparently have us believe. We can
                        assure the public that any accusations of this kind which are made against
                        the Sanitary Department are entirely without foundation. Any one having
                        information which would be likely to be of use has only to apply to the
                        Department in order to see hag baseless these rumours are. But though
                        baseless they are undoubtedly injurious to the commanity at large inasmuch
                        as they tend to destroy confidence in the commission itself.</p>

                    <p>Ms. D.K. Reid</p>
                    <p>We regret to announce the death of Mr, D. K. Reid, senior partner in the firm
                        of Messrs. Reid and Barnard, the stock and sharebrokers of Alexandria, Cairo
                        and London. Mr. Reid had been in a delicate state of health for many years
                        past and has lately been staying at San Remo on the Riviera, where he
                        expired. The news of his death will be received in Egypt with great regret
                        for during his tesidence in this country he had gained the esteem of a large
                        circle of friends and acquaintances.</p>
                    <p>The deceased was thirty seven years of age and was unmarried. He was the son
                        of the late Mr. David Reid, a well-known member of the London Stock
                        Exchange, of Caythorp Hall, near Grantham, Lincolnshire. He was educated at
                        Winchester and Magdelen College, Oxford. Mr. D. K. Reid was a member of the
                        board of directors of the Hamburg-Anglo- American Nile Company</p>
                    <p>We beg to tender our sympathies in their bereavement to his brother, Mr. J.

                    <p>We extract the following from the "African World"</p>
                    <p>An esteemed legal correspondent writes:— Among those called tothe Bar at
                        Gray's Inn this week was Maitre Léon Constant Ghislain Carton de Wiart, the
                        famous Cairo advocate, who paid us a flying visit this week, remaining in
                        London only 48 hours. Me Carton de Wiart was descri as LL.D. of the Univer-
                        sity of Brussels, advocate of the Belgian Bar, member of the Order of
                        Advocates, Egypt, only son of Adrian Carton de Wiart, of Brassels, deceased.
                        The ancient Inn is rapidly becoming one of the mogt popular of the foar Inns
                        of Court, and numbers many very distinguished gentlemen among the members,
                        his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales being one of the benchers. The
                        benchers,as is well known, form the governing body of the va- rious Ions,
                        and their number is added to as occasion arises by their appointing some
                        distinguished ordinary member of the Jnn to be a bencher. We hope the time
                        will not be very far distant when their number may be augmented by Maitre
                        Carton de Wiart, whose general record in Egypt and loyal services to British
                        interests on the Nile bank have been of exceptional importance.</p>

                    <head>Conscription in Egypt</head>
                    <p>Time Expired Soldiers</p>
                    <p>A rumoar is current in official circles to the effect tbat the Government
                        have under consideration a scheme, which, if carried through, will be of
                        very great advantage to time-expired soldiers in the Egyptian Army. No
                        official information is yet to hand but it would appear to be certain that a
                        proposal by which time expired soldiers would benefit materially by the
                        revenue which is annually accumulated through the imposition of a fine of
                        L.E. 20 on all those who would avoid military service in the country, is
                        receiving the serious attention of the authorities. It is proposed to
                        devotea portion of this revenue to a fund from which a soldier would, on the
                        completion of his service, draw a settled sum in order to enable him to
                        start as a civilian with a moderate capital and so counterbalance the lack
                        of commercial or trade knowledge which is so frequently fatal to the success
                        of a man who has spent the best years of his life in the service of his
                        country, for the number of men who, during their term of service, are
                        enabled to follow a trade, is necessarily limited, and the greater numbers
                        are, when discharged at the expiration of their service, totally unfitted
                        for the business life of the civilian, with the nataral consequence that the
                        Army is looked upon by the majority of those who, by reason of lack of
                        means, are forced to serve in it, as an almost insurmountable deterrent to a
                        successful civilian life. But though this is undoubtedly the case, the
                        Egyptian who would have been ready to sacrifice anything he possessed in
                        order to be free from the application of a much dreaded conscription,
                        is,when once he has been forced to accept the inevitable, a much keener
                        soldier than his former conduct would have led any one to suppose that he
                        was capable of becoming. It is in the first place simply due to the inhereit
                        distaste of the Orieatal for any departure from the well-worn grooves to
                        which he has for generations been accustomed, and in the second, he is
                        troubled with a not unnatural fear. Bat at the completion of his military
                        service, his position in his village will be to all intents and purposes,
                        simply but a beginner while his contemporaries Of earlier days who have been
                        fortunate enough to escape conscription would probably be too far advanced
                        in worldly prosperity to admit of the barest chance of his ever raising
                        himself to the same scale. But if the projected scheme should prove
                        feasible, and the time-expired soldier instead lof being thrust back into
                        the world with no particular branch of training which could be lof any
                        material use to him, receive a sum which would enable him to bridge over the
                        lost years of civilian experience by establishing himself in any manner he
                        may choose as being most suited to his abilities, it is more than probable
                        that conscription would quickly loses many of the unfavourable attributes
                        which, to the eyes of the possible soldier, surround it at 'present.
                        Conscription in every country where it obtains is prone to carry hardships
                        in its train, but much would be done to alleviate these hardships in this
                        country if it were felt that the sums of money, which the more fortunate of
                        those who are eligible candidates, yearly pour into the treasury in order to
                        escape the ranks, could be broaght to bear to the ultimate good of those
                        whom circumstances compel to accept service.</p>

                    <p>Since the time when we wrote in terms commendatory of the prospects of
                        Egyptian Markets, Limited, the price of the shares has kept up very
                        steadily, notwithstanding the ad- Verge influences which were calculated to
                        depress it, in common with other companies connected with the country. The
                        time of year has now artived when we may confidently look for an important
                        improvement in the outlook for the shareholders. The money which annually
                        flows in such a copious stream into Egypt after the harvest operations are
                        concludéd must find its way into circulation somewhere; and no better or
                        more certain channel can be found for attracting it than the mrrkets to
                        which so many of the native dealers resort. The new functions which the
                        company has now assumed in connection with the sale cannot fail to
                        enormously increase the profits of its operations; so that those who intend
                        to secure an interest in the undertaking should not delay in taking
                        advantage of the opportunity. "Daily Report."</p>

                    <p>The October retarns of the National Bank of Egypt, which we published last
                        week, appear to reflect the present reputed plethora of gold in the vaults
                        of our local banks. Comparing the returns of October with the corresponding
                        month of the previot&amp; year, we find that the mnonntof notes and cash
                        held in the department in ' October last stands at LE. 2,424,000, as against
                        LB 1,029,000 in October, 1906. The amount to the credit of the Ministry of
                        Finance Stands at L.E. 1,222,000, against L.E. 394,000 for the previous
                        October. This increase seems, wholly or in part, due to the agreement made
                        between the Egyptian Government and the National Bank of Egypt for a prompt
                        return to ciculation of the amount paid by the fellaheen for the land tax.
                        This wise provision has evidently hélped the situation materially. We wish
                        that every local bank in Egypt would follow the excellent' example of the
                        National Bank and publish their monthly retorns, which would throw much
                        light on the financial situation.</p>

                        during luncheon and afternoon-tea. On such occasions, many Caird residents
                        are to be seen on the terrace. To night the first ball will be given in the
                        beavtiful mosque hall. No invitations will be issued to the usual patrons of
                        the hotel, but all will be cordially welcomed to the first dance of the
                        season. The King's Royal Rifles are camping in the neighbourhood of Mena

                        are expected to attend the ball and give that tonch of brightness to the gay

                    <p>It is understood that the new "Party of the People," will take into its own
                        province the propaganda of the scheme for an Egyptian University. Its
                        fortunes, though brilliant at the start, have languished of late, and as the
                        fund subscribed has been standing stationary at its total of 30,000 for
                        several months past, it seemed only too probable that the svheme would
                        collapse, as many Oriental ambitions have before it. Naturally it would
                        confer great prestige on the new party if it succeeded in reviving and
                        bringing to a successful conclusion the plan of founding a purely Egyptian
                        seat of learning on the banks of the Nile-a university that should attract
                        the whole of the Moslem world into its protals.</p>

                            <p>The meeting of Congress has taken place. The proceedings were formal.

                    <p>Dr. Hunt and Dr. Grenfell, who found the "Sayings of Jesus" at Oxyrhynchus,
                        in the Fayoum, have discovered other fragments on the same spot. These
                        included, says Dr. Gren- fell, "a vellum fragment of an uncanonical gospel
                        which would soon be published, relating to a conversation on the nature of
                        purity between our Lord and a Pharisee, which is supposed to take place in
                        the temple at Jeru- salem. It did not possess the antiquity or the
                        importance of the 'Sayings of Jesus,' and was probably to be regarded as an
                        elaboration of Matthew xv. 1-20, composed between a.d. 150 and a.d. 200: But
                        the author was more successful than many writers of apocryphal gospels in
                        catching something of the genuine ring, and the fragment wax a valuable
                        addition to the scanty remnant of the numerous uncanonical traditions
                        concerning Christ's teaching, which were current in many Christian
                        comununities, especially in Egypt, during the third and fousth
                        centuries.</p>
                    <p>At the last meeting of the Hellenic Society of London, held on the 14th
                        inst., Dr. Grenfell gave a most interesting account, with quota tions, of
                        Greek papyri recently found at Oxy rhynchas, including fragments of a new
                        Greek historian, probably Theopompus, whom the explorers are inclined to
                        rank in historical merit between Thucydides and Xenophon ; and considerable
                        fragments of a lost play—the 'Hypsipele' of Euripides</p>
                    <p>Part V. of the 'Oxyrbynchus Papyri,' con taining several of the most
                        important discover ies yet made by Drs. Grenfell and Hunt, will be issued
                        shortly. The bulk of the volume is occupied by the new Preans of Pindar in
                        honour of Abdera, Ceos, lpbi, and other cities, and the new historical work
                        by a writer of the fourth century, supposed to be Theo pompus. Besides these
                        there is an interesting fragment of an uncanonical Gospel, of which a
                        separate edition will be issued simultaneously by Mr. Henry Frowde This
                        relates to conver sation on the subject of purity between Christ and a chief

                    <head>Port Sudan</head>
                    <p>Officials and Civilians</p>
                    <p>There appears to be a considerable amount of grumbling among the commercial
                        portion of the population of Port Sedan' because things do not work as
                        smoothly as it is claimed that they onght to. On the other hand it may be
                        arged trom the officials' point of view that it is ridienlons to expect that
                        in each a ready made town everything should proceed with the regularity that
                        prevails in other centres of population, which have been settled for
                        generations. Donbtless the trying climate is responsible for a great gleal
                        of this discontent. In the following article we will endeavour to give an
                        impartial view of the different standpoints.</p>
                    <p>The Civil Inspector of Port Sudan, Kaimakam Feilden Bey, is most corteous in
                        giving all all information and he keeps his offices-open thrthroughout the
                        day for callers and-all questions arepromptly answered.</p>
                    <p>The Complaints of the COmmercial class may be summarised as follows:-</p>
                    <p>In Port Sudan each department of the Government is independent of one
                        another. All the shipping agencies are put at the back of the town instead
                        of on the front, with the exception of the Khedivial Mail Company, who have
                        the Government contract for the mails.</p>
                    <p>The most valuable commerecial sites have been monopolised By Government
                        offieials and some of the officials have seleeted excellent sites on the
                        front for their private residences, which would afford sites for commercial
                        offices. We have been informed from official sourees that the only firm,
                        which asked for a site on the front was the Khedivial Mail Company and it
                        was given to them. The two most valuable sites on the front are open to be
                        taken on lease.</p>
                    <p>To these official replies the rejoinder is made that the statement that only
                        one firm asked for a site on the quay is not correct, and that in regard to
                        the valuable sites: for lease on the front no business firm would look at
                        them for the reasons given at length in our| article on the leases.</p>
                    <p>Representatives of British shipping interests say that it is absolutely
                        necessary to have an Admiralty counseil on the spot to assist Sudan
                        Government, if Port Sadan is to de velop in regard to shipping. At present
                        there is pot a single English judge in the Sudan selected from the Admiralty
                        Bar.</p>
                    <p>To this it is answered that in a country with such a small staff of
                        officials, it is asking too mach to demand the appointment of specialist in
                        legal matters. The present judge at Port Sadan and Suakim is a practical
                        legal man and is considered to be one of the most competent members of the
                        Bench in the Sudan.</p>
                    <p>Complaints are rife because ships have now to discharge at the temporary
                        quays which are one and a half kilometre from the Customs warehouses,
                        whither they have to be taken by lighter. Heavy goods cannot be taken down
                        and have to be dumped on the quays by the crane. The result is that the
                        ships that arrive from England every month with big cargoes are never less
                        than a week in discharging. As an example of the delay we may cite the case
                        of ten eases from the S.S. "Clydesdale," which arrived at the Customs on ~
                        November 18th, although that steamer left Port Sudan on the 31st October
                        last</p>
                    <p>The reply of the Castomsauthorities to criticisms is that the commercial
                        community has only to wait unti the new quays are built and then everything
                        will go well. Business men ought to consider that Port Sudan is in the
                        earliest stages of its development and allowances ought to be made for the
                        great difficult ties, which are inherent in the satisfactory running of the
                        Customs Administration in such an incohate port. As soon as the Customs
                        staft is fully trained all their dithcalties will vanish. The official
                        attitude is to throw the blame on the agents of the shipping companies. The
                        tollowing paragraph, which has evidently been officially inspired, appeared
                        recently in the "Sudan Times" :-</p>
                    <p>The complaints made about delays and short ages of goods at the Custom House
                        Port Sudan, are attributable mostly to the incompetency of agents of Port
                        Sudan. If the merchants took pains to choose as their representatives there
                        persons who have experience in custom honse transactions, many of their
                        complaints would be removed. It is not denied, however, that difficulty ot
                        landing goods from steamers into lighters has much to do with the present
                        disorder, but this will be removed as soon as the new quays are completed,
                        when freight will be unloaded directly from steamers to cars.</p>
                    <p>The commercial class complain of the dilatorinees of the officials. One
                        shipping agency asked tor a temporary site on the Customs side as its
                        present offices are a kilometre on the other side of the harbour. No reply
                        in writing was receivéd and now the agency has to have its weighing machines
                        and other appliances lying unprotected on the spot near where the ships come
                        in. 'The agent only wanted the site in order to warehouse the equipment
                        necessary for an agency on the quay. The entire frontage on the Customs side
                        is taken apand behind thisplots of land can be obtained on lease for
                        warehouses but without access to the quay. The work of discharging lighters,
                        ete access to the quay. This question has been veterred to Khartoum. It is
                        considered that six hondred of metres of quays are enough, for the most
                        exceptional ocurrence up to now has been the presence of four ships in the
                        harbour at the same time. It is suggested that the Government should
                        construct quays and let them to private firms, If this were done and the
                        warehouses placed in front of the railway siding, the necessary access would
                        be obtained.</p>
                    <cb n="4"/>
                    <p>Another source of discontent is the severe line of demonstation shown between
                        the official and civilian elements of which the following is a sample. No
                        English member of the non official community is allowed to import his new
                        wine, while Government officials can freely do so. The reason is that no
                        private person, whether he is a "bona fide" resident or not, is allowed to
                        import wine fro private purpose and they are compelled to buy inferior stuff
                        from the licensed dealer, who pay a heavy license, for that privilege.
                        Recently, the English manager of a company imported some wine for his
                        private consumption and was not permitted to use it when it arrived, He will
                        consequently have to send it back to Europe or sell it to a licensed dealer
                        and buy it back at a loss while he sees officials freely imperting their own
                        wine. Such is one instance of the sources of discontent. It is trifling in
                        itself, but little incidents like this case cause considerable annoyance and
                        lead to a good deal of discontent.</p>
                    <p>The reason for a good deal of the grambling among the commercial community is
                        owing to the unfinished state of the port and the great difficulties which
                        the officials have had to contend with in the organisation of a town on a
                        site which but a short time ago was utterly unihabited. The energy that has
                        been displayed in the creation of Port Sudan reflects the greatest credit on
                        the ANglo-Sudanese officials, to whom this arduous and important task was
                        entrusted. Of course it is not to be expected that the official and
                        commercial sections of the little community can look at matters from the
                        same point of view and the critacism and grumbling that ensue act as healthy
                        corectives to bureaucractic optimism, but the difficulties which engender
                        this discontent are in a great measure inevitable in such an enterprise, and
                        will no doubt in course of time disappear as experiance is gained.</p>

                    <head>The Sudan's Future</head>
                    <p>Native Opinion</p>
                    <p>The Coptic organ, "Al Watan" says :—</p>
                    <p>In an interwiew recently published by several Europess papers. M stini, ex
                        member of the Italian Chaebor of Deputies, gave expression to views and
                        opinions on the future of the Sudan which haye not received sufficient
                        attention from the local Prees. According to the ex-legislator the Sudan is
                        to be the Land of Promise for the future. It will one day be the home of
                        millions working on its fertile grounds or in its numerous manufacturies. It
                        will fill the towns and markets of Europe with its goods and natural
                        products. The poorer classes of Italy were advised to migrate to the Sudan
                        instead of going to America and to begin the work of civilisation in it now
                        or others will take the first place before them in this land of the
                        future</p>
                    <p>Of all people on earth, we are most interest ed in the Sudan and its future,
                        as that country is being nursed and nourished by our own capital. We are
                        spending millions upon the Sudan in the hope of seeing it live one day upon
                        its own means and pay back its debts with or without interest. If M. Ostini
                        is right in his prediction Egypt ought to be well represented and pre
                        emivently interested in the future of that southern part of the Nile Valley
                        But it appears to us that such a future is still very far and that upless
                        the millions of emigrants from Italy and other parts of Europe flood the
                        Sudan during our lease of life we are pot destined to see the blessing of
                        that golden age. As far as we can see wow there is absolutely no hope of
                        filling the Sudan with European emigrants and colonists. We are of opinion
                        that that country is not even thought of by Italians who have their own
                        possession in East Afriea in many ways better for purposes of
                        coloniastion-than the Egyptian Sudan</p>
                    <p>Our readers will remember, perhaps, a former article in these colamus on the
                        same subject. In that article. we thought that the Arab tribes now living
                        almost on theft and plunder might be induced and even helped by public funds
                        to chauge their present haunts and live im some part of the Sudan. These
                        bedouins are a public danger im Eyypt.as one may prove by
                        the-etheialetatietios of crime, it transfered to the Budan and given lands
                        to cultivate and live upon they will find it no more accessary to rob and
                        steal; they will settle down like all other peaceful subjects and help in
                        improving the condition of their new home. It must be remembered that these
                        Arabs are better fitted for life in the Sudan than European for physical and
                        moral reasons not far to seek.</p>

                    <p>Monks and Ascetics</p>
                    <p>To ordinary readers who are religious mystics or students of folklore,
                        perhaps therefore interested in endeavouring to trace the origin of, or
                        connection between the fabulous exploits and puerile miracles attributed to
                        the Egyptian Christian Ascetics and those known from other myths and wonder
                        tales of paganism, the chief value of Dr. Budge''s book on Palladins'
                        history of the monks and ascetics of Christian Egypt will be the preface. In
                        this he gives some excellent remarks concerning the rise and the practices
                        of Egyptian Monasticism Althongh some of the marvellous alleged performances
                        of the monks and men, and many of their references to the underworld, and
                        the future life, and the visits in the world from spirits and demons betray
                        a close and certain conneetion with the old theology and magic of the
                        ancient Egyptian cults and myths there is no reason to think that the
                        practice of Monasticism itself was inherited or imitated from any recluse
                        like life lived by devotees of the old Egyptian deities.</p>
                    <p>It is true that the sacred hierarchies of the ancient temples and shrines
                        were numerous and devoted for life in many cases to the worship of the god
                        in whose temple they from an early age had been hierophants. But they do not
                        appear to bave in any sense lived an ascetic life, and certainly did not
                        abstain from marriage because many of the chief priestly, and even minor
                        temple, offices such as the canophores and flabellifers were hereditary.
                        Further, in the old religious books no trace of the glorifi cation of
                        abstinence is to be found, but rather the greatest beatitude appears to have
                        been the anticipatory Elysian feasts of innumerable comestibles and
                        beverages.</p>
                    <p>It would therefore rather seem monasticism of Christian Egypt from the flight
                        from prosecution of numbers of Christians who, in the third century, and
                        some perhaps previously, in order to escape death or torture took refuge in
                        the desert, and remained concealed there during the lengthy Roman imperial
                        persecutions. There enforced poverty and hunger many of the refugees whose
                        nature and inclined them to asceticism ascertained by practice that plain
                        living and quiet contemplation addne with God and the desert world aspect of
                        nature produced in their case a contentment spiritual ecstacy not to be
                        achieved in the turmoil and temptation of the ordinary world and caused them
                        to continue living a recluse's existence, when the necessity for it as far
                        as martyrdom was concerned had passed away, and to endeav our to induce
                        others to follow their example.</p>
                    <p>Theausterities at first forced upon their when no longer a necessity became
                        practices of self abnegation, and their loneliness of life and the stern
                        face of nature familiar to them in the Libyan or Red Sea wilderness, may be
                        some excuse for their dreams and the imaginary exploits they or their
                        admirers for them have written that they enjoyed or passed through. When the
                        monkish life fashionable the laity out of pity furnished the reclase with
                        food and stimulated them by laudatory encouragements; false sheep then
                        entered the fold and idolent and neurotic ascetics of both sexes probably
                        abounded. The mystic experiences of the genuine early monks were travestied
                        by fabulous stories of the inferior later followers who strove by their
                        exaggerations and falsehoods to enbance their reputation for a piety they
                        perhaps failed to possess. </p>
                    <p>If no monkish ancestry or prototypes can be detected in the old Egyptian
                        religious books or temple and tomb inscriptions, still less can the great
                        saving truths of Christianity be traced back to the old theology. As Dr
                        Badge well brings out, the old religion was a sort of magic, all hope of
                        reaching heaven being based upon the performance of ceremonies, and the
                        recital of formulae, and whilst the texts written and perused by the pious
                        ancient Egyptians make great boasts of moral perfections such as dutifulness
                        to parents and kindness to relatives and the poor, also integrity where is
                        any meution made of regret or sorrow for sin or offences, and this although
                        the idea of retribution in the next world was commonly held. </p>
                    <p>It would look as if they ragarded a breach of the moral laws as being
                        remidiably by subsequent good works or the payment of offerings, a sort of
                        system of indulgences as raised the ire of Luther. There was not any ancient
                        Egyptian word for repentance therefore for the Coptic new testament a fresh
                        word "netania," was borrowed from the Greek. Indeed the three fundamental
                        ideas of the <cb n="1"/>Christian religion-repentance, conscience and faith
                        appear to have been unknown, or if known, ignored by the pagan priesthood
                        This being so it might be anticipated that the early Egyptian monks would
                        not very purely apprehend the doctrines of the Christian faith and we find
                        this to be the case, for many of them, apparently, based their salvation
                        upon their own works in the form of fasts, excessive labour and ceaseless
                        strife against freshly appetities. </p>

                    <p>The Record of a Great Work</p>
                    <p>The first part of the Memoir on the XIth, Dynasty Temple at Deir el,Baliari
                        bas now been published by the Egyptian Exploration Fund, and is a noteworthy
                        volome. It-contains the record of a great achievement, and will be of
                        absorbing interest to all those who, are interested in the subject of
                        Egyptian research. A great deal hasalready appeared-in regarding the Temple
                        and its excavation, but in the present work Dr. Naville and-Messta H R. Hall
                        and E.R Ayrton are able to, give a more concise account of their labours
                        although as Dr. Naville explains in the preface, this Memoir must still be
                        considered as'the description of a work which was unfinished at the time it
                        was prepared. The final plan, which could only be made when the whele
                        building had been cleared, and-therefore~could not appear in this volume,
                        will probably give further important indications as to the date of certain
                        parts of the construction. The second portion of the Memoir is expected to
                        be ready during the next few months.</p>
                    <p>The task of excavating the site at Deir el- Bahari, commenced fourteen years
                        ago, was completed last season, after the expenditure of an infinite amount
                        of labour and money. The work proved mach more arduous and ex pensive than
                        was at first anticipated, but it can be claimed at the same time that the
                        results of this research have exceeded in value and beauty the highest
                        expectations. The Egypt Expleration Fund are to be congratalat ed upon their
                        determination to go through with the task not withstanding the scarcity of
                        funds, and they have the satisfaction of knowing that they have opened up
                        one of the most interesting sites in this wonderful country, and have thus
                        greatly assisted the cause of Egyp- tian learning. As Professor Naville
                        stated in his paper read at the meeting of the Fund the other day, the money
                        has not been spent in vain, and the final result is worthy of the labour and
                        expense it has cost. To Dr. Navilléhimagli belongs much of the credit for
                        the sucecessful issue of the excavations. He has devoted much time and
                        patience to them, and his services will be all the more appreciated when it
                        is re membered that he has laboured without fee ot reward, and even paid his
                        own travelling ex penses. This devotion finds a worthy place in the record
                        of Egyptological research.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Naville bas had the assistance of a number of able lieutenants Mr. Hall,
                        Mr: Ayrton, Mr. O. T. Currelly, Mr. Garnett—Orme, Mr: M. D. Dalison, Mr. J.
                        'T. Dennis, and inst, but by no means least, Madam Naville, wha has prepared
                        many artistic plates for the Memoirs.</p>
                    <p>The plates contained in the present Memoir are the great feature of the work,
                        and are without exception very beautiful. Probably the best is that ot the
                        Hator-Cow made from a water colour by Mr. C. M. Reach. The plan of the
                        Temple at the end of the third season, 1906, drawn by Mr. C. R. Peers, from
                        working plans by Messrs. Ayrton aod Currelly, gives a very good idea of the
                        Temple as then excavated.</p>
                    <p>Although before Anthony obtained such celebrity as a recluse a certain Paul
                        was a noted ascetic, there cannot be any doubt it was to the devout life of
                        the former that Egyptian monasticism owed its vogue and rapid growth. The
                        monastery which be finally foanded was situated about 25 miles from the Red
                        Sea, and not later not far away from it another anchorite of the name of
                        Paul established a large monastic settlement. Barly in the tourta century
                        Pacho. mius drew up the celebratéd "Rule" for his followers, the practice of
                        which code is display- éd so tully in the Asketikon or History of the monks
                        of 'Tabena which form an impertant portion of Palladias Work.</p>
                    <p>He however wandered about Egypt visiting all the chief novastic communities
                        such as those in the Nitrian desert North West of Cairo, where he says there
                        were 5,000 monks and 600 anchorites. He also speaks highly of the monks and
                        hermite of Antinoe where he resided four years.The chapters of Dr. Budges
                        introduction are devoted to a disoussion of the superpatural and mythical
                        demauds in these Histories of Palladuis and to the ascetic life and teaching
                        of its votaries. Though Palladuis appears to an admirer of the monkish
                        career he in his history illustrates both its strength and weakness and
                        although many impossible miracles and actions are recited, yet, as Dr. Budge
                        says:-</p>
                    <p>"The great merit of Palladnis "Paradise" is that the histories make the
                        reader feel, when reading them, that he has not before him naratives of the
                        lines of a set of beings of supernatural character but stories of men who
                        were trying to live super-human lives and a Palfaduis shows clearly how far
                        they succeeded and in what they failed. He was no more panegyrist of the
                        monks but a patient sober and impartial critic of their lines words and
                        deeds. In several of his biographies of them he admits that they relapsed
                        into worldieness and sin. </p>
                    <p>The abstemious life of a recluse the clear desert air of Egypt might, in many
                        instances be supposed to have been congenial to an excessive longevity, but
                        the greatest span of life attributed to a monk is 133 years for a certain
                        Mar Paul; another Elijah of Antinoe lived a 100 years; and Anthony 105.
                        These are not longer than the age accomplished by the writer of the old
                        Egyptian papyri : or than terms which have been equalled, if not exceeed, in
                        modern times especially in Russia. There are very few historical gleanings
                        to be obtained from the work. Two governors are mentioned Alipius and
                        Lausaus which may be Perfecti Aegyptii, and the papyrus plant is stated to
                        have neen still growing in lake Moreotis in the fourth century. The
                        quotation from Scripture are evidently carelessly made and so not of much
                        value for textual criticism.</p>

                    <dateline>London, November 23rd</dateline>
                    <p>The Grenadier Guard's inquiry case closed yesterday, no doubt to the relief
                        of all con cerned. One cannot help but ask "where the good of holding the
                        inquiry at all" Certaivly it did not make good reading, it served no good
                        object, and it gave the yellow press an opportunity of displaying scare
                        headlones and indulging in the usual bosh on the service maters. One thing
                        would require explanation, and that is, if Lieutenant Woods was unfit to be
                        a regimental officer why was he recommended for service in the Egyptian Army
                        last year, or why was he told to go to Uganda. If he was unfit to serve in
                        London he was unfit to serve in either country. </p>
                    <p>An echo of the famous ''on the knee" case is to be found in a new Admiralty
                        order, just published, to the effect that as far as possible seamen and
                        stokers at Portsmouth are to live a float instead of at shore
                        establishments. This goes well to substantiate what was stated dur ing the
                        stokers' riots of just a year ago that the naval barracks, where the riots
                        occurred, would be vacated by the bluejackets and taken over by the Royal
                        "Marine Light' Infantry, When the "stone frigates" were built, the policy of
                        housing the bluejackets in them was severely criticised on the grounds that
                        it would not make for' the maintenance of good order and discipline, and
                        that certainly it woald not im- prove the standard of seamanship. The un-
                        fortunate sequel proved the truth of the criticisms.</p>
                    <p>The 9.2 guns for the armoured cruiser "Minotaur" are said to be the finest
                        weapons ever manufactured in that particular calibre. This gun weighs 29
                        tons, has a length of 39 feet, and is worked electrically. Its projectile
                        weighs the regulation 380 lbs, and the powder charge consists of 130 lbs
                        cordite, the explosion of which propels the projectile at a velocity of
                        2,900 feet per second, or with an initial energy lof 21,000 foottons. The
                        extreme range of the gun is 12,000 yards—nearly seven miles—and at the
                        liberal fightings range of 3,000 yards the projectile cam punch 11 inches of
                        steel ar: mour. The "Minotaur" carries, or rather will carry, as they have
                        not yet been mounted, four of these guns.</p>
                    <p>Inniskilling Dragoons of all ranks look for ward with regret to the time when
                        Colonel E. A. Herbert, M.V.O., will sever his connection with the grand old
                        regiment at Cairo. No more popalar officer has ever ridden at its head in
                        modern yéars. He has spent nearly all his twenty one years' service with it,
                        and comman- ded the C. Squadron in the early stages of the Boer War. At
                        theaction of Barnard's Nek he did a veryplucky thing in-chrrging, with only
                        thirteen men behind him, a force of 200 Boers, cutting bis way through them.
                        His horse was shot and a trumpeter brought him in on his horse. This charge
                        was necessary to gain an important kopje, which he subsequently held against
                        all the force that the Boers could bring against his handful of men, five of
                        whom, were killed and five wounded. Unfortunately, he had to be invalided
                        home through sickness in Febraary, 1900, and did not rejoin till the
                        December of the following year when he went out from England in Command of a
                        draft for <cb n="4"/> the regiment, which was the operating along the
                        Heilbron Frankfort line, and served with it till the close of the
                        struggle</p>
                    <p>In his remarks on the training carried out by the troops in the Aldershot
                        Gommand this year, Getioral Sir John Fretich emphasises the Importance, as
                        regards 'tactics, of paying in- creased attention to the study of the
                        topography of any probable field of battle. In view of the enormous
                        comparative extent of modern battlefields, that of Mukden, for example, as
                        Compared with the fields of Water loo and Ligny, this study of ground. is
                        much more important than was formerly 'the case, the ngnwrous and varied
                        featares of ground having necessarily exercised a vastly greater
                        influéence'in the great 'battles of 1905 than was exercised by topegraphical
                        conditions in those of 1615. In connection with the training of the Cavalry,
                        an excellent piece of work is recorded of the 1st Cavalry Brigade, the whole
                        brigade having carried oot thé swimming of the Thames by night in so short a
                        time as to constitute it an almost unique performance. The main feature in
                        connection with the training of the Royal Engineers was the marked
                        improvement made as regards wireless telegraphy, the stations being rapidly
                        put up, and Communication being continnously maintained. In the Infantry the
                        system of training by double com pemics Was oootineed, with results that
                        prove, in the opinion of SIr John French, that the longer the system of
                        double company organisation is tried, the more apparent does its value
                        become. An extended develepment is recommended by the system of detailing
                        medical officers to take part in staff tours, which affords an excellent
                        method of teaching the various medical and sanitary problems to be met
                        within war, and of discovering the capabilities of officers.</p>

                    <p>The "New Guide to the Holy Land", which has been compiled by Father Barnabas

                        has been translated from the French mto the English, Italian, German, and
                        Spanish langoages, will be found a very useful volume not merély by Catholic
                        pilgrims and tourists, for whom it is ostensibly written, but 'also by the
                        incréasing numbers of the travelling public who visit Palestine from time to
                        time. Father Meistermann has lived many years in the Holy Land, and has
                        exploted it trom enc tovend. He has thas been enabled to give, in a compact
                        form, a great amount of information regarding the features of interest to be
                        noted, and many hints as to the best means of making a tour in comfort. The
                        work is divided into twenty-six excursions, and as there are twenty-two
                        excellent maps and over one-hundred plans, each day's journey can be
                        arranged and carried out without many of the little inconvenieces which of
                        fires render travelling in the Bast somewhat weéarisonre The guide contains
                        a well-condensed bistory of the Holy Land, and a éhapter on the political
                        divisions of the country, Some very helpful advice as to outfit and hygienic
                        precautions is also given.</p>
                    <p>These plans include Marseiles, Naples, the Piraeus and Athens, Contantinople,

                    <p>MDE. JOSEPH Mde. Joseph Beaudoin, 59 Rue St Olivier, Quebec, P. Q.. Can.,
                        writes "Peruns is wonderful for indigestion I eat whatever I want and no
                        longer feel any oppreasion. "Having had dyspepsia for a long time end having
                        tried various other remedies, I decided to try Perwna and with the fourth
                        bottle of it I was perfectly cured. "For this reason I recommiend it to all
                        those who are enffering with that terrible malady , dyspepsia. </p>
                    <p>The experiences of Mde. Beaudoin ought to be sufficient proof to any one of
                        the value of Peruna in cases of catarrhal dyspepsia. If you suffer from
                        stomach catarrh in any Of its various forms, give Pertins a fair trial,
                        avoiding im the méantime all such indiscretions in diet as would tend to
                        reterd a cure, and you will soon be rewarded by a normal appetite and

                    <p>On a ouvert avec de l'animation, mais l chiffre d'affaires est resté minime;
                        au surplu en cours de séance le ton a perdu de sa fer meté et la clôture a
                        eu lieu au calme plat. A s'en rapporter à la cote on croirait que le mar ché
                        a été remarquable à tous les points de vue beaucoup de titres sont en
                        hausse, dont quel ques-uns de façon marquée. Cependant, comme nous venons de
                        le dire, il s'agit en général de cours nominaux, inscrits en fin de séance
                        au milieu d'un tapage assourdissant. Le fait est que si les vendeurs sont
                        réservés, les acheteurs le sont aussi; chacun reste chez soi. En valeurs
                        dirigeantes la tenue a été inégale, l'Agricole et la Delta Light étant
                        fermes, tandis que la Na- tional Bank était offerte. En tous cas, ce n'est
                        pas l'appui de Londres qui nous a manqué, puisque le taux privé d'escompte
                        nous est arri- vée en réduction sensible et que nos valeurs sont soutenues
                        au Stock Exchange. On allègue pour expliquer la lourdeur que certains ont
                        hâte de réaliser et sont constamment à l'affût des occasions.</p>
                    <p>L'Agricole progresse de 7 7/8 à 7 29/32, la Delta Light de 9 3/4 à 9 25/32,
                        la Daïra de 12 11/16 à 12 13/16, et l'Obligation Crédit Foncier de 286 1/2 à
                        287 l'ancienne et de 253 à 253 1/2 la nouvelle. Quant à la National Bank
                        elle revient de 20 5 8 à 20 1/2.</p>
                    <p>Tandis que les Privilégiées Tramways d'Alex- andrie reculent de 140 à 138,
                        les Dividendes avancent de 272 à 278. L'Alexandria Water gagne une
                        demi-livre à 10 3/4 et les Eaux do Caire 3 franes à 103.</p>
                    <p>En hausse encore les Lots Turcs de 158 à 159, la Banque d'Athènes de 112 3/4
                        à 113 1 4, la Privilégiée Khedivial Mail de 4 à 4 1/4, la Land Bank de 7
                        3/16 à 7 9/32, l'Urbaine de 3 1/4 à 3 3/8, l'Union Foncière de 4 3,8 à 4
                        7/16, et le Crédit Franco-Egyptien de 4 1,8 à 47/32. La Banque d'Orient
                        rétrograde de 115 à 114.</p>
                    <p>Dans la catégorie des petites valeurs, la Cassa di Sconto avance de 42 1/2 à
                        43, la Building Lands de 1 19/32 à 1 5/8, l'Aboukir de 26/3 à 27/6, l'action
                        Allotment de 1 7/8 à 2, la Port Said Salt de 12/3 à 12/4 1/2, les Ritz de
                        5/16 à 11/32 et la Levico de 11/32 à 3/8. La Delta Land fléchit, au
                        contraire, de 19/32 à 1 1/4 et l'Ordinary Khedivial Mail de 23/6 22/9.</p>
                    <p>Pour cette dernière le bilan publié est fa vorable. Après que les actions
                        privilégiées auront touché leur 5 1/2% statutaire et les or dinary 10%, il
                        restera un report à nouveau de £14000, suffisant pour le dividende de
                        l'année prochaine.</p>
                    <p>L'ouverture de la séance a été retardée d'un quart d'heure en signe de deuil

                    <p>On parle beaucoup du projet qu'aurait le Gouvernement du Soudan de créer des
                        routes, un chemin de fer même, qui iraient jusqu'au cœur du Kordofan. Il y a
                        dans ce pays des forêts immenses produisant de la gomme, mais qui n'ont pu
                        jusqu'ici être exploitées par suite du manque de la main-d'oeuvre et des
                        moyens de transport, très peu sûrs et très lents en tous cas.</p>
                    <p>Si le projet du Gouvernement du Soudan est mis à exécution, le commerce des
                        gommes prendra une importance dont il est impossible, à l'heure actuelle, de

                    <head>A BROKEN-DOWN SYSTEM.</head>
                    <p>This is a condition (or disease) to which doctors give many names, but which
                        few of them really understand. It it simply weakness—a break-down, as it
                        were, of the vital forces that sustain the system. No matter what may be its
                        causes (for they are almost numberless), its symptoms are much the same; the
                        more prominent being sleeplessness, sense of prostration or weariness,
                        depression of spirits and want of energy for all the ordinary affairs of
                        life. Now, what alone is absolutely essential in all such cases is increased
                        vitality—vigour--</p>
                    <p>VITAL STRENGTH &amp; ENERGY</p>
                    <p>to throw off these morbid feelings, and experience proves that as night
                        succeeds the day this may be more certainly secured by a course of the
                        celebrated life-reviving tonic</p>

                        conditions, in either sex; and it is difficult to imagine a case of disease
                        or derangement, whose main features are those of debility, that will not be
                        speedily and permanently benefited by this never-failing recuperative
                        essence, which is destined to cast into oblivion everything that had
