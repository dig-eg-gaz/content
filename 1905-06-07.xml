                    <head>WEDNESDAY, JUNE 7, 1905. f SUEZ CANAL. PROBLEMS.</head>
                    <p>The reoent protest entered by certain British shipowners against what they
                        regard as the excessive dues and the arbitrary system of measurements
                        enforced by the Suez Canal Company, and, above all, the bold suggestion to
                        oonstrnct an alternative waterway between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea,
                        lend more than usual interest to the White Paper just issued, dealing with
                        the returns of the Canal for 1904 and the two previous yean. We dealt with
                        the paper from a statist^ point of view in our leading article of Saturday
                        last, but there are other points which deserve fuller consideration in
                        connection with this subjeot. As we stated in Saturday s article, it is more
                        than ever clear that British shipping is the dominating factor in providing
                        the traffio and the reoeipts of the Suez Canal. That fact oertainly lends
                        additional weight to the protests that have been made by an influential
                        group of British ship owners. It has been urged also that the shareholders
                        of the oompany are now reoeiving dividends exceeding 25 per oent per au-num,
                        and that the transit reoeipts for last year, amounting to frs. 115,818,000
                        or, say, £4,633,000, were the largest on reoord, exceeding those of each of
                        the two previous years respectively by over 12 million francs, and tiiis
                        notwithstanding the foot that in 1903 and 1904 the transit dues have been
                        reduoed from fra. 9 to frs. 8.50 per ton. The obvious deduction is that the
                        oompany could well afford to reduoe its rates considerably further and yet
                        leave ah extremely handsome margin of profit to be divided among its
                        shareholders. This is no doubt true ; but, on the other side, it is
                        contended that the undertaking is a private oompany ; that, as we have seen,
                        the traffio oontinues to increase rapidly, notwithstanding the dues levied,
                        and that even as regards these dues they have been reduced gradually from
                        frs. 12 per ton in 1880 to the present figure of frs. 8.50 per ton. t. Our
                        shippers, or some of them, argue that the time occupied in traversing the
                        Canal is too long, and it is said that as the traffic eases the duration of
                        the passage tends to increase. We are told, indeed. « tue present report
                        that the mean length oftho passage for all vessels navigating the Canal last
                        year was 18 hours 8 minutes, as against 17 hours 48 minutes in 1903; but il
                        we tarn back to earlier reports there does not appear be very muoh in the
                        argument, for in 1902 the average passage took 18 hours 2 minutes, while in
                        1901 the figures were 18 hours 41 minutes, or over half an hour in »s of
                        those of last year. Even if it oould be shown that the avenge duration of
                        the passage was steadily increasing, that oould hardly be uaed as an
                        argument in favor of the reduction of rates, the natural effect of whioh
                        would be to make the congestion greater. In view, however, of the large
                        increase in revenue last year, i}; appears to us that the time is ripe for
                        the pany to make a further oonoession to shippers in the matter of the dues
                        levied. This it should do in its own interest, so as liminate friotion with
                        its customers aud to prevent those threats of the oonstruotion of a rival
                        undertaking, whioh, however improbable of realisation at present, are pre
                        sumably a source of some disquietude to nervous shareholders. It is a
                        question also, whether, having regard to the rapidly increasing traffic, the
                        time is not approaching when liberal disbursements of capital should made is
                        order to inorease the transport facilities of the Canal and thereby reduce
                        the duration of the passage. It must sot be forgotten, however, that the
                        British Government holds about ll-25ths of the share oapital of the oompany,
                        and that out of 32 directors 10 are British, although the headquarters of
                        the oompany are oertainly in Paris, and it is oonstitntad under Frenoh law.
                        If, therefore, our Government oould be induoed to bring its influence
                        strongly to bear in order to lighten the tax upon the shipping industry,
                        which, of oourse, falls quite as heavily upon foreign ves-as upon those of
                        British nationality, the inevitable redaction of rates might be hasten ed,
                        and some concessions might also be obtained with regard to the system of
                        measurements adopted. TO WHOLESALE BU.YERS, STORE-KEEPERS, AND OTHER

                        very prevalent, in spite of the fact that many arrests have been made of

                        rounds, noticed a very bad odour proceeding from ofie of the quarry pita On
                        reporting the matter to the director of the salt works, Mr. A C. Ramsay, the
                        latter immediately prooeoded to the spot After procuring a lantern and a

                        correspondent, writing from Vienna by last mal, snys: The immense space of
                        the ftotunde was on Satarday filled to overflowing by the mass of people who
                        were present at the great Nde Festival arranged by the Prinoess Paulino
                        Metternioh. One oonld really believe oneself on the banks of tbe Nile at
                        sunsetThe various stalls represented Egyptian shops. Round the stalls the
                        orowd was so great that the help of the police had to be requisitioned in
                        order to keep the people moving. The Prinoess Metternich looked charming in
                        s yellow Egyptian costume. It was covered with gold and silver laoe. On her
                        head tbe princess wore a turban. She went from one itall to the other, sold
                        pictare postcards, and generally did tbe honors in the most charming manner.
                        Countoss Lippe Pallavicini had established \ magnificent art salon where she
                        sold the works of celebrated painters. The picture postcards designed by
                        Countess M. Palffy, which represented the Princess Metternich on k sphinx,
                        had a great suooess. Among those who were bftsy at this stall *ero Princess
                        Engelbert-Auersperg, who looked utreinely well in her Egyptian oostume. Mrs.
                        iL Warndorfer wore a magnificent real Bgyptian costume and looked her very
                        best ia it Another lady in Egyptian oostume was Baroness Prelis-Romerskirch.
                        Countess Nor* Fugger was at the bead of a very well-stocked Egyptian bazaar,
                        and bad bad all the goods sent from Cairo for the occa-lion. With her were
                        Prinoess Alexander Solms, ■rearing a pretty white foulard dress trimmed with
                        light blue; Countess Wurmbrand-Schenk, uountess Frigi Fugger, and Countess
                        Salm-Steinborg. AT THE “AMBASSADEURS.” The open-air musio-hall at Gberireh,
                        which is known by tbe name of “Theatre des Ambas-sadeors,” attracted a large
                        crowd on Satarday evening by advertising a “soiree Veaitienne,” and the many
                        who attended were in no way disappointed. The theatre had been most
                        effectively decorated with festoons of artificial green-leaves and roses,
                        from which were hang maltiooloured electrio-globes,and flags of. every
                        nation were abundant Just before tbe entertainment commenced the audience
                        were somewhat alarmed to see a design of the star and orescent surmounted by
                        a crown, whioh was attached to the left wing of the theatre, oatch fire, and
                        the dames were oertainly considerable. Happily the adjaoent material was not
                        inflammable, for after the alarm had-been raised full five minutes elapsed
                        before any of the officials Attempted to extinguish the fire.No water was
                        available, but eventually the design was detacbed-from its supports and
                        allowed to bum itself out on the ground. The perfonninoe whioh is presented
                        by the management of this theatre is oertainly superior to the average
                        performance witnessed in other Cairo music-halls, and some of the “tarns”
                        were distinctly good. M. Charley, a lightning quick-change artiste, who made
                        his debut in Cairo, was excellent; he portrayed various characters, and the
                        rapidity with whioh he changed his oos-tumes was marvellous. Want of space
                        forbids us to give details of the programme, but the majority of the
                        artistes were worthy of applause. We would, however, suggest to the
                        management that though we appreciate them, we are at the same time somewhat
                        tired of hearing the same artistes over and over again. They would also do
                        well to provide programmes, and, as we suggested before, to so arrange tbe
                        theatre that more than those who are favored with a front seat can witness
                        the various performances. </p>

                        INSTRUCTION. THE 8ECONDARY CERTIFICATE To toe Editor of the Egyptian
                        Gazfttb. Sir,—I have read in the “Gazette” of yesterday your article about
                        the Seoondary Education certificate examination of 1905 and the results
                        therein obtained. My attention has been particularly drawn to your sympathy
                        for the 122 private students of whom only 10 "satisfied the examiners.” As I
                        have been one of the ten private students who by a stroke of luck have
                        “satisfied tbe examiners," I will be much obliged if you will allow me to
                        explain in the “Gazette” tbe reasons for the failure of so many private
                        students. My wish will have been realised if my article is read by the
                        authorities in tbe Ministry of Pablic Instruction. The very small percentage
                        of suooessful private candidates does not imply in any way that private
                        students are of a lower standard than the Government schools' boys. I have
                        known some of them who are by far more learned and bettor prepared than the
                        beit of the Government school boys. Bat the chief and paramount reason tor
                        the failure of so many lies in the etamination questions. The questions are
                        not about the generalities aad essential parts of tbe sabjeot examined in,
                        and the oorreot answers to these quntions do not indicate a real preparation
                        and a good grasp of the subject Tbe questions are drawn from the Government
                        sohool books (some of which may be catch questions), so that the one that
                        does not study in those books, aad does not attend tbe lectnras of tbe
                        Government teachers will very improbably saooeed.even if be has studied in
                        the best books.As an example of this I may say that tEe Government book of
                        physios is an elementary book of about 150 pages ; I studied in a very good
                        English book of physios of 650 pages, but strange to say I was not better
                        off with some of the questions than the least student who bad prepared in
                        that 150 paged book. The Ministry should know that the examination is a
                        publio one open to all schools, consequently the questions should be found
                        in all the boob treating of the subjeot. They should be good and nseful
                        questions whioh any candidate of any sohool can answer, otherwise it will be
                        qoite dear that tbe Ministry does not want anybody to pass the examination
                        exoept those that go to its schools, study in its books, and attend tbe
                        leotures of its own teaoheTs, quite a singular way of unifying eduoation in
                        Egypt The questions in languages were not diffioalt this year, but the
                        stumbling-blook was in the mttbematios. Most of the questions in arithmetic
                        were reasonable but some of the questions in geometry and algebra were very
                        diffioalt Indeed geometry questions have always proved a stumbling block to
                        many, for the reason that they are all original exercises, some of them ot
                        great diffioulty. In other oountries some of the questions in geometry are
                        oo the propositions proved in tbe books taught while others are original
                        onss so that the candidate may be able (if be has really stucUed) to solve
                        soms of them; but when all the questions are original ones tbe student may
                        in bis nervousness not be able to solve any whatever. Another remark on the
                        questions of geo metry and algebra is that the questions should not indude
                        diffioult problems involving long and complicated formulio for the students

                    <p>Yesterday, before the Mixed Court of Appeal, waa heard the case relating to
                        the division of the property left by the late Baron Moise de Menasoe. Tbe
                        litigants were his daughters, Meedames Lion and Pollooais, bis son Baron
                        lames, sad bis widow Baronees Mode Me-nasce, ntfe Padou. Other interpleaders
                        were the heirs of Baron Elie de Menasoe, and also Messrs. V. and C. Aghion.
                        Tbe oase raised iurious points of international law, and may be summarised
                        in the point of knowing whether the hdr of the owner of an estate is
                        »ntitled to sue in the Mixed Tribunals for a livision of the estate, without
                        first establish-ng in the proper Consoler Court that ho (or n this case she)
                        is entitled, as hdr, to part of £e property. The oase was argued cleverly by
                        tfe. Cuzser, for the appdlants, supported by ties. Coluod and La Pommeraye

                        Cairo and seriously hurt by Mr. Cassab’s oarriage. The Native Court

                        driving furioaely. Mr. Beale then sued Mr. Cassab for damages, sut tke Cairo
                        tribund, ignoring tbe finding of the Native Coon, nonsuited the plaiutiff on
                        the plea that be must have been ou the wrong side. Mdtre Carton de Wiart
                        appeared for the appellant Mdtre Oddi for Mr. Cassab. Judgment was reserved.

                        >f the ritting of the Court of Apped, the pre-ridSjg judge, Mr. Moriondo,
                        informed his jolleagaes of tbe Beneh and the members of the Bar of the Mixed
                        Court of the death of [Jommendatore Giaooone, for so many years president ol
                        that Court The demise of Com-nendatore Giaooone took plaoeat Florenoe, where
                        tbe lamented judge went to live on bis retirement nine years ago. Judge
                        Moriondo referred feelingly to the eminent qualities of tbe leoeased, who
                        had taken an active part in tbe interaationd conferences extending from 1870
                        to 1875, when the foundation of the Mixed Court was discussed and tbe oodes
                        prepared. He waa known as a thoroughly reliable jadge, an upright man,and a
                        sound authority in law. As a man, be was admirable in bis private life and
                        ill who approached him became bis friends. He is deeply mourned by his
                        oolleagues. Me. Procureur-Generd Borchgrevink, in the name of tbe Parquet
                        joined in these words ol praise and regret Me. Cuzzer, Batonnierof the
                        Alexandria Bar, round whom were the other members of the Bar Coundl, also
                        spoke in token of the high r^ard in whioh Comm. Giaooone was held, ipedally
                        recalling his gnat kindness to the itafl of the tribunals and to poor
                        litigants. Tbe ritting was then suspended for a quarter of an hour as a sign
                        of mourning. Comm. Giaooone bad lived 25 years in Alexandria, first as
                        consular jadge for Italy, then as councillor, and afterwards president ol
                        the Court of Appeal He was a popular figure ia the Alexandria streets, where
                        he drove or wdked invariably dressed in a black frock ooat and wearing a
                        high bat He had married a lady of the Zogheb family, a great-aunt ol the
                        present generation, and had thus strengthened his connection with the
                        oountry. The tact and what might be odled the diplomatic quditiee,-of the
                        late President often prevented during the “dghties'’seriooe friction between
                        tbe authority of the Government and the Courts. In those days many question!
                        relating to the management of the Guanoes ol the tribunals, eta, bad not
                        been settled and were open to discussion. About 1889 Comm. Giaooone bad
                        dreamed of amalgamating in s oertain way the native and mixed tribunals, by
                        submitting thdr decisions to the same Court of Apped, where Europeans wonld
                        have beet in majorityooly in European oases. However, nothing come of the
                        idea. When Comm. Giao oone retired it was snnoucoed that he waa about to be
                        appointed Senator in Italy, but the nomination did not take plaoe. Comm.
                        Giao oone was 84 yean of age ; he was a devoul Roman Catholio. STEAMER

                    <head>THE AFRICAN PIGMIES. BY DR. ELLIOT SMITH.</head>
                    <p>( Lecture delivered, before Cairo Scientific Society) The recent sojourn in
                        Cairo of six pigmies, brought from the great forest in the Congo State by
                        Colonel Harrison, has afforded many of ns an opportunity of becoming
                        personally acquainted for the first time with the representatives ot a race
                        long known to ns in Cable and what was supposed to be a tradition, probably
                        as old as Egyptian civilisation.' So much curiosity has been aroused by
                        these little people that I thought 1 might be rendering a service to many of
                        you by transmitting some of the information which I have garnered during the
                        last few weeks, by seafdhing through the extensive literature delating to
                        pigmies and by personal observations made on the little people themselves.
                        The party which recently visited Cairo consisted of six parsons, four males
                        and two females.Of these only two, a man and a woman, can be considered to
                        have reached full maturity, i.e., the stftge in which the bones are no
                        louger capable of increasing in the length. As the average height of the
                        party seemed to be abnormally small, when compared with the measurements
                        hitherto recorded for the pigmy people, one was naturally curious to know
                        whether this exceeding smallness of stature might not be partly due to the
                        age of the individuals. The only means 'of estimating age are the
                        examination of the teeth and the state of ossification of the growing bones.
                        The latter, which is by far the more reliable test, is now possible in
                        living people,si uce the introduction of the use of the Rontgen Rays has
                        enablod us to see every detail in the struoture of the bony tissues. By the
                        courtesy of Dr. Milton we were able to make use of this method and obtain a
                        series of skiagrams of the bones of the hands and arms of the pigmies : the
                        exoellent photographs of the bones were taken at the Victoria Nursing Home
                        by Dr. Khayatt. By means of these photographs I found that in only two of
                        the party had the bones of the arm finished growing and that the other four
                        exhibited various stfcges of immaturity. The smallest member of the party is
                        a mere boy, who, even judged by European standards, cannot be more than
                        twelve or most probably eleven years ot age: he is 1.158 metres in height
                        and weighs only 49 pounds. Another youth is probably no more than seventeen
                        years of age and may be one or two years less, and a third is not much, if
                        at all older, his age limit being about eighteen. The lounger of the two
                        women is probably less than twenty years of age. When it is remembered that
                        all these standards of age are based upon European standards, which there is
                        reason to believe are probably higher than the African, the ages of these
                        four individuals may possibly be even less than the figures that I have
                        given. Taking these facta into consideration it is not surprising to find
                        that the average height (1.305 metres) of the six individuals is
                        considerably less than that (1.452 metres) given by Sir Harry Johnston for
                        the Bambute pigmies. But even the two fully-grown individuals are
                        considerably smaller (the man is 1.367 metres and the woman 1.286 metres),
                        not only than Sir Harry Johnston’s average,but also than the smallest adult
                        man and woman respectively measured by him. All this points to the fact that
                        even the two fully-grown members of the party are small, even for pigmies.
                        This opinion is further strengthened by the fact that one of the immature
                        youths is slightly taller than the fully-grown man, and 'the younger woman,
                        whose bonas are still oapable of growing, is considerably taller (1.334
                        metres) than the older woman. At the same time it is only just to add that
                        the measurements of even smaller adult pigmies than those we hava seen hjwe
                        been recorded by Sir W. Flower. It is perhaps natural that one engaged in
                        selecting representatives of a small race to bring to Europe would hardly
                        choose the bigger individuals. I have made these preliminary remarks to
                        emphasise the necessity of exercising considerable caution in drawing
                        conclusions as to the size and characters of a race from a few individuals
                        who have been selected, «r who have eleoted to become temporary exiles from
                        their home. It is not infrequently supposed that this is the first visit of
                        pigmies to Egypt (or Europe), but this idea is quite erroneous. These little
                        people had been preceded by several parties of their kinsmen within recent
                        years and probably by more numerous representatives of their race in ancient
                        times. Professor Schweinfurth discovered (or rather re-discovered after a
                        lapse of two centuries) the Akka pigmies in the Monbnttu country in 1870 and
                        obtained from Mouza (King of the Monbnttu) an Akka boy in exchange for a
                        dog. This boy died at Berber on his way to Egypt as the result, so professor
                        Schweinfurth tells me, of an expensive meal of macaroni. Although several
                        travellers are said to have brought pigmies to Europe before his time, the
                        Italian traveller Miani is the first of whom I can find any authentic
                        record, who has been the means of sending genuine pigmies to Europe. He
                        followed the footsteps of Dr. Schweinfurth into the Monbnttu country in 1872
                        and obtained tw) Akka boyp with the view of bringing tiiem to Europe. Miani
                        himself succumbed to the climate, and at his death left his collections,
                        including the young Akkas, to the Italian Geographical Society. From the
                        contemporary accounts of the treatment to which these unfortunate boys were
                        subjected, we gather that history is merely repeating itself at the present
                        moment in the case of this party of six, for we read that “probably no two
                        individuals of a savage race have ever beta so mtfob bonortd by the
                        attentions of the soientifio </p>

                    <p>world. First in Cairo,and afterwards in Europe, these two boys were
                        described, measured, and photographed, and have become the .sutyeotp. of a

                        Brooa, Hamy and^ de Quatrefages in France” (Sir W. Flower). From the
                        acoounts of Schweinfurth and Sir W. Flower we learn that they were
                        introduced to the King and Queen of Italy and into the most aristocratic
                        society, and that finally they settled down §3 pages in the household of
                        Count Miniscalchi at Verona, after receiving a European education. Oee of
                        them died of phthisis in Verona in 1883 and was buried there without being
                        submitted to any scientific examination. The fate of Jthe other boy I have
                        bean unable to determine, llomolo Gessi (one of Gordon’s lieutenants) took
                        an Akka girl to Europe and she was living at Trieste as a servant to Madame
                        Gessi in 1888, whioh is the latest record I have been able to obtain of her.
                        The fact that some of the pigmy people now live in dose proximity to the
                        sources of the Nile and, according to most anthropologists who have studied
                        the question, probably extended over a muoh wider area formerly, renders it
                        highly probable that at various times the ^ancient dwellers on the banks of
                        the Nile must have heard of or perhaps seen some of these little people in
                        the course of*their numerous expeditions to the south. Bat eyen if this fact
                        were established with absolute certainty it would not justify us in
                        concluding, as so many reoent writers have done, that every mention of small
                        men in the ancient Egyptian writings referred to real pigmies. On the
                        contrary we know for certain that at all times up to to day, true dwarfs,
                        such as occm sporadically in all races of mankind, have been well received
                        and have been given posts ol honor at the court of the ruler of the oountry,
                        For every population there*is a wide range of variation in the stature of
                        individuals, and it frequently happens that, as the result of various
                        pathologioal conditions, growth may oease at an abnormally early period of
                        life. This “dwarfishness” or uanism may be totals in whioh case the whole
                        bod$>is affected, everj part being proportionally reduced in size, sc that
                        the relative sizes are those of a norma! adult; or it may be partial, some
                        parts being small whereas others grow to their full adult dimensions. The
                        result of this partial nanism is often a grossly mis-shapen and distorted
                        body. It is this type of dwarf which is repre sented in the wall-pictures
                        and statues by ancient Egyptian*. As an example of this see the statue of
                        the dwarf Khuumhotpu iu the Museum of Antiquities. Professor Maspero tells
                        me that a careful study of all the passages in Egyptian literature which
                        have been supposed to refer to pigmies, fails to reveal a single example of
                        a description which can certainly justify such a belief. The determinative
                        invariably applied to these so-called pigmies is a hieroglyphic sign
                        representing the mis-shapen figure expressive of partial nanism. Probably
                        the earliest references to one of those doubtful personages is that found in
                        Professor Schiaparelli’s description of an Egyptian tomb (published in
                        1893). Somewhere near the laud of Egypt was the far-famed land of Punc’a
                        term which has received numerous geographical definitions. •'All that lay
                        beyond Punt was held to be a fabulous region, a kind of intermediate
                        boundary land between the world of men and that of the gods, the ‘Island of
                        the Double,’ ‘Land of Shades.’ It was inhabited by the Dangas, tribes of
                        half-savage (pigmies) whose grotesque faces aud wild gestures reminded the
                        Egyptians of the God /Bes.” In this quotation from Professor Maspero’s ‘Dawn
                        of Civilisation” 1 have substituted the word "pigmies for “dwarfs” because
                        the latter worse in the sense defined above cannot be applied to a tribe,
                        but only to occasional individuals in any given tribe. To continue the
                        quotation : “The chances of war or trade brought some of them from time to
                        time to Punt or among the Amiamti (f.near Wady Haifa): the merchant who
                        suooeeded in acquiring, or bringing them to Egypt] had his fortune made.
                        Pharoah valued the Dangas highly and was anxious to have some of them at any
                        price among the dwarfs with whom he loved to be surrounded:: no knew better
                        than they the dan^r of the goi —that to whioh he unreservedly gave way in
                        his merry moments.” (In regard to this it is instructive to refer to Sir
                        Harry Johnston’s account of the dances of the Bam-bite pigmies [Uganda
                        Projteotorate II. p. 45..] which seem quite appropriate to devotees ol Bes).
                        “Towards the end of his reign King Assi (5th dynasty) prooured one whioh a
                        certain Biurdidi had purchased in Punt. Was this the first which had made
                        its appear ance at court or had others preceded it in the good graoes of the
                        Pnaroahs I His wildness and aotivity and the extraordinary positions whioh
                        he assumed, made a lively impression upon the courtiers of the time, and
                        nearly a century later there were still reminiscences of him” (Maspero, op.
                        cit. pp. 397 and 398). V Professor Keane, quoting from the same memoir of
                        Schiaparelli’s, says that some seventy years after King Assi, “an officer,
                        Heru-Khuf,was sent by Pepi II. (6th Dynasty) to briug back a pigmy alive aud
                        in good heath, from the la d of great trees away to the south.” “That the
                        Danga came from the south we know from a later inscription at Karnak, and
                        that the word meant dwarf is dear from the accompanying determinative of a
                        short person of stunted growth” (“Man, Past and Present,” page 118).
                        Professor Maspero says that the determinative shows that a dwarf and not a
                        pigmy is meant; but we cannot have a race of dwarfs; nor again, if! this
                        Danga was so highly estimated, plaoed </p>

                    <p>) I A 4 U f 'among the dwarfs,” and remembered for nearly 1 century, it
                        could not have been an ordinary lfarf. Dwarfs are so common in every
                        population, and certainly riot less so 4n Egypt, that one is inolined to the
                        opinion that these remarks cannot apply to a mere dwarf but to a real
                        pigmy.) It is > not at all unlikely that the same determinative, derived
                        from the commonest form -of small person—a partial dwarf of distorted
                        form—may have been applied indiscriminately to- all kinds,, of.dwarfa and
                        pigmies. Otherwise it is impossible to explain the reference to a “tribe” of
                        Dangas. But Pro: fossor Maspero makes the. farther and more
                        serious.objection that .the time allowed for all these early Egyptian
                        expeditions to obtain “dwarfs”: or “pigmies,” whichever it may have been,
                        was not nearly sufficient to permit them thi reach to land where pigmies are
                        now found. He estimates that the time oocupied in these journeys would not
                        have permitted them to have gone further- south than Suakin or thereabouts,
                        it this is so the territory occupied by the pigmiesjnust have extended much
                        farther north than it does at present, or, as the only other alternative,
                        Sehiaparelli’s account of the Dangas is meaningless In a very circumstantial
                        and marvellously accurate aocount of a journey to the Jland of the dwarfs
                        given by Herodotus, the actual dwarf land is described as being on the banks
                        of a river flowing from west to east. The pre sident of our sooiety* Mr.
                        QrW^.tells me that the only region with geographical features snob Herodotus
                        describes is that near the Sobat, whioh is the only important river flowing
                        from west to east in this region. If the province oi thepigmies was as far .
                        extended from theii present domain as the Sobat River in the time of
                        Herodotus, it is quite possible that in the remote period of the time of the
                        5th dynaaty, it may have reaohed so far north as to have come within the
                        range of the expeditions tc which I have referred. Although the mattei is
                        still very obscure it seems to me that the balance of evidence strongly
                        inclines to the oonclusion that true pigmies came to Egypl quite early at
                        the dawn of the historic period. In the temple of Queen Hataqu at Deir el
                        Bahan there is a pictorial representation of an expedition to the mysterious
                        southern land it which the celebrated picture of the so-called “Princess of
                        Punt” occurs. She is %, short, un-haplly^teatopygous woman, whose rolls of
                        fat %re grossly caricatured. It is impossible tc draw any certain conclusion
                        from this picture as to the exact physical characters of the woman, but the
                        form of her body, the absence of the conventional mode of representing
                        dwarfiihnes8, and her place of origin, will tend to strengthen the belief
                        that real pigmies, exhibiting a tendency to steatopygia, came tc Egypt in
                        these early times from the southern lauds. Professor Kollman of Basle would
                        have us believe that Afrioan pigmies made their way ^ prehistoric times as
                        lar north as the shores of the Mediterranean, and even crossed into Europe
                        with the taller peoples to leave theii ibones in the neolithic graves of
                        Switzerland and Saruthern Europe. But I have frequently found among
                        normal-sized Egyptians’ remains of all ages, numerous diminutive bodies of
                        the same (Egyptian) type, many of them no bigger than the ordinary pigmy.
                        Suoh dwarfed individuals ocour in all raoes, and their presence cannot be
                        regarded as evidence of the existence of the true Negritoes either in Egypt
                        or Europe lin former times, because the physical features of thele small
                        individuals are not those of the Central African pigmies. Everybody has
                        heard of the pigmies of Homer, Aristotle, Herodotus, Ctesias, Pliny,
                        Pomponios Melo, and othei Greek and Latin classical writers. If we are still
                        hestitating before deciding whether the early Egyptian scribes were
                        acquainted with the trne pigmies, there, is no room for suoh doubts in the
                        case of several of these early European writers. If Homer’s fables of the
                        Cranes and pigmies are not very oonvincing, there is the definite statement
                        of Eraatosthanes, a philosopher who lived in the third centary before the
                        Christian era—“The Cranes migrate as far as the lakes beyond Egypt where the
                        Nile has its souroe* There dwell the pigmies. This is no fable : it is the
                        simple truth” (Lady , Amherst’s “Sketch of. Egyptian History”). The combats
                        between the Cranes and the pigmies, were a frequent theme of the Later
                        classical writers and are often depicted on Greek vases. Sir Wm. Flower
                        .describes one of these piotures “from a vase in the Hope oolleotion at
                        Deepdene in whioh the pigmies are shown as dwarfish looking men, with large
                        heads, negro-features, and close woolly or frizzly hair.” Aristotle places
                        the pigmies in Africa near the sources of the Nile. Sir William Flower jays
                        that the account given by Herodotus [Book II. 32, Rawlin’s translation, p.
                        47) is so sircumstantial and obviously true that it is worth quoting in
                        foil:— “I did hear, indeed, what I will now relate, from certain natives of
                        Oyrene. .Once upon a time, they said, they were on a visit to the oraoular
                        shrine of Ammon, when it ch^ao^that, in the oourse of conversation with
                        Etearohus, the Ammonian King, the talk fell upon the Nile, how that its
                        sources were unknown to all men ! Etrearohus, npon this, mentioned that some
                        Nasmonians had once some to his court and, when a3ked if they jould give any
                        information concerning the uninhabited parts of Libya, had told me the
                        [oliowing tale:— They said there had grown up among them certain wild young

                        indulged in all manner of Bxtravagancies, and among other things drew lots
                        for five of their number to go and explore She desert parts of Libya and try
                        if they could penetrate further than any had previously lone. The young man,

                        upon the desert, which they proceded to cross in a direction from eastco
                        west. After journeying for many days over a wide extent of sand, they came
                        at last to a plain, where they observed trees growing ; approaching them,
                        and seeing fruit on them, they proceeded to gather it While they were thus
                        engaged, there oame upon them some dwarfish men under’the middle height, who
                        seized them and carried them off. The Nasmonians could not understand a word
                        of their language, nor had they any acquaintance with the language of the
                        Nasmonians. They were led across extensive marshes, and finally C4>m§' to a
                        town, where all the men were of the height “Of their conductors, and blaok
                        oomplexioned. A great river flowed by the town, runningt from west to east
                        and oontaiping crocodiled. As I have already mentioned, Mr. Craig, wlio is
                        familiar with the Upper Nile region, tells me that the Sobat River exaotly
                        fits this description. As to the identity of the people with the. pigmies
                        there oanbe, I think, no doobt whatever. The first reoprd of the existence
                        of pigmies in modern times is oontained m “The Strange Adventures of Andrew
                        Battell of Leigh in Essex,” sent by the Portugal’s prisoner to Angola, who
                        lived there, and in the adjoining regions nearly eighteen years (1589-1607),
                        published in “Purchas his PilgrimeS1’ (1625) :— “To the^orth east of Maui
                        Kesook are a kind oflittip people called Marimbas, whioh are no bigger than
                        Boyes of twelve yews old, but very thioke, and live only upon flesh whioh
                        they kill in the woods with their bows and dafta.” And in a work by Dapper
                        on Lower Ethiopia, published in 1686, a race of dwarfs, whioh he oalled
                        Bakke-bakke, is described. This is probably the group of Akka dwarfs whioh
                        Schweinfurth rediscovered almost two centuries later. Little attention was
                        paid to these accounts, which were largely discounted at the time as
                        sensational travellers’ tales, and in the succeeding century critical acumen
                        and .the Wider knowledge of the world’s fauna led writers to “explain away”
                        these stories of pigmies as merely .highly-coloured acoounts of various apes
                        and monkeys. But from the year 1861 onwards trayellere in various parts of
                        Equatorial Africa began once more to record accounts which they had heard of
                        diminutive races of people. Dr. Tonchard (1861) and Admiral Fleuriot de
                        Langle (1868) recorded the rapid extinction of a pigmy race in the Gaboon.
                        M. du Chaillu (1867) gave an acootint of pigmies which he saw iu
                        Ashango-land, between the Gaboon and Congo rivers. But perhaps attention was
                        first rivetted on the existence ol pigmies in modern times by Stanley’s
                        narrative of his journey near the great bead of the Congo, where he heard of
                        the pigmy raoes of Watwas. (“Through the Dark Continent”). In 1887 Dr.
                        Wolff’ gave an account of these Watwas people : he said that they were “Oi
                        lighter colour than the Negroes and never exceed 1.40 metres (4ft. 7ins.)
                        high, but their average height is not more than 1.30 metres (4ft.
                        3ins.).”^Sir Wm. Flower). The moat noteworthy recent work on the . pigmy
                        people is the late Sir Wm. Flower’s memoir on two Akka skeletons sent to the
                        British Museum in 1887 by Emin Pasha, and the valuable account of the
                        pigmies given in Sir Harry Johnstou’s “Uganda Protectorate,” which also
                        contains a full aooount of the skeleton of a Bambute pigmy by Dr. F.
                        Shrubsall. This brief summary (whioh is taken to a large extent from the
                        writings of Professor Sohweinfurth and,Sir William Flower) mentions only the
                        chief landmarks in the history of our fluctuating knowledge of these little
                        people. To have given a mere list of tbe titles of the memoirs whioh have
                        been written on this subject would have taken np more time than I am allowed
                        for my whole disoourse. Whole treatises, such as that of de Quatre- fages,
                        have been devoted wholly to the dis- cussion of the literature. I need no;
                        spend any more time in discussing the geographical distribution of pigmy
                        races, except to remind you that Equatorial Africa is not the only habitat
                        of these diminutive people. There are pigmy race* in- the Malay Peninsula,
                        the Pbillipine Islands, ifc. Java ^and New Guinea, whioh preeemt a
                        relationship to the eastern branch > f the Negro race analogous to that of
                        thq. Congo pigmies to the African negroes. Midway between the East Asiatic
                        and the African groups there is a. race of pigmies in the Andaman Islands.
                        The Veddahs of Ceylon and the pigmy races of India fall into another group,
                        for they do not possess those peculiarly distinctive features which have led
                        to the inolusion of all other pigmies in one group called Negritoes. In
                        Africa there are two (or perhaps it is more correct to say three) pigmy
                        races. There is the peculiar group of bushmen in South Africa, the
                        Hottentot—a blend of Bushmen and Bandu-speaking negroes,—and finally in
                        Equatorial Africa extending three degrees north and south of the equator,
                        containing the pigmy tribe to which the people we are studying belong. Xhqy
                        are p^bably the smallest existing race of human beings. I need not spend
                        muoh time in,describing their physic characteristics, because the lantern
                        slides aud photographs which you have seen have all theso features plain. I
                        would especially call attention to the great projection of the jaws ; the
                        excessive flattening of the nose whioh is carried to such an extent that the
                        lateral wings are sometimes fully as large as the central part; the vertical
                        bulging (bombd) forehead; and the peppercorn arrangement of the short,
                        olosely ourled hair. All these features are oharacteristio of negpes, but in
                        the pigmies they are all carried Jo an extreme degree—are in fact
                        ultranegroidp. The ohooo-late brown oolour of their skin if lighter than
                        that of many negroes, but, as thiie six indivi- ' duals demonstrate, there
                        is a considerable range of variation in ooloar. I think that far too muon
                        has been made of the '* difference in </p>

                        Hamitic ox Semitic blood, are exactly the same colour as these six
                        individuals, and it it were not for their small stature they unite realily
                        pass as pure negroes. The colour difference has been unduly emphasised as
                        the result of the hasty comparisons ipstituted by many writer* between tins
                        yellow skinned bushmen and the pigmies. There are in fact many strikii 0
                        point! ol resemblance. Both races are obviously related to the truo' negroes
                        ; both are of short stature have e.xceptionally flat noses, vertical
                        forcheadi and “peppercorn” hair. In many structural details there is a close
                        similarity between the two races. One of the main objections whicfc some
                        writers have raised against this view if the fact that steatopygia, which is
                        suoh ^ strikingly bizarre an i characteristic feature ol the bushwomen, is
                        not found in the pigmj women. There has been great oonfliot of opi nion on
                        this subject. Many writers have cate gorically stated that steatopygia never

                        Mankind”) admit that il may ocour. The younger of the two women in Qol.
                        Harrison’s party exhibits this feature quite distinctly. There is apparently
                        a distinci colour difference between the bushmen and the pigmies,'yet from

                        transition from the dee{ chooolate brown tint of most pigmies to the fellow
                        of the bushman. Apart from the differ ences in colour and size, there

                        disoussion of this diffioult problem : but a study of the data at our
                        disposal seems to point clearly to the fact that the bushmen anc the
                        negrillo are the diversely specialised remnants of a primitive negro-stbek
                        which al one time inhabited the greater part of Africa, from which they were
                        driven by their biggei brothers and took refuge—the bushmen in the desert
                        lands of South-West Africa and th( pigmies in the dense forests of Equatoria
                        Africa. It seems probable that the true negrc element has been considerably
                        strengthened ir the pigmies by intermixture with the surround ing tribes.
                        One of the four males—the biggesl of the four—has a much more pronouncec
                        negro likeness than the others and one of the woman presents a facial type
                        totally unlike the others in most respects—a face suggestive rather of the
                        type so common in Abyssinia where the Hamitic element enters largely intc
                        the constitution of the people. It is probable therefore that we have to
                        deal with a race by bo means pure, but extremely intermixed with
                        isurrounding peoples. It is commonly supposed that the pigmy jpeople are
                        much more ape-like than most other human beings, but there is little real
                        evidence jin support of this supposition. The lips of the Jtypidal pigmy
                        present a striking resemblance to those of the anthropoid apes. This is espe
                        cially marked whilst drinking: the lips are thee pouted irk a trumpet
                        like-manner, just as in the chimpanzee. The lips are not “fleshy” and
                        everted as in the true nej§ro, but markedly elongated and thin. The ears are
                        relatively sis small and. often as well moulded as those oi a European. The
                        pendant part of the ear,which anatomists call the lobule, is absent in the
                        apes and is very small in two of the six pigmies. Much has been written
                        about the hairy covering of the body in pigmies but, with the possible
                        exoeption of the boy of the party, who has perhaps a rather abundant downy
                        oovering, these pigmies have no more trace of a “Simian ooat” than the
                        average European. The separation of the great toe from the others is no more
                        marked than it is in most negroes, and the power of grasping with their toes
                        is no greater than that of the fellah or other native who habitually goes
                        barefooted. The head, which is shorter than that of most negroes, is also
                        proportionately small. Apart from the skeleton no observations have ever
                        been published regarding the internal structure of the body. About frwo
                        years ago there came to the Anatomical DepHrtm6iit of the School of
                        Medioine, the bodies of two very‘ 8mall blaok women (otie was 1.436 metres
                        in height, the other a few millimetres less) of unknown prbvendnoe; they
                        presented none of the mutilations winch the bodies of most Sudanese woman
                        present and the proportions of their limbs and bones, the form of their
                        heads and faces, were those of pigmies. Th^y were exceptionally rich m
                        structural peculiaritieis of a retrograde type, suoh as are quite rare in
                        ordinary human beings. Their brains were exbeptiohally small: the old womanv
                        (about 4(7 years) had a brain of only 850 grammes, and the ydunger woman’s
                        (22 years) brain was 920 grammes. The average weight of an Egyptian woman’s
                        brain is 1,180 and the European woman’s is perhaps more' than 100 grammes
                        heavier A gorillas brain may weigh more than 50 grammes and the so-called
                        intermediate liu! betwa# man and the apes—the fossil Pitbe cantlfroyus, had
                        a brain of the Sima aizj a the elder of these two women. These figures,
                        although undoubtedly ol groat significance, aflb somewhat discounted by the
                        fiact that, other things baing equ d, a small person has a smaller brain
                        than -« large individual. Apart from their size tb m brains were no more
                        simian than the ordin .rj negro's. To sum up, tSe pigmy peop'e 0 Equatorial
                        Africa are in most respects a ray of ultranegroid type, which i3 in mo3t
                        respect: no more ape-like than the ordinary negro. A BOX-AtAKEtt’a CURE.

                    <head>CAIRO MODEL WORKSHOPS. (From our Oaiko Correspondent).</head>
                    <p>On Saturday last I paid a visit to the Cairo Model Workshops which are
                        situated in Boulac, and owing to the courtesy of Johnson i'ttsha 1 was able
                        to examine the excellent work which is being carried ont here under his:
                        direction. It appeared to me that a want which has long been telt by the
                        residents in Egypt is .ore being supplied, for the yonng native undergoes in
                        these works a most careful : raining in many branches of workmanship and
                        cannot tail to become an expert and . thorough workinau in whichever of
                        these branches his taste or adaptability may decide him to adopt. It is an
                        almost everyday complaint in Eg^pt that ordinary work as done by the native,
                        such as joinery, iron-work, saddlery, decoration, and such-like, *is done in
                        a slip-shod manner by men who do not understand the rudiments of the work
                        which they are undertaking, and that, as long as the work is completed with
                        apparently good results, the durability is of but little account; ami such
                        complaints are certainly not ground-le^.-Tbe method of teaching, however,
                        which is adopted in the Model Workshops, puts aside all possibility of the
                        work done by any of their pupils being anything but thorough, tur the tirst
                        principle which is here inculcated iuto the minds of the young workman is
                        that he must thoroughly understand the most minute details of the work upon
                        which heJs engaged. There is no elaborate system of lectures, the worst form
                        of teaching a young mind the theory upon which practice is based ; a piece
                        of work is set before a boy and as he carries it oat the practical utility
                        of each step is carefully demonstrated to him. Practice is not taught by
                        theory, but theory is illustrated by practice. The engineering department is
                        perhaps the best example to take of the thoroughness with which the work is
                        done, as being that in whioh the greatest care must be paid to details and
                        in which accuracy and a minute knowledge of the various steps which are to
                        be gone through arc essential. Models are set before the pupil of various
                        portions ol machinery for him to draw, and alter be has succeeded in making
                        an accurate drawing of these parts he then has to draw them in transverse,
                        vertical, horizontal, obiijue, and every other form of section, and it cau
                        readily be understood that this cannot be (tone unless the subject has been
                        most thoroughly mastered, it was quite a revelation to me to see vlith what
                        accuracy these drawings were made, and the excellent plans of various
                        complicated pieces of machinery which had oeen drawn by these boys* in the
                        department where decoration is taught i marvelled, too, at the designs which
                        boys of tweive and thirteen years of age were able to reproduce faultlessly,
                        and was glad to see that they are being taught to use their right and left
                        hand alike in the making of these drawings. In this department 1 saw various
                        designs for wall-decoration which had been painted by the boys and others,
                        in the course of completion, both in Oriental and European styles, and
                        stencilling, too, formed a part of their education. Furniture of every
                        description abounded in the shops where woodwork is taught, and was such as
                        to make me envious to possess much cf it. The fancy work done in
                        brass.silver, and oop-per was excellent, and though done by youths of tender
                        age no fault could be found with either the workmanship or the design. The
                        commoner objects of practical utility, such as water-cans, pails, etc.,
                        appeared to be of a a st durable kind,and I also saw both a lady’s and
                        gentleman’s bicycle which had been made by these pupils, and which would
                        compare favorably with those turned oat by well-known firms. 1 must not omit
                        to mention the saddlery department, where the work which is done can be
                        relied upon to the same extent as that done by the other departments, or to
                        the foundry, which has recently been added, and which, though only a small
                        one, has proved of great advantage to the pupil-engineers. In conclusion,
                        let me say that these work-shi -pB are not only worth a visit to see the
                        work which is being tarried out in them, but that they are deserving of
                        being encouraged by the public purchasing the various articles which they
                        turn-out and in which the purchaser will not be disappointed. Lord Cromer,
                        in referring to these workshops, says In 19U4, the expenditure amounted to
                        L.E. 8,200. The receipts—including L.E. 1,000 due for work in course of
                        progress, but not yet paid for -amounted to L.E, 3,500. There can be no
                        objection tO' the workshop executing private orders, provided the prioes
                        charged are ' t such as to compete unfairly with the various trades, fiut it
                        is essential that, in framing the organisation, the commercial should not be
                        allowed to predominate over the industrial side of the system. So long as
                        the Government grant was only just sufficient to maintain the workshop,
                        there was a manifest ri>k that this danger would he incurred. The Government
                        grant has been increased by about L.E. 1,300. The workshop will only, in
                        case o necessity, re draw its receipts from the Trea feury. It cannot be too
                        clearly urtierstood thai the main object which the Government seek* to
                        attain, in creating this and similar institutions, is not to make money, but
                        to afford such instruction as will enable the pupils to become hkiiled
                        artisans, and to gain their livelihood in after life. Another point of
                        importance calls for some remarks. The basis of the system of instruc tion
                        inaugurated at the workshop is that, the education of artisans, practice
                        should be allowed to predominate over theory. Daring the first year of
                        attendance, there was no di$oalty in enforcing this principle , the work
                    </p>

                <div type="item">
                    <p>of the-pupils had, of necessity, to be mainly manual Even if they had
                        understood theory, they would not have been in a position to apply it. But
                        in 1904, when the institution entered upon the second year of its existence,
                        an active demand appears to have arisen amongst the pupils themselves for
                        more theoretical, and less practical, teaching. This was manifested more
                        particularly amongst those who were engaged in metal work, which consists
                        largely m making the component parts of engines. It is true that every
                        moderately competent fitter in Egypt is likely to fiud himself, sooner or
                        later, in charge of an engine of some sort, for the supply of engine hands
                        in the country cannot, for a long time to come, keep pace with the demand.
                        But Johnson Pasha very truly remarks : “As the raison d'etre of the
                        workshops is to create artisans, properly so called, and not engineers, it
                        is absolutely necessary to refrain from much theoretical instruction until a
                        considerable degree of manual skill has been attained.” This institution has
                        to contend with a difficulty which is generally encountered in this country
                        whenever professional or technical instruction is afforded. Directly the
                        pupils have acquired a sufficient amount of skill or knowledge to enable
                        them to gain ever so small a wage, they are incliued to abandon the course
                        of instruction. “There has been some necessity,” Johnson Pasha writes, "to
                        put pressure on parents and guardians to insure regular attendance ; boys
                        supposed to be sick have been found to be earning wages outside.” Mohamed
                        Suleiman Pasha, owing to whose liberality and publio spirit an industrial
                        school had been established at Abou-Tig, has drawn attention to the same
                        difficulty as that encountered ^y Johnson Pasha at Cairo : the boys will not
                        stay long enough at the school to acquire thorough profioienoy in their
                        various crafts. Johnson Pasha, however, says that the tendency to abandon
                        the course of training prematurely, “diminishes as the boys grow older, and
                        come gradually to appreciate the value of the training they receive." Both
                        Mohamed Suleiman Pasha and Johnson Pasha have suggested that, in order to
                        check this tendency, it might be as well to exempt from military service
                        those boys who receive a satisfactory certificate after having completed the
                        whole course of training. The Recruiting Law will probably have to be recast
                        before long. When this is done it would appear that this suggestion is well
                        worthy of consideration. SPOUT AND PL\Y. ALEXANDRIA.SPOTTING CLUB. THIRD

                    <p>The faot that the thinking has to be done by individuals leads, in the oase
                        of all Parliaments, to the existenoe of a number of persons called
                        Ministers, who either do the thinking or.get it done for them by other
                        individuals of greater intelligence (writes Sir Martin Cbnway in the
                        “Nineteenth Century”). The offioial thinkers, meeting together, form the
                        Cabinet or Council of Ministers, or whatever it may be called. Every crowd
                        has to have suoh a council, as a olub or sooiety has to have an executive
                        committee. Now, if this council does not exceed in number the maximum which
                        can meet round a table, each person present having the opportunity to speak
                        in a conversational manner whilst all can hear, it will fulfil its purpose
                        as a orowd-brain ; but if the numbers exceed that limit your exeoutive
                        committee or cabinet will forthwith in turn become a orowd incapable of
                        deliberation, and itself dependent again upon some individual or individuals
                        to think for it This is exactly what has happened in reoent days with the
                        English Cabinet A century ago its numbers were small enough for the
                        individuality of each member to be maintained, and the personalities of each
                        and all of them to have effeot But now the Cabinet is so large that this is
                        no longer possible. It is a little crowd,,possessed, therefor^ ofaU
                        theorowd-characteriatics* chief amQqgstwhich is, the desire for power and an
                        instinctive hostility to all other orowds. Fundamentally, the Cabinet is
                        hostile to the House of Commons. It continuously strives, and with sucoees,
                        to appropriate to itself the powers whioh properly belong to the House of
                        Commons. It supplants the House of Commons as a deliberative assembly; it
                        has praotioally taken away from it the power of refusing supplies, or of
                        debating whatever subjects it pleases; in fact in the course of a oentury,
                        it has wrought an absolute revolution in our whole constitutional system.
                        Nothing but the phrases remain—the facts are all changed. HELLENISM IN
                        EGYPT. The . Greek element is very strong in the oommeroe or Egypt, as we
                        have already observed, but it is not perhaps generally recognised that it is
                        the Greeks who carry on the retail trade of the Nile Valley, and who
                        penetrate even to the smallest villages. They sell articles of food whioh
                        oome from abroad, and really do a great deal toward# helping to civilise the
                        Sudanese tribes. After the battle of Omdurman Greek traders followed in the
                        track of Krtohener’s army/ and spread to El Obekl and into Kordofan, where
                        they found and reported traoes of many of the victims who were massacred
                        when Mr. Gladstone handed over the Upper Nile to barbarism. They have
                        crossed Afrioa from Lake Albert Nyanza to the Zambesi and the Congo; but
                        what is most remarkable about tjkttae men is that they can turn their handj
                        to kny-thing, and become agriculturists or hotelkeepers with equal facility
                        in the straigest plaoes, if they see their profit The Government of Egypt
                        has acknowledged the service the Greek traders are doing as pioneers in
                        opening up the oountry, and, for their |>art, the Greeks recognise that they
                        owe everything to the Government, which, by restoring peace and law, has
                        made it possible for trade and commerce to be carried on in the interior of
                        Africa. It will be as well to keep an eye on these wandering traders, £>r
                        their knowledge of what is going on in the most distant places should be of
                        service in ascertaining the actual trend of native thought among the
                        Sudanese.^-(From “The Globe.”) </p>

                    <p>JEU DE BOUK.SE ET SPECULATION La dame Cavafy avait actionn^ Petrooc-kinos en
                        paiement de £ 210 en vertu de deux reconnaissances, dont Petrocokinos ne
                        con-teatait pas la'signature, mais qn’il refuaait de payer boos pretexts quo
                        oette dette provenaif de pertea subies en sp^culant k la Bourse et qo’etant
                        simple employe de 8 livres par moiB et n’ayant pas d’autre ressource
                        personnelle, il s’agissait d’un jeu prohibit p4r la loi. Le tribunal en a
                        juge differemment et prononce qu’en l’espoce il ue s’agissait pas d’un
                        simple jeu ou pari sur lea fluctuations dea cours, mais d’une operation
                        sdrieuse, comme il rdaulte de la coi-reapondance echangtSe entre parties.
                        l’etrocokinoa ay ant fait appel de cejuge* ment, la Cour dans son audience
                        de ce matin conirme purement et simplement la sentence des premiers jugea.
                        Lea principaux motifs invoqofe par la Cour sont qu’aucune disposition de la
                        loi egyptienne n’anaalle les marches and terme. Pour que de tela marches
                        puiasent tit re annuls, il faut qu’il y ait eu des manoeuvres doloaives de
                        la part du courtier; ce qui n’est pas le cas en l’esp£ce. L’Affaire de la
                        Cie du Canal de Suez Nous lisons -dans les dcrniers joumaux de Paris: “ M.
                        Charles de Lessepa a ete entendu, bier, par M. le juge Leydet. II s’eat
                        plaint d’avoir ete, depuis trop longtemps, en butte aux menaces de M. Paulin
                        Sylvan, avocat au Cairo, qui en veut k 8a vie. “ M. PanHn Sylvan continue n
                        pr5tendre que la premiere liste des fondateurs de la Compagnie du Canal de
                        Suez a ete modifide et que des noma ont ete supprim^s. De ce fait, plusieurs
                        personnes auraient ete lda^ea dans lenrs interfits. L’avocat du Caire avait
                        envoys, dans ce sens, k la Chambre des deputes, une petition qui a 616
                        rejetee. “ M. de Lesseps a apporte au magistrat inatructeur des documents
                        pour rdduire k ndant les assertions de son trop vindicatif adversaire.” M.
                        Paulin Sylvan eat connu au Cairo ou il 86 trouvait il y a quatre ana avant
                        de rentrer k Paris. On lui doit m§me plusiers articles 8ur la Compagnie du

                    <p>Paris, May 81., The sun shines brightly to-day, and rude Boreas to loDger
                        rages through the streets. The Parisian, alwayB a shivery creature,
                        re-;.»ices at the thought that summer has reestablished itself. The Bois is
                        in its most enchanting mood, full of vernal splendours, uni the chestnut and
                        the plane in the avenues A the city are decked with fairest green. You may
                        count it as the snpremest moment of the .season, these weeks before the
                        Grand Prix. There is nothing palpitating in the papers : Hie real life of
                        Lutetia transpires in regions, ^reached by the reporter—in the salons of
                        t;u) Champs Elys^es and in the Avenue du Bois and in the clubs and open-air
                        meeting-{ilacea of society. Everywhere is activity of a juiet sort.
                        Yesterday a most hearty welcome was accorded to the King of 8pain in Paris.
                        The chivalry and hospitality which are inherent iu the French—and more
                        especially in the 1 Frisian—character made a oordial reception for lviDg
                        Alfonso XIII. a foregone conclusion. The news of RodjestvenBky’s defeat has
                        produced great depression. For weeks past the journals have been adopting an
                        optimistic t.-ne , they haJl recovered their spirits, and endeavoured to
                        make their readers believe that this time the Russian fleet would really do
                        successful. The peoplfe with whom I discussed the matter at first expressed
                        incredulity, and, finally, when that position was no longer tenable,
                        exhibited a certain amount of ill humour—the first time that I have noticed
                        this symptom in discussing the war—showing that they wore hard hit in their
                        sympathies. The reflections of France at this moment are not particularly
                        happy. She has put her money on the wrong horse, and now she realises it. In
                        private and public comments on the defeat, to-night, I notice one dominant
                        note ; that the war is all over—bar the indemnity. That, perhaps, is
                        presuming too much—the wish is father to the thought—but the evening press I
                        early regards the verdict of the Korean Strain as the final appeal. “Why go
                        on fighting," they say in a chorus, when there is nothing to gain, except a
                        vast expenditure or human life and treasure ?” Nor must it be assumed that
                        this call for peace is purely interested, purely a question of the solid
                        millions of francs which have come OMt of the French “has de laine.” This
                        people are not strangers to the humanitarian spirit, and they would look
                        with horror on any repetition of the bloody scenes of Liao-yang and Mukden.
                        The Cimetifcre Israelite, where Baron Alphonse de Rothschild was buried, is
                        one of the most curious parts of the great necropolis built on the gardens
                        once owned by the Jesuit Pire Lachaise, confessor of Louis XIV. Besides the
                        tombs of the Rothschilds, it contains those of the Egyptian family of the
                        Foulds, the Singers, and of Rachel, the actress. Quite close to the Jewish
                        graves is theAvenueCasimir-Perier,with the mausoleum of Abelard and Heloisa.
                        The tomb of the Rothschilds is marked by a small construction like a chapel,
                        on the inner wall of which is the portrait of Baron James de Rothschild, and
                        the photograph of the bed in which his jfife died. r It was incredible that
                        France should think seriously of suppressing all its decorations, including
                        that of the Legion of Honor. Envious tongues have spoken lightly of that
                        little piece of ribbon in the button-hole of every seoond Frenchman. They
                        have asserted that its frequency destroyed its value, and that to be without
                        it was the greater distinction. But that is to take a wrong view altogether.
                        To the holder it was not only an innocent joy, but a real testimony, not too
                        dazzlingly exalted, to his standing. It was almost comparable to the title
                        of Esquire, as against the plain Mr. of the undecorated. Such distinctions
                        may be purely relative, but, especially in a republican oountry, they are
                        fondly treasured. So it is a matter for congratulation that the oommittee of
                        the Chamber, which had at first favored the abolitionary measure, has
                        substituted forit a proviso of stricter examination for future candidates.
                        Though the actual construction of the Panama Canal has fallen to American
                        hands, French genius still supplies the motive power. The plan adopted is
                        that thought out by the brain of De Lesseps, and the methods for its
                        realisation are equally French. The working processes are those of a French
                        engineer, and they have within the past few days been explained in detail
                        before the French Academy of Sciences. A look canal would take four years to
                        construct, and a uniform level oanal fifteen. On the recommendation of M.
                        Bunau-Varilla, it has been decided to build the lock canaj, and then to
                        transform it into one of a uniform level, without interrupting the regular
                        navigation. In sewerage systems, British engineers have something to teach
                        to the French. For 12 years, now, the City Fathers of the French capital
                        have meditated a great scheme of sewage purification, and a sum of £4*0,000
                        has long been earmarked for the purpose.Paris experts favor the double
                        system of septio fosses and bacterial beds, and a visit to the beds treated
                        on these two systems by Dr. Calmetti, of the Lille Pasteur Institute,
                        strengthened their favorable impressions. It is only after the observations
                        of a travelling commission to the sewer outfills for London, Birmingham,
                        Leeds, and Manches- </p>

                    <p>er, that the Paris Municipality has definitely made up its mind. The septic
                        fosses and the bacterial bods hold the field. A local newspaper relates an
                        amazing story which most* people will probably regard rather as an example
                        of the ben trovato than of striot fact Acoording to the story, an automobile
                        proceeding from Mantes to Rosny met a herd of fifty horses being led to a
                        neighbouring fair, and stopped so as not to cause a stampede.But the horses
                        seem to have instinctively recognised the rival of their species, and
                        without more ado set on the machine in a body, kioking it to pieces. The
                        chauffeur was with difficulty got out of the metee uninjured. The "Gaulois”
                        has carried out its referendum among playgoers. In thirteen of the principal
                        Paris theatres voting papers were distributed containing three questions,
                        upon which each member of the audience was requested to record an opinion.
                        The questions asked were as follows :— (1) At what hour should the
                        performance begin I (2) At what hour should it finish I (3) Should the
                        entr’actes be suppressed or reduced in length I If the latter, to what
                        length of time ? The process of examining the results of the poll was begun
                        last evening at the offioes of the " Gaulois, ” in the presence of a number
                        of dramatic authors, critios, and theatrical managers, and late last night
                        4,750 voting papers had been classified. 'Two thousand four hundred and
                        nineteen votes were cast in favor of nine o’clock as the hour for the
                        curtain to rise, 995 persons favoured 8.30, and 784 eight o’clock. As to the
                        hour at which the performance should end, opinions seemed to be less
                        decided. One thousand^eight hundred and thirty-one votes were given for
                        half-past eleven, 907 for 11.45, 744 for eleven o’clook, 639 for 11.15, and
                        620 for midnight. A ten minute entr’acte found 2,256 supporters, whilst
                        1,039 voters considered five minutes sufficient, and 412 people did not mind
                        waiting fifteen minutes. Giving evidenoe in a case in which a Paris
                        pastry-cook was sued by twenty-five persons who had been made ill by eating
                        some of his cream tarts, Professor Metchnikoff, of the Pasteur Institute,
                        said that eggs may be poisonous before they are laid. The whites may oontain
                        disease-breeding microbes. These, when heated, survive in a vegetating state
                        up to 60 deg. Centigrade or 140 deg. Fahrenheit. Consequently a raw or even
                        partly-cooked egg, however fresh, may always be poisonous owing to the
                        possible presence of lively bacilli in the white, and contained therein from
                        the very beginning. EGYPTIAN MINES. A correspondent writes from London,
                        under dateMay 29:—Throughout the present period of dulneas and depression
                        the comparative firmness of Egyptians has been somewhat overlooked.
                        Certainly at the outset share values broke rather sharply, but this was only
                        to be expected. All mining descriptions have been involved idf the general
                        volume of liquidation in progress of late. Since, however, the bull account
                        in Egyptians has been closed, the market, though quiet, has kept remarkably
                        steady. With prioes in most cases almost at bed-rock, there is, ip fact, no
                        earthly reason for a further depreciation On the contrary, I look to see a
                        smart recovery when oonditions warrant it While the present public apathy
                        continues it would be futile, of course, to accord strong support to any
                        market, but sooner or later the sentiment will change, and then those on the
                        look-out for an attractive gamble would do well to keep their eyes
                        "Mummies.” Personally, 1 should be disposed to buy now, and so get in before
                        the rush. GREAT BRITAIN AND NAVAL COMPETITORS. The naval expenditure of the
                        great Powers is compared in a return made last week. In 1890 that of Great
                        Britain was £17,042,182 ; France, £8,125,929; Russia, £4,268,208; Germany,
                        £3,938,869; Japan, £1,142,452 ; and America, £4,627,203. By 1901 the
                        expenditure of the other Powers (with the exception of France) had
                        proportionately increased much more than that of Great Britain, whioh was
                        £33,726,491; France being* £13,107,701; Russia, £11,659,766; Germany,
                        £9,624,956; Japan, £3,711,526 ; and America, £16,012,438. For last year the
                        figures wereBritain, £40,327,850; France, £12,513,413 (the only oountry
                        showing a decrease since 1901); Ru^ sia, £12,072,381 ; Germany, £10,567,342;
                        and1 America, £20,180,310. France, Russia, and Germany together spent last
                        year £35,152,866, against Britain’s £40,325,850. These figures, however,
                        represent estimated expenditure in the case of foreign oountries,
                        information as to actual expenditure not being available. His Majesty’s
                        armoured cruiser Bacchante has returned to Chatham Dockyard from an
                        unsuccessful machinery trial in the North Seas. </p>

                    <p>London May 27. Lieutenunt-Colonel R.C C. Cox, Royal Innis-killing Fusiliers,
                        will embark on the 29th inst. for Egypt to take up the command of the 2nd
                        Battalion at Cairo. It is stated that the Kaiser is contemplating the
                        sending of a Squadron to Barcelona by way of a set-off to the recent visit
                        of the British Squadron. Lord Charles Beresford, K.C.B., will hoist his
                        vice-admiral’s flag at Malta on the 4th of JiAe as Commander-in-chief of the
                        Mediterranean Station. Brevet-Colonel S.C.H. Munro, Seaforth Highlanders,
                        has vacated the command of the 1st Battalion in India to take a Staff billet
                        He was appointed to the command when the battalion was in Egypt and will be
                        suooeeded by Brevet Colonel G. Mackintosh of the 2nd Battalion at Aldershot
                        It has been decided to reduce the Royal Field Artillery by one battery and
                        the 151st Battery of the 50th Brigade at Bulford will be the one reduced.
                        Its plaoe in the brigade will be taken by the 56th Battery, whioh recently
                        returned home from Egypt. The personnel of the 15lBt will be absorbed by it.
                        No steps as yet have been taken in oonneo-tion with the reported
                        contemplated increase of the King’s Royal Rifle Corps and the Rifle Brigade.
                        The gallant “Green Jackets” are so popular that little difficulty would be
                        experienced in increasing their strength. An order for the construction of
                        thirty 13. pounder guns for the Royal Horse Artillery batteries, and
                        ninety-six 18-pounders for the Royal Field Artillery batteries has just been
                        placed at Woolwich with the Royal Gun Fao-tory. A number of these guns are
                        for batteries in South Africa and India. The 18-pounder is a most powerful
                        weapon, and certainly no Continental army ha^ got anything like it. It is
                        the direot outcome of Buller’s repulse at Colanso, where our 15-pounders
                        were outranged and outoUssed by the Boer guns. The most prominent features
                        about the gun are the quick-firing arrangements. The gun tube is not
                        attached to the carriage but is suspended from the “buffer chamber” by
                        calliper grips, which permit it to travel back and forward about four feet
                        The recoil is taken up by powerful steel Bprings in the chamber and when it
                        is expended they run the tube forward again into the firing position without
                        disturbing the "lay." The forward thrust is eased off by hydraulic cushions.
                        All No. I. has to do is to keep the sights on the mark. The Immense
                        advantage of this is apparent as under the old oonditions the gun had to be
                        relaid and traversed after every shot. The 18-pounder has a calibre of 3.3
                        inches and it throws a projectile weighing 18jlbs. up to an effective range
                        of 10,000 yards with an initial velocity of 1,610 feet per second. The
                        grooves are 18 in number and of uniform twist and the breech mechanism is of
                        the “swinging block” pattern. The gun and carriage weigh 23cwt. 3qrs. 4lbs.,
                        the carriage limber with 24 rounds of ammunition, 14cwt 3qra. 3lbs., making
                        a total of over 38jcwt behind the traces, exclusive of the gunners. The
                        wagon and its limber hold 78 rounds of ammunition, thus each gun goes into
                        aotion with 100 rounds, whioh would last a very short time as it fires 20
                        rounds per minute. To remedy this the number of wagons is to be increased so
                        as to give each gun 170 rounds. Each battery of six guns will be manned by
                        5offioers and 220 non-commissioned officers, gunners and drivers. The R.H.A.
                        gun is almost identical in construction. It has a calibre of 3 inches, its
                        projectile weights 18}lbs. and has an initial velocity of 1,658 feet per
                        second, and the lame number of rounds are brought into action. The gun and
                        carriage weigh 18owt. 12lbs. and the limber 12owt., making a total of 36owt.
                        behind the hones, and the wagon and its limber filled weigh very nearly
                        SOowt I am authoritatively informed, with reference to the statement that
                        eight officers are to be prooeeded against in connection with the alleged
                        destraotion of stores in South Africa, that the action whioh will be taken
                        on the report of Sir William Butler’s oommittee has not yet been decided
                        upon. The report is now under the consideration of the Secretary of State
                        for War an^his advisers. Ifr is understood that the oommittee has found that
                        serious wastage of stores took place, and that the position of certain
                        offioere is forming the subject of inquiry, at the instance of the War
                        Office authorities. In view of the reoent discussion on the employment of
                        Reservists it is of the first importanfie to learn why some of our Civil
                        Departments are. still so backward in taking them. Naturally, little blame
                        can attach where there is a small and rarely changing staff; the ohief
                        offenders are the General Poet Office, the Custom House authorities, and the
                        various police forces in town and oountry. These last offer many plausible
                        excuses. Leaving aside the pettier motives of exercising their own
                        patronage, they emphasise their wish to raise their own people ; to take
                        them young and train them to their'work when most adaptable, and not when
                        they have hardened into other grooves and must have something to unlearn.
                        Here we have to balanoe the best interests of the department as viewed by
                        its ohiefe, as •gainst the larger national needs of stimulating enlistment
                        Beyond all question recruits hang baok because they see little hope,of a
                        livelihood when they leave the oolors, and if this oould be guaranteed there
                        would be no uncertainty as to the future of our voluntary system. Another
                        and a more unfair objection is raised by the polioe. They very generally
                        hold that the ex-soldier makes a very poor 0011a table, declaring that he
                        has been brought up on too seven lines, that he is too unyielding and lacks
                        the even temper and patient consideration whioh are, no doubt, very
                        reoognisable qualities in our polioe. Even if defects of this kind oould be
                        proved to exist, they are certainly not deepseated and might surely be
                        corrected with a little care. The Military Correspondent of the "Times”
                        leaves no room for doubt as to his views on the controversy that has arisen
                        between Lord Kitchener and the Military Department of the Government of
                        India. The existing system of military administration, he declares, involves
                        dual responsibility and oontrol, things in their very essenoe antagonistic
                        to and destructive of harmonious or effeotive working, and he solemnly
                        asserts that "unless it is promptly changed we shall infallibly oondemn our
                        arms to ignomimous disaster at the first touoh of serious war.” This
                        oonolusion is led up to by two and a half oolumns of well-eeleoted
                        statements of fot and much ably reasoned argument, and it must be admitted
                        that the writer presents a case against the continoanoe of the office of
                        Military Member of the Viceroy's Council which it will be found diffioult to
                        answer. What solution of the question the Departmental Committee, whioh has
                        now concluded its labours, and of which Mr. Brodrick was a member, has
                        arrived at is at present a secret, though we have some ooufidenoe in
                        anticipating that a majority oftts members are in favor of going a long way
                        in the direction, indicated by Lord Kitohener. It is due to him to say that
                        his scheme did not oontemplate unlimited financial oontrol for the
                        Commander-in Chief, at whioh many oritios reasonably jibbed, or any
                        impairment of the Vioe-roy’s authority in matters military. Surely, in a
                        question of such vital importance to our grept Dependency, it is powible to
                        reach firm grou ’ upon whioh the provision for its defenoe may made in the
                        soundest and most comprehens shape. AQABiB INTERNATIONAL INDUBTRIEB AND
