                        and he willingly leaves others to judge how far he has accomplished the
                        second. He speaks with the scorn winch it merits of the allegation that,
                        while the material prosperity of Egypt has been developed, her moral and*
                        intellectual advance-ment has been neglected. He points to what has been

                        period of fierce agitation, they (the Egyptian people) are inclined to
                        believe that Lord Cromer fell owing to want of support in England, and to
                        believe also that the same fate awaits his successor. That being so, it is
                        most important that not only the Government, bnt the whole of the British
                        nation, should through some visible and public act show their continued
                        confidence in Lord Cromer, and therefore in the policy which his successor
                        is authorised by the British Government to maintain. It is not for us to
                        suggest the method by which this most important fact should be emphasised,
                        but we have little doubt that when the proper moment comes the King, acting,
                        as he so often has acted before, as the representative of national feeling
                        in its widest sense, will find the proper method of showing Egypt and the
                        world how utterly ridiculous is the notion that Lord Cromer had lost the
                        confidence of his Sovereign, of the Government, or of the British people. No

                        this direction, but we venture to think that in addition to this some action
                        of what we might call a more dramatic or spectacular kind, such as a public
                        demonstration of welcome to Lord Cromer on his return home, is required.</p>

                    <p>“MODERATE” REFORMERS’ DISAVOWAL.</p>
                    <p>In a letter to the “Times” on the Egyptian Nationalist movement, Mr. H. R.
                        Fox Bourne, secretary of the Aborigines Protection Society, says :—</p>
                    <p>Allow me to point out to your readers that the main body of Egyptian
                        reformers, w hose principal organs are “El Moayad” and “El Minbar”, are not
                        in harmony with the reckless policy of Mustapha Kamel Pasha and his
                        followers, whose organs are “El Lewa” and its English and French
                        reproductions, the “Egyptian Standard” and the “Etendard Egyptien.” They
                        aim, not at an overthrow of British control over Egypt, but at a gradual and
                        statesmanlike development of internal self-government on the equitable lines
                        started by Lord Dufferin and by the Organic Law of 1883, and repeatedly
                        recommended and supported both by Mr. Gladstone’s and Lord Salisbury’s
                        Governments. They recognize the splendid services rendered by Lord Cromer in
                        promoting the material resources of Egypt, and the consequent improvement in
                        many directions of the social condition of the people ; but they claim that
                        the time has arrived for serious effort to be made towards solving what Sir
                        Eldon Gorst, Lord Cromer’s successor, admits in his supplementary chapter to
                        Lord Milner’s “England in Egypt,” to be “a problem of much greater
                        complexity” ; and of which Sir Eldon says “The solution will be found rather
                        in the development of the instincts of the people in the direction of local
                        self-government than in the introduction of European institutions unsuited
                        to the genius of the Oriental character."</p>

                    <head>THE KHARGA OASIS</head>
                    <p>AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS</p>
                    <p>The following information is taken from the weekly reports Agricultural
                        operations in the Oasis of Kharga are proceeding satisfactorily. Wheat and
                        barley crops are now all reaped. The general average of the crops being
                        satisfactory especially considering that most are on second year lands. The
                        yield from one plot of 5 feddans of first cultivation was 40 ardebs or 8
                        ardebs to the feddan. The cotton crop is looking well, and the plants have
                        had a first thinning.</p>
                    <p>The flow of the wells has increased since December last by an average of
                        about 20 gallons per well per minute for the larger number of wells bored,
                        all running simultaneously. This increase is probably due to greater economy
                        in shutting down wells when not actually required for irrigation. The areas
                        for rice and melon cultivation during the summer are now ready, and sowing
                        is in progress. Some plots of melons well up. </p>
                    <p>Arrangements are in progress for the transport and sale of the coming date
                        crop Remunerative contracts for the supply of stone in the Farshut district
                        have been secured. These will materially diminish the cost of such cutting
                        as has been necessary on the plateau.</p>

                    <head>ALEXANDRIA SPORTING CLUB-</head>
                    <p>SECOND SUMMER MEETING.</p>
                    <p>Although the attendance was not so large as that of Monday, the second day’s
                        racing of the Second Summer Meeting attracted a fair number on Saturday
                        afternoon. Excellent weather prevailed and this combined with the
                        fashionable gathering and interesting sport made one of the most enjoyable
                        afternoons we have spent at the Sporting Club. In some measure this may be
                        due to the exceptionally exciting result of the last race, but it is not
                        usual to take the last first, and other races being worthy of mention we
                        will take them in the order of running.</p>
                    <p>The May Selling Race brought out five runners, Sadik being favorite, and the
                        judgment was not misplaced as it easily disposed of Moofid and Mizzaud. Only
                        four horses went to the post for the Lord of Rosna Handicap amongst them the
                        consistent and victorious Carlton. His top weight of 10 stone 7 did not stop
                        him, and</p>
                    <p>his fourth consecutive race on this course this season. Digby tried hard with
                        Aurelius but the effort was useless and could only finish a good second.
                        Carlton we understand is being sent to England shortly. Stillwell shone in
                        the next three races and performed the “hat trick” by winning each, his
                        mounts being Ragueh, Fadaan, and El Tahawi. As we have already mentioned the
                        surprise of the day was the May Handicap for which a field of nine runners
                        turned out. Nadim was fancied and made favorite. All got away well and the
                        excitement did not commence until entering the straight when Dounghan and
                        Ghazi separating themselves from the rest, with Nadim joining them, made a
                        neck and neck race. Shouts went up for Nadim, and Stillwell tried hard to
                        add his fourth victory, but Jenkins was not to be beaten, just getting
                        Doughan home by a very narrow margin. Even then so close was the result that
                        until the numbers went up it was generally accepted that Nadim bad won.</p>
                    <p>To add to the surprise of the win the pari mutuel paid out what we believe to
                        be the record price of P.T. 1416 or over L.E. 14 to the dollar.</p>
                    <p>Referring to the Pari Mutuel reminds ns of what seems to be a matter of
                        general complaint viz :—the difficulty in the first place of being attended
                        to in the scramble to make a bet, and secondly the extraordinary length of
                        time it is necessary to wait before winnings can be drawn after a race, in
                        some instances not until the next race is being or has been run. We realise
                        the task of making the necessary check and calculations must be a huge one
                        but surely the delay is detrimental to their own interests as one cannot be
                        waiting at the windows, and betting on the next race at the same time, to
                        say nothing of the inconvenience in perhaps having to miss the following
                        race, and we think some method of improvement could be made in this
                        direction, even in increasing their staff.</p>

                        communications by subsidies. He would also, if he could, make the Suez Canal
                        free, so as to prevent all obstacles to development. New Zealand would be
                        prepared to take its part in providing the sum required. What he suggested
                        might not be immediately feasible, but deserved consideration.</p>
