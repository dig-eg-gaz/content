                    <p>WEDNESDAY APRIL 26, 1905.</p>
                    <p>STAGGING IN EGYPT.</p>
                    <p>Recent events in connection with company promoting might lead the man in the
                        street to suppose that of the million pounds of cash recently paid into the
                        Anglo-Egyptian Bank in Alexandria and Cairo to cover the applications for
                        the ten million shares in the last flotation, there will shortly be some
                        £300,000 available for investment elsewhere. In our opinion this is absurd,
                        for it toast not be supposed that all this application money is money
                        awaiting investment. It is to a great extent money borrowed, money
                        temporarily withdrawn from other uses, or money scraped together somehow in
                        order to snatch the premium on every share allotted. The premium quoted in
                        the market on recent flotations for some days before the subscription list
                        was opened was in a great measure the secret of the enormous number of
                        applications. People thought they conld be immediately selling their
                        allotments, and would at once secure a handsome profit on the money
                        successfally deposited for a few days. Neither the question of the soundness
                        of the business nor the desirability of the investment ever enters the heads
                        of these stags. The rush was to a great extent one of premium-hunters and
                        not of investors, and we would suggest to those who may be arguing among
                        themselves that if more companies similar to those recently floated are
                        offered to the public they will meet with as good a welcome, is not by any
                        means a certainty.</p>
                    <p>The stag has always been a puzzle to issuing houses in every financial
                        centre, and no satisfactory means has as yet been discovered of eliminating
                        him. The issuing capitalists do not desire to eliminate the stags among
                        their friends, but they do desire to eliminate the stranger stag. For a time
                        it was customary in London to make allotments as freely as possible to small
                        applicants, and the stag, seeing this, split his big application into small
                        sums. Then the issuing house took to disregarding the small applicant
                        altogether, much to the disappointment of the stag, who abandoned his
                        trickery. Seeing that most of the last Japanese loan was issued once again
                        to small applicants, the stag at home must find some difficulty in knowing
                        how to effectively apply, while the issuing house is put to some trouble in
                        dodging him. There is, however, a new way, made in Germany. In connection
                        with the important new Imperial loan, an arrangement is made by which those
                        who do not desire to sell their allotments for six months pay 101 10 pet
                        cent, while those who desire to sell before that must pay 101 20 per oent
                        The arrangement not only givee the real investor an advantage over the mere
                        stag, but it also enables the issuing house to discriminate between the two
                        classes of applicants. Perhaps some day we shall adopt the system for
                        Egyptian flotations.</p>

                        <head>Happiness in the Harem</head>
                        <p>Discontented women, according to an American girl quoted here, should at
                            once join a harem. "I" can assure my American sisters," she is reported
                            to-say, "that they can dream of no greater bliss than to enter a rich nd
                            well-bred Eastern gentleman's harem." Sue has tried the life herself,
                            and is happy as the day is long since she became one of the wives of a
                            potentate, described as Nasruilah Khan, "In a harem," she
                            continues,"life glides softly, like a sweet, peaceful dream. Each wife
                            has her servants. Our slaves obey our least sign of command, and they
                            can never leave us. We can punish their least fault hy cutting off their
                            heads, or, at any rate, having them flogged." This sounds alluring,
                            indeed. Finally, it appears that bad temper, sceces, jealousies,
                            bickerings, are unknown in a harem, and the lord and master is
                            unflaggingly attentive, and never grumbles. The lady urges all American
                            girls to find a harem instantly, and apply for a berth therein, if they
                            want to know perfect bliss, ("Daily Telegraph's" Paris

                        force on May 1:—</p>

                    <p>ALEXANDRIA LINE.</p>
                    <p>The train de luxe between Alexandria and Cairo and vice versa at noon has
                        been abolished.</p>
                    <p>The afternoon express will leave Cairo at 6.35 p.m. (instead of 4.45 p.m.)
                        and the corresponding train from Alexandria at 6 p.m. (instead of 4.25) and
                        a restaurant car will be attached to each.</p>
                    <p>The 4.15 p.m. train from Cairo and the 3.46 p.m. train from Alexandria will
                        be considered as express trains and will stop at a few stations (see time
                        table).</p>
                    <p>The 3.10 p.m. mixed train from Cairo and the 2.10 p.m. mixed train from
                        Alexandria will be proiouged, the first as far as Cairo and the other as far
                        as Alexandria, to pick up and set down express train passengers. The 10 a.m.
                        mixed train from Alexandria has been changed to 10.50 a.m. owing to the
                        suppression off the train de luxe.</p>

                    <p>BARRAGE LINE.</p>
                    <p>All the trains have been extended to Cairo, consequently the train which used
                        to leave the Barrage for Calioub at 7.22 has been altered so as to leave at
                        6.22 p.m., arriving in Cairo at 6.55 p.m., and the train which used to leave
                        Calioub at 8 p.m. for the Barrage has been altered so as to leave Cairo at
                        7.30 direct for the Barrage, and the train leaving the Barrage at 2.55 p.m.
                        will leave at 2.15 p.m.</p>

                    <p>TEH EL BAROUD LINK</p>
                    <p>So as to improve the service on this line, two new trains have been added,
                        one leaving Teh el Baroud at 6.15 a.m. and the other leaving Cairo at 6 p.m.
                        The present afternoon service has therefore been modified as follows. The
                        3.30, p.m. train from Cairo will hence forth leave at 1.45, p.m. and the
                        5.10 p.m. train from Teh el Baroud 5 minutes later.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Weir, in the House of Commons, having asked on what grounds the
                        facilities for coaling and revictualing afforded to the Russian fleet during
                        its recent passage through the Suez Canal were withheld from the Spanish
                        fleet under similar circumstances in 1898, Lord Percy stated that the
                        circumstances of the two cases were entirely different in the receut case of
                        the Russian squadron, cool was allowed because the vessels were entitled
                        under Rule 3 of the Canal regulations now in force to an amount sufficient
                        to take them to the nearest port where they could obtain the supplies
                        necessary for the coutinuation of their voyage, —and the amount which they
                        had on board was not sufficient. In 1898 Admiral Camara might have claimed
                        under the general principles of international law coal sufficient to enable
                        him to reach the nearest Spanish port or some nearer neutral destination,
                        but for the fact that the Spanish warships had already enough for that
                        purpose, and further supplies were, therefore, refused on that ground.</p>
                    <p>There is a vast discrepancy between the letter of the Judicial Adviser to the

                    <head>ST. MARK'S CHURCH. JUBILEE COMMEMORATION.</head>
                    <p>Yesterday, the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Consecration of
                        St. Mark’s Church commenced with a celebration of the holy communion at 8
                        a.m. At 11a.m. morning prayer was said by the assistant chaplains and an
                        address was given by the Rev. F. B. N. Norman Lee (S. C. F.). At 5 p.m. for
                        evensong the chapel was filled to overflowing. Among those present were
                        H.B.M.'s Consul General at Alexandria, Rear-Admiral Sir R. Masie Blomfield,
                        K.C.M.G., Lady Blomfieid, and Judge and Miss Batcheller.</p>
                    <p>At 5.30 p.m., before a representative company, the unveiling and dedication
                        of the handsome and beautifully executed memorial tablet commemuratiug the
                        jubilee took place. The ceremony began with the singing of the hymn for St.
                        Mark’s Day. The Consul Geueral, Mr. E.B. Gould, I.S.O., than unveiled the
                        tablet at the request of the officers of the church. The Chaplain afterwards
                        dedicated the tablet, and read some appropriate prayers specially compiled
                        for the occasion. A photograph was then taken of the compauy by a local firm
                        of photographers.</p>
                    <p>At 5.45 p.m. the rendering of Gaul’s sacred cantata, "The HolyCity," began.
                        The church was crowded and the chairs from the chapel were removed into the
                        church to give further sitting accommodation. At the end of the first part a
                        collection was made by four of the sidesmen of the Church and amounted to
                        P.T. 810. This sum will cover all expenses incurred by the purchase of
                        music, etc.</p>
                    <p>The Chaplain closed with the Benediction. Then ended the jubilee
                        commemoration, which will long be remembered by all who were present.</p>
                    <p>The dimensions of the brass tablet are 26:40 inches. The block of dark marble
                        in which it is mounted measures 35:50 inches. Immediately above this block
                        of marble, and resting upon it, is an arched piece of marble, affixed to
                        which is a brass bearing upon it the figure of the Winged Lion of St. Mark
                        with an opened book of the Gospel.</p>
                    <p>The inscription on the tablet, which was executed hy Joseph La Macchia, gives
                        the date of the foundation of the chaplaincy, the laying of the foundation
                        stone, and the consecration, besides a list of the Anglican bishops who have
                        been consecrated to the see, and the chaplains of St. Mark's sinoe its

                    <head>REMISIERS AT ALEXANDRIA.</head>
                    <p>The following note to Lord Cromer's article in his Report on "Gambling in
                        Futures," will arouse considerable local interest: —</p>
                    <p>M. Vercamer, the very able Belgian judge on the Mixed Court of Appeal, who
                        has studied this subject with special care, has drawn attention to the harm
                        which results from the employment of a number of “remisiers” or "half
                        commission men" by the brokers at Alexandria. This view is confirmed by many
                        other excellent authorities. This system affords an easy means to gain, for
                        a time, considerable incomes by half commission broking. At first
                        good-natured people pass business to the new comer, and he makes large
                        brokerages. Then come fewer orders, and he has to speculate to maintain his
                        income. The principal reason these "remisiers" flourish is the abnormally
                        high brokerage of 1/2 per cenk on the value of the transactions paid at
                        Alexandria, as against 1/4 per cenk, which is the customary rate at most
                        Exchanges. If the brokerage were limited to 1/4 per cent there would not be
                        a sufficient margin to permit of the brokers paying so highly for the
                        servioes of “remisiers."</p>

                    <p>The following is the report of the directors of the above company, which is
                        to be submitted to the shareholders at the eighteenth ordinary meeting which
                        will be held at the company's offices, 134, Palmerston House,
                        Bishopsgate-street, London, RC., on Friday, 28th inst.—</p>
                    <p>The total sales of land, including those of previous years, are as follows
                        3,420 19/24 feddans sold for cash, £47,665.3.6; 14.476 5/24 feddans on
                        deferred payments, £446,310.19.2, Less discount on ditto
                        £5,617.18.7—440,693.0.7, making 17,897 feddans, at £488,358 4.1. During the
                        year ending 81st December, 1904, 2,723 feddans wore sold on deferred
                        payments for £123,882. Of this area his Highness the Khedive purchased a
                        further 510 feddans and he now owns a fine estate of 2,800 feddans of
                        Aboukir lands, as an adjunct to his favorite residential palace at Montazah.
                        Other sales were made to Europeans of 1,369 feddans, in hods of 300 to 500
                        feddans, for £57,900. About 900 feddans were also sold to natives, of which
                        800 realised about £60 per feddan, and the remainder about £45. These sales
                        included all the land let or fit to be let, but the company will receive a
                        proportion of the rents up to the dates the sales were made. The arrears of
                        instalments due by purchasers on the 31st December amounted to £17,140, of
                        which £4,675 has since been paid. After long negotiation the Government
                        consented to the construction of the new syphon and head sluice referred to
                        in the last report, and the work is now being proceeded with as rapidly as
                        possible. The value of the unsold land will be materially increased by the
                        large expenditure involved.</p>
                    <p>Mandara Division.— Pending completion of the syphon, no new land was taken in
                        hand for canalisation. About 4,000 feddans were in various stages of
                        reclamation, and, of this area 2,600 feddans were sold during the year. Two
                        staff houses, of which one was sold with the land, have been built with the
                        necessary offices, stables, and servants’ houses. The construction of staff
                        houses has greatly facilitated sales of land and the company has at
                        different times built ten, of which seven have been sold with the land. The
                        tramway through the centre of the division has been a great boon; without
                        it, the rapid development of the land would not have been possible.</p>
                    <p>Bahari Division.— Reclamation in this division has been retarded by the
                        uneven state of the land, which required a great amount of levelling, but
                        the position has now improved and more rapid progress will be made.</p>
                    <p>Wastani Division.—There are about 5,000 feddans in this division, and it is
                        expected that at least 1,000 feddans will be canalised this year. A new
                        staff house and some esbehs will be built, and the tramway will be extended
                        along the bank of the new canal for a distance of about two miles to the
                        Mahmoudieh Canal.</p>
                    <p>Cattle —In compensation for the cattle lost by the compvny in 1903, referred
                        to in the last report, the Government have ceded a long a narrow piece of
                        land containing abont 665 feddans along Aboukir Bay. In January there was
                        another outbreak of cattle plague and the company lost abont a dozen cattle;
                        later on malaria and foot and mouth disease caused sickness and some deaths,
                        but the plague has now almost disappeared from Egypt. The young stock has
                        done very well, and will more than compensate for losses by death and old
                        age.</p>
                    <p>Work and responsibility having greatly increased during the year, as
                        evidenced by the large sales of land and the heavy expenditure, Mr. Richmond
                        has been appointed sub-manager, a position well earned by his continued good
                        work and application for over six years with the company. Of the original
                        30,000 feddans possessed by the company, only about 12,000 now remain
                        unsold, and the directors have felt that it would be a pity not to utilise
                        the valuable experience acquired in land reclamation. They have, therefore,
                        in conjunction with two other Egyptian land companies, acquired a valuable
                        property in the province of Gharbteh of 1,677 feddans, with the intention of
                        extending reclamation to adjoining areas when opportunity presents itself.
                        From the accounts presented the profit and loss account shows a credit
                        balance of £23,048. 17s. lOd., which, added to £3,780. 17a, brought forward
                        from the preceding year, makes £25,829. 14. lOd. The arrears of dividend due
                        to the Ordinary shares to 31st December, 1903, amounting to £9,057. 14s.
                        2d., or 10a lOfd. per share, srero paid in January, 1905, and it is now
                        proposed to pay dividends for the post year of 7 per cent. on both the
                        Ordinary and Deferred shares which swill amount to £11,769. 2s, leaving
                        £6,002. 18s. 8d. to be carried forward.</p>

                        have been sold by the landlord, M. Laurens, to a native capitalist of Cairo
                        for £24,000 All the expenses and costs of the transfer are to be borne by
                        the purchaser. The block embraces a site of 1,882 square pics and includes

                        and Meimarachi; and the offices of the “Egyptian Gazette.” The reason for
                        the sale was that M. Laurens finds his present premises too small for the
                        cigarette business and he intends building a large cigarette factory in the

                        the Rev. E. J. Hardy, M. A., chaplain to the forces, have been granted leave

                    <p>QUINTANA-PRIOR.</p>
                    <p>The marriage of Mr. William H. Quintana, third son of Mr. J. Quintana, late
                        British Consul and Eastern Telegraph Superintendent at Chio, Turkey, to Miss
                        Mary Louisa Prior, only daughter of the late Commander R. T. Prior, took
                        place at St. Catherine's Cathedral, Alexandria, on Monday last at 2 p.m. The
                        bride, who was given away by her brother, wore a handsome gown of white
                        satin trimmed with mousseline de soie and real lice. Her court train was of
                        satin and mousseline de soie, and her wreath of orange blossoms was arranged
                        over her long embroidered tulle veil. The bridegroom was supported by Mr. F.
                        R. Acheson, as best man. The principal bridesmaid was Miss Mabel Lamb, who
                        looked very pretty in a beautiful robe of pale pink chiffon silk. She wore a
                        white chiffon hat trimmed with white ostrich plumes and ospreys and carried
                        a bouquet of pink and white roes. The two little bridesmaids who acted as
                        train-bearers were the Misses Lily and May Ablitt. They both looked very
                        sweet in white accordian-pleated silk frocks, and white picture hats of
                        chiffon. The bride’s mother looked charming in a mauve silk gown and mauve
                        hat to match, and carried a lovely bouquet of red and white roses.</p>
                    <p>After the ceremony at the church the guests were invited to a reception held
                        by Mrs. Prior at the New Khedivial Hotel. The newly-married couple left
                        shortly after 4 o’clock for the Beau-Rivage Hotel, Ramleh, where they are
                        staying until their departure for Liverpool to-day by the 8.8.

                            is readvised that they must go, and that before long. My first feeling
                            on reading the portion of Lord Cromer’s report devoted to the question,
                            was one of disappointment at the somewhat tame and colourless nature of
                            his lord-ship’s remarks on-a matter on which it is well known that be
                            holds very decided opinions. There are, however, many considerations
                            which may have influenced him and induced him to practically invite an
                            expression of public opinion before taking any decided course of action.
                            For one thing, considering that at the present time we have in England a
                            Ministry in power that nobody trusts, and which is impervious to blow
                            after blow from British constituencies; a Ministry that will apparently
                            submit to every possible humiliation, rather than give the offices to
                            which they cling like barnacles on a ship's sides, impeding all attempts
                            at progress; and that possibly this state of things may continue to
                            exist until the Blue Book on Egypt in 1905 is published,— taking this
                            alone into account one can well understand that many reasons may have
                            suggested themselves for the postponement serious action. But the
                            Capitulations have to go, and the sooner the fact is realised, and
                            arrangements are made for the substitution of some system more in
                            accordance with decency and morality, the better.</p>
                        <p>It does not seem to me that the solution is far to seek. Foreigners are
                            content to live in England and to abide by the laws, of the country, or
                            be judged by them if they transgress them. Surely if laws were framed in
                            Egypt by which a foreigner transgressing them could be tried here, with
                            the same guarantees for justice being administered as are given in
                            England, no one would object to live in the country under them. No such
                            question is that of arbitrary arrest could arise if the habeas corpus
                            act wee introduced, and it ought not to require by any means an
                            elaborate system of jurisprudence to cover the ground required, and to
                            give full consideration to the just requirements of foreigners in
                            Egypt.</p>
                        <p>Undoubtedly such an arrangement would tend to give us a still firmer
                            footing in Egypt, and why not? If we are to stay in Egypt and to make
                            our influence felt for good, why not boldly accept responsibility for
                            the good government of the country, and see that that government makes
                            for, righteousness and not iniquity, purity and not vice! At present we
                            are shirking our plain duty and only doing things, by halves. It is
                            because I cannot help seeing that we cannot leave our task unfinished,
                            and anyone with half an eye can see that with our withdrawl from the
                            couutry things would quickly slip back into chaos, -that I would urge
                            that we should be thorough in our action. The small and noisy clique who
                            would have England become the owner of, instead of the trustee for,
                            Egypt might possibly acclaim the establishment of British administered
                            laws as a step towards that end, but it need be no more than a step in
                            the direction of helping the Egyptian people to understand the
                            principles of self government, and in preparing the way for that
                            realisation of the national hopes which it should be our every desire to
                            foster. Whether we have any right to be here at all is another question.
                            We are here, and having assumed great responsibilities, we have to see
                            the thing through, and faithfully to fulfil our trust. I see no reason
                            why, as Egypt progresses and her police and military forces become more
                            efficient the British Army of Occupation should not be reduced until it
                            merely remains of the strength necessary for State functions and other
                            'show' purposes.</p>
                        <p>I hope that few people will take the line of your correspondent "Judaeus
                            Appella,” whose letter appears in to-day's “Gazette.” The spirit in
                            which it is written is just the very one which has brought Egypt, to its
                            present position, and made the ceuturies of mis-government from which
                            she has suffered, possible.</p>
                        <p>But I think the writer is right in drawing attention to the vagueness of
                            Lord Cromer's suggestion, as to “the creation of some local machinery
                            which would take a part in the enactment of the laws applicable to
                            Europeans.” Local machinery for administering the laws I could
                            understand, but for their enactment!!! Criminal law should be the same
                            thing at Assiout as at Alexandria, at Cairo as at Suez "Common sense,"
                            whose letter appears in the same paper, simply looks on the surface
                            instead of beneath it. Because Cairo is free from the Piccadilly scenes
                            which disgrace London, be seems to think that it compares favorably with
                            the English Capital. There was nothing hysterical about Mr. Sims'
                            letter. I myself have watched the crowds that nightly pour into a
                            notorious quarter of Cairo. I have seen the terrible sights to be
                            witnessed there, and the utter moral degradation that is only too
                            plainly visible. And I say deliberately that the sight is a disgrace to
                            the Egyptian Capital, and the British influence that is powerless to
                            prevent its continuance. If, as alleged, and as I fully believe, the
                            Capitulations stand in the way of the cleansing of the foul plague spots
                            of the cities of Egypt, the utmost support should be given to those who
                            would clear these obstructions to good government in Egypt out of the
                            way, and give a healthier tone to the morality of the country than that
                            which now prevails.—I am, etc.,</p>

                        <p>To The Editor of The Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                        <p>Sir,—As a traveller interested in the progress of this country, I hope
                            you will allow me by means of your valuable paper to make known my
                            hearty appreciation of the views of your correspondent "T.A.” on the
                            subject of drunkenness, and of that, I understand, is now being done in
                            the way of suppression of two of the most prominent causes of moral
                            degradation in Egypt, viz., the import of hasheesh and of white slaves,
                            which, it is gratifying to learn, do not in any way contribute to the
                            revenue of this country.</p>
                        <p>I am told that, as regards the former, a simple prohibition having proved
                            ineffectual, in consequence of the temptations of bak sheesh offered to
                            the Coastguard by smugglers proving too great, the Egyptian Government
                            decided, very wisely, some twenty years ego, to enter into competition
                            with them by offering a higher rate of baksheesh to the Coastguard
                            sailors, to be derived from the public sale and expatriation of half the
                            quantity of hasheesh seized, the other half being destroyed. This
                            measure not proving as efficient as was expected, in consequence of the
                            expatriated half finding no other market than Egypt, it was, not long
                            ago, decided to destroy all the seized hasheesh, and to supply the
                            baksheesh from the Government treasury at an annual cost of about
                            -£4,000. This wise and liberal action has, I am told, produced the
                            desired result, recent statistics having shown that the terrible form of
                            vice known as “hasheesh smoking" has been practically eliminated from
                            the country, whilst the prohibited article itself is no longer to be
                            found in the native shops and cafes, which, formerly, made a large
                            profit from its surreptitious sale at a high price.</p>
                        <p>As a consequence of this success I understand that it is the intention of
                            the Egyptian Governemnt to endeavour to extend the good and useful work
                            of the Coastguard, by entrusting it with the suppression of the still
                            more terrible “White Slave Trade” import, in connection with which an
                            International Comission has, quite recently, been instituted at
                            Alexandria, and that, with this object the Water Police Service of that
                            port, as a tentative measure, has been transferred to the above
                            department by the Ministry of Finance.</p>
                        <p>This is as it should be, and it may be reasonably expected that future
                            statistics will show, by a diminution of “entant trouves,” that this
                            measure has been as substantial as the other. But, it is evident, that,
                            in fairness, the competition with regard to Government baksheesh should
                            be, when applied to the white slave smugglers, followed by a
                            corresponding increase in the annual grant to the Coastguard for the
                            additional service. I would go even furtner, and suggest that the
                            Government grant ahould be extended to the police service of the
                            Interior for successful seizures at slave procurers and procuresses, an
                            especially large baksheesh being awaraod to tne capturer of the white
                            Osman Digua.</p>
                        <p>I would, also, with a view to the ultimate entire suppression of the
                            “entant” in whose behalf the elite of society at Alexandria has been
                            during the last few days to humanely devoting both its energies and
                            pecuniary resources, venture to suggest that the W.S.T. Committee should
                            be urged, in your columns, to utilise the services of the intenor police
                            in an endeavour to trace the paternity of these unfortunate waits to its
                            source, and to bravely combat, as we have had to do at home, the vicious
                            propensities of the sex for which the white slave market alone
                            exists.</p>
                        <p>Might not, I ask, this important Commission be divided into two sections
                            with the above object, to be called, respectively, the “Virgin” and the
                            "Joseph"? the former being specially aided in its operations by the
                            Coastguard, and the latter by the police. This suggestion I venture to
                            put forth as a practical measure for the consideration of those who so
                            nobly interest themselves in the excellent work of the suppression of
                            drunkenness and vice in Egypt.-Your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p>To The Editor of The Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                        <p>Dear Sir,—In your issue of last Saturday’s the writer of “Under the
                            Mosquito Net,” after pointing out the regrettable fact that the
                            Capitulations were standing in the way, and seriously interfering with
                            the accomplishment of very urgently needed reforms, said: 'Everybody
                            knows this, but the question is, How long is it to remain a reproach
                            that under British influence Egypt is still a hot-bed of immorality and
                            vice, a morally plagne-stricken spot unmatched in any part of the
                            civilised world? Surely the time must soon come when we shall cease
                            calmly to look on and do nothing, while all the rascaldom of Europe
                            laughs in our face at the puny efforts we put forth to suppress their
                            villainous work"</p>
                        <p>This is, a rather a serious indictment. But one can never afford to let
                            the kindliness that is in one's heart soften the asperity that is in the
                            facts. Calling bad things by their right names, is the first step
                            towards getting rid of them. Indeed, it is a sad commentary on the
                            doings of so-called Capitulations and on British Occupation in
                            particular, and on our Christian civilisation in general, which suffer
                            such evils to go unchecked. While there can be no doubt that the British
                            Occupation has done and is still doing an immense amount of good under
                            the wise leadership of Lord Cromer, it cannot he said that it has done
                            its full share of duty, unless it is in a position to take full and
                            radical measures for the suppreesion of the vices complained of, and for
                            , the provention of money-making in drunkard making. It is hardly
                            necessary to say that the great problems of society are at the bottom
                            moral questions, and that duty is the cement which binds the whole moral
                            edifice together, without which all the fabric of existence crumbles
                            away from under our feet, and we find ourselves in a cedar swamp from
                            which we may never find our way out.</p>
                        <p>As we all know, there is a great difference both in the mental and moral
                            as well as in the physical stamina of men. Some can dodge raindrops and
                            find four-leaf clover on everybody’s lawn, while others stumble over
                            straws and cannot pick a rosebud without being pierced by a thorn. Man
                            is to a large extent a creature circumstances and environment. The men
                            and women who live on a purely animal plane and think of nothing but the
                            baser self, whose souls are in thraldom to their body, bound hand and
                            foot by animal appetites, cannot be elevated by argument, and most be
                            kept in a sphere where the conditions of brute existence will not
                            endanger more precious things. Hence the necessity for stringent laws on
                            one hand, and for other philanthropic forces,—forces which make for
                            righteousness,—on the other hand. One of the greatest evils of the
                            preseat day is the liquor traffic. It is estimated that it is
                            responsible for 35 per cent of idiocy, 45 per cent. of lunacy, 80 per
                            cent of crime, and 90 per cent of pauperism in America. And it is
                            considered that the most sucoesslul method of combating intemperance is
                            through legislation, education, and moral suasion.</p>
                        <p>An Institute for the moral, mental, and physical training of the Egyptian
                            youth, without distinction of race or creed, would be no doubt, like a
                            perennial fountain of sweet water in-the desert land. Let us have it by
                            all means. While the world is full of loose talk of the diituicUona of
                            blood ; while the man is judged not by his inward character but by the
                            colour of his skin, the shape of his nose, or the race from which he is
                            sprung, yet true philanthropy to-day gives the lie to all such outward
                            distinctions, and we are learning to recognise that after all, we all
                            are sons of the one, all-pervading “Father," and are our brother’s
                            keeper.—I am, etc. </p>

                            RIFLE SHOOTING. B.R.C. (ALEX.) v. TEAM FROM ROYAL BERKS. REGT. A very
                            close and interesting match between the above was shot last Saturday.
                            The totals of 10 scores on each side were 729 for the regimental team
                            and 718 for the club, but, on counting out the two lowest on each side,
                            as pre-arranged, the club remained the winners by 6 points. Weather
                            conditions were trying ; with a strong khamseen, the sky was overcast
                            and the atmosphere hazy, and during the latter part of the shooting an
                            irregular wind carried a yellow mist across the targets, which were, at
                            times, almost obliterated. B. R. C. (Alik.) 200 yds. 500 yds. 600 yds.
