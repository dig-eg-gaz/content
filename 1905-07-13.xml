                    <head>SPORT AND THE NATIONS.</head>
                    <p>How cosmopolitan modern- sport is becoming ! The reflection is inevitable on
                        reading the home papers of last week. Never surely was there a time when the
                        nations were so mingled in friendly rivalry, when so many international
                        contests were proceeding simultaneously. All the papers are full of it, so
                        full that we have almost been tempted to forget that other and grimmer kind
                        of "test match" which has been in progress in the Black Sea and in Eastern
                        Asia.</p>
                    <p>During the past week or two the representatives of different peoples have
                        been competing against one another in many ways. The champions of Great
                        Britain have been waging stubborn warfare with the best players<cb n="6"/>
                        of Australia on the tented field, in the finest of all games that man has
                        devised. It was a Homeric match, and if the brilliant play of the home side
                        did not give them the victory, they must feel, as Britons, proud of the bull
                        dog tenacity which enabled the Australians to stave off defeat. England,
                        too, has been at hard grips with another branch of the Anglo-Saxon race
                        elsewhere. At Wimbledon the Australian cracks were just beaten for the
                        doubles in the lawn-tennis tournament by the Englishmen, Smith and Riseley.
                        But the true champion in this contest is Miss Sutton, the young Californian
                        girl who has been giving our English ladies new ideas on the game.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps even more generally interesting was the duel between England and
                        America at Henley. The race between Leander and Vesper for the Grand
                        Challenge Cup was the event of the regatta. The hopes of Americans ran high,
                        as they did two years ago, when the Philadelphians entered for the cup, and
                        if the Vesper crew had succeeded in bringing back the trophy with them the
                        people of the United States would have been hard put to it to find adequate
                        expression for their enthusiasm. A fresh element of interest was added to
                        the contest on this occasion. The Belgian crew from Ghent proved
                        unexpectedly strong, and won their heat with exemplary ease, and there was
                        even an apprehension in the minds of some onlookers at one moment that
                        Leander, having disposed of the Americans, might themselves succumb to the
                        redoubtable Flemings. Beyond the Channel all the world was exciting itself
                        over the great motor race for the Gordon Bennett Cup, with England, France,
                        Germany, Austria, Italy, and the United States all represented. Motor racing
                        seems to us a foolish, dangerous, and useless pursuit, which ought to be
                        discouraged ; but international it assuredly is. Then on Monday began the
                        Bisley meeting, where our best shots will have to hold their own against the
                        picked riflemen from across the ocean.</p>
                    <p>Sport, then, it seems, is now a real bond between the nations. There is a
                        useful give and take, a pleasant interchange in these matters. A French
                        horse may win the Derby.</p>
                    <p>An English driver might have carried off the Gordon Bennett Cup. The
                        Americans have beaten us on the running ground, and we may be sure they will
                        try and try again at Henley until they defeat Leander, perhaps to find
                        themselves in their turn worsted by a crew from the Meuse or the Rhine. For
                        it seems that Continental athletes know how to row, just as they are even
                        learning to play cricket.</p>
                    <p>This is one of the incidental advantages of international sport. It not only
                        enables the nations to know one another, but it helps them to take the
                        advice of the Greek sage, and to know themselves. It knocks a little of the
                        conceit out of them. The time was when we thought that excellence in
                        athletic exercises was our own monopoly—the natural birthright of the
                        Briton. We should have laughed at the notion that a French man, a Belgian, a
                        German, could be a real sportsman, could equal us in a fair trial of
                        strength, courage, and nerve. We know better now. We know that our
                        superiority was mainly a matter of training and practice. The other peoples,
                        when they prepare themselves in the same fashion as ourselves, do very well.
                        We hold our own still, but we have to fight hard for first place against
                        foemen who have no natural inferiority. That, at any rate, ought to do
                        something to rub off national and racial prejudices. Sport is a fine
                        democratic leveller. It teaches the peoples to respect one another, since it
                        shows that the sportsman may come from any country which take the trouble to
                        teach him rightly, and give him fitting encouragement for the development of
                        his powers.</p>

                    <p>Interesting as the announcement is that the Olympic games of Greece are to be
                        revived, one rather hesitates to extend all unrestrained welcome to the
                        project until its details take more definite shape. The attempts that have
                        hitherto been made to imitate the historic meeting have turned out decidedly
                        second-class affairs. It is a difficult task that the organisers have before
                        them. To strike the elusive thread on success, the revival must neither be
                        too painstakingly archaic nor too painfully modern. It must evade the
                        similitude of a Barnum show on the one hand, and of a bicycle gymkhana on
                        the other. Simplicity is the first requisite. Let there be no crimson cloth
                        or blare of trumpets. The second is the presence of really representative
                        athletes. In this connection we are glad to see that an earnest effort is
                        being made to draw on the best talent of England, and a strong British
                        committee has been formed with this object. Given these two primary
                        conditions, the "pulvis Olympicus" may yet perhaps be the scene of a meeting
                        not entirely unworthy of the glorious past.</p>

                    <head type="sub">ADVANCE OF TURKS IN FORCE.</head>
                    <dateline>Aden, July 12.</dateline>
                    <p>The Turks are preparing to advance in great force from Hodeida and Tais
                        simultaneously against Sanaa. It is feared that the rising will become
                        general. (Reuter.)</p>
                    <p>“Die Post” gives the following summary of the position in the Yemen :—</p>
                    <p>The insurrectionary movement in the Yemen has given the Ottoman authorities
                        more trouble than ever, though the military authorities appear to be acting
                        with the necessary energy to prevent any further extension and continuation
                        of the troubles, which might lead to a most serious situation in conjunction
                        with the disturbances in the European portion of the Empire. A Turkish
                        officer who has returned from Arabia gives the following interesting details
                        which are not marked by any excessive optimism.</p>
                    <p>He states that the number of the followers of tho insurgent Sheikh Mohamed
                        Yehya, instead of reaching 150,000 men, does not greatly exceed 40,000. At
                        the opening of the campaign not more than four or five thousand armed
                        guerillas were in the field, but their numbers rose rapidly as the Arab
                        troops of the Turkish Expeditionary Corps surrendered to them and the
                        Yemenis, emboldened by each of their successes and especially by the capture
                        of Sanaa, joined them. The present strength of the rebels is formidable
                        enough, if the climatic conditions, from which the Turkish soldier suffers
                        terribly, are taken into account,</p>
                    <p>Tho present Turkish force consists of three full brigades — Albanians, Lazes,
                        and Turks, who are absolutely reliable, unlike the Syrian and Arab
                        conscripts. The despatch of soldiers to the front continues. Meantime the
                        communications and transport of the force are being assured and a large
                        number of transport mules are being sent from the Syrian Coast to the
                        Arabian ports.</p>

                    <head>MESOPOTAMIA. SIR Wm. WILLCOCKS’S SCHEME.</head>
                    <p>Sir William Willcocks’s scheme for the irrigation of Mesopotamia is made the
                        excuse for a letter in the “National Zeitung," again pleading for the
                        participation of British capital in the construction of the Bagdad Railway.
                        The letter declares that the English see in the irrigation scheme a
                        possibility of obtaining the construction of the Bagdad-Basra section of the
                        line, which, the writer asserts, will be cheaper than the southern (?
                        northern) portion, as it presents no natural difficulties, and, therefore,
                        Germany must not allow it to fall into British hands. The letter continues:—
                        “In view of the Emperor's great personal influence in the East, Sir William
                        Willcocks will not prevail with the Sultan; but I am convinced that if Great
                        Britain and Germany combined their interests, the desired concession would
                        be granted.” The writer then expatiates on the beneficial effects to be
                        expected from irrigation in Mesopotamia by promoting cotton-growing and the
                        cultivation of corn, barley, dates and tobacco. These benefits, he thinks,
                        would be felt by the Bagdad Railway, which would profit by the increased
                        passenger and goods traffic. He concludes by expressing the hope that Sir
                        William Willcocks’s scheme may be amalgamated with the Bagdad Railway, so
                        that Germany, France (who is already interested to the extent of 40 per
                        cent. of the capital), and Great Britain would take part in it. He declares,
                        however, that the management of the whole undertaking must remain in German
                        hands.</p>

                    <head>THE LATE GRAND MUFTI. IMPOSING FUNERAL.</head>
                    <p>A large crowd assembled at the Cairo station about 2 o’clock yesterday
                        afternoon to await the arrival of the special train conveying the mortal
                        remains of the late Sheikh Mohamed Abdou from Alexandria for interment in
                        the Capital. The train drew up at platform No. 1. exactly at 2.36 p.m. and
                        as soon as it came to a standstill the many who had accompanied the body
                        from Alexandria dismounted and swelled the number who were waiting on the
                        platform. The large assembly then gathered round the carriage in which the
                        coffin had been placed. When the doors were opened, and the bearers had
                        mournfully raised the bier on their shoulders the crowd parted and silently
                        stood aside to admit the passage of the coffin, which was carried to a room
                        opening on to the platform, there to await the appointed hour-of four
                        o'clock when the funeral cortege would leave the station. The room in which
                        the coffin lay was closed and guarded by four policemen.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile the crowd grew larger and larger, but the people were not admitted
                        to the platform, which was reserved for those who were to form the cortege,
                        and the entrance soon became so crowded that access to the platform was a
                        matter of considerable difficulty. Shortly after half-past three the
                        mourners began to arrive and increased in numbers continuously until 4 p.m.
                        Every Ministry and public office was fully represented ; Egyptian and
                        English officials alike had come to pay their last homage to a man who had
                        played throughout his public life an eventful part in the Mohamedan world of
                        Egypt, and who had gained the respect and admiration of all who came in
                        contact with him, even of those who actively opposed his ideas and
                        schemes.</p>
                    <p>At four o’clock the coffin was carried out of the room where it had been laid
                        and the procession, leaving the station by the side exit, started on its way
                        to the place of burial. The procession was headed by an officer of the
                        mounted police, and after him came twelve other mounted police, who were
                        followed by fifty foot police in double file. Next came the coffin, a simple
                        bier without adornment, and only covered by a cloth, as is the custom with
                        those belonging to the Mohamedan religion, and this was carried by ten men,
                        several of whom wore the green turban. The bier was followed by a large
                        number of the students of the University of Al Azhar, and these were
                        followed by the lawyers and judges of the Native Tribunals in their robes of
                        office. The English representatives of the various Ministries and public
                        offices and of the Army of Occupation followed. Mr. P. W. Machell, Adviser
                        to the Ministry of the Interior, the Hon. C. James, Mr. Moberley, Mansfield
                        Pasha, Commandant of Police, Brig.-General Bollock, Sir H. Pinching,
                        Director General of the Sanitary Department, Mr. Goodman, Mr. W. Swanson,
                        representing the Ministry of Public Instruction, and many others had come to
                        take part in this procession, and behind these was a large number of those
                        who have been connected with the work of the deceased.</p>
                    <p>It was an immense and most impressive and solemn cortege, and as it passed
                        along it was swelled by the crowds who lined the streets. All traffic in the
                        streets through which the procession passed was stopped, and the huge crowds
                        stood silent and respectful until it had passed them. It appeared indeed as
                        if the whole native population of Cairo had come to pay their last respects
                        to the great Sheikh, and Europeans were also present in large numbers. The
                        procession passed along Sharia Bab-el-Hadid, Sharia Kamel and Opera-square,
                        where the English representatives left it, and it then continued across
                        Ataba el-Khadra-square, the Mousky, and Sikkat Guedidah to the Mosque of Al
                        Azhar, where the customary ceremony previous to interment took place, and
                        there the procession was reformed and wended its way to the cemetery of
                        Megawreen, where the body was laid in its final resting place.</p>

                    <p>A very pretty wedding took place to-day at St. George’s Church,
                        Hanover-square. where Captain Charles Wilberforce Maclean, of the Lancashire
                        Fusiliers, (attached to the Egyptian Army), son of the late Colonel Allan
                        Maclean, R. A., and grandson of the late General Maclean, of Rowlands,
                        Wimborne, and Lazoneby Hall, Cumberland, was married to Miss Gladys Royle,
                        only daughter of Mr. and Mrs. George Royle, of Cairo.</p>
                    <p>St. George’s Church, Hanover-square, specially popular for smart weddings,
                        and within the past month both the King and Queen, with Princess Victoria,
                        were present there for Lady Alexandra Acheson’s marriage with the Earl of
                        Derby’s son. The music and singing are of a very high-class order, and Dr.
                        Jolly, the organist, played finely at to-day’s wedding, as he has done at
                        previous ceremonies, his choir acquitting themselves admirably. The hymns
                        sung were, “Lead us, heavenly Father, lead us” and “O perfect Love!” While
                        the register was being signed Mendelssohn’s anthem from Elijah, “He shall
                        give His Angels charge over thee,” rendered beautifully, and the Wedding
                        March was a splendid finale. Mr. Douglas Morice and Mr. Maclean, the
                        bridegroom’s brother, acted as ushers and the numerous guests were shown to
                        the seats appointed for them without the slightest confusion or delay.</p>
                    <p>The ceremony was performed by the Rev. David Anderson, Rector of St.
                        George’s, who at the head of the choir met the bride at the entrance of the
                        church and preceded her to the altar. There the bridegroom was waiting
                        attended by his best man, Major Hawker, Coldstream Guards. Miss Royle, who
                        was given away by her father, wore a lovely Princess robe of rich Brussels
                        applique lace over silvered net, and trimmed at the foot with a Vandyck
                        flounce, from which branches of embroidered raised silver lilies tapered to
                        the waist, the leaves of the flowers being edged with a tiny lace frill. A
                        spray of the embroidery crossed the corsage, which was softened by a large
                        square lace collar, and there were pretty lace elbow sleeves. With this robe
                        was worn a courttrain of gauged spot net each gauging separated by a band of
                        fine old point de Gaze lace, and garlands of the embroidered silver lilies
                        were introduced, matching the embroidery on the robe. The bride wore no
                        ornaments. Her tulle veil fell over a chaplet of orange blossoms and she
                        carried a sheaf of white lilies. The brides maids were Miss Victoria Royle,
                        Miss Hermie and Miss Violet Beauchamp (the bride’s cousins), Miss Daisy and
                        Miss Gertrude Maclean (sisters of the bridegroom), Miss Margaret Maclean
                        (his cousin), Miss Ella Rayne, and Miss Ethel Lambert. They wore charming
                        gowns of white blonde lace on soft white satin, the bottom of the skirts
                        trimmed with Empire wreaths of pink chiffon roses, set in by garlands of
                        blue ribbon, run through the lace. The tops of the bodices were
                        transparent,—and two bretelles of blue ribbon, veiled in lace, crossed the
                        shoulders and finished under a deep folded belt of blue satin, trimmed at
                        the back with little rosettes and short folded ends. A butterfly bow of lace
                        was fastened in the front of the bodice with festoons of the pink rose; with
                        small green foliage falling at each side. The elbow sleeves were in two
                        puffs, divided by a bracelet of blue ribbon and a single pink rose, and
                        terminated in lace ruffles. The pretty hats were made of white tulle,
                        narrowly frilled with blonde lace. The round brims were very much raised off
                        the face in front, and to one side, and out away at the back, which was
                        filled in with a bow, and ends of wide blue ribbon edged with lace. The
                        crowns were encircled by a band of blue ribbon and inside on the raised brim
                        were a large cluster of little pink roses and foliage and a blue bow. The
                        bridegroom gave the bridesmaids bouquets of pink banksia roses tied with
                        blue streamers, and turquoise and pearl pendants- dresses, hats, bouquets
                        and ornaments making a beautiful harmony of delicate pompadour
                        colouring.</p>
                    <p>After the ceremony, Mrs. Royle held a reception at 22, Charles St.,
                        Barkeley-sqnare, kindly lent by Miss Warmald, which was numerously and

                    <head>CAIRO WATER SUPPLY. DR. BITTER'S REPORT.</head>
                    <p>We have received from the Cairo Water Company Dr. Bitter’s report upon the
                        water as at present supplied to the greater number of the Cairo districts
                        from the artesian wells at Rod-el-Farag, and we give below a translation of
                        this report:—</p>
                    <p>“The water of the wells is absolutely clear and limpid and without colour. It
                        has no smell and is of a very pleasant taste. Its temperature is 23 Cent.
                        The water contains no bacteria and is sterile.</p>
                    <p>“In comparing the chemical analysis of the well-water and of the Nile water
                        one sees that there is no very pronounced difference between the two. There
                        is only the hydrometric degree which was greater in the case of the
                        well-water.</p>
                    <p>“During the time of the high Nile the well-water is about twice as hard as
                        the Nile water, but this difference decreases during low Nile, to such an
                        extent that, during the month of May for example, the rates of hydrometric
                        degree of the two waters is reduced to 7 : 5.</p>
                    <p>“The high hydrometric degree of the well water is due to the presence of a
                        larger quantity of calcium bicarbonate and magnesium bicarbonate, and not to
                        an increase in the quantity of calcium sulphate. On the contrary, the
                        well-water contains less sulphuric acid than the Nile water, especially when
                        the Nile is at low-water mark.</p>
                    <p>“In other respects the hydrometric degree of the well-water is very moderated
                        and the water of the Embabeh wells can be considered as a very sweet water.
                        A considerable amount of the water used for drinking in the large towns of
                        England, Germany, and France him the same degree of hardness or is even
                        still harder. A water is generally considered as distinctly hard only when
                        its hydrometric degree exceeds 30 French degrees, and the hydrometric degree
                        of the well-water of Embabeh is about 20.</p>
                    <p>“The calcium contained in the well-water is almost exclusively in the form of
                        calcium bicarbonate and gives to this water a particularly fresh and
                        agreeable taste, which we are accustomed to find in good water springs. This
                        constitutes a real advantage in comparison with Nile water, which contains
                        much less carbonic acid. The well water also contains less sodium chloride
                        than the Nile water. During low Nile the amount of salt found in Nile water
                        is about 2 1/2 times as great as that found in the well-water.</p>
                    <p>One can consider the well-water as having the same origin as the Nile water,
                        i.e., as a Nile water naturally filtered through beds of soil. But this
                        filtration has not taken place in the proximity of the wells; it must have
                        traversed for a considerable length the underground beds, as is proved by
                        the differences in the chemical analyses and by the constant temperature of
                        the well-water (a temperature equal to the annual mean temperature). It may
                        thus be described as the water of the subterranean Nile which accompanies
                        the superficial Nile and has the same origin as the latter.</p>
                    <p>“The taste of the Nile water does not differ sensibly from that of the
                        well-water. Most people, and especially the Arabs, are unable to distinguish
                        with certainty the two waters, as I have been able to prove by direct
                        experiments.</p>
                    <p>“The well-water is a drinkable water of the first quality as much from the
                        point of chemical analysis as from the point of taste, and especially from
                        the fact that it is absolutely free of living germs.</p>
                    <p>“Being given the geological configuration of the aquiferous beds and the
                        construction of the wells it is absolutely impossible for this water to
                        become contaminated by the filration of unhealthy water. During the three
                        years that two of these wells have been worked almost continuously day and
                        night to the amount of about 4,000 cubic metres each per day, the chemical
                        composition of the water has remained unchanged.</p>
                    <p>“The water of the Embabeh wells ranks, therefore, amongst the best of the
                        natural drinking waters known, and the town Cairo may be congratulated on
                        possessing a supply of drinkable water which is no way inferior to the best
                        waters of the whole world.”</p>

                    <p>mousseline de soie richly incrusted with renaissance lace in handsome design.
                        The bodice was draped en bolero with front of the mousseline de soie,
                        inserted with lace, and there was a folded belt of soft white satin, the
                        belt and bodice trimmed prettily with little satin bows. The picture hat was
                        of white tulle in soft cloudy frills, and with a wreath of pink heather and
                        roses round the crown, tied at the back with a blue ribbon bow. Mrs. Boyle
                        wore a most becoming gown made of light blue satin veiled in blue chiffon
                        and again in chiffon of a rich tone of purple. The skirt was finely gauged
                        and trimmed at the foot with garlands of chiffon. An effective touch was a
                        band of wide chene ribbon at the foot on the blue chiffon underskirt,
                        showing through with charming result. The gauged bodice had frills of creamy
                        silk lace about the neck, and a bow of blue and silver shot tissue was
                        fastened at the bust, and the waistband was of purple ribbon. On the
                        graceful sleeves, the pale blue chiffon appeared as small puffs under a
                        loose elbow sleeve veiled by the darker fabric. The toque, smartly turned up
                        at the wide back, was slightly pealed in front, and made of tulle matching
                        the gown, embroidered with ribbon straw to match ribbon and finished by a
                        handsome purple ostrich feather. Mrs. Murray Cookesley, who gave the bride
                        her fine painting of “Circe resplendens” as a wedding present, wore a
                        picturesque dress designed by herself, made of pearl great voile, under a
                        tunic of rare gold lace, the bodice embroidered with pearls. A pearl fringe
                        finished the white satin sleeves, and there was a belt of the same satin.
                        The toque was composed of grey ostrich feathers and white roses.</p>

                        <dateline>London, July 7</dateline>
                        <p>Markets here are in a state of summer holiday slackness, and, for the
                            time being, at any rate, there seems very little probability of their
                            being stirred into activity. Of course there is always the possibility
                            of peace negotiations coming to a head sooner than is generally
                            anticipated, especially as Russia’s hand is being weakened by internal
                            troubles. The spirit of revolt is abroad in all parts of the Tsar’s
                            dominions, and the mutiny on certain of the warships is evidence of the
                            extent of the disaffection in the navy. From the attitude of the
                            mutineers and their comrades on the other vessels, as well as of large
                            numbers of the more dangerous section of the residents in the towns, it
                            is evident that little provocation would be required on the part of the
                            authorities to bring about an open revolution, the consequences of which
                            are terrible to contemplate. The seriousness of the position is now
                            evidently realised.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Takahashi, the Financial Agent of the Japanese Government, has
                            arrived here for the purpose of completing the arrangements for raising
                            the new £30,000,000 loan, which is likely to be very favorably received.
                            By the time this reaches you it will be a fait accompli. It is stated
                            that in London the issuing banks will be Parr’s Bank, the Hong Kong and
                            Shanghai Bank, and the Yokohama Specie Bank. The loan runs for a period
                            of 20 years and bears 4 1/2% interest. The issue price will be 90.</p>
                        <p>The mining section is decidedly weak, and Kaffirs are in a sorry plight.
                            There is little inducement to support most of the African and Westralian
                            properties in this market, and there has been a good deal of forced
                            selling during the past week. This, unfair as it may appear, reflects
                            severely on Egyptian mines, which suffer from neglect and want of public
                            confidence in anything of this class.</p>
                        <p>As regards South Africans, it is thought that the Barnato proposal re
                            amalgamation with the Johnnies Investment Company will have sickened
                            investors for some time to come. This has a serious effect on the
                            market, as an increase of confidence is regarded as necessary in order
                            that further capital can be obtained for carrying out the fresh
                            developments which have been started.</p>
                        <p>The market for Home Government securities is dull. Consols closed at 90
                            1/8 for money and 90 1/8-1/4 for the account.</p>
                        <p>The Bank return shows large movements in connection with the close of the
                            half-year. The coin and note circulations increased considerably, and
                            the reserve is £1,167,000 lower at £26,201,000, and its proportion to
                            current liabilities has fallen 3 5/8 to 42 5/8 per cent.</p>
                        <p>The Paris market appears to be still to some extent under the influence
                            of the Morocco scare, but as the crisis may now be safely said to be
                            almost past, there should soon be an increase of business on the Bourse,
                            provided Russia does not collapse entirely. Suez Canal shares are
                            f.4,430 ex-coupon of f.95.89, showing a nice margin on the price.</p>
                        <p>Other Egyptian stocks than those already referred to keep fairly steady,
                            Dairas being a fraction better at 28 1/8, and Agricultural Banks a firm
                            market at 13 3/4. Nationals are unchanged at 26 ¼.</p>

                        <p>American Futures. — The market this week has experienced great activity
                            and excitement, and prices advanced 80 points from the closing rates of
                            Monday to the opening prices paid yesterday morning ; later a reaction
                            set in and prices declined sharply. To-day the tone is unsettled at
                            about 20 points below the extreme rates touched. The Bureau report has
                            of course been mainly responsible for this extraordinary advance. The
                            condition of 77 % for June indicates a most serious if not disastrous
                            state of the crop ; the weekly government reports did not forecast such
                            a statement for the month and private information generally favored an
                            improved condition during June. It is impossible to formulate any
                            definite opinion ; speculation in America has run wild and manipulation
                            is daily at work to raise or depress values ; but the possibility that
                            the condition of the Crop has been exaggerated, and the fact that the
                            price is now 5 ¾, should we think make operators cautious, which will in
                            time probably lead to some further reaction. The following are the

                    <head>THE PANAMA CANAL.</head>
                    <p>I am afraid that President Roosevelt’s domestic worry, as you term it in your
                        number of the 10th inst., will not cease for many summers to come. Having
                        resided on the Isthmus of Panama for seven years and contributed a series of
                        articles to the “Times,” “Saturday Review,” “Scotsman,” “Chambers’ Journal,”
                        and “New York Herald,” I can speak as an authority with “connaissance de
                        cause.” First and foremost, without entering immediately into technical and
                        financial matter, such as the Chagres River, Culebra mountain, the ports of
                        Colon and Panama, the expense and difficulty in finding labour, let me refer
                        to the climate and the sanitary conditions of the Isthmus. Yellow fever
                        resides permanently, whether in an endemic or epidemic form, and until this
                        scourge is eradicated the canal will cost millions sterling, take years to
                        build, and thousands of lives will be its holocaust. Has there been any
                        specific discovered to save a patient once attacked with this disease, and
                        what percentage die and how many recover? There are only special beings,
                        “lucky dogs,” who seem exempt from this fatal disease. A muscular, lean man
                        acclimatised in a torrid zone between the ages of 40 and 60 appears to
                        escape its virus, providing he is abstemious and refuses to drink Panama
                        water in any shape or form. Youth and middle age are more subject,
                        especially those who have not lived in or frequented a warm climate.
                        Sanguine, lymphatic, and corpulent natures are tempting preys to the
                        disease. To be acclimatised is to be in a constant state of anaemia, a state
                        which the microbe despises. Children seem to be exempt. I am not alluding to
                        the indigenous population, for it would be very unfortunate if they could
                        not live in their own country, although some, very few, do die from yellow
                        fever through contagion or intemperate habits. The native population are as
                        yellow as quinces, and in a perfect state of chronic anaemia. The yellow
                        fever microbe is seldom the tenant of a black man ; he has enough to do with
                        other bacilli.</p>
                    <p>During my sojourn on the Isthmus, with a change of air every two years, I
                        knew but very few Europeans who recovered from an attack, and these attacks
                        were slight. None ever weathered a virulent case. We have amongst us to-day
                        a worthy and excellent Sister of Charity of the Order of St Vincent of Paul,
                        who for several years was the Angel of Mount Ancon hospital, where she
                        unremittingly tendered her care and services to the last moments of many a
                        patient</p>
                    <p>To construct a canal through these Nicropolai you must commence by purifying
                        the whole Isthmus, and changing the sanitary conditions, then you may
                        succeed in improving the climate, but otherwise you can bury your dead and
                        spend your millions, as the French company did from 1881 to 1885. It was not
                        a “French folly,” but a French misfortune. They went boldly and gaily to
                        work, but M. de Lesseps never dreamt of such a climate nor contemplated such
                        a task. He preferred the Panama route on account of its being shorter than
                        others proposed, but had he selected any other, the Atrato, Darien, or
                        Nicaragua, even Tehuantepec, he would have succeeded. His genius and
                        popularity would have moved mountains, but he could not battle against the
                        hidden monster of disease which rendered his staff and workmen fearful,
                        nervous, and careless. Engineers-in-chief died, like MM. Blanchet and Boyer,
                        men of vast experience and capacity. In a few months the wife, son, and
                        daughter of Mr. Dingler, the director general, were victims of yellow fever.
                        All collapsed; it was a forlorn hope with a “sauve qui peut’’ which ushered
                        on the scene in many cases the fiend of dishonesty. “Apres moi le deluge”
                        was the password.</p>
                    <p>The luxuriant vegetation and the dense foliage on each side of the proposed
                        line of the Canal prevent the rays of the sun from penetrating the
                        accumulated heaps of dead and decayed vegetable matter from which emanate a
                        mephitic vapour charged with the germs of disease and pestilence. What part
                        of the Isthmus can be pointed out as free from these seeds of malignant
                        fever ? Is it in the swamps of Rio Grande, on the heights of Emperador,
                        Culebra, or Obispo ? On the plains of Mamei, Matachin, or Bohio-Soldado ?
                        Surely not at Gatun nor Colon ! The fever lurks in the dry season from
                        December to March and is ready to sally forth as soon as the change is
                        taking place from April to June and from September to November. Seasons are
                        only two, the rainy and the dry, which fairly divide the year. The former is
                        torrential; the storm gathers in the hours of the antemeridian and bursts
                        with violence, accompanied often with tremendous flashes of fork lightning.
                        I have, on several occasions, seen objects struck with unusual force,
                        displacing blocks of masonry, reducing planks into splinters, melting leaden
                        gutters on the tops and sides of houses. These phenomena are independent of
                        a few good shakes by earthquakes and a few revolutions now and again as a
                        pastime. These are the Isthmian games of this chosen spot. After a rain
                        storm you have rivers and rivulets. The Chagres rises with an extraordinary
                        rapidity. It rose 30 feet in one night in 1882 in one of these charming
                        freshets mandwashed away<cb/>the rails, sleepers, and embankments of the
                        railway between two sections near Barbacoas.</p>
                    <p>Trees grow without culture, (no need of arable land), on the tops of houses,
                        and your boots and shoes in one night in the wet season are coated with a
                        lovely soft mildew like lambswool. As for perspiration, you are in a
                        constant state of liquefaction, from the damp heat before the storm burts,
                        when you are partly relieved. Then comes the dry season, when the land is
                        absolutely arid—better the Sahara, even with Jacques Ier. as Emperor. It is
                        difficult to obtain water and one is obliged to go several miles to bring a
                        pailful or purchase one from the trickling Matasnillo and its stagnant
                        pools. And then it is not as if your journey could be rewarded or your
                        purchase satisfied with a meagre quantity of good water, but you are
                        confronted with a pail of dancing animal culae. The house trees fade and die
                        and are whirled away from the slender roots with the breath of Aquilon; but
                        do not weep ! The tiles will bring forth others next season. The streets and
                        roads are watered with clouds of fine dust and the Savanna is a parched
                        plain. “0 fortnatos nimium, sua si bona norint Panamania!”</p>
                    <p>This is only climatic, what about the technical side? Will the Culebra be
                        ever mastered, will it be prevented from closing its wound when it is cut ?
                        This is the phenomenon of the moving mountain. What about the Chagres ? is
                        that to be muzzled, how and when ? By a deviation to the east of Colon or by
                        a dam which in my time was to retain 2,000,000,000 cubic metres of water.
                        Well! if it comes to grief on a freshet like 1882 it will remind us of the
                        flood without the ark which will not be ready to receive the Isthmians of
                        Panama. This sovereign miniature State was wrenched from the territory of
                        Columbia. A second Andorra with a Bishop as President instead of an
                        engineer. The former will be more useful in this case as there will be only
                        souls left. What about the ports of Panama and Colon and the three-mile
                        dredging in open roadstead to Flamenco ? MM. Barratoux, Latellier &amp; Co.
                        worked like Spartans at this channel but they found out to their
                        astonishment that as fast as they dredged in front it filled up behind, and
                        for a surplus of misery they lost their director, Mr. Lilas, and part of
                        their staff from yellow fever. Mr. Latellier thought it wiser to abandon his
                        hourglass and take up journalism.</p>
                    <p>Is it a level or a lock canal ? Ask Mr. Eiffel if he knows about the lock
                        system. I know he is a “tower” of strength, but when he found that the
                        Atlantic rose only six inches and the Pacific 20 feet he thought that,
                        considering yellow fever was to be calculated with this rise and fall, it
                        would be prudent to leave that problem for later on and construct a more
                        profitable enterprise in the shape of “la tour d’Eiffel.”</p>
                    <p>I never doubt American enterprise with money and science, but they have not
                        yet discovered the antidote for yellow fever, nor the remedy to prevent
                        staff and workmen deserting. Moreover, will they be able to induce West
                        Indians to come to the Isthmus, only to return invalided and increase the
                        poor rates ? And if they do, will the governors allow the depopulation of
                        their dependencies ? If they want to get rid of the coloured population of
                        America the best thing would be to make them a present of the infant
                        Republic, and allow them to govern themselves and dig the Canal. The
                        coloured American race would be extinct in a very few years. They might save
                        a couple to please Bostock.</p>
                    <p>If they could invent automatic excavators, diamond drills, self-working
                        dredgers, etc., I could believe that the Panama Canal was approaching its
                        construction, but as long as “Yellow Jack” holds its sway I must wait until
                        the spread Eagle has conquered him.</p>
                    <p>Panama is more American now than Colombia, and had not America supported the
                        Franco-Panamanian visionaries with Mr. Bunau-Varilla as High Commissioner
                        and Envoy-extraordinary and Plenipotentiary per interim, the Canal would be
                        the same to day as it was 25 years ago, but with £15,000,000 more in the
                        American Treasury. There is a notice out, I see, that stray and ownerless
                        dogs found in the San Stefano quarter during the night of Friday and
                        Saturday at daylight will be poisoned by the police. I am off— Vale.</p>

                    <p>Professor Chantemesse, an eminent French doctor, and Director-General of the
                        Paris Hygienic Bureau, says, according to the “Daily Mail” correspondent,
                        that Europe is seriously threatened with a cholera epidemic this year.
                        During the last four years, he states, cholera has been advancing rapidly
                        westwards, and it now threatens to invade Europe by four different routes:
                        (1) Through Moscow, St Petersburg, and the Volga river ; (2) through the
                        Black Sea, Odessa, and Central Europe ; (3) through the Danube and the
                        Balkan principalities ; (4) through Constantinople, the Adriatic, and Italy.
                        All that is wanting now for the advent of cholera in Europe, says the
                        Professor, is a long spell of hot weather.</p>

                    <dateline>London, July 7.</dateline>
                    <p>Princess Victoria, whose thirty-seventh birth, day it was, yesterday received
                        many presents and congratulation. Her Royal Highness, who takes the keenest
                        interest in, and displays the warmest affection for, her younger relations,
                        is understood to have selected for the celebration of her birthday a garden
                        party, to which her nieces and nephews and some fifty juvenile guests were
                        invited.</p>
                    <p>In the grounds of Buckingham Palace Queen Alexandra arranged an entertainment
                        for the young folk, and arranged for the presence of the forest pigmies,
                        Jumbo junior, the baby elephant, two performing ponies, and a
                        prestidigitateur of marvellous powers.</p>
                    <p>The Duchess of Sparta and her children, with Prince and Princess Frederick
                        Charles of Hesse, and their little ones, came up from Seaford for the
                        occasion, and joined the Crown Prince of Greece, whom they accompanied to
                        England on Monday last, and who has since been staying at the Palace as the
                        guest of the King and Queen. All her Majesty’s grand-children also came up
                        for the day.</p>
                    <p>The guests were received at the grand entrance, and conducted to one of the
                        spacious drawing-rooms, where tea was provided for them, accompanied by
                        vocal mnsic.</p>
                    <p>Of the attractions in the grounds the keenest centred, at least for a time,
                        in the pigmies, who were armed with their tiny bows and arrows. Grave and
                        solemn, seated beneath a tree in a shaded part of the grounds, the pigmies
                        awaited the arrival of her Majesty, the Princes and Princesses, and guests,
                        and submitted, without any apparent shyness or unwillingness, to the
                        interested scrutiny to which they were subject. When attention was diverted
                        in turn to the performing animals and the mystifications of the conjurer,
                        the pigmies appeared as interested in the performances as the general body
                        of guests.</p>

                    <head type="sub">HUSBAND AND DIVORCED WIFE</head>
                    <p>The hearing of the case of “Constantinidi v. Constantinidi and Lance” was
                        resumed in the Court of Appeal last Thursday, before Lords Justices Vaughan
                        Williams, Stirling, and Cozens Hardy. It was an appeal by Mrs. Julia Lance
                        from a judgment of Sir Franois Jeune given on December 5, 1904, directing
                        that an order of the Registrar as to the alteration of settlements made on
                        her marriage with Mr. Demetrius Sophocles Constantinidi should be varied.
                        Lord Justice Vaughan Williams said that the judgment appealed against had
                        been given by the late President in exercise of the discretion conferred on
                        him by section 31 of the Matrimonial Causes Act, 1857, with reference to the
                        variation of a marriage settlement after the decree for divorce had been
                        made absolute, and was in the petitioner’s favor. His Lordship read the
                        facts as stated by the late President, under which the proceedings for
                        divorce were instituted by the husband. The President had pointed out that
                        the authorities were in favor of the principle that where a wife had by her
                        misconduct broken up the home it was justifiable to give her husband a
                        portion of her income to restore him to the position he would have ocoupied,
                        and also on the broad principle that a co-respondent should not be allowed
                        to profit by his own iniquity. The President had found that the petitioner
                        had not himself been guilty of misconduot before the date of the
                        respondent’s going to South Dakota with the obvious intention of procuring a
                        so-called divorce and contracting a bigamous marriage. No doubt, continued
                        Sir Franois Jeune, after she had gone the petitioner himself was guilty of
                        shameless misconduct, but the President was unable to say that she had not
                        conduced to her husband’s misconduct. Having granted a divorce to the
                        petitioner in this case—a decision which had not been challenged—he could
                        not hold that the petitioner’s misconduct should debar him from the relief
                        he sought. He did not propose to take the £25,000 damages awarded by the
                        jury or the unpaid costs into account, but he had to consider what the
                        respective settled incomes of the parties were. The petitioner’s . was £710
                        and the respondent's £2,200, the latter derived from a capital sum of
                        £51,000. The President, taking those figures and facts into account, varied
                        the order of the Registrar, who had reported as follows : “Having regard to
                        the verdict of the jury against the petitioner, to their being no issue of
                        the marriage, and to no neccessity being shown for providing for the
                        petitioner out of the wife’s trust funds, it is submitted that no order
                        should be made in variation of the respondent’s settlement of October 23,
                        1889.” In his (Lord Justice Vaughan Williams’) opinion that order of the
                        Registrar was the right order. But the late President had varied that order
                        and had directed that the trustees should pay to the petitioner two sums
                        yearly of, roughly, £1,000 each, one to be paid immediately, and one after
                        the death of the respondent’s mother. The order of the late President must
                        be set aside, and an order made in the sense of the Registrar’s report</p>
                    <p>Lord Justice Stirling and Lord Justice Cozens-Hardy concurred.</p>
                    <p>It was decided that the costs of the appeal should be paid by the
                        petitioner.</p>

                    <p>The new force of cavalry which is about to be raised in Egypt will no doubt
                        attract many officers to that servioe, for the land of the Pharaohs is a
                        popular place to soldier in. At the same time our cavalry regiments cannot
                        afford to part with many officers, the commissioned ranks being depleted as
                        it is.</p>
                    <p>The S.S. Dunera is due to leave Southampton on the 27th of September with
                        drafts on board for Gibraltar, Malta, and Egypt. The same liner will take
                        out drafts to Egypt in November.</p>
                    <p>Colonel E. K. G. Aylmer, C.B., an officer well-known in Egypt, will retire on
                        half-pay from the command of the 19th Hussars at the Curragh on the 17th
                        inst. under the four-years’ rule. He will be succeeded by Brevet Lieut.-
                        Colonel H. G. De Pledge, the second in command.</p>
                    <p>The administration of the King’s African Rifles, of which there are five
                        battalions, has been transferred from the Foreign Office to the Colonial
                        Office. Brigadier-General Sir William Manning, Inspector-General of the
                        force, retains that appointment under the transfer of administration.</p>
                    <p>All the British cavalry regiments in India have been re-armed with the short
                        rifle. The mode of carrying it has not yet been decided upon.</p>
                    <p>The War Office has taken a strong step towards reducing the expense of living
                        in the cavalry regiments of the line, and the King’s Regulations will be
                        amended accordingly. All extravagances, which heretofore have been the means
                        of keeping young men of moderate means out of the service, are to be put
                        down, and commanding officers who fail to aid and assist the authorities in
                        keeping expenses well within bounds will be liable to be summarily dealt
                        with. The system of keeping two sets of accounts, one showing the legitimate
                        outlay, and the other expenses which hardly come under that heading, is to
                        be suppressed, and semi-private accounts will be tolerated under no
                        circumstances. The Army Council is of opinion that no difficulty would be
                        experienced in keeping up the supply of eligible candidates if the
                        expenditure were reduced. Regimental drags have been marked down for
                        abolition, as being a very expensive item. It must be remembered that many
                        deserving officers who won commissions in the late war had to resign these
                        hard earned commissions after the war closed owing to the expense in cavalry
                        regiments. This time the Army Council seems to be in earnest.</p>
                    <p>Germany’s campaign now in progress in South-West Africa has witnessed some
                        successful experiments in the use of camels for army transport. The camels
                        are brought from Fuertura Ventura, an island of the Canaries group, and have
                        proved specially useful for transport across the stretch of shifting sand,
                        about forty miles in extent, which separates the coast from the interior,
                        and which has proved fatal to ox and mule transport. The animals are able to
                        cross the sand without water and carry a load of 600lbs. each. They are fed
                        chiefly on alfalfa, chaff, and barley, and stand the change of climate
                        well.</p>
                    <p>The youthful King of Spain is determined on having a Navy commensurate with
                        his dominions. The programme is a modest one, embracing four battleships of
                        16,000 tons displacement, five armoured cruisers of 10,000 tons
                        displacement, and a dozen smaller craft. The programme is to be spread over
                        a number of years. The last of the cruisers of the Orlando type building for
                        the Spanish Navy is in hand, and it is ironically said that at the present
                        rate of construction she will be ready for commission about the year 1910.
