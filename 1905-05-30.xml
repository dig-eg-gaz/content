                    <p>An artistic wall covering.</p>
                    <p>This celebrated water paint is made in two qualities for Inside and Outside
                        work</p>
                    <p>HALL’S SANITARY WASHABLE DISTEMPER is rapidly superseding wall papers in all
                        tastefully furnished homes. It is made in 70 artistic tints, and only
                        requires the addition of water to make it ready for use. It is quickly and
                        easily applied with a whitewash brush, with half the labour and at one third
                        the cost of paint. HALL’S DISTEMPER ensures cleanliness, and is pleasing to
                        the eye. It appeals alike to artistic and practical house decoration. HALL’S
                        DISTEMPER is of special value in hot climates. Owing to its cool, pleasing
                        colours, great weather-resisting and germ-destroying properties, it lends
                        itself to every kind of wall, wood, brick or stone coating, possessing all
                        the advantages of paint, colour- wash, and disinfectant at one third the
                        cost of oil paint. It never blisters in the hottest sun, and the fact that
                        it can be washed adds greatly to its sanitary advantages.</p>

                    <head>TOGO'S VICTORY</head>
                    <p>The issue of the battle in the Korean Straits will be far more decisive in
                        its results than the great victory of the Japanese at Mukden or the fall of
                        Port Arthur. Last week's fight will take a foremost rank among the decisive
                        battles of the world's history. In spite of the continuous ill-success that
                        has hitherto attended Russia on land, it must be borne in mind that if
                        Admiral Rodjestvensky had succeeded in wresting from Japan the mastery at
                        sea, the misfortunes already suffered on land would have been in great
                        measure retrieved. If Marshal Oyama’s sea communications were permanently
                        cut, he would be unable to keep his army in condition, and one or two
                        campaigns might brings its ruin. But the victory of Admiral Togo has
                        annihilated the Russian Armada and the greatest naval victory since
                        Trafalgar has been won. The telegrams fail to make clear the strategy of the
                        battle, and we must wait for some time to come before we can judge the
                        actual conditions of the fight. In our leading article yesterday we reviewed
                        the material conditions in the two sides which appeared to balance each
                        other. But it must be remembered that the moral conditions were indisputably
                        in favor of the Japanese. To begin with, they had a practically
                        uninterrupted series of victories to look back upon. Some of their
                        operations failed it is true, but the failure was less due to their enemy
                        than to the difficulty inherent in the operations, if not to their virtual
                        impracticability. The Japanese have displayed every quality which makes for
                        success in maritime war. All Admiral Togo’s officers and men are now
                        veterans to warfare. All have “seen blood about the decks,” and are
                        habituated to the habit of mind desirable when an enemy is at hand. It is
                        quite different with their opponents, of whom nearly all made acquaintance
                        with the realities of war for the first time when they got near the Japanese
                        fleet on Saturday week. Another point in Japan’s favor was that when Admiral
                        Togo’s fleet was called on to fight he went into action with an advantage on
                        his side which has hitherto been denied him. In all previous engagements he
                        has been obliged to make allowance for the arrival of a Russian fleet from
                        Europe. Consequently, he was never able to push his attacks home. He had to
                        husband his fleet, the only one that his country possessed, so as to be able
                        to meet the force expected from Europe when the latter arrived in the
                        theatre of war. This he was not obliged to do when he fell upon the Russian
                        Armada in the Korean Straits on Saturday, no longer impeded by what hitherto
                        has been a serious obstacle.</p>
                    <p>As to the behaviour of the Russians and the handling of their fleet no
                        details are yet available, but the Russian naval record is not very
                        inspiring, and in this connection we may recall the behaviour of the Russian
                        Fleet when it made its great sortie from Port Arthur under Admiral Prince
                        Outomsky. On that occasion, although the strength of the Russian Fleet was
                        such that, if properly handled, it stood every chance of disputing the
                        command of the sea on equal grounds with Japan, it, nevertheless, abandoned
                        all idea of a fight to a finish, and instead, acted like a flock of helpless
                        sheep before a pack of wolves. Only one ship in the whole of that great
                        squadron distinguished itself at any time, and that was the cruiser “Rayan,”
                        whose captain, alone among them all, had fought his ship throughout in a
                        gallant and seamanlike manner. The inaction of the Russian destroyers during
                        all the weary months of blockade was as contemptible as it was surprising,
                        and for the credit of their commanding officers, we can only suppose that
                        either they were suffering from a shortage of supplies in torpedoes, or
                        that, as has been reported in well-informed quarters, the stock of
                        “war-heads” for them was almost nil--in which case the destroyers would be
                        useless except for use as scouts or dispatch boats. Otherwise, it is
                        difficult to understand why, during the months of blockade not a single
                        torpedo attack was delivered against Togo’s naval base at the Elliott
                        Islands.</p>
                    <p>It is not likely that Rodjestvensky’s officers were capable of showing more
                        dash and initiative than their fellows have done in the past, for whatever
                        may be said in praise of defensive ability shown by General Kuropatkin and
                        of the indomitable staying power of his troops, the Russian record at sea
                        has hitherto been one of almost unredeemed discredit. The ponderous inertia
                        which incapacitates the Muscovite temperament for the great aggressive, but
                        makes it incalculably formidable for resistance upon land, can exercise no
                        such negative power at sea. The fleet that cannot develop superior offensive
                        ability must be lost, and the Slav has yet to prove his possession of the
                        rudiments of naval aptitude. The Baltic provinces, no doubt, furnish a
                        proportion of fine officers and fine men, but that they are enough to leaven
                        the lump for any hopeful purpose nothing has hitherto suggested. This was
                        not always the view of Europe. In the eighteenth century speculative
                        politicians in many countries that that Russia might conceivably become the
                        first naval Power in the world. That was the opinion of the Abbé Raynal, in
                        his “Histoire Philosophique des Deux Indes”--that eloquent and penetrating
                        oration in ten volumes which coloured the whole of Napoleon's early views
                        about politics at large and sea-power in particular. It was thought that as
                        trade followed the flag, fleets would follow the timber. The Baltic, in the
                        days of wooden navies, was the great store-house of naval materials. The
                        fear of being cut off from that source of supply had always been a serious
                        anxiety to England, Holland, and France, possessing no adequate forests of
                        their own. This was the chief reason for the preference given to the import
                        of American timber under our old Colonial system, which sprang out of facts,
                        not theories. Russia, possessing the material, as the Abbé Raynal imagined,
                        would create the equivalent navy. The logic was as if you could make any man
                        an incomparable virtuoso by presenting him with Paganini’s violin. Nothing
                        ever was more superficial than the view commonly held a few years ago, that
                        the equal development of destructive machinery upon modern warships would
                        neutralise the superior aptitude of born naval races. The relative value of
                        a machine depends upon the man who works it. The habits of coolness,
                        rapidity, and certainty in action are at least as decisive in our time as in
                        that of Nelson. Russia can spend vast sums upon purchasing and equipping
                        warships, but it takes more than the money and more than the vessels to make
                        a fleet. Sea-power has always belonged to the free. Liberty develops the
                        qualities that win and keep it. Despotism depresses them, and Russia has yet
                        to develop the qualities that would be required to make her a great naval
                        nation.</p>

                    <p>A most important improvement in the port of Alexandria is to be undertaken
                        immediately, and to morrow the first dredger for the work is arriving at
                        Alexandria. The Egyptian Government has determined to construct anewpassfor
                        entrance to the harbour as owing to the enormous and continuous increase in
                        the size of modern vessels the present entry by way of the Boghaz pass is
                        too small for the largest type of ships. For instance, when the White Star
                        liner “Celtic” arrived here the season before last she had to lie outside
                        the harbour.</p>
                    <p>The Boghsz pass is only 31 feet in depth and can only admit as a maximum
                        vessels drawing from 29 to 30 feet of water, and then only in the smoothest
                        sea. The Dew pass is to bo dredged to the depth of 35 feet and will thus be
                        able to admit the largest ships alloat</p>
                    <p>The dredger, which arrives from Malta tomorrow, is convoyed by H. M. S.
                        “Juno," a second-class cruiser under the command or Captain Christian, R.N.
                        This dredger, the “St. Lawrence,” belongs to the Admiralty and is of the
                        type known as “Saints.” She has very powerful machinery and it is expected
                        that her dredging capacity is approximately six hundred tons per hour.</p>
                    <p>The construction of the new pass will begin at once. It will make the harbour
                        most efficient for the alternative entrance will be especially useful when
                        one orotherof the passes gets blocked. The new pass will be the same as the
                        present pass from a navigator’s point of view, with leading lights.</p>
                    <p>The Ports and Lighthouses Administration is also negotiating with the
                        Admiralty for the hire of a second dredger for the same work. Another
                        dredger is arriving from Cyprus in about ten days’ time.</p>

                        in consequence of increasing competition the rate of interest had been
                        reduced, the loans were so well placed that no falling off in the business
                        need be anticipated. Looking at the above results, it is evident that the
                        company’s prosperity is increasing with that of the country generally.</p>

                    <head>THE PIGMIES</head>
                    <p>Colonel Harrison, who has been ill since his return home, has been engaged in
                        making all arrangements before the pigmies’ arrival in England. The
                        directors of the London Hippodrome have engaged them to appear at the London
                        Hippodrome immediately after their arrival at the Royal Albert Docks,
                        probably on June 5.</p>
                    <p>There is a sort of disposition still prevalent to regard these little people
                        as filling, more or less, the part of the “missing link,” but low though
                        they stand in the comparative social scale, they seem to present no marked
                        features whatever to warrant their being placed outside the class of various
                        other ill-developed peoples. Even the silence and apathy of which so much
                        has been made are fully paralleled among the Indian forest races of South
                        America. They are directly attributable to the oppressive gloom and monotony
                        of the surroundings in which for generations they have passed their</p>
                    <p>It is not generally known that several of these little people have been
                        educated and baptised in connection with the C.M.S. Mission in the Uganda
                        Protectorate. One of them is a teacher in a mission school in Toro, near the
                        Ruwenzori Mountains. Writing of the school to children in England, a lady
                        missionary says : "Listen to this ; one class that is being taught by a
                        pigmy from Stanley’s Great Forest, who recently was baptised. His name is
                        Bulasio, and be is very fond of dealing out whacks with that little cane,
                        whenever a pupil slackens in his reading, or does not show him due
                        respect.”</p>

                    <p>The following is the report of the board of directors of the Anglo-American
                        Nile Steamers &amp; Hotel Co., Ltd., read at the general meeting of share
                        holders held in Cairo to-day :—</p>
                    <p>The directors, in presenting their fifth annual report and balance sheet, are
                        able to congratulate the shareholders on a year or exceptional prosperity in
                        the history of the company, and to point to a steady increase in all
                        branches of their business, the profits from all sources rising from LE.
                        18,086 in 1903 to L.E. 19,471 in 1904, and LE. 24,197 in 1905. These results
                        have been achieved in the face of very severe competition in the freight
                        service dating from the reduction of the Railway Administration’s tariff,
                        which involved a corresponding decrease in the rates charged by the company.
                        The increase of river and canal traffic between Cairo and Alexandria had led
                        to the issue of certain Government regulations which, if adhered to, are
                        likely to have serious results upon the future of transport by steam barge
                        in this country, Representations are, however, being made to the Public
                        Works Department which it is hoped will lead to their modification </p>

                    <p>Allusion was made in the last report to an arrangement by virtue of which an
                        option on the unissued share capital of the company was given against
                        £10,000 of debentures in the company taken firm by a local group and the New
                        Egyptian Company. The results of this operation have been fully commensurate
                        with the directors’ expectations. A valuable holding has been secured in the
                        Menzaleh Canal and Navigation Company shares; the order for the construction
                        of their fleet is being carried out in the company’s workshops ; and the
                        central management thereof is assured to this company for a period of two
                        years at a remuneration of £500 per annum.</p>

                    <p>Apart from profits derived from the usual sources of business, a special
                        profit has been made on the sale of the Savoy Hotel at Assouan, which has
                        been transferred for a sum of £60,000 to the newly-formed Upper Egypt Hotels
                        Co. The sale was made for cash, and the second instalment of £30,000 has
                        been paid over since the accounts have been closed. The directors are of
                        opinion that this profit should be considered as extraordinary and dealt
                        with accordingly. They therefore propose that ten thousand pounds shall be
                        placed to reserve and that the whole of the preliminary expenses, amounting
                        to L.E. 2,983.202 m/m, be written off. The continued existence of this
                        account, which has no realisable value, appears to them undesirable. The
                        directors, although entitled by law and precedent to their percentage of
                        this profit, are strongly of opinion that in cases where a profit is dealt
                        with as extraordinary and not distributed by way of dividend, the Board
                        should also forego their claim to a share in it. No deduction on this
                        account has therefore been made.</p>

                    <head>REDEMPTION OF DEBENTURES</head>
                    <p>The sale of the Savoy Hotel had allowed of the amortisation of the debenture
                        debt of the company amounting to £35,000. The interest on these debentures
                        at the rate of six per cent. constituted a heavy charge for the company, and
                        the directors are confident, that should occasion to borrow arise in the
                        future, they will be able to do so on more advantageous terms. As
                        amortisation only commenced as from May 1, no change is shown in the
                        balance-sheet in the total amount of debentures outstanding on 30th April,

                        insufficient they will be able to pump from the plant at present in use, end
                        thus prevent any shortage.</p>
                    <p>Regarding the insufficient supply, of which we have of late received
                        complaints, we learn that the maximum amount which the company is compelled
                        to pump per day, according to the contract with the Government, is 30,000
                        cubic metres, whereas they have pumped as much as 75,000 cubic metres in one
                        day. It is also interesting to note that they have pumped 68,101, 940 litres
                        of water so far this year, whilst during the corresponding period last year
                        they only pumped 44, 835, 880 litres, thus making an increase of 23, 266,
                        060 litres.</p>
                    <p>We have mentioned before that the price of ice as supplied by the company is
                        P.T. 3-5 per block. The company informs us that they sell the whole of the
                        ice produced to Messrs. Boehms and Anderer, who are under control not to
                        sell at any higher rate than P.T.3-5, whatever the consumption may be, and
                        it is only on account of people buying ice from other persons than the
                        recognised agents that a higher rate is paid.</p>

                    <p>The native Press is speculating a good deal on the reasons which led to the
                        selection of Boutros Pasha Ghali to accompany the Khedive to Europe. It is
                        said that he went to Constantinople in order to settle the question of the
                        Coptic Convent at Jerusalem. Another theory is that he is to be Prime
                        Minister on the retirement of Mustapha Pasha Fehmy, and so he has gone to
                        England to make himself acquainted with the King.</p>
                    <p>The Earl of Galloway, who is to be chairman of the new North Egypt Land
                        Company, is the eleventh holder of the title, and is concerned in no small
                        amount of land nearer home, the death of his brother four years ago having
                        made him not only an Earl but the owner of eighty thousand acres. Lord
                        Galloway was known until that event occurred as Captain Randolph Stewart, of
                        the Black Watch, a veteran of Crimea and of the Mutiny, and in October next
                        he will be entering upon his seventieth year. Descended from the Stewarts of
                        whom the Kings of Scotland and of England were a branch, Lord Galloway owes
                        his title to that Sir Alexander Stewart who, in 1607, was created Lord of
                        Garlies, and advanced to an earldom by James the Sixth in 1623.</p>

                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE.</p>
                        <p>Sir,-- I was delighted to see the noble protest of your correspondent in
                            to-day’s “Gazette” against the scheme of having pigeon shooting at the
                            Alexandria Sporting Club. The latest London papers announce that this
                            wicked and cruel so-called “sport” has been expelled from Hurlingham.
                            Every genuine sportsman will rejoice at the decision of the Hurlingham
                            Club to erase pigeon shooting from the list of “sports” practised at the
                            club. It would be difficult to advance a single argument in favor of its
                            continuance, save that of ancient usage, from which standpoint is claims
                            are equalled, if not surpassed, by those of cock-fighting or
                            bear-baiting. Even in its least objectionable form, pigeon-shooting
                            falls far below the modern standard of sport, in the lack of a fair
                            chance of escape for the quarry. In its lower, hole-and-corner aspects,
                            it lends itself to abominable cruelties, inflicted upon the birds in
                            order to affect their flight when they rise from the trap. The value of
                            Hurlingham’s decision lies not only in its immediate effect, but in the
                            promise which it holds out that either by force of example or by actual
                            legislation the “sport” may be abolished altogether throughout England,
                            and a blot which disfigures our sporting annals be thus for ever
                            removed. Let the A.S.C. take note, I am, Sir,</p>

                    <head type="sub">REPORT FOR THE YEAR 1904</head>
                    <p>At the beginning of the year there was a cash balance of P.T. 1,849. The
                        total receipts during the year amounted to P.T. 40,676. The subscriptions
                        and * donations amounted to P.T. 37,596 as compared with P.T. 15,216 on the
                        occasion when the last previous collection was made. The expenditure in 1904
                        amounted to P.T. 23,746, as compared with P.T. 19,864 in 1903.</p>
                    <p>There was a decrease in expenditure under the following heads :--1. Loans
                        granted ; 2. relief at Rudolph’s Home and school fees ; 3. fares to
                        Alexandria, etc. ; 4. burial and funeral expenses. There was an increase in
                        the amounts expended on passages to England, etc., and on hospital and
                        medicines. As regards the first item, the most costly case was that of a
                        mining engineer, who, though of English birth, had his home and family in
                        Australia and had therefore to be sent there. His relief and re-patriation
                        cost the fund P.T. 2,599. The next most important case was that of a
                        governess whose passage to England cost the fund £10. With regard to
                        hospital fees it should be stated that out of the total of P.T. 7,581 more
                        than P.T. 2,500 was expended on the maintenance at the Asylum of pauper
                        lunatics. There was a cash balance at the end of 1904 of P.T. 18,779. The
                        total assets at the end of 1904 amounted to P.T. 29,309 as compared with
                        P.T. 12,925 at the end of 1903. The total number of cases dealt with by the
                        fund was 122 as compared with 128 in the previous year. ** There was an
                        increase of 10 in the number of natives of the United Kingdom who were
                        relieved. Besides the relief given out of the fund, the Government of Malta
                        expended on hospital treatment and burials of distressed Maltese a total sum
                        of £188.0.3.</p>
                    <p>*Among the donations was one of £50 from the Daira Saideh Administration and
                        one of £50 from Mr. Pissoi, a Greek subject.</p>
                    <p>** Of these 51 were natives of the United Kingdom, 54 Maltese, 10 British
                        Indians, and 7 Colonial subjects.</p>

                    <p>The twenty-fifth annual general meeting of the shareholders of the Land and
                        Mortgage Company of Egypt, Limited, was held on the 19th inst., at
                        Cannon-street Hotel, E.C., under the presidency of Sir Edward Leigh
                        Pemberton, K.C.B. (the chairman).</p>
                    <p>The Secretary (Mr. J. Chisholm) read the notice convening the meeting and the
                        auditors' report.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman said : On the last two or three occasions I have had the
                        pleasure of addressing you I think I have commenced by address by saying
                        that I hoped the shareholders had as much pleasure in reading the report as
                        the directors had in preparing it. At the risk of appearing monotonous and
                        incapable of any fresh ideas on the subject, I should like to begin in the
                        same way to-day, because I am convinced that the shareholders will have read
                        the report with much satisfaction. We told you last year that we had every
                        reason to be satisfied with the position of the company and that we looked
                        forward with confidence to the future. The result of the past year's working
                        has shown that we were not too sanguine. The reserve fund has been built up
                        to £50,000, in addition to the capital reserve of £25, 180, and that amount
                        having been obtained, we have decided to distribute the bulk of the year's
                        profits in payment of the dividend. We propose to pay at the rate of 10 per
                        cent. for the whole year, as against 9 per cent. for the preceding one. We
                        are glad to be able to do this with still a margin left, as we feel that the
                        shareholders have exercised much patience and forbearance in the past, and
                        are entitled to the full benefit of our present prosperity.</p>
                    <p>The amount of capital invested this time last year was L.E.459,567. During
                        the past year new loans and investments have been made amounting to L.E.
                        131,316, making, together, L.E. 680,883. I might here mention that,
                        according to Mr. Hrui's report, all these new investments are on first-rate
                        securities. From this sum of L.E. 680,883 has to be deducted the sum of L.E.
                        87,235 for payments by the usual working of amortisation--- that is to say,
                        the gradual paying off of loans as previously advanced. The present capital,
                        therefore is L.E. 593,648, thus showing an increase of L.E. 44,081. This is
                        the largest amount invested at any date since the foundation of the company.
                        (Hear, hear.) I called attention last year to the great prosperity of Egypt,
                        and I am happy to say that it continues and extends to every branch of
                        business. We cannot, however, expect for ever to maintain the high rate of
                        interest we have sometimes received, particularly in the face of existing
                        competition and the floation of many new companies doing the same business.
                        We hope to obtain our share in the new business, and I may mention that
                        there is still a demand for money on the part of persons who are investing
                        in the purchase of land. On this point, I should like to read to you an
                        extract or two from our friend Mr. Huri's report as to the position and
                        future value of land in Egypt. He says: "Another factor which has
                        contributed, and will always contribute, to maintain the value of land is
                        the great number of native landowners, large and small, who have no debt and
                        who would absorb any quantity of land which would be offered. Such people,
                        who have excess of revenue over expenditure and who trust no other
                        investment than purchase of land, will always buy land, and they do not
                        consider the present prices as too high. Land to be reclaimed has much
                        increased in value ; for two reasons: first, that the Government has stopped
                        the sale of their waste land, and, secondly, the large margin between the
                        purchase price of this category of land, with cost of reclaiming work, and
                        the present value of good land. Very renumerative business has been done in
                        this branch, which is being taken advantage of by private individuals and by
                        companies. But where the rise has been most marked is in the value of land
                        for building purposes in Cairo and Alexandria and their suburbs. There the
                        increase has attained incredible proportions, and one cannot say that it is
                        not justified. The increase of population and of the welfare of the people,
                        and the penetration of modern ideas as to comfort and sanitation among the
                        natives have proved important factors in enhancing the price of land. New
                        quarters are continually created, with wide streets and magnificent
                        buildings, and rent is steadily increasing. Large fortunes are being made in
                        this branch of business, and companies are being started for this purpose.
                        Up to the present time, with experience and discernment in the choice of the
                        spots, there is still room for good business in these two branches.</p>
                    <p>I only refer to these extracts to show you that we may not maintain the
                        present high rate of interest. There is still very good business to be done
                        in the future, and of which, I need not say, we are convinced Mr. Huri will
                        secure us our fair proportion. I will now turn to the accounts which you
                        have before you. The gross earnings for the year, you will see, amount to
                        £44, 291 9s. 8d., and after deducting total expenditure, including interest
                        form debentures amounting to £27,202 2s. 3d., the net earnings for the year
                        are £17,089 7s. 5d., to which add balance brought forward from last year's
                        account, £2,400 8s. 2d., making together £19,489 15s. 7d. From this we
                        deduct the interim dividend paid on November 12 last, amounting to £ 6,750,
                        which leaves a balance of £12,789 15s. 7d. Out of this the directors have
                        placed</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>£2,000 to reserve for contingencies and granted £350 to the staff's provident
                        fund, leaving an available balance of £10,389 15s. 7d. Out of this we
                        recommend a dividend of 5 ½ per cent. for the past six months which, with
                        the 4 ½ per cent. paid in November, will make a dividend of 10 per cent. for
                        the year. This will absorb £8,250, leaving the sum of £2,139 15s. 7d. to be
                        carried forward. In order that you may see that the directors have not acted
                        inadvisedly in making this recommendation without consulting Mr. Huri, who
                        is the gentleman chiefly to be consulted on the subject, I should like to
                        read you another extract from his report, which shows that he approved of
                        what we are going to do. It is as follows: "The board having decided to stop
                        building their reserve and to divide the yearly earnings amongst
                        shareholders, we have to consider what can be fairly reckoned on as an
                        average net profit in the future. Well, considering the very sound and solid
                        position of the company, the perfect safety of our business, and the
                        prosperity of the country, also considering that we shall be able henceforth
                        to have the whole sum of £400,000 at our disposal, and that we have devery
                        reason to hope that no important sum will remain idle on this side, I
                        honestly believe, as far as a man can make prognostications for years to
                        come, that a net profit of £15,000 will not be an exaggerated average; so
                        that I think you can safely inaugurate this year the era of a ten per cent.
                        dividend." If you approve of that, we hope in the future to pay you 10 per
                        cent. by equal half-yearly payments---that is to say, 5 per cent. in
                        November next and 5 per cent. in May. I have referred once or twice to my
                        friend, Mr. Huri, who, I am happy to say, is present to-day and will be able
                        to give you any information you wish. I am sure the shareholders will
                        recognise, as the directors have always done, the great debt of gratitude
                        they owe to Mr. Huri for the ability and devotion he has given to the
                        company's affairs. I will now simply propose : "That the report and accounts
                        of the directors, submitted to this meeting, be, and are hereby received and
                        adopted, and that, as recommended by the board, a dividend at the rate of 10
                        per cent. per annum on the paid-up share capital of the company for the year
                        ended March 31, 1905-- (consisting of an interim dividend of 4 ½ per cent.
                        for the six months ended September 30, 1904, paid by the board on account in
                        November last, and 5 ½ per cent. for the six months ended March 31 last, now
                        to be paid), be, and is hereby, declared payable, free of income-tax."</p>
                    <p>Viscount Hampden, G.C.M.G., seconded the motion.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Skeel said there were two classes of shareholders who certainly ought to
                        congratulate the directors on the satisfactory result they had obtained,
                        namely, the original shareholders, who paid £5 for their shares, and those
                        shareholders who took up their shares at £5 16s. According to the report,
                        the first section had come by their own again, as had also those who paid £5
                        16s. for their shares. As he was the holder both those classes of shares, he
                        was very grateful to the directors for what they had done for them.</p>
                    <p>The resolution was carried unanimously.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman proposed the re-election of Sir Walter Frederick Mieville,
                        K.C.M.G., as a director of the company.</p>
                    <p>Mr. N. S. Stott seconded the motion, which was agreed to.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman next proposed the re-election of Mr. R.C. Johnston as a
                        director, remarking that he had been connected with the company for nearly
                        twenty-five years.</p>
                    <p>This was seconded by Viscount Hampden and agreed to.</p>
                    <p>On the motion of Mr. West, Messrs. Price, Waterhouse and Co. were reappointed
                        auditors.</p>
                    <p>Replying to a question, Sir W.F. Mieville said he did not like Mr. Huri to
                        take the entire responsibility of saying that they were fairly well assured
                        of paying a dividend of 10 per cent. in the future; but, as Mr. Huri very
                        properly put it, as far as human foresight and care went, they hoped to do
                        so. He did not want Mr. Huri to take the whole onus of that, supposing it
                        should turn out to be wrong ; but he wished to say that it was his (the
                        speaker's) opinion---and he was in Egypt his year---that they would be able
                        to do it easily for some time to come.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Huri then addressed the meeting, at the invitation of the shareholders.
                        After thanking the chairman for the very flattering remarks he had made
                        about himself, he stated that the report and the lucid remarks of the
                        chairman had fully explained the position of the company, and therefore it
                        was not necessary for him to address them at any length. Although the
                        interest on loans had gradually diminished, they hoped to continue to invest
                        their money, in very safe loans, at rates which would enable the board to
                        continue to pay a dividend of 10 per cent. (Hear, hear.)</p>
                    <p>On the motion of Mr. Skeel, a vote of thanks was given to the chairman and
                        directors, the speaker remarking that it was the first time that a ten
                        percent. dividend had been paid.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman briefly acknowledged the compliment, and the proceedings
                        terminated.</p>

                    <head>THE TRADE OF EGYPT</head>
                    <head type="sub">CUSTOMS RETURNS FOR APRIL</head>
                    <p>Egyptian trade continues to make very satisfactory progress. The totals of
                        the imports month by month show considerable increases over those of last
                        year, and the expansive power of the Egyptian imports appears to be
                        limitless. Last year, the total value of the imports, exclusive of tobacco,
                        was L.E. 19, 889,000, or L.E. 3,742,600 more than in 1903. It was difficult
                        to believe that the imports would show much of a surplus over the figures
                        month by month of the record year that has just passed. Yet as month by
                        month passes of the present year, steady progress is maintained, and from
                        the beginning of the year to the end of last month the value of the imports,
                        L.E. 6,441,159, shows an increase of L.E. 640,342 over the figures for the
                        corresponding period of last year, L.E. 5,801,119. The total for last month
                        was L.E. 1,602,959, a surplus of L.E. 87,357 over April, 1904.</p>
                    <p>The imports from England in April amounted to L.E. 573,724, as against L.E.
                        521,879 for the same month last year. For the first four months the imports
                        from home totalled L.E. 2,146,677, against L.E. 1,962,977 for the
                        corresponding period in the previous year.</p>
                    <p>The biggest increase in imports last month was in cotton textures, which
                        amounted to L.E. 248,658, or L.E. 43,388 over the previous April. This class
                        of imports for the first four months of this year amounted in value to L.E.
                        971,703, an increase of L.E. 216,868 over the same period in 1904.</p>
                    <p>The exports for April amounted to L.E. 1,521,871, an increase of L.E. 70,869.
                        Owing to the decrease in cotton exports since the beginning of the year.
                        L.E. 1,968,075 less than the corresponding four months in 1904, there is a
                        good deal of leeway to make up, and the total exports from January 1 to the
                        30th ulto. L.E. 7,025,998, show a decrease of L.E. 1,691,480 compared with
                        the same period the previous year.</p>
                    <p>The exports to England in April amounted to L.E. 805,991, as against L.E.
                        698,788 in the previous April. The chief increase in the April exports was
                        in sugar cane, L.E. 50,073, an increase of L.E. 45,597. Next came onions,
                        L.E. 181,183, an increase of L.E. 33,262. Cotton seed was a bad third, L.E.
                        116,751, an increase of L.E. 15,902. The increases in these three classes of
                        exports during the first four months of the year compared with the same
                        period in 1904 have been made respectively, L.E. 201, 054, L.E. 83,222, and
                        L.E. 7,850. The biggest decreases during the same period, exclusive of
                        cotton, have been in the case of beans, eggs, and rice, which show decreases
                        compared with the first four months of 1904 respectively of L.E. 22,588,
                        L.E. 19,534, and L.E. 13,861.</p>

                    <head>HEIHACHIRO TOGO</head>
                    <p>Heihachiro Togo, the great naval commander, who has so signally distinguished
                        himself, was born in 1857, and educated at the naval school, the Heigakuryo,
                        where, among his boy contemporaries, were two youths, destined in later days
                        to be known to the world as Admiral Ito and the present Naval Minister,
                        Baron Yamamoto. Togo's father was Kichizaemon Togo, a member of the Samurai
                        or warrior caste, and one of the class of which Ito and Field-Marshal
                        Yamagata are also members. In his sixteenth year, young Togo was sent by the
                        Emperor to England, to the Thames Nautical Training College, on board H.M.S.
                        "Worcester," and it will surprise no one to learn that his conduct while
                        there was officiailly stated to be "very good." Having returned to his
                        native country, he in due course entered the Navy, and the great career with
                        which all are now familiar began. For a long time he, of course, could only
                        serve his Sovereign in time of peace, but during the year which preceded the
                        war with China he was busy, watchful, faithful, ever on the look out for
                        something that could be improved, winning the confidence of his superiors,
                        the esteem of his equals, and the intense admiration of those who were under
                        him ; and the result of it all was that when the war with China broke out,
                        it found Captain Togo in command of the "Naniwa," one of the vessels in
                        Rear-Admiral Tsuboi's fleet. With the luck which is said to be his, it fell
                        to him to strike the first blow of the war, sinking the "Kowshing" with the
                        swiftnesss with which he has sunk so many Russian vessels as of late. His
                        promotion was swift, and as commander of the squadron that destroyed the
                        Chinese fleet, he was raised to be Admiral; and when, a year ago, it began
                        to be realised in Tokio that war with an infinitely greater power than China
                        was inevitably, the finger of the whole country was at once pointed to Togo
                        as the man to lead the Japanese fleet to victory and lure the Russian
                        warships to destructions. He was duly appointed, and calmly and deliberately
                        he laid down his plans. With what a deadly certainly they have been carried
                        out the whole world knows to-day.</p>

                    <head>GREEKS AND JEWS AT BRAILA</head>
                    <p>A very large proportion of the trade of the Danube passes through Braila,
                        which is one of the principal ports of Roumania, and which owes its
                        importance to its geographical position and to the trade in corn. Formerly
                        the greater part of the trade was in the hands of the Greeks, who are very
                        numerous at Braila, but, according to the "Bulletin d'Orient," of late years
                        a great number of Jews have settled in the town, and have seriously menaced
                        the monopoly of the Greeks. As the greater part of the commerce of Braila
                        depends on the grain trade, a poor harvest naturally a very bad effet on the
                        port, and the more so as the Roumanian peasants live almost entirely on
                        maize, and as the Government prohibits the export when the crop is short.
                        The Greeks have the greatest number of vessels engaged in the trade, as they
                        possessed last year one hundred and twenty-six ships, but Great Britain came
                        next with ninety-one, and Austria, Holland, and France followed in the order
                        named. But the effects of a bad year may be judged by the fact that in 1903
                        the Greeks had over two hundred steamers plying at the port, with a tonnage
                        nearly double that of last year. The fact is that the shipping trade of the
                        Danube is in a bad state, owing ot the competition of the shipowners and of
                        the railways, which between them have lowered the freights to an
                        unrenumerative rate.</p>

                    <head>RUSSIA AND AFGHANISTAN</head>
                    <p>Afghanistan, and, in fact, the outlook in Central Asia generally, are
                        occupying public attention in Russia. Thus the "Bourse Gazette" discusses
                        Afghanistan :–"Is it now the time for thinking about Central Asian affairs,
                        when we have on our shoulders the burden of the war in the Far East---a war
                        which has cost us already so many sacrifices and which is calling upon us
                        now to make colossal efforts? How can Russia think about Afghanistan at this
                        moment, when Russia itself must before all else extricate itself from its
                        own internal complicated crisis, which has lasted all too long, which
                        becomes more mischievous in character from day to day, and which demands all
                        the spiritual and material strength at the disposal of Russia? We know that
                        Russia's misfortune in war has aroused the appetites of its traditional
                        foes, that it has given wings to their old hopes, and that it has inspired
                        their speeches, the tone of which has shown us that, in their opinion,
                        Russia is weakened, helpless, and isolated for some time to come. But we
                        know well that their open and secret work will remain stillborn if only the
                        Russian Empire comes out honorably from its honorable crisis. Towards that
                        end, which is the only important end in view, all our efforts must be
                        directed. Then everything else will come to us in the end."</p>
