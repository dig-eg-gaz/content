                <p> RAILWAY RETURN TICKETS We notice that several of our contemporaries assert that
                    return tickets are to be re-introduced on the Egyptian State Railways. Their
                    Absence is one of the many things that may have struck the members of the recent
                    Railway Commission, and may have been remarked upon by them, any knowledge of
                    which (may be held to be sufficient ground for stating that the want will be
                    immediately supplied. These tickets were in force in former times and abolished
                    because of the openings they afforded for their fraudulent use. Things are more
                    orderly now, but on the other hand, the passenger traffic is heavier to deal
                    with, and generally speaking, we do not see on the Egyptian State Railways the
                    existence of those precautions necessary to control crowds of passengers. Until
                    provision for these is made we shall be surprised if return tickets are
                    introduced-it would only be courting failure. </p>
                <p> THE SUEZ CANAL The new Suez Canal proposals may be only a threat, and the scheme
                    may be impracticable, but it has certainly creaated a stir among the governing
                    body of the Canal. A considerable amount of correspondence bearing on the
                    question has passed between Egypt and Paris, with the result that four members
                    of the head administration, two French, one British, and one Dutch, have arrived
                    at Port-Said, and are busily engaged, amongst other things, in inspecting the
                    new harbour works, in the company M. Tillier, director-general from Cairo, and
                    M. Coulant, director at Port-Said. It is much to be regretted that the Canal
                    Company cannot see their way to give some public indication of the nature of
                    their scheme. From an outsidder's point of view, the progress of the works
                    appears to be so slow, and the plant and personnel are so trivial for such a
                    gigantic piece of work, that no real por extension seems likely to be
                    accomplished for many years. One would think that the present rate of
                    development of the country, and the congested state of the port of Alexandria,
                    would warrant the company’s tackling this large scheme in a more serious and
                    energetic manner. </p>
                <p>TO-DAY'S TELEGRAMS. FORT ARTHUR FORMAL ENTRY OF JAPS. SURRENDER INEXPLICABLE.
                    PORT ARTHUR, JANUARY 14. The Japanese have formally entered Port Arthur.
                    Detachments of all arms are marching to the sound of the bugle in the old and
                    new towns. (Reuter) TOKIO, January 14. The surrender of Port Arthur is
                    inexplicable because there were no signs of privation. The prisoners number
                    upwards of 24,000, excluding the sick and wounded. (Reuter.) </p>


                <p> TSAR AND PORT ARTHUR CONFIDENCE IN THE FUTURE St. Petersburg, January 14. The
                    Tsar in an order of the day to the Army and Navy announcing the fall of Port
                    Arthur, eulogizes the glorious garrison whose heroism Russia has witnessed with
                    pride. The order adds: “Peace he to the ashes of the dead, and glory to the
                    living. Our enemy is bold and strong. The struggle at such a distance is
                    indescribably hard, but Russia is powerful, and has undergone harder trials in
                    the past from which she always emerged more powerful. While lamenting our
                    losses, we must not become distracted. With all Russia, I trust that the hour of
                    victory will soon dawn and I pray God to bless our troops and fleets so that
                    they may be able to uphold the glory of Russia.” (Reuter.) ST. PETERSBURG,
                    January 14. An order of the day by the Tsar praises the heroic defence of Port
                    Arthur and foresees the early triumph of Russia. (Havas.) </p>

                <p> GENERAL STOESSEL RECEPTION AT NAGASAKI Nagasaki, January 14. General Stoessel
                    arrived here in the afternoon. The Governor, with a guard of honor, welcomed
                    him. </p>
