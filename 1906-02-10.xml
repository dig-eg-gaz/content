                    <p> To-day a naw epoob begins in the history of naval «instruction, with the
                        launching o the most powsrfol engine of deatrnotion the* baa ever been
                        devised, for the Dreadnought, which will be laanohed by the King this
                        afternoon ia a battleship potency. Whst will the Admiralty do with thi» ship
                        of tremendous power when th, in commission and flying the white puiga I Wi'h

                        damage by gutfire at ordinary battle rangs. The Atlantio Fleet is the
                        •‘pivot” force of the navy, and oonaequently it is in the natoral order of
                        thioga that his Majesty’s ship Dreadnought should be attached to this furoe,
                        whidi is commanded by Vioe-Admiral Sir W. H. May. That Admiral's flagship,
                        oommandgd by CapL A. C. Leveaon, at the late “battis prso- tioe," when
                        steaming at fifteen knots, fiisd eleven shells from her fonr 19in. gnus and
                        hit the target—nearly three and a half miles distant — ten times, discharged

                    <p> When the Dreadnought joins the Atleaiù Fleet ia the early months of 1907,
                        this fora will be the most strategical unit which bai ret been placed under
                        the orders of an admiral. Its creation a year ago was a stroke of geoim

                        question whether the time had not come to oonsider th» poesibi lity of
                        donbliog the oanal, or outting a separate a </p>
                    <p> "This is only another plea for a teoond ial," remarked a leading City

                        gone before. M. Binning gives an additional unsn»werable reason for the
                        fai'h which it in him. When the Chatham sank she not only blocked the
                        waterway, but menace to the oanal itself, for she had a large quantity of
                        dynamite in her hold. 8he wa» got o .t of the way very expeditiously, on'y.
                        I thiuk, about a week being oooupied in o'earanoa, whereas some of as had
                        anticipated that the task would take a month. The operation was exceedingly
                        well oarried out, and bat little damage WM done to the maL But brief as was
                        the delay, it meant grievous loss to the shipping and mercantile oommnoity. </p>
                    <p> "This experience shows how easily a tingle oanal may be blooked either by
                        accident or dasign. Bat there are other reasons why a second canal should be
                        ont There is the defaooe of India to be oootidered. and on this point we are
                        backed up by the highest military opinion. Faithermore, we know in praotioe
                        that we have reached the limit of the oapacity of tha siogle oanal. The
                        oong»stion becomes w >r*e every day, and we h»ve to faoe the dead ovrtainty
                        of increasing delays in making the passage with our ships. </p>

                    <p> ‘Another argument it that the ooet of transit through the existing oanal is
                        absurdly High—more than donble as muoh as ikonght to be—and this is a great
                        deterrent or impediment to Eastern trade. By reduoing the oanal dees
                        one-half yon would immediately lower ths rate of oarriage from the Bast, and

                    <p> I base this last assertion on the fsot that the oanal is enormously over oa
                        pi tali ted, and yet is able to pay 80 per oent. from the profi’s— and this,
                        in breach of a specific agreement entered joto^by the oompany with British
                        shipowners, under which it WAS arranged that after paying v5 per oent all
                        profi t should go 10 redno io i of duns. </p>
                    <p> 'An addttoiial point to be considered is that a seoood canal oould be made
                        for an infinitely leu exp nditara of oapital than was rvqiired for the firs'
                        osna1, the Britiib Government giving a gnaran'ee—which it could do without
                        risk—for a 5 per oent. dividend. Under sueha dividend ships oould be allowed
                        through for one-third the present dues. LOOM end Aird, Jacks in, or any one
                        of many contractors would, I am sere, readily undertake ths work. Yon would
                        have contractors competing for it if the British Government took the matter
                        up." </p>
                    <p> The Oppeelte View. </p>
                    <p> The oppoii'S point of view has been stated in an interview with a direotor
                        of the 8urz Canal ooeupany which appeared in the ‘ Phoe- in wbich it w*t
                        mentioned that the dividend was high but shareholders, being burner, desired
                        to get at muoh *s they oould. Asked wbat be thought about the threat of a
                        rival canal, the direotor repl ed that, io h;a opinion, the proposal was
                        preposterous. F ran or, he said, owned £66,000.0'O of the share oaii- tel
                        *.f ih» oanal the British Government nearly £34 O' 0,000 ; moreover, Great
                        Britain was ths trn-tee of Etypt, to which the oanal would •vert in sevemy
                        years: Th»t, he sd ■boaId be sufficient in itself. It was absurd >y that a
                        iw n canal oould he constructed for £5,' 0»,000 Ttiis would be revised when
                        it was remembered that not only would ths canal have to be made, but a port
                        would h»ve to be created in the Mediterranean, another in the Red Sea. Tbe
                        direotor, aom- ming op the whole nutter, declared that the agitation for a
                        seoood canal would only have the effect of putting op tha baoks of the
                        French shareholders, by which fntnre concessions might be endangered. </p>

                        'Standard." One authority deolared, ‘ 1 never looked on the agitation lor
                        increased canal f cilities as in any way •ariooa, and I *h >nld be surprised
                        to bear that there are many people who understand ths question who are not
