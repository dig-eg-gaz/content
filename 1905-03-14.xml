                        about to enjoy a sunrise of unprecendented splendour, for never, surely, has

                    <p>discontent more severse. East and WEst, at home and in Manchuria, the future
                        s equally shrouded in impenetrable gloom, and such speculations as it is
                        possible to make con- cerning the course of events only seem to create that
                        "darkness visible" which Milton imagined as the only light in Hell. Little
                        by little we are learning what the vast Japanese host beyond the Sha-ho has
                        succeeses in doing. Time has fought on the side of the commander nearest to
                        his base. As everybody might, surely, have seen (but as curiously, many did
                        not see), Russia never had a serious chance of bringing more ment into the
                        field than Japan. And the release of Nogi's force before Port Arthur has
                        effectually decided the question of numbers. Oyama, confident in numerical,
                        as well as other, superiority, has acheieved a great enveloping movement and
                        inflicted on the Russian Army the more crushing defeat of the war. The
                        telegrams to-day form gruesome reading. Official despatches record the loss
                        of nearly 500 guns and over 200,000 men. Ge- neral Kuropatkin, telegraphing
                        on the 11th inst., admits that out of two regiments there were only 150 and
                        619 survivors respectively. The Russian dead, we are told,were everywhere,
                        and from the 28th February to the 11th inst. 47,581 wounded were sout North.
                        Apparently, the First Army alone is intact, the whereabouts and condition
                        of the remainder being quite incertain. It is doubtful, says Reuter, if the
                        remains of the shattered armies are capable of holding out, if the pursuit
                        is pressed more. The position of the Russian Army is therefore obviously one
                        of utter desperation. Kuropatkin has been deprived of that last blessing, an
                        alternative. As seems in the highest degree probable, if the Japanese
                        tactics prove suc- cessful, his retreat from Mukden will be cut off, and all
                        that will remain will be standing still and - surrendering. In little over a
                        day the complexion of affairs has changed. The retire- ment on Harbin has
                        been rendered almost impossible. Probably it is quite impossible by this
                        time. Kuroki has driven in the left flank, Nodzu is forcing back the centre,
                        Oku and Nogi are trespassing on the right, while a strong Japanese force has
                        obtained pos- session of the Harbin road. The Russians fight bravery - much
                        more bravely than might have been predicted. Either they have not credited
                        the news from the interior or their country, or they are not in so revolu-
                        tionary a frame of mind as the reformers would have us believe. It is
                        impossible to suppose that the fight between the Tsar and his people has had
                        any efect on their military prowess. After all, the simple explanation may
                        be that a Russian soldier can attend to only one thing at a time, and
                        Kuropatkin's men have been deafened to all other considera- tions by the
                        roar of the Japanese guns, accou- panied as it is by an insuffciency of food
                        and by the horro of utter discouragement. The Russian soldier is the
                        outstanding tragic item in the situation though no one bestows much thought
                        on him.</p>

                        are now all but completed for the commencement of a further considerable

                    <p>Writing in the "Financier" of the 4th inst., Mr. W. Tattersall stated that
                        the cotton trade in Lancashire was in a state of unexampled prosperity,
                        excepting the fine yarn department. "Every day," he continued, "we have
                        reports in the papers of proposals to erect weaving sheds in different parts
                        of Lancashire. Co- operative provision societies are offering help in sevral
                        cases. No doubt there are at the present time a fair number of sheds going
                        up, and if the list proposed goes thorugh there will be by the end of the
                        year a moderate increase in the number of looms. The question arises - Where
                        are the operative weavers to come from to fill these new places I At present
                        there is a scarcity of this kind of labour,"</p>

                    <p>A motor, while coming from the garden of Mena House on Sunday, ran over a
                        little norite donkey boy of about 8 years. The boy was seriously hurt,
                        having a fracture of the shoulder and one arm broken. Drs. Milton and Wake-
                        ling, who happened to be on the spot, ad­ministered first aid. The boy was
                        taken to Dt. Milton's Hospital, but there is little hope of his
                        recovery.</p>
                    <p>A correspondent write*"Motorcars should really not be allowed to drive
                        through the gates of Mena, for in addition to being a greet nuisance to
                        visitors taking their tea on the terrace of the hotel, they are a constant
                        danger to any one on the road outside the gates, and it is a wonder that
                        accidents have not happen­ed before- It is impossible for a motor driver to
                        see what is going on in the road, when he starts inside the gates in front
                        oi the terraae, and as they generally do not leave at a slow pace, they
                        upset the whole traffic outside. A notice has been put up by the management
                        of the hotel to prevent automobiles entering the grounds, but nobody seems
                        to pay any heed |to it. The police, who are stationed opposite tho hotel,
                        should certainly lend their assistance to stop the nuisance."</p>

                    <p>Mr, W, W. A. Fitzgerald gave an interesting lecture at Coxton Hall,
                        Westminster, last week under tbo auspices of the League of the Em­pire, ou
                        "The Anglo-Egyptian Sudan—Gordon's trust." Sir Charles Lyall, who presided,
                        ex­plained that the objects oi the league, which was established three years
                        ago, wore to in­spire personal and active interest in the Empire, and to
                        promote educational and friendly intercommunication between its diffe- rent
                        parts. It was just twenty years and a month ago that General Gordon died,
                        and the great work ot civilisation which bail since been nooutuplUbetl would
                        bo described by Mr. Fits- Coraid. After remarking that no not of Gor­don's
                        life could have drawn Great Britain to the completion 61 hi* groat task iu
                        the Sudan to much as his death, and that Dervish mis­rule and anarchy had
                        muro limn justified the uuipdgn which had brought the country under tho
                        British and Egyptian flags, the lecturer excited tho interest of the
                        audience by giving a series ol views of the country, the pcoplo, and tho
                        Blue and Whito Mile, a hich enabled him to show that Gordon had not died in
                        vein. Tbo journey betwoeu Cairo and Khartoum across an unknown, dangerous,
                        and Waterless desort could now be covored in perfect safety and comfort in

                        of Ljrd Kitchener in his Lm-iu&lt;*rablo campaign. Pictures of the railway,
                        the desert, tho groat barrage works on the Mile, and the other engineering
                        triumphs achieved in the sudd regions, formed a fitting introduction to

                        among others, the son of tho late K hah fa was learning (be trade of a car-
                        Muter, which ho preferred* to going to school. After describing the progress

                        said that it Gordon could now see be Sudan he would know that England hud
                        Invert to do her duty towards it. His statue ras her last pledge that

                    <p>CRUELTY TO BIRDS. </p>
                    <p>To rni; Eniimt or the ''Eovptian Gazetvx" Dear Sir,—May I venture in the
                        columns of your valuable paper to call the attention of , the travelling
                        publio to the distressing cruel­ties that aro to be seen practised towards
                        birds', at some of the stations touched at by the ?leamcrs going up and
                        down-the Nile, arising, so I am told, from tourists and others having given
                        money in order to release the poor victims-*- this, of course, is obviously
                        fatal. Birds with broken wings and leg* and with wing feathers palled out,
                        strings of small Unis lied t*-gather are to bo seen—dangled most cruelly
                        before the passengers' eyes iu b'«pe of getting money. When once tho native
                        grasps that he will be punished and not re­warded for this, the practice
                        will aoon cease,' and if only one quarter of the hundreds of, tourist* »bo
                        visit the Mile would take the 1 bird away without giving money a great check
                        j would be givoa. I have seen a fellow traveller, a lady, oa more than one
                        occasion administer a sharp stroke with her parasol, startling tho offender
                        so that the bird was dropped, and she was able to take it away. On one of
                        Gpok's steamers, we had a moat humane manager who personally rescued many a
                        tortured victim. Wo were glad to hu-jir him aay that his firm were anxious
                        lor their employes to do all they can to stop it May 1 vesture to oiler one
                        or two suggestions; 1st, that oa the steamer, a notice should be put up
                        asking passengers not to give moo*y fur die birds, 2nd, at the stopping
                        place, of the boats, notices in Arabio should be placed, thru no money will
                        be given for birds brought in such a manner, and that instead jlfcudcr* lay
                        themaeJve* open to punishment; ird,instructions to be given to the police to
