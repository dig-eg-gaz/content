                        <p><placeName>New York,</placeName> July 25. M. Sato, the spokesman of Baron
                            Komura, in an interview, said that he was confident that peace will be
                            successfully negotiated. - The Japanese will be guided by moderation,
                            and will not make excessive demands. But as the war is costing a million
                            dollars a day, there is a feeling that there ought to be an indemnity.
                            It is probable that the conclusion of an armis- tice will be the first
                            move of the negotiations. (Reuter.)</p>

                        <p>A native of Mellawi recently brought some hashish paste home in a tin,
                            and after taking a dose, handed the rest to his wife to keep. She
                            tasted, and tasted more, with the result that at 10 p.m. she took a
                            small roof lamp for a fire and began to scream. Her husband, awakened
                            from his stupor by her cries, also saw a fire devouring his house and
                            roared for help. The neighbours, hearing the noise, sent for a

                            followed the shawish into the house their alarm gave place to huge

                            with the sole object of assisting British trade in this country. The
                            services of the Chamber are always at the disposal of any member
                            desiring information on trade matters generally, including the question
                            of appointing suitable agents. As no fee is charged for such advice, it
                            is obviously in the interests of all British traders here to become
                            members, especially when it is remembered that the annual sub- scription
                            is merely the nominal one of £1. The latter payment also includes a copy

                    <p>(From our Correspondent.)</p>
                    <p>Suez, Wednesday. The Jewish refugees who lately arrived at Suez from Yemen,
                        state that about 10,000 refugees are now at Adeu, of whom 2,000 are Jews and
                        8,000 Moslems.</p>
                    <p>The rising in the Yemen, according to their statements, is owing to the
                        discontent of the inhabitants, who prefer to be ruled by Imam Yehia,—who has
                        a claim to the throne as a descendant of the old rulers,—rather than by the
                        Turkish Government Imam Yehia , appear! to be a good and very popular
                        leader, and is beloved throughout the Yemen.</p>
                    <p>The insurgents seem to have taken the upper hand, and the rising has become
                        general. San’a, the capital of Yemen, was closely surround- ed by the
                        insurgents, and all communications are cut. The Turkish troops defending the
                        town suffered considerably on account of their being short of provisions,
                        eta, before the capture of the place.</p>
                    <p>Strange to say, the insurgents are very well armed with rifles of the latest
                        type, and have got ample supplies of ammunition.</p>
                    <p>A Constantinople contemporary contains (at last) some references to the Yemen
                        rising. We learn that "in consequence of some slight disturbances in the
                        Vilayet," Marshal Shakir Pasha, with some battalions, attacked a village
                        occupied by the rebels, of whom hundreds strewed the ground, while one
                        Turkish soldier alone fell wounded. The inhabitants of the country implored
                        the Sultan's clemency with tears and prayers, asserting that they had been
                        driven to revolt by the threats of the Imam's followers. They were pardoned
                        by Marshal Shakir Pasha, who, with Ahmed Faizi Pasha, is on the march to
                        San'a, winning daily victories.</p>
                    <p>The non-Tarkuh Press seems to have taken an alarmist view of the situation in
                        Arabia, or can it be that the exigencies of the censorship demand the
                        publication of military romances?</p>

                    <head>THE NILE FLOOD.</head>
                    <p>The rise of the Nile continues very slowly, as the comparative table of the
                        present and last year's gauges shows, and it is probable that the flood will
                        not be appreciably felt in Lower Egypt until towards the end of next month.
                        The result of this continued slow rise is, as we announced in a recent
                        issue, that it has been found necessary to alter the rotations to six days'
                        working and twelve days' stoppage, with the exception of lands where rice is
                        cultivated, in which cases five days' working and only five days' stoppage
                        are permitted. Our Nile gauge table has been somewhat incomplete for the
                        last few days on account of the irregularity with which some of the read-
                        ings are received at the Ministry of Public Works. No reading of the
                        Rosaires guage has been received at the Ministry since the 21st of this
                        month, and it has been suggested that this is due to a breakdown in the
                        telegraphic system. The readings of Assouan, upstream, also have not been
                        received since July 20 either by telegram or by letter, bat this reading is
                        not of great importance, and oar readers will be able to gauge the condition
                        of the river at this point from the downstream readings.</p>

                        repay, in cash, the debt of the Daïra Sanieh. This decision, taken in

                        1890, and November, 1904, promulgated with the assent of the Powers, binds
                        bondholders of all nationalities. ln consequence, Coupon No. 30, falling due
                        on October 15 next, will be the last coupon paid by the controllers, and the
                        bonds in circulation must be presented for repayment. All bonds, stamped,
                        must be de- posited, at latest, on October 1 next. It has been decided to
                        redeem the stamped bonds in October, in cash, instead of an exchange against

                        <byline>( From our Correspondent. )</byline>
                        <dateline>Port Said, Wednesday.</dateline>
                        <p>During the past few days quite a number of German colliers have passed
                            through here on their way back from China and Rodjestvensky’s fleet—many
                            of them with their original cargoes still on board. Yesterday, the
                            Macedonia, one of the fleet of 21 which remained in Port Said Six weeks
                            on her way out, arrived from the Canal to await orders, and at 8 p.m. a
                            fire was discovered in her main hold, amongst her cargo of coal, which
                            had been on board over seven months. The fire is undoubtedly due to
                            spontaneous combustion, and this is not sur- prising, considering the
                            length of time the coal has been under hatches. The Canal Company's fire
                            appliances were at once got ready in anti- cipation of the necessity of
                            flooding the ship, and she was, at midnight, placed in the petro- leum
                            basin, out of the way of other ships, in case she might become much
                            worse. All hatches have been Carefully closed and it is hoped that the
                            fire will smother itself out in a short time.</p>

                        <head>THE ST. KILDA STORY.</head>
                        <p>In your yesterday’s issue I notice a para- graph to the effect that the
                            members of the St. Kilda's crew who were landed here from the Dneiper
                            express surprise and amassment at the report that a display of force was
                            made here by British cruisers. The paragraph which you reproduced from a
                            Marseilles paper was so supremely ridiculous that at the time I did not
                            think it worth while contradicting. There was not the least difficulty
                            about land- ing the men here ; no official representations were made by
                            the captains of the British men of-war, nor did they or the British Con-
                            sul present any ultimatum— in a neutral sea- port ! and the two cruisers
                            certainly did not heave up anchors, as the Marseilles paper states. The
                            matter was all arranged by 3 p.m. and the crew quietly landed, without
                            the least fuss, nor was any doubt expressed about their landing here
                            even by the men themsel- ves, for they were told in the canal that they
                            would be liberated, though the captain might, proceed to Libau.</p>

                        <head>THE NEW ABBAS MOSQUE</head>
                        <p>The Abbas Mosque, which was formally opened by Sheikh Abdul Gomel on the
                            16th inst., is a building of considerable beauty. Standing in its own
                            courtyard, rearing its white and blue minaret far above its some- what
                            squalid surroundings, it, by mere com- parison, at once attracts the
                            eye. The outer walls are painted red and yellow in horizontal bars, its
                            24 windows are fitted with handsome iron "grilles," and its three
                            entrances re- present the old style of Moorish architecture in all its
                            beauty. The interior, which is scrupulously clean, is lit by
                            electricity, and the woodwork is highly polished, the prevail- ing
                            colours being brown and red with patches of blue here and there. A
                            spiral stairway leads to a gallery at the west end of the building, and
                            its roof is supported by four rows of pillars, which are also the
                            support of 16 Moorish arches, all of dazzling whiteness. The whole
                            appearance of the mosque is decidedly at- tractive, and a visit amply
                            repays the curious.</p>

                        <head>HABIB PASHA'S DISMISSAL.</head>
                        <p>(From a Correspondent).</p>
                        <p>The discharge of the Vice-President of the Administrative Council, Habib
                            Pasha El Saad, is the topic of the day in Lebanese and Beirutine
                            circles. During the short period of financial plenty preceding the
                            ignominious fall of his banking firm, Habib Pasha, by the free use of
                            gold and skilful insinuations, obtained not only the title of Pasha and
                            its accompany- ing honors, but the support of high quarters at
                            Constantinople, and this, combined with the fact of his belonging to one
                            of the well-known Maronite families of the Lebanon, was the most potent
                            factor in his election ; for France bas been the patron nation of the
                            Maronites ever since Lebanon’s partial independence. Habib Pasha,
                            however, is a characteristic type of the Oriental diplomatist with whom
                            finesse is the supreme end, and the cultivation and exercise of which
                            may, if necessary, be made at the expense of principle. Habib Pasha pos-
                            sessed in a high degree this finesse ; indeed he is “trop fin," as one
                            of the Consuls once said. As a matter of fact, having secured his object
                            from French patronage, he turned to court English favor. But diplomacy
                            in Lebanon is as jealous as an Oriental maid, and dalliance with consuls
                            of different Powers finally ended in the disgrace of the diplomatic
                            flirt.</p>
                        <p>The career of Habib Pasha has not been a brilliant one in the full sense
                            of the term, as indeed no career can be under the regime of the present
                            Mutessarif, whose dread of party ascendancy has led him to the
                            annihilation of all parties, the result of which was the aliena- tion of
                            all sympathies. He stands now in cold isolation resting on very unstable
                            ground. Solidarity is an inherent quality of civic life, and will always
                            determine the existence of parties. It is the skilful control of this
                            party feeling and force that constitutes real states- manship.</p>
                        <p>Some assert that Habib Pasha, with all his unprincipled finesse, kept
                            himself above the general taint of bribery, while others occupying high
                            official positions, who have been in sufficient proximity to see things
                            hidden from the general gaze, allege that if he has not stooped to petty
                            briberies he has deftly committed wholesale ones in the monopo- ly of
                            the carriage tax, the carriage road contracts, and in the widespread
                            changes in the mayoral posts. My personal knowledge of Habib Pasha
                            enables me to affirm that, whatever failings he may have, he certainly
                            cannot be charged with being a man of petty aims, and the facts I am
                            giving are simply the re flection of the public mind, which
                            unfortunately for our Pasha is not very kindly disposed towards him.</p>
                        <p>The mayors or sheikhs of villages in the Lebanon are supposed to be the
                            representatives of the people, and although they are elected on the high
                            principle of universal suffrage, yet in their election the intrigues of
                            priestly and consular parties enter so largely that these sheikhs no
                            more represent public opinion than would the chosen creatures of
                            priestly or con- sular patronage. And then the passion for politics has
                            been fostered so much in the heart of the Lebanese, and consular favor
                            has come to be regarded by him so much an end of existence, that the
                            best-intentioned amongst them ends by sacrificing the public good for
                            such petty ends. The mayoral posts have, therefore, come to be important
                            factors in the ballots for high appointments, and for all the miserable
                            ammout of the salary, they have come to be objects of important bribes.
                            One handled sterling is no uncommon bribe for the obtaining of the post
                            of Sheikh Sulh.</p>
                        <p>Now, whether a dim knowledge of these alleged disloyalties has been the
                            determining factor of dismissal or not, it is certain that the
                            Mutessarif has for some time back been keep- ing Habib Pasha in office
                            under the com- pulsion of higher influences. Lately, however, on
                            perceiving that the powerful support of the French Consulate was
                            withdrawn owing to the Vice-President's assiduous atten- tions to
                            another Consulate, the chief saw his opportunity and dealt the long con-
                            templated blow. It is said that the Mowing was the apparent occasion for
                            dismissal. Colonel Barbar Bey, who, by the way, is brother-in-law of
                            Habib Pasha, had presented to the Administrative Council a petition to
                            invite tenders for the supply of uniforms for the soldiery. The 17th of
                            July was fixed for the reception of the different tenders and the
                            decision as to the most suitable. In the mean- time, Barbar Bey, in
                            secret accord, it is said, with his brother-in-law, had concluded the
                            contract with a certain Mr. Abela, a British subject of Maltese origin,
                            and in soliciting the official sanction of the Council he urged that, as
                            the supply was of an exceptionally argent nature and the tender seemed
                            to him an ad- vantageous one, he deemed it advisable to close it. The
                            members of the Council are said to have been prepared by the astute
                            Vice- President, and to their decision the unsuspect- ing Mutessarif
                            fixed his seal.</p>
                        <p>A few days later the other contractors who had been left in the lurch
                            raised, as may be imagined, a scandal which did not fail to reach the
                            ears of the Governor-General, who there- upon wrote a letter to Habib
                            Pasha calling upon him to cause the Council to retract its decision,
                            failing which he would hold him personally responsible for the
                            consequences. It may be parenthetically observed that the Administrative
                            Council has, ever since the premature fading of the first glow of
                            Musaffer pasha's prestige, made a point of opposing any scheme that they
                            knew he had at heart, and Habib Pasha, with his diplomatic talent, was
                            the fittest person to act as the intermediary and conciliating medium
                            between the Governor and the recalcitrant Council, and some allege that
                            he not unfrequently used to secretly set the latter against their
                            President in order to strengthen his hold on his chief. In this con-
                            nection one cannot help passing a remark on the injudiciousness of the
                            law that provides for the retention in office of the members of the
                            Administrative Council of Lebanon for a period of six years, and the non
                            liability to dismissal except for a criminal or judicial offence.</p>
                        <p>Now Habib Pasha made a dry reply to the Governor’s covert threat, saying,
                            with a show of truth and reason, that the decision he was asking him to
                            subvert had been duly signed and sealed by the Governor him- self.
                            Thereupon Muraffer Pasha wrote the Vice- President a personal letter
                            couched in very courteous terms, which some qualified even as
                            undignified, in which he said that be regretted he felt compelled to
                            inform Habib Pasha that his services were no more required. It is said
                            that the officer who had been charged with the conveyance of the
                            missive, meeting Habib Pasha at Alay, told him that his chief had
                            written him a personal letter which had been sent to his Beyrout address
                            in the hope that it would reach him more quickly. Muraffer Pasha had
                            just happened to arrive at Aley to call on the British Consul-General,
                            and Habib Pasha hied to meet his chief. “I have been told," he said,
                            “that your Excellency has written me a letter which has been sent to
                            Beyrout. May I ask what the purport of it is" "You shall know when yon
                            read it," was the dry reply. Habib Pasha then repaired to the British
                            Consulate to learn there the news of his dismissal.</p>
                        <p>It is believed that the Kaimakam of Metn, Emir Youssef Ismail Bellama, is
                            to succeed to the Vice-Presidency, although I myself consider this
                            appointment open to doubt, as the Emir Youssef prefers to keep the
                            Kaimakamat owing to its being a more lucrative and a less res- ponsible
                            and troublesome post than the Vice- Presidency, for which his rather
                            delicate health partly incapacitates him. Should the Kaima- kamat of
                            Metn become vacant it will be filled presumably by Sheikh Rachid E1
                            Khasen, the oft-dismissed Kaimakam of cosmic tame.</p>
                        <p>Small fortunes will be made through these appointments, and meantime this
                            unhappy province, that fades under the fatal shadow of the wings of the
                            seven Powers, is bleeding to death, or at least to anaemic exhaustion,to
                            fatten the lightly chosen rulers of its destiny.</p>

                        <p>The wind was fresh from the N.W. In Class 1., the handicap was again
                            fairly good. The Minnie and Coot each have 9 points for the monthly
                            prize, so have tied and will race a special race to decide the winner.
                            In Class II. the Derphil carries off the prize, having 10 points against
                            the Jessica’s S. Unfortunately the Jessica loses her points for July 12,
                            when the Celtic ran into her and pat her “hors da combat”</p>
                        <p>Next week there will be a special single race for the cups (one for each
                            class) kindly given by the Sporting Club. The handicap will be re- vised
                            for the same.</p>
