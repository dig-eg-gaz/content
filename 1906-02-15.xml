                    <p>Berths can be definitely engaged beforehand. Plans can be seen at the Offices
                        of the Company's Agents.</p>
                    <p>The through Steamers for Marseilles, Gibraltar, Plymouth and London are
                        Intended to leave Port Said after the arrival of the 11 a.m. train from
                        Cairo, every Monday. A steam tender will meet the train to convey passengers
                        to the ship.</p>
                    <p>The Brindisi Express Steamer leaves Port Said directly the Indian Mails
                        arrive. Passengers can go on board the evening before.</p>
                    <p>The express steamer usually reaches Brindisi on Wednesday afternoon, the
                        special train starting at 8 p.m. and arriving in London at the very
                        convenient hour of 4.56 p.m. on Friday.</p>
                    <p>The combined Sea and special train fare is £22.9.11 Port Said to London via
                        Brindisi or via Marseilles.</p>
                    <p>Passengers having paid fall fare in one direction are allowed an abatement of
                        25 per cent, on returning within 12 months.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the above regular weekly service there are sailings about
                        twice a fortnight of 5,000 to 7,000 tons steamers to London, calling at
                        Malta or Marseilles.</p>
                    <p>TO THE EAST.</p>
                    <p>The Mail Steamers leave Suez for Aden and Bombay every Wednesday, and for
                        Australia and China every alternate Wednesday. A steamer leaves for
                        Calcutta, fortnightly, and another for Japan. Passengers can embark at Port
                        Said.</p>

                        <p>The weather in the early part of yesterday was bright and cheerful, but
                            as the day advanced ominous clouds gathered and the atmosphere became
                            strongly charged with electricity. There was considerable loghtning and
                            thunder about 9 p.m., and this was followed by a moderate gale from the
                            W. The morning opens cool, cloudy, and dull, with squalls from the W.
                            and a falling barometer.</p>

                    <p>THURSDAY, FEBRUARY 15., 1906. MOROCCO CONFERENCE. It is almost a traiem to
                        say that the solemn conolavə which is being held at Algeciras involves
                        interests far wider than those of a semi-barbarian people in the north west
                        corner of Africa. Roughly speaking, the Conference will decide whether the
                        nations of Europe are determined to live in peace with out another or
                        whether they are still a lot of squabbling children, ready to take offence
                        at the first word spoken in a moment of anger. The responsible men of the
                        countries most interested have openly declared that they wait nothing so
                        much as peace. Bat the crucial question is now being discussed by the
                        delegates, and by their fraita we shall know tham. Germany has deliberately
                        thrust the policing question into the forefront of the controversy.. It she
                        had oontouted herself with her woonomio / claims her positioa would have
                        been onassail able. By the Madrid Treaty of 1880 she is entitled to equal
                        commercial treatment and the open door. Rugland, for bør own purpo:es,
                        limited her demands for equal treatment to a period of thirty years. But she
                        could not, of course, bind Germany by any private arrangement made' between
                        herselt. and France ; therefore Germany was perfeotly justified in taking
                        steps to make it known that there was to be no limitation of time as far as
                        she was concerned ; she stood abaqlately by the Mad. 'rid Treaty, and
                        claimed her tall rights. The point was perhaps an insignificant one, not
                        worth all the fass that has been made about it, since France always declared
                        her intention of preserving the open door, and there woald have been ample
                        time for Germany to ory oat when she was actually chreatened. Still she had
                        a right to make her voice heard at any time if she'thought her interests
                        were in any danger; and no one would object to her endeavour to make her own
                        position quite clear. | Unfortunately, she- dragged politios into what was
                        really an economio question. She . believed, or professed to believe, that
                        the Rronoh were aiming at a sort of protectorate over Morocco, "and that,
                        while nominally adhering to the prinsiple of the open door at the porta,
                        they would opposo German enterprise in each matters as financial and railway
                        exploitation. Booba polioy would, she contended, be contrary to the spirit
                        of the Madrid Treaty. In order to prevent the realisation of such a
                        protectorato Germany is det soined that the seounty of life and property in
                        Morocco must be guaranteed by some sort of interna cional control, and not
                        by Pradoe alone. l'he proposal she is believed to have in view is one which
                        will hand over the policing of Morocco to some disinterested Power who will
                        be the mandatory of all the civilised nations, She will leave to France the
                        task of polioing tbo Algerian frontier – that was oonoeded from the first in
                        the negotiations which led to the acceptance of the Conference ; and Spain
                        will be allowed a similar privilege in the parts of Morocco adjoining her
                        territory ; but the rest of the country must be placed either ander an
                        international commission, or else | under the control of one neatral and
                        disin terested Power. And it is understood that Germany would prefer the
                        latter alternative. | There are several objections to the German soheme.
                        First of all it would be difficolt to Johoose the nentral Power. Even if a
                        nation like Denmark or Switzerland were willing to andertake the task, the
                        necessary anthority: would be lacking. On the -other hand, if Italy or
                        Austria were soggusted, France would certainly feel affronted, Italy is a
                        Mediterranean Power like Franoe. Why should sbe be asked. to step into
                        Morocco and perform a task whicb, it is alleged, cannot be undertaken by
                        France withont injary to the interests of Earope! . Indeed, it is diffioult
                        to see how any Power, bowever disinterested in theory, can besked to dearp
                        the position which France had mark | d out for herself. To accept such a
                        mandato would be to ooort the enmity of the French p:ople, and that in
                        itself would surely debar Italy from stepping into the broach. The ides of
                        an international commission is rstbor less open to objeotion, but the
                        experienco. of interTuational commisione in hardly encouraging </p>

                        <p>This morning, the appeal of Mr. Luigi Stagni against the decision given
                            in regard to the Custom House Porters Benevolent society came before the
                            Mixed Appeal Court. Mr. Stagni had made a contract with the Society
                            whereby at should undertake the "factage" of his wood stores. But the
                            work did not give satisfaction and some correspondence ensued. The
                            matter came before a judge in chambers, who ordered an expert to give
                            his opinion. M. Mazou was selected. The appeal was against the
                            nomination of this expert on the ground that he was only a nautical
                            expert. Mr. Stagvi demanded that a specially qualified man should be
                            chosen, or if M. Muzou remained he should be assisted in bis
                            investigations by two other qualified men. </p>

                        owing to the unjastifiable increase in the lui tax on 'dnnumbered carriages,
                        which, as of your readers are aware, has been raised from P.T. 50 to P.T.
                        150 per annum. It is abgnrd to consider that this tax will only apply to the
                        177 birds carriages. It will equally apply to over 1,000 private carriages.
                        Is it to be expected that the owners of these carriages are more likely to
                        remain quiet under this imposi tion than are the owners of the semi-public

                    <p>The following anthorised statement in regard to the presence of a Belgian
                        post on the Upper Nile has been issued :-It is an ondoghted fact that
                        Congolese native soldiers anpeared at Inyolo in 1904, and that a "mirsion"
                        of some kind, ostensibly &amp; scientific one, has been in oooupation of the
                        post ever since. The Egyptian Government did not welcome this prolonged
                        stay, especially as the mission and the patives failed to agree. As a
                        pacifio mode of app sing pressure upon the visitors to "move on," it was
                        decided some three months ago to stóp the Belgian transport and post
                        servizos on the Nile, bat, up to the present, the Congolese mission has
                        apparently been able to get sufficient supplies from its Congo base to
                        withstand the inconvenience thug involved. The British and Egyptian
                        Governments are on good terms with the Belgian Government, and there seems
                        to be every hope that the mission will shortly be withdrawn from territory
                        within the sphere of British and Egyptian jarisdiction without the recessity
                        arising for resort to stronger measures than those already in operation.

                    <p>We understand the Menzaleh. Capal and Navigation Co. intend commencing a
                        servic9 € between Matari-h and Port-Ssid (Karponty) in 8 a few days. The
                        service most at first be more or less experimental until the "raises" get
                        accostomed to the bindling of the steamers e onder somewhat new nditions,
                        and antil it be ascertained hy experjance what time will be occupied by the
                        journey between the two towns. The difficulty at present appears to be for
                        the steamers to attain the estimated speed in! | shallow water. This,
                        however, in no way affects the ultimate succers of the service, for the
                        actual cost of dredging is comparatively small, and it would well repay the
                        company to deepen the canal, if by doing so it were found that b the speed
                        of the steamers could be increased t to that estimated. It is expeoted that
                        very shortly a regular time-table will ba published, a and quick trains
                        between Matsrieh" and i Vansourah will run in connection with the company's
                        service across the lake. The 'a steamers will probably leave Port-Said duily
                        at 1 8 a.m. and it is hoped that passengers will catch the 11.30 train from
                        Matarieh to Man. sonrah.. The disadvantage of Karpoaty as a point of
                        departure will soon be done away with, for within three month, the company
                        experts to I have completed the canal ap to Raqwa, where f a large qnay is
                        now poder construction. When this work is finished the passenger steamers
                        will leave for Matarieh from Raswa. We understand the company is negotiating
                        with the Government for acting as salesmen for the fish basiness on the
                        lake, with a view to protecting the interests of the fishermen, who are now
                        completely in the bands of groups of local sheikhs. Parchases of building
                        sites at Matarieh have also been made recently which should yield a good
                        profit. The opening of the Ananieh Canal for navi. gation, insaring a free
                        waterway from PortSaid to Mangourah and even Cairo, is now it ander study.
                        Ao ording to the company's concession, this I portion of the work must be
                        commenced before January 1, 1907, and finished by Jaquary, 1909. Wêre it not

                        temper I struck her. That was the only time. Cro-s-examined by Mr. Drake,

                        that he would never let her join him again. In reply she wrote : "My dear,

                        too harshly, Ted, as I have been good to you and the little On88, only the
                        accursed management of money was my only fault, as you know yourself. Try

                    <p>Some fifteen years ago Mesars. Th. Ralli and P. Philippoteaux conosived the
                        idea of starting a small Art Bxbibition in Cairo ; to day the Exposition
                        Internationale des Beans Arts has become one of the features of the BOASon,
                        and numbers among ita patrons ench world-famed artists 24 Messrs. L. Bondat,

                        . 1 There are many important canvagas in the present exhibition-notably ONA
                        very larga one (No. 243) Le Bain dos Nymphes, hy Alfred Planzean, which was
                        in the Salon last year. The composition and coloaring of this vy of bathing
                        nymphs startled at the appearance of the satyr, are admirable, the cool
                        atratch of water and the green forn-oled banke making &amp; delightfal
                        scheme of colour. In close prox. I. imity is the life-like portrait of Mme
                        G., by Victor Grétin, a beautifal piece of work repre.. senting the lady in
                        black dress and hat and light overcoat standing in front of a doll gold
                        ourtain. Lovers of London atmosphere will experience &amp; certain amount of
                        heimweh on finding at the end of the large room a painting of the La Tamise
                        (No 17) below London Bridge with the dome of St. Paul's looming through the
                        mist, and the foreground filled with the berges and usual river boats. The
                        artist, A. Barbier, has caught the atmosphere and mystery in wbioh our river
                        loves to enfold itself, and one can almost fael the drear gloom of the day
                        as one looks apon its misty half shades. Arthomics (No. 18), hy | Alexis
                        Axilete, is a happy inspiration, The young buntress aglow in the early
                        morning sonlight, and with the young pale moʻn abnye bør bead, is poised
                        with bow ontstretobed, the honnds beld in leash behind her. Mlle. Lonise
                        Abbema is represented by a delightfal bead of a fair young girl in vignette
                        surrounded by branches of wi-teris and a big sheaf of pennies: a delicate
                        piece of work, and very much more to be desired than some of the other
                        soulless studies of feminine baanties. There is not mnoh depth of feeling in
                        Dimanche (No. 5) by Mlle George Achille-Poold thongh the young couple appear
                        to be enjoying themselves, and the details and portraits have been worked up
                        to a wonderfal degree of finish. For mastery of composition, drawing, and
                        minnte detail one must visit Didte complote (No. 67). by Francesco Branery,
                        whose canvas will bear the most minute inspection and whioh is admirable in
                        every respect. His Tóte de femmo (No. 68). in pastel, ig also charmingly
                        rendered. Un cas Embarassant (No. 124), by Mlles Cecile and Mario Deslions,
                        attracts many admirers. It represents a faithfal but perplexer waiting maid
                        disolosing the tattered condition of his garments to the equally perplexed
                        caré, and the f4088 and treatment of both figates are most happily rendered.
                        Soleil d'Au. tomne (No.6), by L. B. Adan, with ite! resting figare gazing
                        from its corner, framed: | by bright green ivy on to the leaflegg woods
                        beyond, is an excellent piene of work; Veillo Ravandeuse (No. 9). by Sem
                        Angerville, is a deli htful study of an old dame smiling over ber work
                        before her cottage window. Albert Guillaume has three canvase* (Non. 145
                        147). Two of these, Ferveur and Gestation, are bis gorious wierd grote quer,
                        Esthetismo haa not mnoh interest. Au Large (No. 256), by Lonis Ridel, b-8
                        made &amp; name but does not appeal to the ordinary eye. The two frail
                        ladies, oled in diaphanong decolleté gowns and bats, stretched apon the deck
                        of a boat amid heaving waves, is in no way convincing, though may be its
                        treatment is high above the average. Espagnolo (No. 180), by Mme Julette
                        Dubufe Webrie, is fine in colouring with its copper coloured draperies
                        against the gold background, bat the features are not distinotly Spanish in
                        type and are faulty in modelling. Miss Elizabeth Noorse has some delightful
                        studies, of child life in Les Enfants de Penmarch and Fráre ot Sæur
                        Bigoudins (Nos. 233 and 234); Un Champ do Bataille (No. 194). by Timotéon
                        Lobrichon, will doubtless appeal to the domesticated mother and lover of
                        children. Napoleon on board the Bellerophen in Plymooth Sound, is the
                        gobject of Jales Girardet's cativas No. 140 m.; it PORFASAGs fome merit
                        though it is sadly over-weighted by the crowd of figares around the

                    <p>Reports of a very satisfactory character as to the progress that is being
                        made in the establishment of a cotton-growing industry in the territory of
                        the Mozambiqne Company have been received from the Governor. The industry is
                        still in its youth, and experiments are being made, both by the local
                        administration and by private growers, to determine what are the most
                        suitable kinds of cotton to grow commercially. At the Government
                        experimental gardens at Chimoio satisfactory results have been obtained from
                        various Ezyptian varieties, and this year several American varieties,
                        including Georgia, Sea Island, and Louisiana, are bộing planted for
                        experimental purposes. Bat already experiments have been made on &amp;
                        commercial scale, with the result that last year some 59 tons of cotton were
                        prodace 1, | about 18 tons - by the Mozambique Company and the balance on
                        various private plantations. This year &amp; very much larger area has been
                        cleared and planted with both American and Egyptian varieties, and it is
                        estimated that, on a very conservative computation, the crop for the year
                        should be not much short of 300 tong. Several of the consignments which have
                        reached Liverpool have been reported on favourably, and have bronght good
                        prices. Both as regards climate and soil, the Mozambique Company's territory
                        is exceptionally well adapted for cotton cultivation. It is stated that
                        there are, close to the cast, and consequently with cheap sea transport,
                        many handreds of equare miles of cotton land, while, it is said; it has also
                        been proved that along the line of the Beira Railway there are large areas
                        where the yield of cotton per acre is very greatly in excess of the average
                        yield in the Southern States of America.</p>

                    <p>Some months ago 1 picked ap at one of the the booksbops &amp; emall book
                        entitled "The Songs of an Egyptian Peasant." The 'photo Sat graph of the
                        picturesqne and venerable ghaffir of the Antiquities' Department on the
                        cover first attracted my attention, but for private reasons I was not able
                        to read the book Sar until quite lately, when I spent many a pleasant hour
                        enjoying it. Other books have appeared on the songs of the Egyptians, such
                        As Bonriant's "Chansons Arabes Popnlaires," | Mo bat Profesor Scha-ffer's
                        book desls, not with 'Sat the songs of Cairo bat with those of the peasants
                        of Upper Egypt, living so far from the metropolis. Uolike Monsieur
                        Boariant's book, where the songs are entirely in Arabic, with not. a word in
                        French to say what they mean, the author gives the songs in Latin characters
                        and the translation line by line, Fel in some places word for word. There is
                        no doubt that these songs are really song by the natives in that part of the
                        country ; | they are, therefore, genuino Bong8 as any Egyptian who hails
                        from the Said will at Once find out and will probably remember many of them.
                        Like all songs in colloquial Arabic, they are not set to metre, as Arabic
                        poetry must of neceşsity be, but they have their melodies to Egyptian ears,
                        and I may venture Fri to say they are not diapleasing to Earopean ears when
                        properly read. Not koowing German, I could only judge the book in its
                        English garb, and having carefally compared the original Arabio of many of
                        the songs with their English translation, I have no hesitation in saying
                        that Mrs. Breasted 'has done her work in a very creditable manner and is
                        therefore to be congratulated on its succes. It is most difficult to make a
                        literal comprehensible translation from one language to another, especially
                        poetry or songs, as all who have tried it have found ont, 18 and I am sure
                        few of Mrs. Broasted's English readers will find it difficult to anderstand
                        her renderings, aspecially with the head and foot potes necessary to perf

                    <p>QUESTIONS MUNICIPALES LES PROCHAINES ELECTIONS LES TAXES · A megnre que sea
                        recettes augmentent, notre municipalité majore les taxes existantes et eu
                        orée dè nouvelles. Tout loi est prétexte à innovation dans ce sens. Il y a
                        quelques années i seulement ces recettes ne dépassaient guère d cent milla
                        livres, aujourd'hui elles atteignent i deux cent cinquante mille livres ; et
                        au lieu de se contenter de la progression produite par l'ac.. croissement de
                        la ville, pos édiles ne pensent qa'à décoa yrir de nouvelles sources de
                        revenus et à groesir celles qui existent déjà. C'est aingia que
                        l'augmentation récente de la taxe de 50 - 150 piastres sur les voitures a
                        déterminé la grève des cochers. Si l'argent ainsi porça devait servir à
                        l'entretien et à l'assainissement de la ville, pange encore, maie tout est
                        englonti 'par de vastes! projets, qui sont grandioses sans doute, mais dont
                        la nécessité est loin d'être aussi pressante que la canalisation des roes et
                        le drainage des quartiers. Le balayage et l'arrosage sont, en outre, de plas
                        en plus négligés. A part la roe Rosette, la rae Chérif et le Boulevard de
                        Ramleh, il n'y a de propres que les rues bagtes balayées par le vent et
                        nettoyées de temps à autre par les pluies. Cependant, la taxe da 2 % qui est
                        si onés rense et qui ne frappe en définitive que les locataires a été créée
                        expressément pour pro céder à l'a-sainissement de la ville. Poisque ti rien
                        n'est encore fait et que cette taxa est d d'ailleurs dovenae ipotile,
                        pairqu'elle a permis 8 de prendre sur la mer des terrains qui soffisent lp
                        amplement au but proposé, M. Zouro conseille de la supprimer ou da moins
                        d'en exonérer les fa locataires pauvres. C'est une idée qu'il a coustamment
                        soutenue et qu'il soutiendra encore devant la Commission. CHRONIQUE

                    <p>Circulaire H. de Vries et Boutigny NOTES ET CRITIQUES Caire, 14 février. Les
                        nouvelles tendancieuses propagées sur la Conférence d'Algésiras ne
                        paraissent pas avoir impressionné sérieusement les marobé d'Oecident. En
                        réalité, on s'est beaucoup plus effrayé lici qu'en Europe. A Londres, le
                        Consolidé anglais est resté, hier encore, invarié à 90 5/8. L'Unifiée &amp;
                        hausgé de 1/4 à 105 1/4. La Daïra Sanieh est demeurée inchargée à 18. Ls
                        National Bank &amp; bien reperda une 1/2 livre à 27 3/8 et l'Agricole 1/8 à
                        10 1/8; mais cette réaction pent être attribuée à la hausse précipités
                        réalisée récemment 'par des valeurs plutôt qu'aux informations d'ordre
                        politique. - A Paris, l'action Crédit Foncier Egyptien a réagi de 1 franc
                        seulement à 805. Par contre, la Banqne d'Athènes a encore gagné 3 francs
                        &amp; 143. Notre marché des valeurs a été, ce matin, a88e2-animé et plus

                        a gagné 1/16 &amp; 6 7/8. Le monvement de hau889 quo nous pressentions hier
                        sur la Banque d'Athènes s'est dessiné dès ce matin. De 137, l'action a monté
                        à 143, gagnant 6 francs en und néance. Il y a liea de prévoir des cours plus
                        élevés. | La Cassa di Sconto est revenue de 198 &amp; 190 francs l'action
                        ancienne et de 193 &amp; 185 la nonvelle émission. L'action crédit Foncier a
                        progressé à 809. Los parts de joniggance Etux du Caire ont rattrapé à 265 la

                        of Egypt, continue à donner les résultats les plus promettante. D'après le
                        dernier état comparatif, les recettes pour la première décade du mois de
                        février courant se sont élevéas à environ L.E. 1,300 contre 710 ponr la
                        période correspondante de l'année passée, c'est-à-dire avec le surplus hau.
                        tement appréciable de L.E. 600. Cet accroissement, déja, ni marquant, des
                        revenus est appelé à prendre des proportions beancoup plus considérables dès
                        que les travaux l'agrandissement de l'hôtel auront été completement terminés
                        dans le courant da mois prochain. Aussi bieh il y a lieu d'attirer
                        l'attention sur le bas coats du titre, qui est à environ an qnart de livre
                        seulement au-dessus da prix l'émission. Un mouvement de hatago ne saurait
                        tarder à se produire, et tout semble indiquer qu'il sera aussi ra pide
                        qu'important. </p>

                    <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                        January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so warm as
                        Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm
                        than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in
                        the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest
                        place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                        sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on each of
                        the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="3"/>
                    <p>They are as follows:-</p>
                    <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southhampton,
                        London or Liverpool—occupy about 4 days. The short ones are as follows:—</p>

                    <p>The steamers, of the P.&amp;O. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageriea
                        Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines are
                        also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by travellers to
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made without change
                        in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp;O.
                        Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna
                        express from Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis” to Brindisi. One of these leaves port

                    <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                        attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats" having
                        been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi.
                        If you are going straight through to England you will find the train waiting
                        at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete
                        arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in
                        London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <head>SICILY.</head>
                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMENA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is the
                        station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful,
                        occupying about one hour. In and around the town is much to interest the
                        visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but restored under the Romans.
                        CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of Etna and here also is a fine
                        Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all over
                        the island, are an endless sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting
                        history, having been a Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C.
                        413, and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb
                        is to be seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                        about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                        delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The
                        Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S.
                        Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral,
                        Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also worth a
                        visit.</p>

                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                        bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento
                        [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                        City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence itself the churches
                        and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local promenades and
                        excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and
                        fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea
                        level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero,
                        thence by cog-wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks
                        takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; hero there is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                        and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                        house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                        and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                    <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                        the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and deliciously cool
                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a

                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo

                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                        SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal springs,
                        change trains at Borgo San Donino and in half-an-hour you are at
                        Salsomaggiore.</p>

                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea port.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                        lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza :</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo, Cadenabbia,
                        and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio opposite. The walk
                        from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio is most enjoyable. A
                        steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake Lugano in three-quarters
                        of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                        delights and grandeurs."</p>
                    <p>LUGANO is some 20 miles from Como and reached by train in one-and-a-half
                        hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated on
                        the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San
                        Salvatore, M. de Caprino.and M. Generoso.</p>
                    <p>LOCARNO, may be reached by rail from Bellinzona in forty minutes. This pretty
                        town, situated at the top of lake Maggiore has a mild climate and is an
                        excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated above the
                        town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings, "Entombment,"
                        by Ciseri, and 'Tho Flight into Egypt,” by Bramantion.</p>
                    <p>LUCERNE—A striking picture on the Lake of Lucerne facing the Rigi and Pilatus
                        and the snow-clad Alps.</p>
                    <p>In and around the town the walks are charming, and the excursions to be made
                        from Lucerne by boat, rail, etc., are very numerous.</p>
                    <p>The Lake of Lucerne abounds in delightful excursions, those to the Rigi,
                        Pilatus, Burgenstock and Sonnenberg needing a special visit each. Other
                        excursions on the lake can be made by steamer, and the ever-changing scenery
                        on the trip from Lucerne, to Fluelen is a source of delight to the lover of
                        nature.</p>
                    <p>BRUNNEN, charmingly situated on the most beautiful part of the Lake of
                        Lucerne, commands magnificent views of lake and mountain scenery. Along the
                        Lake of Uri from Brunnen to Fluelen runs the famous Axentrasse</p>
                    <p>A delightful exeption from Lucerne is that to ENGELBERG. Take boat to
                        Stansstad and from Stansstad it is about 1 hour and 40 min. by Electric
                        Railway, with delightful scenery en route. The ascent of Titlis, is made
                        from here, and the panoramic view of the Alps is grand; extending from Monte
                        Rosa to the Black Forest, and from the Santis to the Matterhorn.</p>

                        centre for making excursions in the Oberland, abounding in fine walks and
                        views. There is a magnificent view of the Jungfrau from the Hoheweg, a fine
                        avenue of walnut trees the chief resort of visitors. Interlaken is also not
                        far from the famous waterfalls, Giessbach, Trummelbath and Staubbach. Then
                        also the glaciers of Grindelwald and view from Murren and the Schynige
                        Platte are sights not to be missed.</p>

                        from Alexandria ; the climate in April is charming. The best steamers are
                        those of the Khedivial Mail Co. and the Russian Steam Navigation Co.</p>
                    <p>If possible tourists should arrange to be in Athens for the Orthodox Easter
