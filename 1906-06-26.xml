                    <p>Icilma Fluor Cream is the only cream that contains no grease nor oil.
                        Deliciously scented it cleanses the pores of the skin as nothing else can

                    <p>Its unique properties are due to Icilma Natural Water so that it may well be
                        called <hi>Nature’s Skin Food </hi> and the skin requires nothing else to
                        give it the necessary vitality, to preserve it from sunburn, heat, cold or

                        overheated blood, and to preserve the youthful fresh look to which hot
                        climates are so fatal.</p>

                    <head>THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMY.</head>
                    <p>Soldiers cannot but regard as ominous the signs and tokens of the forthcoming
                        pronouncement of the Government, and they deplore the disastrous policy
                        which seems t have been foreshadowed by<persName>Mr. Haldane's</persName>
                        latest utterances. Soldiers who study the question at issue will entertain
                        no doubt whatever as to what are the requirements of the military situation.
                        Statesmen who know the history of the Army will not contemplate any real
                        diminution of it. Those who saw the dangers behind the Conference of
                        Algeoiras who have had to strengthen the garrison of
                            <placeName>Egypt</placeName> foolishly reduced, who were prepared to run
                        the risk of a war with the Turk, who are confronted with the native danger
                        in <placeName>South Africa</placeName>, will stultify themselves if they
                        speak of it. After the great war, the exhaustion of the nations led to a
                        reduction of armaments, but there were some prescient men who foresaw the
                        danger. <persName>The Duke of Wellington</persName>had vainly urged
                        successive Governments to organise the Army on a new footing, and
                            <persName>Lord Palmerston</persName> declared to the Cabinet in 1846
                        that the Empire existed only by the sufferances and forbearance of other
                        Powers. It was the opinion of <persName>Sir John Burgoyne</persName> that
                        the very object of armed forces was being gradually lost eight of, the scale
                        of armaments being measured by peace requirements. Notwithstanding the
                        zealous efforts of that good soldier, <persName>Lord Hardinge</persName> the
                        British Army left for the Crimea still armed with the old smooth bore, while
                        its general state of unpreparedness is recorded in all our histories. It had
                        been stated by <persName>Mr. Cobden</persName> and others that the addition
                        of 25,000 or 30,000 men to the Army was impossible, because the country
                        could not stand the burden. We had not in any way adapted the Army to our
                        policy, and in <placeName>India</placeName> we had enormously increased our
                        responsibilities without increasing our strength, thus committing great
                        political errors, which caused the Mutiny. Such have been the faults of
                        politicians, moved by considerations of party advantage and forgetful of the
                        welfare of the State, and thus has enormous outlay been caused, where a
                        steady sufficient outlay would have sufficed. If expenditure be improperly
                        reduced now, the day of reckoning, perhaps of disaster, and of much larger
                        expenditure, will inevitably come later on. The Army on all occasions of
                        unwise retrenchment has had to be saved by the soldier. <persName>Mr.
                            Haldane</persName> cannot take his pattern in the matter of economy from
                            <persName>Mr. Cardwell</persName>, because the reductions of that time
                        were due to the larger measure in which the colonies were preparing
                        themselves to undertake their own defence.</p>
                    <p>We had great hopes that the committee of Imperial Defence would enable , the
                        Government to accomplish the nice business of adjusting military means to
                        the ends in view, and we have not lost hope, though the test, it seems to
                        us, will be supplied when <persName>Mr. Haldane</persName> makes his
                        promised statement in July. Whatever may be the other purposes for which the
                        Army may be employed, he may advisedly take the requirements of
                            <placeName>India</placeName> as the standard. There we have gone on
                        adding vastly to our dominions and millions to our population without ever
                        doing anything to meet the larger responsibilities. The establishment of
                        British Regular troops in India this year is 75,031; the Committee of 1859
                        fixed its proper strength at about 80,000, so that even upon the
                        requirements of nearly half a century ago, we are now some 5,000 men short
                        of the proper number. But compare the <placeName>India</placeName> of
                        pre-Mutiny days with the <placeName>India</placeName> of the present time.
                        Then the area of British territory was 776,000 square miles; it is now about
                        a million square miles, being an increase of about one-quarter, while the
                        population has grown by something like one-third. At the same time the
                        population of the Native States has increased enormously, and we have added
                        vast tracts of country and millions of people to the territory we have under
                        control. We have strengthened our obligations to defend
                            <placeName>Afghanistan</placeName>, and we foresee the approach of a
                        great military power on the northern frontier and through
                            <placeName>Persia</placeName>, indicated by the strategic railways that
                        have been made and are contemplated. Can it then be pretended for a single
                        moment that any case has been made ont for military reduction? The answer
                        must be an unqualified negative. The need is rather for an increase than a
                        decrease. ("Army and Navy Gazette.”)</p>

                    <head>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE."</head>
                    <p>Dear Sir, - In reference to the acccount of the fire in the harbour given in
                        yesterday's issue of your paper we beg to state it is quite erroneous and
                        utterly misleading.</p>
                    <p>The true facts of the case were as follows:</p>
                    <p>The fire on the above steamer was successfully extinguished by the sole
                        efforts of the officers and crew, and no assistance whatever was rendered by
                        anone apart from the persons mentioned.</p>
                    <p>In reference to the discharging of the cases of acid from ship's deck into
                        lighters, said to have been done by <persName>Yousbashi Watt</persName>,
                        there being only 20 cases, this also is erroneous, as the officers were
                        responsible an carried out their particular work.</p>

                        a dividend of 17 1/2 per cent, on the Ordinary shares, leaving £1,413 to be
                        carried forward. The directors in March 1905 entered into a contract with
                            <persName>Mr. Charles Baehler</persName> to give him an option to
                        purchase the balance of the surplus lands of the Ghezireh Estate for

                    <p>Midnight.</p>
                    <p> So many were the details which were given by the witnesses called before the
                        special tribunal today that when the Court rose at seven o’clock I could not
                        complete the translation of my notes before the last post left and
                        therefore, as you know, telegraphed you the remaining evidence. In case any
                        mistake should have arisen from telegraphic transmission I will not write
                        what I have wired and in greater detail. In my written account I reached the
                        point where <persName>Lieutenant Smithwick</persName> deposed to all the
                        officers, after they had been pulled from their carriage and himself dragged
                        off his horse, running towards the camp.</p>
                    <p>
                        <persName>Lieutenant Smithwick</persName> then said that after they had ran
                        a short distance he turned round and saw that <persName>Major
                            Pine-Coffin</persName> had been thrown to the ground, where he was held
                        face downwards by a native who was on the top of him. Witness returned and
                        pulled the man off and from among the prisoners he recognised <persName>No.
                            24</persName> as this man. He could not say whether the man had a stick
                        at that moment, but he certainly had one immediately afterwards and for the
                        rest of the time. <persName>Major Pine-Coffin</persName> then shouted to
                            <persName>Captain Bull</persName> to run to the camp and this he did in
                        company with <persName>Captain Bostock</persName>, the two getting well
                        ahead. Witness saw <persName>Captain Bull</persName> struck twice before
                        this; once on the side and the other time on the back of the head with what
                        he supposed was half a brick. <persName>Captain Bull</persName>, who
                        staggered and appeared dazed, was bleeding profusely. Just as witness pulled
                        the man off <persName>Major Pine-Coffin</persName> he was himself struck
                        between the eyes by half a brick and then on the back of the neck by a
                        nabout. The fellaheen then commenced to drag them back towards the village.
                        They were thrown to the ground, and the natives then beat them, kicked them
                        in the stomach, and generally maltreated them to make them get up again.
                        Witness saw <persName>Major Pine-Coffin</persName> struck severely on both
                        arms and said that he could identify the man who struck him on the right
                        arm, but not the one who dealt the blow on the left. He then identified
                        prisoner <persName>No. 23</persName>. He also recognised <persName>No.
                            14</persName> as having had a stick in his hand and <persName>No. 25
                        </persName> as having been very violent and having thrown clods of mud, and
                        bricks, and having used his stick. Witness lost consciousness. He
                        recollected being taken to see the wounded woman and that two men made signs
                        of cutting their throats, one of whom carried a hoe. He believed prisoner
                        No. 26 to be this man. Before being taken to see the woman witness was
                        separated from <persName>Major Pine-Coffin</persName> and <persName>Lieut.
                            Porter</persName> and was thrown to the ground and beaten severely. When
                        he was taken to the other two officers be found them sitting on a tibn floor
                        and heaps of tibn were placed round them by boys, while <persName>Lieut.
                            Porter</persName> remarked that they were going to be burnt. He next
                        remembered lying under a tree and one fellah brought him water. This man was
                        one of a ring who gathered round them and tried to keep the mob away. He
                        remembered meeting the troops on their way to the place to where all this
                        had taken place and heard either <persName>Major Pine-Coffin</persName> or
                            <persName>Lieut. Porter</persName>—he could not say which—call to them
                        to return to camp. He recognized prisoner <persName>No. 9</persName> and
                        believed him to have been friendly to them.</p>

                <div type="item">
                    <head>Cross-Examination.</head>
                    <p>On cross-examination witness stated that when they arrived at the ground for
                        shooting he saw <persName>Major Pine-Coffin</persName> met by a man, hwom he
                        identified as <persName>prisoner No. 11</persName>. Witness was riding and
                        was by himself. When he went over to join <persName>Major
                            Pine-Coffin</persName> he did not see any fire or smoke. When he went to
                        join the other party it took from five to six minutes to get there, as far
                        as he could tell. He lost his watch and his cigarette case, the latter being
                        returned to him at the conclusion of the attack by an old man. The man who
                        tok his watch had a short black beard, and either prisoner No. 13 or 51
                        might be he.</p>
                    <p>The Court then adjourned for a quarter of an hour, and on their return
                            <persName>Lieut. Smithwick</persName> was questioned further. His gun
                        was not returned to him and he identified one of the two guns placed before
                        the tribunal as his. <persName>Mohamed Bey Youssef</persName> asked if the
                        woman was wounded by the discharge of <persName>Lieut. Porter</persName>'s
                        gun. Witness said he heard so, but did not see it happen. He did not know
                        that other persons were wounded. <persName>Ibrahim Bey Helbawi</persName>
                        asked what would happen if a gun went off and there was a person three yards
                        away. Witness said that for such a distance the charge would go like a
                        bullet.</p>

                    <head><persName>Captain Bostock</persName>'s Evidence.</head>
                    <p><persName>Captain Bostock</persName> was then called and said that he was on
                        the S.E. side of the agricultural road with <persName>Lieut.
                            Porter</persName>, who was about 100 yards away from him. Roughly
                        speaking, he was about 100 yards from the nearest tibn and probably more
                        than 300 yards from the village. Witness and <persName>Lt. Porter</persName>
                        commenced shooting at once. No one cautioned them and he noticed no people
                        as he went along the agricultural road.</p>
                    <p>After firing nine shots he noticed that people were collecting round him and
                        he asked them to stand back, but as they did not do this he went backwarads
                        himself in order to get more space. He found his way, barred and the people
                        hindered him. Then a fire broke out, but only lasted about two minutes. The
                        people then began to lay hands on himself and on his gun, and
                            <persName>Lieut. Porter</persName> came towards him, but being also
                        surrounded by people was not able to get nearer than ten or fifteen yards
                        away from him. They then tried to get to the carriage, offering the crowd
                        bakshish in the hope of pacifying the, but without avail. When he was
                        struggling for his gun he felt someone rifle his pockets and he lost his
                        watch, money, and cartridge bag. He was hit across the nose by a nabout.
                            <persName>Major Pine-Coffin</persName> then arrived and tried to help
                        them to get away and, as they were going along the road, they were beaten
                        all the way. He could identify none of the prisoners as having done any
                        special thing, but recognissed several as having formal part of the mob. He
                        saw Captain Bull struck by a clod of earth and he was bleeding from the
                        wound, but as he was some way from him he could not see his exact condition.
                        The officers get into the carriage, but were dragged out again and beaten
                        severely. They tried to get away and he saw <persName>Major
                            Pine-Coffin</persName> thrown to the ground but could not say who threw
                        him. When <persName>Major Pine-Coffin</persName> got up again witness took
                        the lead, but on turning round saw the others surrounded. He noticed,
                        however, that he had a clear road in front of him and ran towards the camp
                        for help. When he had run about two miles he saw <persName>Captain
                            Bull</persName> and shouted to ask him how he was getting on and
                        received the answer "All right." <persName>Captain Bull</persName> told him
                        to go to the police station on the left. He was not near enough to
                            <persName>Captain Bull</persName> to see to what extent he was injured
                        but he had seen him before injured and bleeding.</p>
                    <p>At this point <persName>Ahmed Bey Loutfi</persName> asked if witness could
                        say why the people closed round him. Witness said he did not know, but that
                        it was before the fire broke out.</p>

                    <p>After returning from the camp witness saw <persName>Captain Bull</persName>
                        lying in the shade in charge of the sergeant-major and he made a hasty
                        examination. He noticed that he had a severe wound over the right temple and
                        three or four blows on the head and was unconscious, so he took him to the
                        camp as quickly as possible. He made a superficial post-mortem examination,
                        and came to the conclusion that death was due to concussion of the brain and
                        sun-stroke.</p>
                    <p><persName>Ibrahim Bey Helbawi</persName> asked witness if he could say what
                        length of time elapsed between them leaving the carriage to shoot and
                        returning to it. Witness thought it woul dbe from three-quarters to one
                        hour.</p>
                    <p><persName>Dr. Nolan</persName> was called next and it was remarked that in
                        his report of the autopsy which he held on the body of <persName>Captain
                            Bull</persName> he stated that the wounds were caused by violent blows
                        from some blunt instrument, but that this was not the direct cause of death.
                            <persName>Dr. Nolan</persName> said that death was immediately due to
                        heat apoplexy. <persName>Captain Bostock</persName>'s evidence was not
                        incompatible with witness's report and after hearing the evidence he was of
                        the opinion that death was due to heat apoplexy which was aggravated by the
                        concussion of the brain caused by the blows.</p>
                    <p>The Court then adjourned to meet again at half past eight tomorrow

                    <p>It was shortly after half past eight when the tribunal commenced this
                        morning's sitting.</p>
                    <p><persName>Lieut. Porter</persName> was the first witness called, and, having
                        been sworn, deposed that he went out pigeon shooting with <persName>Major
                            Pine-Coffin</persName>, <persName>Capt. Bull</persName>, <persName>Capt.
                            Bostock</persName>, and <persName>Lieut. Smithwick</persName> on the
                        13th inst. near the <placeName>village of Denishwai</placeName>. Witness
                        went to the S.E. side of the agricultural road with <persName>Major Pine
                            Coffin</persName> and indicated on a plan shown to him the position
                        which he took up. He was between 200 and 300 yards from the village and
                        about 150 yards from the nearest tibn floor. He had fired about half-a-dozen
                        shots before he noticed any people or was interfered with. When he had shot
                        four he saw that a crowd was collecting round <persName>Capt.
                            Bostock</persName> and that he was being molested. As he went towards
                        him he saw a fire break out in the tibn floor and he next noticed that about
                        fifty people were rushing down from the village and surrounding them.</p>

                    <head>Gun Seized.</head>
                    <p>Witness did not see if the fire was put out. Several people sezied hold of
                        his gun, which he tried to unload, but being unable to do so, owing to the
                        interference, he put it at "safety." The gun went off almost immediately
                        after it was taken from hiim. The crowd surged back, and he saw a woman
                        lying on the gorund, but no other persons. After the gun had gone off he saw
                            <persName>Major Pine-Coffin</persName> coming towards him that he
                        thought someone had been hurt. <persName>Major Pine-Coffin</persName> took
                        witness's arm, pretending to arrest him, and on meeting <persName>Lieut.
                            Smithwick</persName> witness told him to take his other arm.</p>
                    <p>Up to that time he had not been struck, but had been pulled about, his
                        clothes had been torn, and his cartridge bag taken from him. When they
                        reached the carriages, <persName>Lieut. Porter</persName> got into one with
                            <persName>Major Pine-Coffin</persName> and <persName>Capt.
                            Bull</persName> and <persName>Capt. Bostock</persName> into the other,
                            <persName>Lieut. Smithwick</persName> mounting his horse. Bricks were
                        thrown at them, and they were afterwards pulled out of the carriages and
                        beaten with sticks. They all commenced to run down the road. Witness saw
                            <persName>Capt. Bull</persName> stagger as if he had been struck and he
                        noticed that he was bleeding profusely from a wound in the region of the
                        right eye. <persName>Major Pine-Coffin</persName> fell to the ground and
                            <persName>Capt. Bull</persName> and <persName>Capt.

                        to know what he was doing. <persName>Lieut. Smithwick</persName> was with
                            <persName>Major Pine-Coffin</persName> and as he was going to their help
                        he was struck with a nabout by <persName>prisoner No. 14</persName>, who
                        then ran to <persName>Major Pine-Coffin</persName> and jumped on his stomach
                        with both feet. <persName>Major Pine-Coffin</persName>, <persName>Lieut.
                            Smithwick</persName>, and witness were surrounded by fellaheen who
                        started to drag them back to the village, and of these men he identified
                        from among the accused thirteen, <persName>No. 25</persName> said witness
                        was carrying a hoe and when they were taken to see the wounded woman he made
                        signs of cutting their throats. <persName>No. 9</persName> resembled the
                        omdeh's son, but witness could not say that he actually was his son.
                            <persName>No. 14</persName>, said witness eventually robbed him of his
                        gold match-box, silver chain and keys, cigar-case, pipe and tobacco pouch,
                        whistle and corkscrew, which had not been returned. He gave his purse to the
                        guide. They were first taken to the scene of the fire and made to sit down,
                        when he thoguht they were going to be burnt. In about five minutes, they
                        were taken to see the wounded woman, when <persName>No. 25</persName> made
                        signs of cutting their throats, and made them sit down near her.</p>

                        their protection and they were taken by these men to a mound a short
                        distance away and the mob was held back. They were given water and in about
                        half-an-hour, when <persName>Major Pine-Coffin</persName> and

                        were taken back to their carriages. They met a patrol of Mounted Infantry
                        about a mile and a half down the road. Just before they finally left for the
                        camp two mounted native police arrived and he thought that they asked them
                        what they had lost. Witness thought the crowd was hostile from the moment it
                        arrived, there being no children in it.</p>

                        next called and deposed to having received a telephonic message at

                            market</placeName>, where they would meet officers who were going

                        was driving and two into the other, while one officer went on horseback.
                        When they arrived at the <placeName>village of Denishwai</placeName>the
                        onbashi of police who accompanied them, went into the village and the

                            11</persName>. This man asked them if they were going to shoot pigeons.
                        Witness recognized <persName>prisoner No. 16</persName>, <persName>prisoner

                        and beating them with nabouts.</p>
                    <p>The next witness was <persName>Mohamed Abd el Aad</persName>, driver of the
                        second carriage. He deposed to seeing people strike the officers when they
                        returned to the carriages, but only recognized <persName>prisoner No.
                            24</persName> as having been present. He stated that he coul dnot drive
                        away as the crowd would not allow him to, and that they took his whip from

                    <p><persName>Ibrahim Moussa</persName>, general messenger to the village, said

                        to fetch the omdeh and the sheikh el ghaffir. They were met by a white
                        bearded man, whom witness identifed as <persName>prisoner No. 11</persName>.
                        This man, according to witness, told the officers not to shoot as there had
                        been trouble over them doing so last year and the year before. If they shot
                        they must do so on their own responsibility. </p>

                        earth. Another person told him that there was a gun in the house of
                            <persName>Said Mokattam</persName>, but on searching the house he found
                        no gun, though he discovered on the roof a bag of cartridges. From the
                        enquiries which he had made he stated that prisoners Nos. 48, 2, 11, and 19
                        were the ringleaders of the mob. When witness arrived at the omdeh's house,
                        after being summoned there, he found a crowd of people whom he addressed,
                        asking them to give him and information they could or to give up any of the
                        missing things which were in their possession, and he told them that if they
                        wished they could place the things at a certain spot just outside the
                        village which he indicated and he would, then, not see who put them there.
                        On Saturday he searched the sakkias and found nothing in the first one but
                        in the second he discovered a gun.</p>

                    <p>Whilst this witness was giving evidence several of the accused interrupted
                        him frequently, and this continued for some time. The Court threatened to
                        sent them out if they did not stop interrupting witnesses and subsequently
                        three of the greatest offenders were sent away. The evidence, too, given by
                        the fellaheen was almost impossible to follow and the interpretations given
                        by the translator were almost equally incomprehensible, chiefly owing to his
                        being nearly inaudible.</p>
                    <p><persName>Mohamed Omar Zaid</persName> was called and said that as he was
                        going along the agricultural road he saw that there was trouble. He saw
                        prisoner No. 19 (<persName>Mohamed Abd el Nebi</persName>) seize one of the
                        officers' guns and he also saw No. 2 (<persName>Mohamed Dokran</persName>)
                        either striking or catching hold of the officers, whereupon
                            <persName>Mohamed Dokran</persName> ran interrupted loudly denying his
                        statements and saying that witness bore enmity against him, and No. 48, whom
                        witness said he saw taking the guns from the officers also asserted that
                        this was the case. Witness identified Nos. 2, 48, 58, and 19 as active
                        participators in the attack, and shortly afterwards No. 19 was taken out of
                        Court for continued interruptions.</p>
                    <p>The next witness caled was <persName>Mohamed esh Shedli</persName>, who said
                        that <persName>Mohamed Abd el Nebi</persName>, <persName>Mohamed
                            Dokran</persName>, <persName>Hassan Magfous</persName>, and
                            <persName>Ahmed Mohamed Salim</persName> took part in the attack. He saw
                            <persName>Mohamed Abdel Nebi</persName> seize hold of one of the
                        officers.</p>
                    <p><persName>Ali Magfous</persName>, next witness, stated <persName>Major
                            Porter</persName>'s gun went off while the people were trying to seize
                        it, and that when the other officers came up they fired three shots.</p>
                    <p><persName>Omar Zaid</persName>, the omdeh's wakil, gave the names of fifteen
                        men whom he saw among the hostile crowd, throwing stones and striking the
                        officers with nabouts. He saw one officer hit across the eyes, another on
                        the arm, and one thrown to the ground. He said that prisoner No. 48 had a
                        stick in his hand, but did not see him holding a gun.</p>
                    <p><persName>Fathalla Shedli</persName>, the omdeh's son, named fourteen men as
                        having taken part in the attack, but could not say any of them were using

                        and, on finding that he was away, asked for the wakil. He stated that when
                        the people seized <persName>Lieut. Porter</persName>'s gun he got hold of it
                        to try to prevent them taking it away.</p>
                    <p><persName>Lieut. Porter</persName> was reclled and said that he did not
                        recognize the man. He had not got hold of his gun when the people seized it
                        and when the fire broke out among the tibn he saw the onbashi of police
                        about fifty yards away, and the latter made no attempt to reach him.</p>
                    <p>Several witnesses were called after this, including the mulahiz of police and
                        the telephone clerk, but the evidence was of no great importance.</p>

                        stated that the Court would rise for half-an-hour, and when it reassembled
                            <persName>Maitre Ibrahim Bey Helbawi</persName>, counsel for the
                        prosecution, commenced his address. Counsel remarked first of all that every
                        praise was due to the Army of Occupation during their stay in
                            <placeName>Egypt</placeName>. "We must acknowledge," he said, "that
                            <placeName>England</placeName> possesses the finest standing army in the
                        world." Since the occurrences of the time of Arabi Pacha no such incident
                        had occurred. Continuing, officers said that we now heard of English
                        officers being severely treated and generally maltreated with no evident
                        provocation.</p>
                    <p>He then related the main facts of the case, starting from the warning
                        received by the district on the 10th inst. of the visit of the troops,
                        numbering some 150, and requiring every facility for them. Counsel spoke for
                        more than half an hour, dealing with the facts of the case, when the Court
                        rose and at its resumed sitting tomorrow morning, he will continue his
                        speech.</p>

                    <p>Counsel for the prosecution continued his speech today enlarging on the
                        savagery of the people and their murderous intentions towards the British
                        officers. Four natives were wounded but only after <persName>Lieut.
                            Porter</persName>'s gun had been snatched from his hands and had
                        exploded, as was shown by the position and nature of their wounds. The
                        onbashi of police had been guilty of neglect of duty in going to lunch with
                        a friend instead of going straight to the house of the omdeh and informing
                        him of the arrival of the party. All the facts of the case showed that the
                        officers were absolutely blameless.</p>

                    <head>QUESTION IN PARLIAMENT.</head>
                    <p>In the House of Commons last week, <persName>Mr. Dillon</persName> (Mayo, E)
                        asked the SEcretary of State for Foreign Affairs whether he could give any
                        information as to the cause of the recent affray between Egyptians and
                        British officers; whether the British officers were in uniform and were
                        engaged in the performance of any military duty at the time; by what
                        tribunal it was proposed to try the Egyptians concerned in the disturbance;
                        and whether the trial would take place in public.</p>
                    <p><persName>Sir. E. Grey</persName>.- The information which we have received
                        hitherto states that during a march of mounted infantry from
                            <placeName>Cairo</placeName> to <placeName>Alexandria</placeName>, five
                        British officers were attacked by natives whilst shooting pigeons in a
                        village near <placeName>Tantah</placeName>. One officer has died from the
                        effects of the inuries he received, and two others are badly injured. The
                        actual cause of the attack has not yet been ascertained, and it is not known
                        whether the officers were at the time in uniform. The matter will be dealt
                        with under a Khedivial decree of February 25, 1895, which institutes a
                        special tribunal to deal with crimes of violence against officers and men of
                        the Army of Occupation. The meetings of the tribunal will be held in public.
                        The facts of the case cannot be thoroughly known until the judicial inquiry
                        has taken place.</p>
                    <p><persName>Mr. Dillon</persName> asked whether the right hon. gentlemen
                        proposed to allow these Egyptians to be sent before the special tribunal
                        before it had been proved that the officers were in uniform and were engaged
                        in the performance of military duties.</p>
                    <p><persName>Sir. E. Grey</persName>.- That is a point on which we have not yet
                        received full information. We cannot tell without inquiry how far that point
                        would affect the question of the tribunal before which the case should
                        come.</p>
                    <p><persName>Mr. Dillon</persName>.- Will the right hon. gentlement direct the
                        attention of the Egyptian authorities to that point?</p>
                    <p><persName>Sir. E. Grey</persName>.- We are expecting more information. I will
                        bear that point in mind.</p>

                    <byline>PROFESSOR PETRIE'S LATEST WORK.</byline>
                    <p>(CONCLUDED)</p>
                    <p>In the interesting chapter on the mining expeditions of the ancients in his
                        "Researches in Sinai,” noticed in yesterday's issue, <persName>Professor
                            Petrie</persName> pays a tribute to the organising abilities of the
                        Egyptians of all ages, in which abilities consists the secret of their
                        power. The Egyptian of old time was nothing if not methodical in arranging
                        the expeditions to the mines, and it is diverting to read of the variety and
                        importance of the various recognised offices, from the chief, who was a
                        “seal-bearer of the gods," "chief in the department of the interior," and
                        “chief of the land of the North,” down to the "guards of the store house,”
                        and tho "chief of the boats." Every department of work was fully provided
                        for and each department recognised its own responsibilities. On one occasion
                        a “chief physician" was mentioned as accompanying the party. It is evident
                        that in the earlier times the armed forces were called upon to assist in the
                        operations, as, during the reign of <persName>Amenembat II</persName>,
                        reference is made to 734 soldiers being present.</p>
                    <p>The arrangement for the expedition commenced in December and continued until
                        the commencement of the hot season, when the homeward journey was begun with

                    <p> Theologians will find the author’s views on the wanderings of the Israelites
                        of engrossing interest. His careful consideration of all the circumstances,
                        added to his knowledge of the topography of the country, will win for him
                        the sympathetic attention of even those who are unable to accept all his
                        conclusions. In dealing with this question, he finds, after a careful study
                        of the diverse characteristics of the Jewish race and thei, literature, that
                        "we cannot accept all the conclusions drawn from the documents, or the
                        introduction of non-natural causes as setting à priori bounds to
                        archaeological argument.”</p>
                    <p>He is of the opinion that the traditional identification of the region of
                        Sinai must be accepted; that the itinerary during the three days’ journey
                        into the wilderness was from Suez to Wady Gharandel. "It seems clear that
                        the writer of these itineraries knew the road to Sinai well. The description
                        exactly fits that road, and will not fit any other. He holds that the
                        account of the journey does not tally with the theory that the march was
                        eastward to the Gulf of Akabah, as there is no proof that the Midianites may
                        Dot have occupied both sides of the gulf.</p>
                    <p>An interesting hypothesis to account for the apparent exaggeration of the
                        numbers of the Israelites is placed before us by <persName>Professor
                            Petrie</persName>. He suggests that the thousands referred to are
                        families or tents, and the hundreds are the total inhabitants of these
                        tents. In other words, the thousands are considered to have an origin
                        entirely independent of the hundreds. A test of the traditional figures on
                        this basis gives the total in the census taken before the wanderings of
                        5,550, and 5,730 at the close, as against the totals of 603.000 and 601.700
                        mentioned in the Book of Numbers. These figures tally with the present and
                        ancient population of the country, with whom the Israelites fought on equal
                        terms.</p>
                    <p><persName>Professor Petrie</persName> thus conclude his admirably compiled
                        and extremely interesting record:</p>
                    <p>“The work of this last season in Sinai has served to put in order the
                        Egyptian inscriptions previously known there, and to fix their place and
                        connections which were uncertain before. It has also uncovered many new
                        inscriptions and the whole of these two or three inscriptions have been
                        drawn full-size in facsimile, and many of them photographed. The publication
                        of these will form the largest body of texts from any year’s work. The plan
                        of the temple of Serabit was but vaguely known before. Many more walls have
                        been found, and also the Shrine of the Kings ; and the whole is now fully
                        planned and modelled, and the architectural details restored as far as
                        possible. The district of Serabit has been planned for the first time, and
                        the position and character of the temple includes the finest portrait known
                        of <persName>Queen Thyi</persName>. The fuller records now obtained have
                        enabled us to reconstruct the old Egyptian organisation of the expeditions,
                        and the views that result from these studies regarding tho early Semitic
                        ritual, restore what has hitherto been only a matter of conjecture. Never
                        has a working party been more closely occupied with copying, and seldom have
                        the resulting conclusions been of greater interest.”</p>

                            <placeName>Mount Sinai</placeName>. Some very useful statistics relating
                        to the population of <placeName>Sinai</placeName> are also given by
                            <persName>Mr. Currelly</persName>. Probably the most interesting feature
                        of his contribution is the explanation of the manna, which he suggests was
                        snow. This theory, however, does not enable us to account for the recorded
                        statement that the Children of Israel were daily sustained by the manna. It
                        is hardly likely that snowstorms would be so frequent, nor can snow by any
                        manner of reasoning be considered food, and this obstacle <persName>Mr.
                            Currelly</persName> admits. He adds: "If the story of manna does not
                        reflect the startling effect produced upon the Hebrews by the sight of snow,
                        the only other explanation that appeals to me is that the sotry itself is
                        literally true."</p>

                    <byline>ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS.</byline>
                    <p>The general meeting of the shareholders of the Suez Canal Company was held in
                            <placeName>Paris</placeName> on Tuesday week. The report of the
                        President, <persName>Prince Auguste d'Arenberg</persName>, begins by
                        pointing out that, after the first few months of 1905, there was a slight
                        diminution of traffic in the canal, causing a falling-off of some
                        2,100,100f. (£84,000) in the receipts. This state of things, however, may be
                        considered as entirely satisfactory having regard to the remarkable and
                        exceptional activity during 1904 following upon a series of years during
                        which there was a steady advance in traffic through the canal. The board of
                        directors propose, therefore, to maintain the figure of 141f. (£5 12s.9) for
                        the dividend, and to set apart 3,000,000f. (£120,000) for the reserve fund.
                        The total receipts for 1905 amount to 117,308,196f. (£4,692,324). and the
                        expenses to 40,984,184f. (£1,639,364). During the year 1906, 4,116 ships,
                        representing 13,134.105 tons, went through the canal. The average tonnage,
                        which was stationary in 1904, rose in 1905 from 3,163 to 3,191 tons.
                        Progressive increase in the average draught of the vessels going through the
                        canal is one of the essential elements in the increase of receipts. In 1885
                        the average tonnage was 1,748 tons. The progress in twenty years has,
                        therefore, been about 80 percent. Yet navigation in the canal is becoming
                        safer every year, as is shown by the diminishing number of founderings. The
                        company have just ordered a second tug boat, so as to do all in their power
                        to avoid delay in going through the canal. The accident to the Chatham
                        furnished an occasion for showing the great resources of the company and the
                        loyalty of the staff. Work is now proceeding from kilomètre 61 to Suez for
                        the widening of the canal by at least 15 mètres. <persName>Prince
                            d’Arenberg</persName> gives other details of the activity in dredging in
                        the construction of new basins, etc. During the opening months of 1906
                        traffic in the canal has been maintained at a very high level, due partially
                        to the repatriation of Russian troops. This special movement still
                        continues.</p>
                    <p>The Prince d'Arenberg, in his opening speech, referred to the stranding of
                        the British vessel Chatham in the canal with a large quantity of dynamite on
                        board, and the consequent hindrance to traffic extending over several weeks.
                        He spoke in warm terms of the engineers and workmen who, at the risk of
                        their lives, blew up the obstruction, and asked the shareholders to join In
                        the congratulations of the Council of Administration. (Applause.) In
                        conclusion, the Chairman insisted on the necessity of proceeding as rapidly
                        as possible with the task of widening and deepening the canal. All the
                        proposals of the board were unanimously adopted, and the outgoing directors
                        were re elected. The report was read and passed without a single question
                        being put. The British members of the Council of Administration present were

                    <p>The Turco-Egyptian officials, says our contemporary, arrived recently at a

                    <p>The sad death of <persName>Captain Seymour C. Bull</persName>, Inniskilling
                        Dragoons, has been the almost sole topic in Service circles since the
                        intelligence became known. Very much regret is expressed at his untimely
                        end, and the wish that the perpetrators of the murderous assault will be
                        brought to justice. In <placeName>Dublin</placeName>,
                            <placeName>Belfast</placeName>, and <placeName>Cork</placeName>, where
                        the unforutnate officer served successively prior to the embarkation of the
                        regiment, he was very popular and his good record of service with the
                        regiment, and his hearty manner and genial temperament under all
                        circumstances, made him hosts of friends at every place he served. it was a
                        sad end to a promising career.</p>

                    <p>Some changes are announced in the commissioned ranks of the Royal Dublin
                        Fusiliers. Captain and Brevent Major E. Fetherstonbaugh, on absorption, is
                        posted to the 1st Battalion at <placeName>Alexandria</placeName>, for where
                        he will embark in due course; <persName>Major R. A. Rooth</persName>, on
                        promotion, remains with the 2nd Batt. at buttevant, and <persName>Captain
                            H.J. Kinsman</persName> has been transferred from the 1st Battalion to
                        the 2nd Battalion. <persName>Major W. Bromilow</persName>, 2nd Battalion,
                        has been selected from amongst the majors of the regiment for the
                        appointment of second in command of the 1st Battalion, Alexandria, and
                        further orders for his embarkation will be made. <persName>Major
                            Bromilow</persName> received his first commission in the Dublins a
                        little over 22 years ago. His selection for the appointment should in the
                        ordinary course give him the command of a battalion before being caught up
                        by the age rules. He got his company in 1893, and majority just at the close
                        of the Boer war, in which he saw service from the autumn of 1901 till the
                        end, including the operations on the Zululand Frontier, and the Transvaal
                        (Queen's medal with four clasps) and the numerous minor affairs in which the
                        1st Battalion was engaged.</p>

                        the battalion, and now Assistand Adjutant General at Cairo, a very valuable
                        and much-prized token of his regard in the shape of a notice board. It is
                        covered with blue cloth, and set in a massive silver frame, surmounted by
                        the regimental crest, and the date "April 24th, 1906" - the day on which he
                        gave up command of the battalion to the regret of all ranks. On the frame
                        are engraved the names of the members of the mess, and along the bottom the
                        inscription: "Presented to the Sergeants' Mess, 1st Battalion Scots Guards,
                        by <persName>Col. Cuthbert</persName>, in remembrance of happy days gone
                        by." The gift has occasioned the greatest pleasure amongst the members of
                        the mess. Their old commanding officer is not likely to be forgotten by
                        those who had the privilege of serving under him.</p>
