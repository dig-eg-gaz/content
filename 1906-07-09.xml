                            <p>A WEEKLY HALF-HOLIDAY</p>
                            <p>An excellent suggestion was recently made to us by ore of the leading
                                tradesmen of the city, to the effect that daring the summer months,
                                when little business is done owing to the heat, especially in the
                                after part of the day, shops should be closed at noon one day every
                                week. Not only would the shop it assistants benefit by the half
                                holiday, but in many instances the principals themselves would be
                                glad of the weekly relaxation, which, in our opinion, could be
                                arranged with little or no difficulty if those interested in the
                                mattsr would take up the question and urge it opon the leading
                                employers. Already the saturday half holiday is enjoyed by the
                                clerks in many offices, and the extension of the boon to the retail
                                trade should be easily brought about There is all the more reason
                                for the adoption of some such measure, inasmuch as there is no such
                                thing as a weekly day of rest for very many shop assistants, who
                                from morning to night, Sundays and holidays included, have to attend
                                to their daily round of duties</p>
                            <p>It is satisfactory to note that the Sunday closing of shops in Egypt
                                is making steady progress. Not many years ago, when an English firm
                                then commencing basinets in Egypt expressed its intention of
                                remaining closed from Saturday to Monday, the leading partner was
                                told that he would find it impossible to succeed without opening as
                                usual on Sunday. But he would not give way and to-day his firm is
                                one doing a very extensive business both here and in Cairo ; and his
                                example has been followed very generally among the leading tradesmen
                                of both towns. The great exception to what would otherwise be the
                                general rule is to be found in the provision trade, and it is
                                somewhat surprising to find that no serious effort is made to obtain
                                the closing of these establishments on Sunday. It would be
                                interesting to hear what steps are being taken by the Société des
                                Employés in this direction, though it is somewhat late in the day
                                for anybody to bring forward arguments in favour of the absolute
                                necessity of one day’s rest in seven. If the human machine it to be
                                kept in perfect working order; the extension of Sunday closing
                                during the last few years and the impossibility of reverting to
                                seven days' work per week when the weekly rest day has been
                                established, affording ample proof that the system has not been
                                found wanting.</p>
                            <p>We look forward with some degree of confidence to action being taken
                                in favour of a weekly half-holiday in the retail trade, and feel
                                sure that even if in the first instance it is only arranged for
                                during the summer, it will soon become an all-the-year-round
                                institution and perhaps pave the way for the still greatest boon of
                                a weekly rest-day for those who do not, at present enjoy this very
                                necessary relaxation from their daily labours.</p>

                    <head>AFTER DENISHAWAI MORE TROOPS WANTED ARTICLE BY MR. DICEY. (Gazette's
                        special service. London, Monday, July 9.</head>
                    <p>Mr. Edward Dicey, C.B., in an article the "Daily Telegraph," says that the
                        latent antagonism between administrators and the administrated in egypt is,
                        in his opinion, not likely to become active under present conditions to such
                        an extent as to endangerthe tenure of our highway to India. The Tribunal,
                        composed of native and English judges, which was constituted by the decree
                        of 1895, has dealt out summary and just punishment to the authors of the
                        Denishwai outrage.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Dicey is inclined to think that the prompt and stern judgement passed on
                        the ringleaders will tend to keep things quiet. Any mitigation of the
                        well-deserved punishment, would be ascribed, not to humanity, but to fear.
                        We must largely increase our forces both in the Delta and the Sudan, and
                        make it manifest that any outrage of this kind will be punished with equal
                        severity.</p>
                    <p>MORE QUESTIONS IN PARLIAMENT</p>
                    <p>Sir Edward Grey was further questioned in the House of Commons last week with
                        reference to the Denishwai executions.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Reddy asked whether he was aware that whilst one of the Egyptian natives
                        was being hanged at Denishwai, on June 28, two others were flogged within
                        view of the gallows; that a large multitude, including women, were looking
                        on; and that the flogging caused horrible cries; and whether the sentences
                        were carried out under the supervision of Captain Machell, adviser to the
                        Egyptian Minister of the Interior.</p>
                    <p>Several other Hon. Members had put down questions on the same subject.</p>
                    <p>Sir E. Grey: In consequence of the statements which have appeared in the
                        Press, I have asked for a full report of how these sentences were carried
                        out with special reference to the points raised in this and other questions.
                        Meanwhile I cannot say who is primarily responsible for the actual carrying
                        out of the sentences.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Dillon: May we tke that as an answer to all the questions on the paper?
                        If so, when will the right hon. gentleman be in a position to answer those
                        questions.</p>
                    <p>Sir E. Grey: I have, as a matter of fact, prepared an answer to ever
                        question, but really the reply i have given applies to all of them.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Reddy: Does the right hon. gentleman deesire to cloak it? (cries of
                        "order")</p>
                    <p>Mr. Myer: Is the report in the newspapers substantially true?</p>
                    <p>Sir E. Grey: On this particular point i have asked for a full report of all
                        the circumstances.(ministerial cheers.) I assume there can be only one
                        impression produced by the details as they appeared in the newspapers, and i
                        think it most desirable that instead of giving information piecmeal we
                        should have a full report. (Hear, hear.) when that report is received I
                        shall, of course, be prepared to lay it on the table.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Macneill: Will the right hon. gentleman direct the full report to be
                        cabled?</p>
                    <p>Sir E. Grey: No, sir. the number of points raised inconnection with both
                        sentences and trial make it absolutley necessary that it should be
                        considered a report. (Hear, hear)</p>
                    <p>Mr. Pickersgill: Will the right hon. gentleman be in possesion of that report
                        before the Foreign Office vote is taken?</p>
                    <p>Sir E.Grey: I do not think it is possible that the report can be received by
                        Thursday.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Dillon: Then will the right hon gentleman consider the desirability of
                        postponing the vote, or get the report sent by cable? Would it not be very
                        unfair to deny the House the only opportunity it will have of considering
                        the report this session?</p>
                    <p>Sir E. Grey: I recognise the importance of the matter, but there are other
                        questions which should also be considered not connected with it. (Hear,
                        hear.) My one object is to give the House the fullest inforation, and not to
                        minimise the matter in any way. when I am in possession of the report, no
                        doubt an oppurtunity will be found for its discussion.</p>
                    <p>Mr. J.D. White asked the secratary for Foreign Affairs whether the hanging
                        and flogging of natives at Danishwai on June28 were of a public character;
                        whether some hundreds of natives, men and women, were present as spectators;
                        and, if so, whether steps would be taken to have the execution of any such
                        sentences in Egypt conducted in accordance with the usage of civilised
                        nations.</p>
                    <p>Sir E. Grey: The sentences were ordered to be carried out in public, and when
                        I have recieved the full report the question of whether such executions
                        should take place in public will be considered.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Dillon: May I ask whether any official attempt has been made to induce
                        any of the London Press to abstain from publishing any of the details of
                        these cases?</p>
                    <p>Sir E. Grey: I am not aware of any attempt, official or otherwise, to
                        influence that Press in any way.</p>
                    <p>Mr. C. Wason asked the prime minister, if in view of the demoralising effect
                        of public executions and floggings, and their long abandonment in the United
                        Kingdom,he would order their discontinuance in all countries directly on
                        indirecty under the flag of the British Empire.</p>
                    <p>Sir H. Campbell-Bannerman: I will consult my colleagues as to the extent,
                        which i believe to be very limited, to wish public executions take place,
                        and consider whether any and what steps should be taken.</p>

                    <head>Sir E. Grey's Speech. Comments of Native Press.</head>
                    <p>Commenting on Sir Edward Grey's speech in the House of Commons on Friday,
                        "Al-Moayad" says:--"Lord Cromer was present when Sir Edward Grey delivered
                        his sensatinal speech à propos of the Denishwai sentence; and we may infer
                        that the British Diplomatic Agent was the real speaker, the latter being
                        only inspired by him to deliver so alarming a speech before the british
                        Parliament. We understand from that apeech that Lord Cromer, in the person
                        of Sir E. Grey, has been fearing that an inquiry into the Denishwai affair
                        would probably be required by Parliament and that such an inquiry, if
                        seriously held, would show who were really responsible for the affair and
                        would reveal the secret of the case. That is why he requested Parliament not
                        to pass a hasty judgement in the matter. Lord Cromer, who knows that members
                        of Parliament are unaware of Egyptian customs and havits of mind, could not
                        find anything better than the plea of religious fanaticism to make the more
                        sagacious members cease to press for a reply to their just demands.
                        Religious fanaticism has shown itself this year, according to Lord Cromer,
                        not only in Egypt byt also in all the northern party of Africa. He did not
                        forget to add that this fanaticism has been directed against all Europeans
                        in Egypt alike. Now, Religious fanaticism is sort of a goblin- a mumbo
                        jumbo- to the British officials here; they, it apprears, become frightened
                        of its effects and remain silent. Sir Edward Grey then emphasized his speech
                        declaring that Parliament should by no means weaken or destroy the Egyptian
                        Government's authority, the suppression of which will lead to serious
                        reukts. It is by this unjust and unfair policy that Egypt is governed. No
                        other voice exceot that of the absolute Governor of Egypt can ever be heard
                        in England. Lord Cromer said nothing about the Denishwai incidentin
                        Parliament, but, in the person of Sir E. Grey, requested the members no to
                        deal with this question, which was a "result of religious fanaticism." Had
                        the noble Lord asked himself whether the fanaticism was really in existence
                        or not he would have believed the latter as he has experience in the
                        Egyptian qualities and circumstances. Hearing such a debate to have taken
                        place in the British Parliament we have to contradict every word pronounced
                        regarding the fanatisicm of the Egyptians. Lord Cromer acts to preserve his
                        absolutism in Egypt from any superior authority such as that of Parliament,
                        which in discussing such matters considers nobody to be above justice. The
                        Egyptians, consequesntly, cannot maintain any safeguards for their national
                        future unless hey set their matters directly before Parliament, whih should
                        know how matters stand in Egypt from a native source. This was what we
                        declared several years ago when we visited London and shook hands with some
                        of the members of Parliament.</p>
                    <p>Sheikh Ali Youssef, it will be remembered, paid a visit to London a few years
                        ago. A banquet organised by Mr. Benjamin Mosely, at which a number of
                        journalists ad several members of Parliament were present,was given in his
                        honour.</p>
                    <p>"Al Lewa" says:-- How does the British Minister know that religious
                        fanaticism exists in Egypt, and that itis dangerous? Did he derive this
                        conclusion from the Denishwai people, who are all "learned and of a high
                        class," or from their attacks against the British troops in their camp?
                        There is no reason why they should put everything down in Egypt to religious
                        fanaticism. If the British officials like to defend their policy in Egypt
                        they will be acting most unreasonably, imputing criminality and fanaticism
                        to all the Egyptians, and could surely find some other arguments to defend
                        that policy. It is curious to hear that the Europenas in Egypt are in
                        danger; and we should like to know what are the other meausures which the
                        British Government would take in Egypt beyond those already taken by the
                        occupation. We call upon the Regent to contradict against the Egyptians in
                        the British Parliament, as we know the effects of such serious suspicions,
                        and to what result the suspicions of Sir E. Grey are likely to lead.</p>
                    <p>The comments made by "aL-Minbar" are on the same lines as those of
                        "AL-Moayad." Says out new contempoary: Lord Cromer has delivered a speech in
                        the person of Sir E Grey in Parliament, and he only went to the House to
                        hear and see what effects his arguments would produce upon the members.</p>
                    <p>After mentioning the "Daily Telegraph's" statement regarding the Egyptians,
                        their fanaticism, and attachment to the Turkish Government, "AL-Minbar"
                        says: Our only Fault is to dare to criticise British policy in Egypt and
                        sympathise with the Ottoman Government owing to its suzerainty ovr
                        Egypt.</p>

                        as follows: "I had not read this news in the papers before you told me ofit.
                        As to be flogging being more useful and effective that imprisonment, that it
                        quite unreasonable, and i do not think that anyone, possesing feelings and
                        reason, would weigh that present circumstances of our country and yet
                        require the Government to make use of the ship as means of punishment."</p>
                    <p>From the Pasha's words, remaks the writer, I gather that if the suggested
                        reintroduction of flogging is brought before the liegislative council for
                        discussion that project will meet with disapproval.</p>

                    <head>THE LEVANT SQUADRON RUMOURS OF RE-ESTABLISHMENT.</head>
                    <p>It is rumoured at Gibraltat that the former Levante quadrom is to be
                        re-established. Four Atlantic ships are to be attached to Malta, and six
                        ships to remain in Malta and six ships to remain in Malta and six ships to
                        cruise in the Levant during the winter months. The reason given for the
                        increase is thay since cruising was discontinued in Eastern waters numerous
                        difficulties have arisen in Egypt and Turkey. The Mediterranean Fleet will
                        probably remain at Gibraltar three weeks after the manoeuvres, and then,
                        calling at Malta, will proceed to the Atlantic, and from there to the
                        East.</p>
                    <p>DR. ANDREWS' INVESTAGATIONS IN THE FAYOUM.</p>
                    <p>The interesting results obtained by Dr. C. W. Andrews in his investigations
                        of the fossil mammalia of the classical region of the Fayoum, have (the
                        "Globe" states) been published in the form of a descriptive catalogue by the
                        trustees of the British Museum. The strata from which the remains have been
                        obtained are of middle and upper Eocene age, and are situated to the north
                        of that ancient irrigation reservoir knownas Lake Moeris. The more recent of
                        these beds show indications of having been deposited nearer the land mass,
                        and the coast line advanced northwards as time passed on</p>
                    <p>One of the most interesting mammalian forms described is a four-toed
                        ungulate, with remarkably massive and powerful horns. Near the place where
                        its bones were disinterred from the rocks stands themount representing the
                        site of Arsinoe, otherwise Crocodilopolio where the sacred crocodile kept in
                        Lake Moeris was worshipped. Hence Dr. Andrews has appropriately named this
                        strange creature Arsinoitherium, that is, the beast of Arsinoe. LakeMoeris,
                        again, has provided a name for Moeritherium, interesting as the earliest and
                        most generalised representative of the Probosoidian, or Elephant, order.
                        Africa, which is one of the two regions where the elephants now occur, was
                        thus probably the place of origin of the order.</p>
                    <p>Another interesting Fayoum species is the Megalohyrax, or Giant Hyrax. This
                        would appear to be the first fossil representative of that curious modern
                        animal, the Hyrax. There are some thirteen species of these little animals,
                        though some authorities consider many of them to be mere varieties.Showing
                        in their structure and habits affiaities with such diverse forms as the
                        hare, rhinoceros, hippopotamus, and sloth their classifcation has been
                        somewhat of a difficulty to zoologists. Regarded by some as rodents, they
                        were casted by cuvier with his Pachyderms. Hax'ey cute the Gordian knot of
                        their relationship by making them a separate order. With the exception of
                        the Syrian Hyrax, probably the "Cony" of scripture, the Hyracoidea are
                        confined to Africa.</p>
                    <p>It is interesting thus to find that Africa, the present home of the Hyrax,
                        was also the place of origin of the family, and that it was in Eocene times
                        represented by omparatively giganticspecies. Dr. Andres considers that the
                        new facts brought to light by his researches support the theory of a former
                        land connection between Africa and South America. This existed perhaps in
                        Jurassic times, and continued up to tertiary.</p>
                    <p>JEWISH HISTORICAL SOCIETY</p>
                    <p>The annual conference of the Union of Jewsish Literary Societies held in
                        London was brought to a close last week with a meeting held in the Physics
                        Theatre of University College, under the auspices of the Jewish Historical
                        Society. The chariman, Dr. H. Gollancz, referred to the fact that the
                        society now had its headquarters in that building, and that the Mocatta
                        library, about to be opened, was being taken over by the authorities of the
                        college. He had hoped that in return for the hospitality afforder to the
                        Jewish Historical Society, those students who engaged in the stufy of Hebrew
                        and Orientallanguages at the Universitywould dervice material assistance
                        from the memorial library now being established.</p>
                    <p>The proceedings took the form of a series of lectures by Sir Isidore
                        Spielmann, Mr. Israel Abrahams, and the Rev. S. Levy. The firstnamed gave a
                        detailed history of the events which led up to the Whitehall Conference in
                        1655, which resulted in the Readmission of the Jews into England through the
                        strenuous efforts of Menasseh ben Israel. Mr. Abrahams gave and interesting
                        description of the "crafwford" Hagadah, the book recited in all Jewish
                        households on the first eve of Passover, narrating the story of the
                        miraculous deliverance from Egyptian bondage. A perfect series of lantern
                        slides, taken from photographs by Mr. Frank Haes, were requisitioned to
                        illustrate the lecture, which was humorously delivered by Mr. Abrahams.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Levy explained a number of portraits shown on the screen, giving details
                        of some of the leading figures at the Whitehall conference, principal among
                        them being SirJohn Glynee, the representative of law, and Major General
                        Lambert, one of the three members who advocated the readission of the Jews
                        without any restrictions whatever. Simon de Montfort's Leicester Charter,
                        forbidding Jews to reside in the city of Leicester, was the concluding paper
                        of the evening's programme.</p>

                    <p>We do not hold ourselves responsible for the opinions expressed by out
                        correspondents, but we wish, in a spirit of fair play to all, to
                        permit-within certain necessary limits-free discussion.</p>
                    <p>MR. DILLON AND DENISHWAI</p>
                    <p>We have received the following letter from a well-known member of a Roman
                        Catholic Mission:</p>
                    <p>Dear Mr. Editor,-- With your kind permission i should willingly try to
                        justify Mr. Dillon's conduct in the House of Commons relative to the
                        Denishwai affair. I dont think it fair to say he has been unruly. I dont
                        think it right to have it asserted he has been governed by malicious
                        impulses.</p>
                    <p>Let us consider the facts. Unfortunately I havent a copy of his first
                        question, but, if my memory does not fail me, they were about the trial by
                        special court. He desired to know if the officers were on duty, and
                        furthermore if they were in uniform; and Sir. E. Grey, being unable to
                        answer, graciously promised to take note of the implicit remark conveyed
                        through the questions. Now, a polite answer generally supposes a correct
                        question, and the Secretary for Foreign Affairs had, himself, no difficulty
                        in admitting the soundness of Mr. Dillon's view. And surely they were not
                        both unruly, or did Sir E. Grey feel a little of the impulse?</p>
                    <p>His more recent questions have been asked with the same apparent calm and
                        dignity, and answered as fully as possible, a fact that proves their
                        reasonableness has been approved of. Had the justice of an English Court;
                        were they in no wise related? If so, was it not the interest of the English
                        nation to see things done thoroughly and rightly? What is unruly in asking
                        were the pigeons tame or wild, in asking had the officers permission to
                        shoot, in ascertaining were the Arabs provoked before they attacked? What is
                        unruly in all the rest? Let the judges of the Special Court give the answer:
                        they have inquired into all these things with a greater animus, i hope, than
                        even Mr. Dillon himself has manifested. Mr. Dillon, in my opinion, has acted
                        through no impulse whatsoever but his conduct is stamped with honour. I have
                        heard most repectable Englishmen in Egypt say, with whom he is intimately
                        acquainted, that Mr. Dillon is the most perfect gentlemen they have ever met
                        with. It is not right then to slander him, even here in this out-of-the-way,
                        half-civilised country: Cui honor, honor.</p>
                    <p>I have nothing to say for the followers of Mr. Dillon. He has none: he is but
                        himself the follower of an able and enlightened man who is an honour and an
                        ornament to the British Parliament. The party to which he belongs is meant
                        undoubtedly "but of course it is known to all Britishers in this country"
                        that they, the members of that party, disturb and dirty the limpid waters of
                        every policy, even when these waters quietly flow uphill.</p>
                    <p>These questions are sure, in fact, to do more good than harm. They plainly
                        show to Egyptians and others that justice and fairplay have their
                        representatives in the imperial parliament, and that nobody shall be trodden
                        under foot with impunityor wihtout the stigma of abhorrence. And no man is
                        more entitled to rank among these than Mr. Dillon, who has known how to
                        uphold a just cause and suffer for it. I trust, then, that "anglo-Egyptian"
                        will not think it amiss on my part for having crossed swords with him over
                        the honour and respect due to Mr. John Dillon.</p>
                    <p>Now, one might think i am against the severity of the Denishwai verdict. Not
                        in the least. In the words of and English paper, it was a regrettable and
                        unhappy necessity. The criminals acted with cowardice and brutality, and if
                        they have met with a rigorous treatment, they have, in the full senseof the
                        word, been cruel and merciless. And those who try to polliate their conduct
                        do so, I am afriad, throughunruly sympathy or foul jealousy.</p>
                    <p>But this has nothing to do with a justice-loving representative a justice
                        loving people. Fairplay</p>
                    <p>Turkish Coal</p>
                    <p>To the editor of the "Egyptian Gazette"</p>
                    <p>Sir,--In reply to "Coal Merchant," I gave ten shillings as the maximum cost
                        of the coal, as I am not sure what the latest figure is C.I.F. the coal is
                        sold in Constantinople, 180 miles away, at 16s. the ton, but isnot much in
                        evidence in view of the opposition of a number of coal-agents who represent
                        English collieries and who allege that the Herackes coal contains too much
                        sulphur to make it of use to oceangoing steamers. This is perhaps true of
                        some refuse stuff that is brought down, but where the coal has properlu
                        washed and screened excellent results are obtained, to the satisfaction of
                        all. In fact I know of several agents who prefer the cheaper Turkish coal to
                        Newcastle not only because of cheaper price but because it is nearer at hand
                        for ships in Levant and Black Sea waters.</p>
                    <p>As regards shipping facilities, there are many. First of all the société runs
                        severalsteamers to and from Zonguldagh, and besides this there are a number
                        of Turkish steamers and sailing vessels which are continually bunkering or
                        loading coal at the port. Most of the mines being on the sea the coal can be
                        had as soon as possible, being delved, wasged and picked almost in sight of
                        the steamers. The natural and artificial advantages of Zonguldagh are such
                        that the ships can coal and clear without delay. The Zonguldagh valley is
                        not the best coal of the Heraclea basin; there are other beds in the
                        neighbouring valleys opening on to the sea which contain a rich seam of coal
                        that is much appreciated. However as there is no port of shelter vessels
                        have perforce to call at Zonguldagh and these include nearly all stemers
                        engaged in the Black Sea trade.</p>

                        in this region of Asio Minor. If the German is penetrating the interior, we
                        might at least exploit the seacost of that naturally wealthy peninsula.
