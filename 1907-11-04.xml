                    <p>THE DATTARI COLLECTION AT CAIRO</p>
                    <p>In the last issued number of the "Revue Archéologique" one of the most
                        attractive articles was that upon a marble group in the Dattari collection
                        at Cairo. An excellent photo Prize. gravure is supplied and the antiquarian
                        des 1. 40, cription is by Mr. H. Seymour de Ricci of arded Paris. The group,
                        or rather cluster, of figures comes from Dear Memphis and was found there in
                        ery at 1905. It is carved ont of one single block of white marble.
                        Unfortunately the Hachi. central, and considerably the larger and grander,
                        figure, that of Aphrodite, has lost the head and the greater part of both
                        anos. The attitude of the goddess however is so well know from other
                        representations of Antiquity that Baron the statue may be affirmatively
                        assigned as an Aphrodite Anadiomene, that is to say that she is standing
                        with the excess of weight apon the left foot and with both hands wringing
                        the moisture from her tresses prize having just risen from the water. One of
                        the and most beautiful replions of the style of AphroLeo dite statue is the
                        Staart Wellees statuette preserved in London : but also emapating pur). from
                        Egypt, having been aequiredat Minieh. The asce other figures in the Dattari
                        sculpture are a - T. smaller figure of Aphrodite in almost precisely similar
                        pse. Why the artist arranged this Ist duplicate of the Goddess is a mystery.
                        It also is of very inferior execution to the larger and Ban more majestie
                        one. As the miniature statuette had to remain attached in the marble to the
                        rize right leg of the larger one, the artist did not Mr. wish the flesh of
                        both to be in juxtoposition, so a piece of drapery covers the leg of the
                        larger figure below the knee leaving only the ankle anal and foot exposed.
                        Bat, it hangs in an, impossibal ssefble position and shows the lack of
                        ability of 2nd the soulptor. The other side of the group is a Mr. carving of
                        two children embracing, delineated in similar style to the admirable work in
                        the el Capitol Museum at Rome. The pretty attitude of the boy in the and
                        Capitoline example, whose hand seeks to open the lips of the little girl to
                        impress a kiss thereon is not attempted by the Memphite copyist; and in this
                        he follows most replicas of the pair. Curiously enough the size of the the
                        children's group is much larger than thatof the smaller Aphrodite and so the
                        whole piece ro th, does not balance in any way This renders it lor A
                        extremely difficult to suggest any raison d'être for the whole work But Mr.
                        de Rieci anggests one which a care was be ful survey of the piece confirms
                        as being probably correet. That is that the soulptor, mad perbaps a student,
                        and proof of his advance the ment in his art was at some examination given T
                        the piece of marble and ordered to execute in d it the figures that he felt
                        it would best permit jetty him to render, stilising much of the block for
                        the purpose as possible. ticul Most likely the work had to be executed in In
                        dla given time, hence the leaving of a piece of coas drapery, or garment,
                        between two of the in fin figures where the rounding off of the limbs would
                        have closed much delay. The young sente artist doubtless selected the
                        Aphrodite and them the group of the child lovers because in the ure a studio
                        he had executed separate replicas of every these and so he could recarve
                        them with more accuracy and rapidity and because he had to of m work in as
                        much of the block as possible, varied their dimensions to suit the size of
                        the piece of kindn marble. That this, the correct view of the of the case,
                        is substantiated by the back of the scalption, tore being almost as
                        carefully carved and and completed as is the front, which probably it! would
                        not have been if merely intended for BRIT sale to some bourgeois amateur
                        collector to stand upon a shelf in his home, or in a cabinet. matel This
                        hypothesis adds much interest to the from relie and renders it an important

                        fierce struggleda was witnessed during the last few hundredet yards.
                        Unfortunately the second boat (German) eing tor, made a bad start due to not
                        hearing or seeing bli the starter's pistol, which is regrettable. There was
                        great excitement amongst the cas ven members of the towing clubs, who
                        crowded the mit jetty when the rowing boats houe in sight, and cheered,
                        shouted, and waved their caps, parme ticularly those of the winning boats.

                    <p>Nous croyons faire plaisir à nos lecteurs en publiant la conclusion d'une
                        brochure très documentée que le Dr. Alfred Eid vient de faire paraltre sur
                        ce sujet; la voici in extenso:</p>
                    <p>Sauf pour les terrains de la troisième catégo rie (comprenant les terrains
                        éloignés, situés en dehors de tout mouvement) la situation est saine, les
                        prix qu'ils ont atteints sont justifiés, si l'on fait abstraction de
                        quelques prix payés en pleine effervescence et qui ne sont pas as sez
                        nombreux pour avoir une influence sur l'ensemble de la fortune urbaine. Les
                        différents facteurs de l'évolution que nous avons étudiés continueront leur
                        œuvre et contribueront en core dans l'avenir au développement des villes
                        égyptiennes.</p>
                    <p>Comment se fait-il qu'un malaise général se soit emparé des spéculateurs et
                        propriétaires, malaise qui peut dégénérer en vraie crise? La cause de ce
                        malaise est dans la rapidité même de l'évolution. Nous venons d'exposer
                        comment les propriétaires ont acheté, en prévision de be- soins toujours
                        grandissants, des terrains bien plus nombreux que ceux qu'ils pouvaient con-
                        vrir de constructions. C'était déjà s'exposer à un grand danger que de
                        laisser ainsi des capi- taux considérables sans revenu immédiat; et ce
                        danger fut encore aggravé par les nombreux achats à tempérament de terrains
                        sans rapport.</p>
                    <p>Une dette très lourde fut ainsi constituée ans rentrées suffisantes pour en
                        couvrir les charges; au moindre resserrement du crédit cette dette devra
                        peser de tout son poids sur les détenteurs actuels des terrains, ébranler
                        leur situation et arrêter toute transaction nou- velle.</p>
                    <p>Cependant cette dette a été beaucoup exa- gérée ces temps derniers ainsi que
                        l'étendue des transactions urbaines; comme il arrive toujours en pareil cas,
                        un revirement de l'opi- nion publique s'est produit, arrêtant bon nom- bre
                        de gens qui auraient pu contribuer efficace ment à maintenir la situation.
                        Oubliant l'en- gouement de naguère on s'effraya du rayon énorme sur lequel
                        s'étaient étendus les achats, sans songer qu'une grande partie des terrains
                        compris dans ce rayon devra rester à l'état actuel et que les terrains
                        achetés au loin sont destinés à former des flots d'habitation sépa rés,
                        entourée de jardins et de terrains maral- chers pour lesquels il n'y a pas
                        lieu de penser d'ici très longtemps encore à la destination urbaine. Ces
                        flots ne doivent certainement pas être considérés comme une continuation de
                        la ville.</p>
                    <p>Nous ne pouvons done aller plus loin avant d'avoir dégagé la valeur réelle
                        des acquisitions et de la dette qui en est résultée. Malheureu- sement, ce
                        sont là des données difficiles à éta- blir, vu le grand nombre de personnes
                        qui ont pris part à ces affaires et le peu de publicité de ces dernières.
                        Aussi nos résultats ne peuvent- ils être que très approximatifs.</p>
                    <p>An Caire et dans ses environs les lotisse ments et achats nouveaux forment
                        une surface de 9 millions de mètres carrés environ repré- sentant une valeur
                        d'achat, tous frais compris, de 6 millions de liv. ég. et une valeur de re-
                        vente de 12 millions. Ces différentes transac tions se répartissent comme
                        snit:</p>
                    <p>1. Quartiers centraux de la ville: 200,000 mètres carrés pour 3 millions de
                        liv. ég, soit en moyenne 15 liv. ég. par metre carré;</p>
                    <p>2. Lotissements et ventes dans les quartiers nouveaux: Choubrah, Ghézireh,
                        Garden City, etc., compris dans notre évaluation: 1,100,000 mètres carrés
                        ponr 4 millions de liv. ég. soit un peu moins de 4 liv. ég. le mètre
                        carré.</p>
                    <p>3. Lotissements autour de la ville, com- prenant les nouveaux terrains
                        s'étendant de Konbbeh à Marg, Mahmacha, les lotissements entre Rod el Farag
                        et Choubrah village, Rodab, la rive gauche du Nil et les parcelles loties de
                        Meadi: 7,600,000 mètres carrés pour 5,300,000 liv. ég, soit en moyenne 0.70
                        liv, ég. le mètre carré.</p>
                    <p>Les lotissements suburbains n'ont done a- grandi le domaine de la ville,
                        comme nous l'a vons établi, que de 7,600,000 mètres carrés ayant une valeur
                        de vente de 5,300,000 liv.ég.. soit une augmentation de 28 p.e. pour la
                        super- ficie et sealement de 6.4 p.e pour la valeur. Si même toute cette
                        superficie était complè tement perdue pour la construction, le déficit
                        serait petit en comparaison de la valeur globale de la ville. Mais
                        heureusement il n'en est pas ainsi et un tiers au moins de ces terrains,
                        pos- sède déjà tous les éléments d'un développe- ment lent mais continu.</p>
                    <p>L'unique indication nons permettant de nous faire une idée de la dette
                        résultant des tran sactions urbaines, nous est fournie, par les bilans des
                        societés. On compte actuellement en Egypte une quarantaine de sociétés
                        s'ocon- pant d'opérations immobili res; les unes en font leur occupation
                        exelusive, les autres y joignent soit des entreprises agricoles soit des
                        entreprises de constructions et de travanx publics.</p>
                    <p>Parmi ces sociétés sept ont pour but unique de construire des maisons et de
                        les exploiter directement; elles ont un capital nominal de 844,000 liv. ég.
                        et un capital libéré de 494,000 liv. ég (soit respectivement 21,1 et 12,3
                        mil- lions de francs). Leur genre d'opérations ne rentre pas dans nos

                        si les placements de ces sociétés en terrains urbains sont faibles
                        relativement aux ressources, cela est du au fait que beancoup d'entre elles

                    <p>En dehors des sociétés anonymes, il y a quel ques sociétés en commandite et
                        de nombreux particuliers qui se sont occupés de ce genre d'affaire
                        L'évaluation de leur charge est plus malaisée encore vu le manque de tout
                        document public. Les renseignements que nous avons pris à des sources
                        privées, nous permet tent de croire toutefois que nous ne sommes pas bien
                        loin de la vérité en estimant l'impor tance de leurs opérations à la moitié
                        de celles des sociétés anonymes. </p>
                    <p>Nous pouvons donc évaluer l'ensemble des terrains disponibles pour la
                        construction en Egypte à une dizaine de millions de liv. ég: et le montant
                        total des charges provenant des ventsed terme sur la propriété immobilière
                        (terrains vagues et construits) à environ 849 millions de liv. ég. Dans ces
                        charges figurent! les dettes dues par plusieurs aoquéreurs sticces ! sifs
                        pour un même terrain. </p>
                    <p>De telles charges sont loddes assurément, I néanmoins, sans vouloir atténuer
                        lour gravity il est de notre devoir de montrer que toutes ces charges ne
                        pèsent pas d'un poids mort sur le la propriété urbaine et que même dans
                        l'état actuel une partie des dettes s'éteint petita petit. </p>
                    <p>Beaucoup de terrains situés dans la ville donnent des revenus permettant A
                        leur acqué. reur de se libérer dans les délais fixés ; d'autres, en
                        transformation, sont déja assurés d'une rentrée suffisante pour le moment on
                        ilx pour. ront recevoir des locataires. Parmi les sociétés et les
                        particuliers ayant entrepris de grands lotissements, la plupart tirent des
                        revenus soit d'entreprises nrbaines en pleia rapport, soit d'entreprises
                        agricoles ou commerciales qui leur permettent de supporter les charges de
                        lenrs terrains invendus et meme la pertu eventuello qu'ils subiront sur les
                        terrains excentriques Ajoutons, en ce qui concerne ces derniers, que les
                        grands lotisseurs les ont achetés souvent des prix tellement bas que les
                        sommes qu'ils out touobées sur les parties revendues couvrent dans une
                        certaine mesam leurs débours et que par conséquent ils pourraient garder
                        improdue tives pendant unsez longtemps les parties invendues. </p>
                    <p>La situation la plus critique est celle des petits péculatoors qui ont placé
                        leur épargne dans des terrains dépourvus pour le moment de touto valeur et
                        de oeux qui ont fait des su crifices pour spheter des terrains ayant un
                        avonir immédiat mais qui n'ont plus les moyens pour les atitisor de
                        maintenant en les dotant de constructione adéquate </p>
                    <p>Il fait dono impiter le malaise actuel moins à la spéculation, bien que
                        quelques excée aient <cb n="2"/> provoqué la méfiance, gu'à la stagnation
                        gé. nérale des affaires qui a désorganisé le crédit, a empêché ceux qui en
                        avaient le plus besoin de se procurer des fonds d'exploitation et qui,
                        aggravant les charges existantes, a arrêté tonte affaire nouvolle dans le
                        domaine urbain. </p>
                    <p>Le remède contre ce mal est tout indique : prolongation. Wes échéances
                        jusqu'à des temps meilleurs, liquidation prudente et successive des
                        positions surchargées, adoption de combinaisons financieras mettant a la
                        portée des propriétaires et des entrepreneurs les sommes nécessaires pour
                        rendre productifs los bons torrains. C'est là une conduite d'autant plus
                        facile à suivre que les sociétés immobilières, in téressées directement ou
                        indirectement dans la plupart des grandes transactions, possèdent les
                        ressources nécessaires pour attendre et même liquider si o'était nécessaire
                        dertaines affaires avec quelques pertes et que d'autre part, les capitaux
                        engagés, non pas dans la sprculation mais dans la construction, ne oourent
                        aucun risque. </p>
                    <p>Ces mesures peuvent être appelées de bote négatif du programme urbain, elles
                        sont de tinées à relever le crédit, à aplavir les difficultés de l'heure
                        présente. Ensuite il y aura toyl an programme positif à remplir, car on
                        aurait tort | de croire que l'évolution des villes égyptiennes est
                        définitivement arrêtée et qu'il n'y a plus rien Afrire au point de vue
                        immobilier. </p>
                    <p>Les principaux points de ce programme sont la multiplication de constructions
                        sur les terrains vides des quartiers en plein développe mont; élaboration
                        des combinaisons financières permettant même aux classes moyennes de de
                        venir propriétaires dans la banlieue, création sur certains lotissements
                        existants d'agglomé. rations nouvelles répondant à toutes les exi gences de
                        l'hygiène et accessibles à toutes les | boarses. Ces agglomérations pourront
                        être asi sez éloignées des centres, mais elles doivent être dotées de moyens
                        de communications rapides. C'est un projet d'agglomération de ce genre que
                        la Socisté des Oasis est en train d'exécuter en ce moment. </p>
                    <p>Une des parties et non la moins intéressante de ce programme est celle ayant
                        trait anx quartiera indigènes et aux villes de province. Nous avons vu
                        combien les quartiers araber du Caire et d'Alexandrie étaient en retard sur
                        le reste de la ville et quelles difficultés s'oppo saient A leur
                        transformation. Mais dès que les pouvoirs publics auront exécuté les
                        grandtravaux d'utilité publique, les entreprises im mobilières qui
                        rénoveront ces quartiers pour ront bien réaliser tout ce qui s'est fait
                        jusqu'aujourd'hui dans les centres. </p>
                    <p>Les villes de provinces se trouvent un peu dans la situation des quartiers
                        arabes. Elles réunissent tous les éléments nécessaires à leur évolution :
                        angmentation de la prospérité gént. rale, extension des affaires,
                        concentration de la population, changement dans le genre de vie, relations
                        de plus en plas suivies avec la Caire et Alexandrie. Il ne lear manque qu'un
                        encouragement sérieux de la part des autorités, quel ques modifications
                        radicales dans le réseau de leurs rues, la création et le développement de
                        services publics tels que : eau, éclairage, tram ways, et surtout la
                        constitution, pour les villes qui en sont encore privées, de municipalités
                        capables de s'intéresser à leurs besoins pour les voir prendre un essor
                        rapide. </p>

                    <p>1. First statement by Mrs. J. DICKAON, 123, Mid Street, Keith, Scotland, "
                        About two months ago my little boy, who is nearly 3 years old, hud a severe
                        attack of influenza and inflammation; his back was very weak and painful,
                        the lower part of his body was very much swollen, and he was constantly
                        wetting the bod; he often wanted to pass the kidney secretions but very
                        little nt a time. The doctor's treatment doing him no good we started to
                        give him Doan's Backache Kidney Pills, which helped Ashim from the first,
                        and he gradually improved Mlay by day. He is stronger and better in every
                        way, never wots the bed now, and the kidney Jsecretions are quite clear and
                        natural. (Signed) JANE DICKSON." Nearly a year later. - Third statement:
                        "You will see from his photograph how hearty my son looks, he is still
                        keeping in splendid health. I shall always give Doan's Backache Kidaey Pills
                        praises for the great blessing they have proved to him." Doan's Kidney Pills

                            <p>Lord Cromer, speaking at the Guildball on the 28th October, said that
                                he wished Sir El. don Gorst every success which he was apre he •
                                would achieve it he did not allow himself to be burried by faddists
                                in Eagland and their numerous sympathisera in Egypt who regard
                                London as a sort of political Mecca. Referring to the drain of gold
                                to Egypt he said that this was likely to occur annually as the
                                cotton crop was assured and the country well nigh secured against
                                the vicissitudes of season. This year's-Nile was the lowest on rol
                                cord bat it was probable that the crop would be extremely
                                favourable. Every year some £ 25,000,000 or £30,000,000 have to be
                                found to finance the crop. The most remarkable feature was that al
                                great deal of money going to Egypt never comes baok. During the last
                                four years the imports of gold to Egypt amounted to £13,000,000 more
                                than the exports. It was almost impossible to say what becomes of
                                this vast quantity of coin but it is certain that a great deal is
                                converted into jewellery. • Hoarding of money is carried to an
                                extent Almost incredible to Europeang. He cited instances where
                                large sums, bad been hidden in cellars or buried in gardens. He
                                hoped that the banking facilities would gradually wear the natives
                                of Egypt froin this uncommercial habit. Referring to the slump in
                                Egyptian, under takinge, he did not doubt that some individuals
                                deserving of syınpally had suffered, but he could not think that
                                from a general point of view the recent occurrences were to be
                                regretted. He hoped they would do something to stop.
                                over-speculation which had been very narked and was a very
                                mischievous feature of Egyptian markets of recent years. There were
                                many striking instances of this and it was quite manifest that this
                                period of inflation could not last. The prosperity of the country
                                was in no way suffering the wealth of Egypt was essentially
                                agricultural. He only knew of two risks to which it was exposed: if
                                the demand 1or Egyptian cotton were to diminish, un doubtedly great
                                embarrassment would be caused, but bê knew of no reason for
                                supposing that any such contingencey would arise as the world's
                                demand for cotton was steadily in creasing. The other risk was
                                totally different: the financial prosperity of Egypt undoubtedly
                                depended to a great extent on the policy adopted in Egypt He thought
                                it would be a mistake to take too seriously the proceedings of what
                                are called Egyptian Nationalists or of their friends in Great
                                Britain, inasmuch as some of the latter appeared to him, to mislead
                                Egyptians as to the true trend of public opinion in this country and
                                to encourage the hope that political development would be much more
                                rapid than could be at all possible : lie was accustomed to regard
                                these as the worst eneinies of Egyptian pro. gtese. When he said
                                Egyptian Nationalists he did | not wish to be misunderstood : he was
                                not al. luding to those who favoured a moderatereasonable, and
                                gradual extension of self-govern. ing institutions. These had his
                                entire sympathy and throughoat his career in Egypt he had done his
                                beat to encourage them. Henlluded to the extremists who existed in
                                Cairo, as in Calcutta and Dublin. With these gentlemen he did not
                                think it possible to deal. They could not be conciliated save on
                                terms which in India and Ireland would spell political suicide and
                                in Egypt involve relapse into all the unisgovernment and disorder of
                                the past. At present some of the yonth of India and Egypt appeared
                                to be basing their political conduct on the proceedings of agitators
                                in this - country. He referred in this connection to the almost
                                culpable folly of Mr. Keir Hardie. Lord Cromer saw but one method of
                                dealing with the unrest and disturbances in Egypt and India, namely,
                                to continue steadily to do our duty towards the people and to come
                                down with heavy haud upon exemists, should they overstep, the law,
                                but not to be deterred by their presence or proceedings from
                                adopting reforms calculated to satisfy moderate or reasonable
                                aspirations.. (Reuter)</p>

                            <p>A Greek circular to the Powers in reply to the Austro Rossian note
                                points out that every relaxation of the defensive measures taken by
                                the Greeks in Macedonia is followed by a recrudescence of activity
                                among Bulgarian bands. A similar recrudescence followed the
                                Austro-Russian note. The Powers should seek to eliminate the causes
                                of agitation. The Government hopes that any eventual delimitation
                                will be based upon status quo before the Bulgarians sought to modify
                                the ethnographical conditions by violence In deference to the Powers
                                Greece would continue to do her utrnost to assist in pacifica tion
                                and to tranquilliso the Greeks in Mace. donin, but in order to
                                restore confidence it was necessary to protect the latter and to
                                ASSOTO f them with reference to the future. (Reuter) MOBAstir,

                    <p>| Speaking to Mothers. A grateful parent tells of her debt of gratitude to
                        Dr. Williams Pink Pills. "For the sakeof all women broken in health and
                        particularly for the benefit of suffering mothers, I wish to make known the
                        debt of gratitude I owe to Dr. Williams Pink Pills for Pale People." There
                        were the words of Mrs. Abrahams, residing at 29, Bell-street, Leeds; and
                        remarkable indeed is the evidence she supplies of the boon that Dr.
                        Williams, Pink Pills are to womankind. The reason is clear; not only do they
                        supply new, good blood, but they purify bad blood, and give support to weary
                        women. These pills impart strength, develop the appetite, and improve the
                        digestion, alse stimulating the functions of all the organs. For anemia,
                        general weakness, neuralgia, digestive troubles, and the ailments that
                        afflict women only, Dr. Williams' Pink Pills are invaluable. Mrs. Abrahams
                        states :-"It was inst after the birth of my last child that I A became very
                        ill and depressed. I was NO bloodless that I FELL AWAY TO A SHADOW. My face
                        was drawn, my eyes sunken, and I detested the sight of food, for even a
                        glass of milk caused excruciating pains through my chest. Splitting
                        headaches attacked me night and day, and my breathing was accompanied by a
                        stahs through my heart. If I mounted a few stairs I felt poffed. Rest and
                        sleep were out of the question, for when I dozed nightmares startled me. My
                        face became quite white and my lips livid, and my nerves got so beyond
                        control that the LEAST NOISE SENT TREMORS THROUGH ME. Trifles upset and
                        worried me beyond reason and the thought haunted me that I was sink ing to
                        my grave. I had to neglect my home in many ways, because I was not strong
                        enough for the lightest duty. I derived no benefit from ordinary medi. Bu
                        cines. I was sinking fast when Dr. Williams' Pink Pills stepped in and saved
                        me These blood-making pills not only saved me, but made a new wotnen of me;
                        they gave me energy I never expected to enjoy again. As a mother speak. ing
                        to mothers, I strongly advise Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for those weaknesses
                        to which they are subject. "After a few boxes of Dr. Williams' Pink Pills
                        for Pale People my veins were full of rich, red As amother, I strong. IN
                        blood. I enjoyed my meals, ly advise Dr. Will the pains left me, and iams

                        remarked what a wonderful change bad come over me, and they moongratulated
                        me upon my clear and healthy complexion. I perserved with Dr. Williams Pink
                        Pills until I had been restored to perfect health. These pills are a
                        wonderful remedy, and a great boon. To-day I enjoy the best of s. health,
                        and I can honestly say that I have to thank Dr. Williams' Pink Pille for
                        it." Maid, young mother, and elderly matron everywhere sing the prince of
