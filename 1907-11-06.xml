                        You have probably been informed by Agency telegrams that £8,000,000 have been advanced temporarily to the Bank of England by the Bank of France. The acoumey of such a statement is undeniable, but I am able to state with authority that the sum advanced is no less than £6,000,000. Thisadvance is likely to create calmer feeling in the market, and it is questionable as to whether it will be necessary for the Bank of England to raise the rate of discount at to morrow's meeting, the probability of which has been suggested by earlier telegramas.

                        The Survey Department has issued the following report on the weather during October
                        last:
                        Throughout the month, the weather has been usually fine and undisturbed in character.
                        Lightning occurred at Cairo and Port Said on the evening of the 21st. At Cairo, this was immediately followed by a short but violent hailstorm in which there fell hailstones up to ! 25 m.m. in diameter At Port Said on the following afternoon, there was a similar more! violent storm, also preceded by lightning. In this case, the hailstones were even larger than at Cairo, the largest piece picked up being of the weight of 560 grammes.
                        Pressure was above normal over the Eastern Mediterranean, but somewhat below at all stations south of Cairo.
                        Temperature was higher than normal in the Central Mediterranean, lower over Egypt and the Eastern Mediterranean, higher over the Sudan north of Khartout, and lower again south of Khartout.
                        Rainfall was in excess in the south at Kodok and Gallabat usual in the month appears to bave failed entirely.
                        River gauges fell steadily throughout the inonth except for the two small waves which checked the fall of the Blue Nile. Roseires is now 25 cms. below the average of seven years and Wadi Halfa a metre below the average of sixteen years.
                        The volume of the flood has been about 35% below the volume of a sormal flood.

This festival is held on the first three days of Showwal, and celebrates the close of Ramadan, whence it is also called Id el-Fitr ('Festival of Breaking the Fast'). This, though called the minor, is in reality the greater of the two great Muslim "ids as regards ontwarł signs of rejoicing. Prayers are per formed in the mosqnes. New clothes are worn. Visits are made, especially by women, to the tombs upon which palm branches, etc., are laid. Particular dishes are prepared. Amusements of various sorts are provided, and the streets present an animated appearance. The district outside the Babon-Nasr is one of the chief scenes of gaiety. In the cemetery beyond, and near the Tombs of the Khalifs,' tents are pitebed, and the buildings there situate are occupied by visitors, many of whom distributo cakes, dates, eto, to the poor. The Khedive bolds an early reception, which all officials and osny others attend. The princesses also receive visits of numerous ladies.

                        To The EDITOR OF THE "ROYPTIAN GAZETTE."
                        Sir. It is an extraordinary fact that notwithstanding the number of Bnglish residents in Osiro, there is not a school in the town to wbiph Englismen can send their children and At the same time be sure that the education they receive will be the same as it would be in Bogland, in faet there is not a single Baglish school in the town, and such parents are unable to afford the expense of keeping their children at boarding school at bome are obliged to send them to schools in Cairo, which, however, excellent they may be, are still conducted on foreign lines and principles. The foundation of an English school for the exelasive use of the English is of course quite outside the province of the Government, it is only necessary for the people who are interest ed in the subject to prove that the demand exists, and the foundation of such a school wonld follow as a matter of course, but as long as these people appear to be content with the existing system, so will it continue, the persons in whose power the forming of the desired school would lie being naturally backward in the carrying through of a project which is not been asked for and the success of which is to all appearances doubtful. It must be bome in mind that the governing bodies of our large schools at home are for the most part in ignor ance of the needs of this country, indeed we do not doubt that there are a great number of Englistimen in Cairo, residents, who have not the slightest idea of the number of married people of their own nationality, who bave families growing up, and would welcome an educational etablishment here in order to avoid the necessity of keeping their child. ren at home, or of sending them for instruction to schools of an alien nationality. There are of course schools in Cairo, where English masters are kept for the teaching of English, but this is not all that is required, the children are forced to mix with others who are not of their country, and the essential features of our methods of educational training Are thereby lost to them. It is doubtless an ad vantage for ones children to grow up with the knowledge of divers tongues, and the insight into the varied characters of the different nationalities with which they are brought into contact is often of undeniable use to them in after life, but in a town such as Cairo it is not necessary for such experience to be picked up at the schools, the every day existence of residents offers sufficient opportunities for the assimilation of such language and ideas and I consider that in the majority of cases more harm than good is effected by the indiscriminato mixing of nationalities which of necessity occurs under the present regime obtaining in Cairo. It would be to the advantage of any one to start a good school here, make it thoroughly English, and run as nearly as possible on the same lines as at home, and a great and pressing need would be satisfied. It must be distinctly understood that I do not wish to attempt to minimite in the least degree the excellence of the moral and mental training comiaon in the existing schools of Cairo, many of our countrymen have profited materially by them and I wish them all the success which they soundoubtedly deserve, I desire only to call the attention of Boglinh par rents to the fact that the formation of English schools for the teaching of their offspring. lies, to a very great extent in their own hands.

                        A MOSQUITO CAMPAIGN.
                        (From Our Port SAID CORRESPONDENT)
                        Professor Ronald Ross, the director of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, has jast passed through Port Said on his way to Mauritius. He is going there by the invita tion of the Colonial Office to institute a campaign against mosquitoes and malaria in that island. On his arrival in Port Said he visited the Goverrior and the Canal Autho rities and made an examination of the campaign in progress here. He expressed his Approval of the measures taken and the re salts obtained-almost a complete exterminal tion of the past throughout the whole of the European and Native quarters
                        The work bas presented some considerable difficulties which bave now been overcome thanks to the energy of the Governor and Dr. Ross our Sanitary Inspector. There was no opposition on the part of the inhabitants as was at first anticipated by some. There hus! been a great reduction of all fevers in our town this year, and Port Said, which before WAS insanitary, is now a healthy summer resort. Considering that 18 months ago when the onmpaigo was first started, mosquito curtains were used in offices during the day and that Row they are not needed for the beds at night, is sufficient proof of the success of the campaign at Port Said under the supervision of our able inspector

                        ADVISERS AND INSPECTORS.
                        The Egyptian Standard" writes as follows concerning a rumour, probably quite baseless
                        A rumour is current in political circles even in the local press. It is more than a rumour, more than a report, and we, for reasons that need not be defined at any length in thee columns, are in a position to state that these rumours and reports are almost treta, or, to say the least, are founded on foots.
                        Consequently we do not exaggerate when We state that it is not only possible but prob able that the autoeratie despotism of the provincial inspectors is going to use; that in future they will limit the sphere of their activity and authority to the task of inspecting and not ordering the police force in the provinces, and that, on the other hand, the mudirs will recaperste after having been monopolised for years in the hands of British inspectors, in many cases unfit for the task imposed upon them, their legitimate and legal right to provide for public security and safety in the rural districts of the Valley of the Nile.
                        The reform is important. It is one we have incessantly advocated in the interests of the dwellers in the provinces. Consequently we are the first to applaud this new decision taken by the Occupation authorities and which is perhaps due to the new Agent's initiative in the matter.
                        We have likewise pointed out that the police organisation in the provinces wrested from the hands of mudins trained to their work and carefully chosen by the central government, and placed apparently" in those of manikina, in some cases uneducated, and "in reality" in those of solled inspectors whose duty it was to spend many months at head-quarters, many months in England and a few months in
                        soi-disant tan of inspection -- had wrought for greater harm than good to the country and its inhabitants.
                        We even compared Mebemet Ali's times - As far as publie safety is concerned with those of the Occupation, and the deductions drawn from these comparisons favoured the former and not the latter period in Egypt's history
                        We insisted upon the reforms which would have to be introduced in the provincial police organisation, namely, the recuperation by the medins of their authority; the limitation of the inspectors' duties to the task of inspecting, and of thoroughly inspecting without giving precise orders or moving the police force about at their own sweet will. And thirdly we insisted upon the education of madirs and omdehs and police officers-upon the practical education which would give them the necessary insight into and knowledge of social organisations, to enable them to discharge their duties as their more experienced forefathers had done before the days of the Occupation and the epoch of denationalisation.
                        We now learn that the first two parts of our demands have been listened to namely that the inspeetors' rule is to be limited to inspection, and that the madirs and omdehs are to be given a freer hand in the discharge of their duties. Remains the third part of our demand, which we sincerely hope will be taken into immediate consideration and be deserving of a special mention among the proposed educational reforms.
                        That inspectors should inspect, is a truth which Webster's Dictionary--without going any further-will confirm. Thus it is but natural, logical and national that they should do so. We are glad to see that such in going to be the case and heartily approve of this first step in the direction of Egypt for the Egyptians." May it not be the lost, because the only way for the British to obtain the good will and esteem of the Egyptians, is by introducing the reforms we propose in our columns, and by returning to Egyptians their usurped right of looking atter, organizing and furthering their own interests.
                        But it Webster's Dictionary confirms oor and everybody's.-belief that inspectors are those who inspect, it likewise approves us when we assert that advisers are those who advise. We do not know-we do not even pretend to know what the new Agent's instructions to the advisers are. But we do know and have no besitation in repeating that the only task these gentlemen are supposed to perform is that of advising in the ministries to which they are attached.
                        Therefore, whilst awaiting the propitious moment when these posts will be entirely abolished boosos superfluous-it seems to us logical enough that the gentlemen who fill them should limit their pent up energies to the wise performance of their duties without overstepping the bounds our friend Webster has clearly defined.
                        In view of which and we repeat it-we! hope that the same restrictions will imme diately be placed upon the sphere of the Adv. isers' influence, as have been or are about to be-put on that of the provincial inspectors.

                        AN INDIAN'S APPRECIATION.
                        The following letter has been received by Sir Eldon Gort from a certain Narsindas Tiloomall, of Indian nationality -
                        "May it please your Excellency, I the under sigoed, beg to state as follows. It is a remarkable phenomenon that India was in a forlorn state some centuries ago. Its inhabitants were
                        I quite illiterate. They used to wear clothing at made of a very coarse quality of stuff resembl.
                        ing Hessian cloth. There was no dream of the milroads no trains, no post offices, people were travelling to and fro in carta driven by bullocks and journey of short distance was taking months to complete. No individual dared Deither to leave his country nor had any ideas of a voyage beyond the sens. The most import ant thing to mention it is that it was governed by such people who had no fixed rules of their own and every human being
                        both male and female was in a great terror, in h fact the whole country was in a great alarm.
                        Bat when the British Government occupied the country, and sunlight of their good deeds! was thrown upon India and the Indians Education was widely spread, schools and colleges were opened for the public, hospitals were opened for the use of indigent anbealthy persons, clothing of varieties were imported into the country. Railroads were constructed post offices opened, telegraph wires were con Dected and many other things were amended which are quite innumerable to mention. The journey which was to be completed in days! prior the paramount British reign can now be finished in hours. Every man both rich and poor has an absolute liberty and permanent prosperity, as English people are the founder : of civilisation and reforms, and the British Government has gratified and has been onde avouring to keep up the wishes of the loyal India and the Indians and every precautionary nessures have been taken to protect and safe guard the country from those who desire it to suffer. Looking to the question from a broad standpoint, India has been raised to a highest pitch since the British rule and it is quite! apparent that the foundation of British rolo in India is puceful, creating free liberty and merey,

He said he was the bi writer of the letter, and went on to explain that be was stoward on the 8.8. "Hurons," which had just come from Egypt, and had called there expecting to see her father. She replied that he had died a few days before. Ho expressed surprise, and then stated that the British Consul at Port Said had given bim two cases and deputed bin to bring them to London and despatch them to Sir Augustus Hemming. This, he said, he had done. He then turned to go, but on reaching the front door he stopped to explain that the charges on the box had been fully paid, and handed her what purported to be a receipt for £1 2s.6d. signed by the purser of the S. "Horona." Believing his story, she said she supposed she ought to repay him the money. "Yes, you ought," he said, "because I have paid all the charges," and she thereupon band ed him the money, and he signed the receipt on the back and left. Her husband afterwards made inquiries, and discovered that no such a ship as the "Hurona" had some frotu Port Said. I la

                        CAIRO STREETS.
                        A Cairo correspondent writes - The state of the Cairo streets has for so long a time been the cause of complaint, their filth and roughness have so frequently been commented opon without avail, that we had almost come to look upon the existing state of things as a inevitable disgrace which we were powerless to remedy, and to cease to marmur when we are forced to leave a pavement strewn with the stone and rubbish which is being carted to 'or from some new building, but bitherto we have had no reason to speak of either roada or pavements as being absolutely dangerous.
                        We cannot, however, say the same thing any longer, for the department which has previously only been guilty of an astonishing laxity, bas now gone to the extreme of allowing the exes vations for new buildings to eneroach upon the public pavement, and to leave it to chance that the passer-by may notice it before he is precipitated into an excavation at least a couple of feet deep
                        A few days ago there was a pavement in the Sharia Madebegh, of which last night a portion had been removed and the excavation above mentioned had taken its place. There was no light to mark the spot and absolutely no barrier of any kind erected to prevent the possibility of an accident
                        There is no excuse for such gross carelessness on the part of the authorities who are responsible to us for at least safety in the streets. In no other town would such a thing be allowed, and one can see no reason why it should be tolerated here. The constant block ing of the pavements with building material is perhaps unavoidable, though even in this case a little supervision of the contractors would do much to redace the evil, but to leave a gaping excavation in one of our most frequented streets is an anpardonable breach of duty.

                        MACHINES
                        (FROM A CORRESPONDENT.)
                        It would no doubt be interesting for the publie to know that stenm plongbing was in troduced in Mersina distriot as far back As twenty years ago. Abdeon Pasha, one of the goveryons general of Aden, was the first to bay and steam plough of the somewhat primitive type then in existence, about two decades ago, for a large farm of his in Soletkin. But the Oriental, far more the Turk, is apt, no matter bow progressive his spirit, to allow some what compliented machinery requiring carefal handling and vigilant maintenance, Bosnovamb to the rust of innate negligence and hereditary indolence. But there seems to be a general Awakening, and, at least this part of the bear Bast, is catching the emulative spirit, and girding up its loins. The steam ploughin question was taken up some time ago by successor to the estate of Abdeen Posbe certain Abdel Kader Blondi and put by him to a more or less pratical asa. This paved the way for the introduction of up to date steam ploughs, and the John Fowler atean plough works in Leeds, that have a leading position in this industry, took naturally the first footing, and through the perfection of their machines are likely to hold an undisputed ground. Whar Agricultural possibilities the vulgarizing of these machines will open up in this virgin country can hardly he ganged, especially in connection with the cotton culture. Six Fowler steam ploughs are already in practical use by wealthy landowners in Mersins district. Two 16 hp. steam-driven ploughs, worth about £4000 each, are oweed and worked | by Chaker Effendi Boutros and wealthy Syrian
                        landowner and tour 20 h. p. ploughs of £5000 worth each, have qnite as recently been | bought by Chaker Pasha, a very wealthy Ansairi landowner.
                        Despite the cost and difficulty of discharge And transport of such beavy lifts in a port like Mersins, the advantages of these perfected machines have become so patent to the in telligent class of wealthy landowners that fartber large orders have recently been made, And as many as 300 tons will shortly be on the way from England by Prince liners. Once landed these machines insy by their own motive force be made to roll them selves to ultimate destination inland. No roads are required and fields may be crossed provided they are more or less level. To avoid wear and tear to the motor, and reduce the difficulty of ponderous manipulation to its minimum, steel cables of rope wire are used, and while the motor is fixel in a sheltered place in the farm-bouse, the motive power in transmitted by means of the cables to the plough, that is set working at a distance in the fields. The Powler machines used actually in Mersine district can plough from eighty to 125 donums per day and they torn up the soil st'a depth varying between 25 and 30 centimeters. Six thousand donums (three don ums making about an acre) of cotton land are now under cultivation by the steamplough. The results obtained seem to have been startling. The same land ploughed by these maehines bas given a treble and quadro ple yield compared with an adjoining property of identie soil and position, worked by the ordinary plough. But the great value of these steamploughs does not reside merely in the fact of their turning up virgin soil for exploitation and allowingexhaust ed one to rest and acquire fresh fortilizing power, but also in the fret that by breaking it up to such a depth it allows whatever quantity of rain falls, to sink slowly and infiltmte into the lower strata, and thus keep the land fresh and humid, instead of the water running over it and losing itself in lowlands, converted into marshes, or into the sen, as has hitherto been the case with land ander ordinary primitive cultivation, which leaves the soil hardened and, to a certain extent, impervious to the beneficial aetion of rain. This quality for a country like Syria, where rain is so precious and som certain is inestimable. A more or less uniform yield may thus be insured Another great advantage of these steamploughs is their rapid work. The ploughing season, as is well known, is limited, and for a vast property where a very considerable supply of hands and cattle is required the importance of this point acquires further value. With the problem of labour that wholesale emigration bas lately raised in Syria labour-saving machinery in general in getting to be indispensable.
                        Thus Mersinais destined to enter into the ranks of cotton producing countries, and to be the pioneer among Turkish provinces in the adoption of scientific methods of agriculture. of particular significance is this impending revolution in the history of Agriculture in Turkey, because, with the state of insecurity that there reigns, the growing of cereals and edibles in general is being gradually neglected especially in places far from Government centres, and the growing of cotton becomes a most recommendable, and, indeed, the only agricultural resource of a more or less safe exploitation. When one thinks of the vast and fertile landa in Syria that actually lie in waste and could, so to speak, be got for a song, And of their posible transformation into cotton fields under the magie-influence of the perfected stein-driven plough, without the fear of robbery or damage (or at least these dangers greatly minimized) it would be surprising if foreign capital should any more hesitate to come into this land. In the vast plains of Hama and Homs there are magaificent pro perties, irrigable and otherwise combining both the advenge of proximity to the railway

                        (From A CORRESPONDENT.)
                        On strolling through the town of LAMA one cannot but be strook with the enormous improvements that bave been made in its appearamos and the look of prosperity it now enjoys. On every band one notices new and beautiful buildings taking the place of its older and smaller houses and its waste spaces Among these are the new offices for the Imperial Ottoman Bank, which will, when finished, add greatly to the beauty of the Konak Square, a site in itself to gain the envy of many a larger town. One asks oneself why this energy and life in this sleepy and said to be dying old town 1 On yuzing out upon the wide expanse of its glorious buy the answer is easy to see, for lying off the port are no less than eight steamers busy loading and unloading, ench constantly calling in varions musical tones for the lighters to burry and wante no valenble time. Around the steamers are at least one hundred siling craft of various sizes and shapes, each adding its quota to the trade of the port
                        On the beach, in the streets, are huge stacks of corn waiting to be shipped, the overflow of the crowded stores, in the square are rows of cattle and flocks of sheep going to help feed the people of Egypt, while near by are hondreds of baskets of fruit, destined to find the RAINO market. Amongst all the bustle one notices carts and truoks loaded with hundreds of soka gypsum and with which all three piers may be seen laden. Passing along the marina one is compelled to notice the fact that LAMAR is very far from being a dying town.
                        Strolling through the town itself one notices many factorier, each busy adding to the prosperity of Larson. That of Mr Amiet! situated in the heart of the town is interesting with its combined gypsum, flour and cotton ginning mills. Passing on and over the main road one notices the tall chimney of Mr. Soundia's factory where gypsum and the burning of terra umbra is the order of the day, following the line of mails one at length comes to the new factory of the C.B.D. cement company, whose square buildings and straight even roofs are in themselves an object lesson. Here is hurry and bustle amongst its 60 to 80 men and women, vying with each other in trying to satisfy the needs of its greedy kilns, which night and day give out their cooked stone all pure white ready to be ground into plaster, such as one sees only in Barope. On enquiry one learns that the factory is only yet in its infancy, its powerful engine, probably the most powerful in the island was destined to do great er work than the 50 tons per day it now can grind. Now and larger kins are to be added until the output of this factory resebe the maximam for which it was designed, namely, 20 tons of finished plaster per hour. On leaving by the Famagusta Rond obe notious new houses and stores in every direction with near by huge mountains of the terra ambra all rendy and waiting to be shipped, to supply the world's demand for painte. Troly LATDAN may well be proud of her progress and enterprise, and may the day be far distant when she loses her place as the busiest centre of trade in the whole island of Cypry and may ber demands for a railway to the capital be soon realised.

                    <p>Volume 2 of the "Catalogue of Hebrew Manuscripts in the Boldleian Library has just been issued under the joint editorship of the late Dr. Adolf Neubauer, and Mr. Arthur Ernest Cowley, MA, but in reality the major portion of the work is due to the latter scholar, for as long ago as in 1894 the health of Dr. Neubauer gave way and necessitated Mr. Cowley continuing the work.
                        This volume enumerates the additions of Hebrew Manuscripts acquired since 1886, that is to say it gives a list of all manuscripts con taining any Hebrew text, because very many of the Codices mentioned are really Arabia manuscripts with Hebrew interpolations and colophons. This second instalment of the Bodleian Hebrew catalogue may most appositely be entitled The Egyptian Manuscript volume for it contains the short descriptive notes referring to the numerous fragmentary texts from the Geniza manuscript monument room or the Jewish Synagogue at Old Cairo which commenced to pour into the Oxford collection in the year 1890. Thus out of the 316 volumes described in the new volume of the entalogue no less than 166 containing about 2,673 frag: ments are believed to be from the Geniza
                        Mr. Cowley says that the contents of the Cairo Geniza were first brought to notice by the Reverend Greville. J. Chester: but we believe that some year of 80 previous Count d'Hulst sent' care containing specimens of the manuscripts from it to the British Museum when the authorities neglected to even examine its contents, and that by the time that Mr. Chester came across some of the manuscripts the majority of the great store had been des troyed and all more or less mutilated.
                        For readers of the "Egyptian Gazetto" the most interesting manoscripts catalogued will be those from the Geniza and it will therefore be to them we shall mainly refer. Being preserved in a Hebrew Synagogue the maJority of the texts are necessarily portions of the "Old Testament". Many of them being Arabio translations with Hebrew notes, or short passages. Closely connected with this class of text are the Midrash commentaries and Talmudio treatises, Liturgies and such like. The bulk of the pieces from the Geniza, like the older Greco-Roman Bgyptian papyri, are legal documents or personal communien: tions. In the case of the former the Bodleian Catalogue gives the names of the parties, and those of the withesses, and officials and magistrates mentioned when legible. For the letters, a brief sommary of the contents is given Much interesting society and family history may be obtained from those fragments, but they require comparing with the larger series of Gepiza documents now preserved at Cambridge where are probably other parts of the same persons, correspondence. Nearly all the older legal memoranda with are mostly of the 11th and 12th centuries, are dated from Pos tat. A few are earlier, such as the marriage 1 contract in volume 2805 which relates to al certain Aaron bar Jeshuah. It is dated 5th of the month Elul A.M. 4750-990. AD The same date is assigned to another record wherein the son of a Jew ai Nisibis, in Asia Minor, is concerned. This bondle of old Fostat texts contains four other marriage contracts.
                        One of these dated 1030 A.D. is interesting because of the numerous biblical names it bears as Japheth, Soloman, Berakha, Shemariah, Abraham, Samuel, Phinehas, Ephraim and Joseph As a specimen the most important texts bound up in volume 2859 may be enumeratel. There is an astrological fragment. A deed of gift dated A.D. 110. A contract of the same age and part of another deed. These in Syrian coursive characters. Then come Some homilies, and fragments of a commentary on Jeremiah in Arabie with Hebrew notes. A
                        huilar work on Hakaloth and another on Nambers 21, and part of Deuteronomy. Then por tions of a Hebrew commentary upon Hosen Other pieces of Studies on the Old Testamento follow. Then come poetical fragments and extracts from Alfasi's treatise an the Babylonian Talmud.
                        As with Greek and Latin paypri the writings on the recto and verso of a manuscript often differ materially. For instance on the back of and page giving Leviticus 2. 6.17. as a naptial contract of Mubarakat daughter of Soloman Kahna, drawn up at Postat in 1368 of the Seljuk era viz A.D. 1067. Many of these writingi are in Spanish Rebbinical characters and also many legal doouments refer to cities in North Africa and some to Toledo and Spanish towns. One manuscript preserves the end of a Hebrew work upon the plantes. The remains of medical books recoyered from the Geviza treasure are perhaps of some value. For instance there is unfortunately incomplete, Hassin-b-Isbag's introduction to Galen's Techne and fragments of a medical dictionary in Hebrew, Arabie and Spanish. Some of the Antsie papyri Ind Ostraca from Elephantine albo published by Sayoe and Cowley in their volume upon the Mond papyri are given again in the catalogne because deposited in the Bodleian Library.

                        La température dans la première moitié d'Octobre n'a pas été favorable aux cotonniers, les nuits ayant été souvent trop fratches.
                        Cette circonstance a naturellement, et un peu partout, retardé l'éclosion des noix de la seconde oueillette ; même, dans certains dis. tricts, quelques dégâts ont été constatés de ce chef.
                        En somme, la seconde cueillette, qui n'est pas encore terminée, ne répond plus aux pers pectives qu'elle laisait entrevoir.
                        la troisième oueillette se présente irré. gulière, suivant les localités ; ses résultats definitifs dépendront d'une continuation de temps propice en Novensbre.
                        Lo rendement à l'égrenage se maintient de 1a % au dessus de celui de l'ante passe
                        De la Haute-Egypte, il y a eu aussi des plaintes à cause de la température ; mais, malgré tout, la récolte là-bas nous promet une forte augmentation sur l'aunée préordente.
                        En résumé, et prenant l'ensemble des renseignements, la récolte semblerait devoir etre a pet pres égale and celle de l'année dernière ; aussi notre première estimation est-elle de Cantats 6,750,000 à 7,000,000.

                        <p>L'aspect de notre corbeille n'a pas sensible ment différo de celui d'hier, sinon en ce qu'il a présenté plus d'animation, il faudrait dire plus d'empressement de la part des vendeurs. Malgré tout, les affaires sont restées clair semées et limitées aux Comptoir, Estates, Delta Land et en proportions plus restreintés aux Agricole, National Bank, United et Rita. Pour quelques-unes de ces valeurs il est diffieile de dire si le tapage a donné lieu à des transactions. Dans ces conditions on comprend que la cote sit subi une nouvelle molus-value. Cependant on a constaté en cours de séance un peu d'amélioration sur les prix d'on verture, Notre marché, qui n'a pas l'habitude de pécher par exoès de pessimisme, espère qu'après les fêtes du Balram nous aurons de meilleures nouvelles do dehors et qu'une reprise se prodaira. Enoha Allah
                            En attendant, les cours fléchissent: l'Agricole recule de 7 7/8 a 7 3/4, la National Bank de 20 3,8 à 20 5/16, la Ramleh de 4 3/8 4 1/4, les Privilégiées Tramways de 136 à 135, les actions de capital Eaux du Caire de 110 à 108, la Dairs de 12 1/2 à 12 8 8, la Privilégiée Bière da Caire de 87 à 85, l'Obligation nouvelle Orédit Foncier de 253 a 252, la Banyue d'Athanes de 106 á 106, les Nangovich Hotels de 16 11/16 à 16 5/8, les Splendid Hotels.de 4 1/4 4 /16, l'Urbaine de 8 3/16 à 3 1/8, et la Banque d'Orient de 114 1/2 à 114.
                            La Nile Land perd encore 1/2 livre à 8.
                            Parmi les titres de moindre importance, la Salt and Soda rétrograde de 16/- á 15/9, la Cassa di Sconto de 46 à 44, l'Anglo American Nile de 2 3,8 à 2 1/4, l'Ordinary Khedivial Mail de 22/6 à 22/, le Comptoir de 2 1/2 à 2 7/16 l'action et de 1 11/16 . 1 1/2 la part de fondateur, la Building Lands de 1 3/4 à 1 11/16, l'Aboukir de 27/- and 26/6, la fondateur United de 7,8 à 3/4, les Rita de 3/8 and 11/32. Seule la fondateur Levico reprend de 2 1/2 à 2 3/4.
                            On voit que la situation ne n'est pas amé liorée jusqu'ici. Cependant, pourvu que la réaction n'atteigne pas des niveaux trop bas, il faut espérer qu'on n'aura pas and redouter l'intervention des banques.
                            Ia été vendu ce matin aux enchères publiquas 216 obligations Crédit Foncier Egyptien, dont 113 anciennes à un prix moyen de 191 fr. 50 et 103 nouvelles à une moyenne de 251 fr. 25. C'est à l'annonce de ventes forcées de ce genre qu'on attribue en partie la dépression de notre marché : les détenteurs de titres de la même société que ceux mis en vente cherchent, en effet, and liquider leur stock en prévision de la baisse que ces ventes peuvent occasionner.
                            Le bruit courait ce matin que des courtiers vendaient des titres d'une société pour compte de cette société même. Les acteurs du bruit ont en avec les agents visés une vive alterention.

                            Au Stook Exchange, le Consolidé anglais a baissé hier de 1/88 81 719 et l'Unifiée de 1/4 100. La National Bank a rétrograde de 1/2 20 5/8 et la Daira de 1 4 à 12 1/2. L'Agricole s'est maintenue à 8 1/8 et la Delta Light a 10 1/4

                            Idi, la légère amélioration d'hier n'a pu se maintenir et la séance de ce matin, influencée par les mauvaises nouvelles d'Occident, a été nulle comme transactions, bien qu'à vue de nez l'animation parat considérable tellement les vendeurs mettaient de ceur à leur be. sogne.
                            Les prix bien entendu n'ont pas été favorables et la clôture a enregistré une baisse assez sensible sur toutes les valeurs traitées à une on deux exceptions pres, les plus maltraitées ayant été les valeurs dirigeantes.
                            La situation actuelle apparait comme très explieable à ceux qhi se rendent compte de l'emol canisé au capital par les événements d'Amérique apris ceux d'Allemagne et d'An gleterre, sans oublier l'Italie.
                            Pour le moment l'argent se'cache, mais tout a une fin et sous peu le capital oubliant ses terreurs réclamers en Europe et ailleurs des placements rémunérateurs. L'Egypte en profi ters largement d'autant plus que l'élévation da taux de l'escompte, à part un effet moral, ne peut avoir chez nous de grandes conséquen cas, nos taux officiels étant de beaucoup supé rieurs et en tous temps à ceux demandes Lontres au moment les plus aigos des période d'argent cher.

                        La fin de la crise américaine.
                        "Les brokers et banquiers de Londres sont généralement d'avis que la crise américaine est passée et ils ponsidèrent que les liquidations qui s'opèrent à l'heure actuelle constituent un facteur favorable. D'après eux il va sans dire que rien ne pourra faire mieux renaitre la confiance que l'estime pour les aptitudes et le caractère des personnalités qui dirigent les grandes entreprises industrielles.
                        "Avee M.J.P. Morgan à la tête de Wall Street, il est très probable que l'on verra bientôt les choses sous un autre angle qu'aujourd'hui. En un mot, malgré la hausse récente des tanx d'intérêts à 100 %, malgré les faillites signe lées, les perspectives paraissent un peu plus encourageantes.
                        "Evidemment, les reprises seront presque al coup sur suivies de liquidations, mais tout bien consid-ré, les plus grosses difficultés paraissent maintenant écartées.
                        "Et après une période de transition dont la durée ne saurait être fixée " priori" on assis. tera à une reprise de mouvement ascensionnel des Etats-Unis. Certes ce ne sont pas les énergies et les initiatives qui manquent de l'autre côté de l'Atlantique, ce sont surtout les capitaux. Aussi ne faudra-t-il pas s'étonner que le situation monétaire mette quelque temps à s'améliorer."
                        L'Information de Paris s'exprime ainsi an sujet du nouvel emprunt égyptien :
                        Plusieurs journaux ont annoncé la nouvelle de l'émission prochaine d'on emprunt égyptien. On dit que cette information est inexacte. LA situation de l'Egypte est très florissante et ancune émission ne serait projetée."
