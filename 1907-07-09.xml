                    <p>I hereby certify that I have taken samples of every vatting of <hi
                            rend="bold">Mackie's White Horse Celler</hi> Blend of Scotch Whisky used
                        in bottling during the month of September, and the results of my analyses
                        indicate that it conforms to the standard for Pot Still Scotch Whisky set up
                        in the London case. I am also of opinion that it is an old Whisky of
                        excellent quality and flavour, which has been well matured in wood.</p>

                    <head>THE EGYPTIAN BOOM</head>
                    <p>An interesting article, of which the fallowing are extracts, appears in the
                        July number of Blackwoods magazine under the title of "The Egyptian Boom,"
                        by Sir R. Hamilton Lang, K.C.M.G : -</p>
                    <p>In this article I do not propose to enlarge upon the successful
                        administration of Lord Cromer in Egypt. It is well known, and is it not
                        written better than I could do in the bril- liant pages of Lord Milner's
                        'England in Egypt,' and in the more stu'gy but tborougly reliable volume of
                        Sir Auckland Colvin?</p>
                    <p>I am not the less an admirer of the strong, far-sighted, patiently persistent
                        administra- tor who, so recently was obliged, from motives of health, to
                        hand over to an experienced successor his heavy burden. Lord Cromer may rest
                        from his labours assured that his great work in Egypt will follow him—work
                        for which his country will ever be grateful.</p>
                    <p>I left Egypt in 1897, after ten years of con- tinuous and active service
                        there, and revisited it in the early months of this year with the desire to
                        see with my own eyes, what I could only vaguely understand in London, the
                        remarkable boom of prosperity which has come over that country during the
                        past few years. What I saw, and the impressions left upon me, may perhaps
                        interest the many in England who have only such a dim notion as I had of
                        what had been going on in Egypt.</p>

                    <p>The charming residential town of Cairo of ten years ago I found disfigured by
                        huge blocks of buildings five storeys high; enormous hotels built and
                        building; where was then park is now studded with villas; tramways
                        everywhere, even out to Cheops' Pyramid; motors careering along, followed by
                        clouds of dust and heralded by the deafening sounds of horn or hoot. All the
                        constructions are higgledy-piggledy without line or order. Huge ungainly
                        blocks alongside of unpretentious residences; buildings being torn down or
                        foundations being laid. The conversations over- heard were mostly of the
                        price of plots of land, or the rise or fall of shares, or of companies
                        floated or being floated, or of people who had become millionaires or
                        expected to become such. One realised at once that one was amongst a
                        community intoxicated with success, in the feverish escitement of
                        speculation. The luxurious hotel, opened only some seven years before, was,
                        while I was staying in it, sold to a company for £450,000. Its proprietor
                        (the seller), reputed to be a millionaire, is laying the foundations of a
                        still grander hotel, on a site which was once a prince's palace. Two
                        wellauthenticated transactions will give a fair conception of the enormous
                        rise in the value of property in the best parts of Cairo. A small villa,
                        erected some twelve years ago at a cost of about £3000, found a purchaser
                        recently at £32,000. A property purchased far £17,000 eight years ago was
                        being treated for while I was in Cairo at £150,000. In fact, it is no
                        exaggeration to say that property, in what was the residential part of
                        Cairo, has increased in value, during the past five or six years, eightfold
                        to tenfold. The price of land there may be said to vary from £46 to £82 per
                        square metre (3 1/10 yards), equal to the value of land in the crowded parts
                        of the city of London. In Alexandria a nearly similar appreciation in the
                        value of town lands has taken place. Lands towards Gabari, which a few years
                        ago were only of a nominal and prospective value, have recently changed
                        hands at fabulous rates. The site of the Victoria College, bought about ten
                        years ago for £1300, was sold at the beginning of this year for
                        £100,000.</p>
                    <p>The origin or cause of this boom in the value of urban lands is traceable to
                        the high price of cotton during recent years, and especially since 1903.
                        When I left Egypt in April 1897 the price of cotton was 9 1/4 talleris per
                        cantar ; in March 1907 it was worth 21 1/2 talleris. The average monthly
                        value of cotton in the year 1896-7 was 9 1/2 talleris ; while the same
                        average monthly value from 1st Sep- tember 1906 to April 1907 was 19 1/4
                        talleris.</p>
                    <p>The crop of cotton in 1896-7 was 5,875,597 cantars, and its value £11,163,634
                        ; that of 1906-7 is 7,000,000 cantars, of the value of £26,950,000.</p>
                    <p>Good cotton land in the Delta was worth, in 1897, about £40 per feddan
                        (acre). Its worth to-day is £200. The acreage put yearly under cotton is
                        roughly 1,200,000 feddans, the value of which has risen in the decade
                        fivefold.</p>
                    <p>The comparisons which we have made above, refer to a period often years and
                        eight months, but in reality the greatest increase in the value of cotton in
                        Egypt has token place since 1902-3, say a period of four years.</p>
                    <p>Simultaneously with the boom of prosperity came a boom of speculation, which
                        had its origin in the sale of the Daira Sanieh lands in 1898. Money was
                        required by the Government to pay on a reliquat of expen- ses for the Sudan
                        campaign, and three or four millions sterling were needed for the Assouan
                        and Assiout Dams. The Caisse de la Dette refused to advance money for either
                        purpose. In this situation a native Jewish banker, Mr. Raphael Snares,
                        proposed to purchase the Daira Sanieh lands—about 400,000 acres,— engaging
                        to pay off in 1905 the debt upon them, to make a cash advance of £500,000,
                        and to share the profits in the enterprise with the Egyptian Government.</p>
                    <p>The undertaking being, however, too large for Mr. Snares alone, he addressed
                        himself to his co-religionaire Sir Ernest Cassel. There was not much cause
                        for hesitation on the part of that shrewd financier, as the administration
                        of the Daira Sanieh, after paying expenses, taxes, and 5 per cent interest
                        on its debt, had been yielding to the Egyptian Treasury a surplus of over
                        £200,000 a year, which might safely be considered to represent a capital sum
                        of three or four millions sterling. Sir Ernest Cassel became associated with
                        Mr. Suares, and the bargain was concluded with the Egyptian Government. Sir
                        Ernest Cassel also interested himself in finding the money needed for the
                        dams.</p>

                            suppression of this traffic. The French Consul, accompanied by the local
                            police made a visit to a house of ill- repute in the Esbekieh quarter
                            last Saturday and seized a young girl; her abductor was also placed
                            under arrest. The girl will be sent home and the man will be expelled
                            from the country. It is to be regretted that he cannot receive the
                            punishment which he so richly deserves by a salutary course of exercise

                        <p>The States Railways Administration has invited the Government to consider
                            the question of relieving from military service those of their employees
                            who are higher grade artisans and whose training necessitates a lengthy
                            apprenticeship. The Administration emphasises the danger of having men
                            entrusted with responsible positions who are insuffi- ciently trained
                            and the consequent risk to the public safety. It seems very evident that
                            it is hardly fair to a large administration to have its best hands taken
                            for military service just at the moment when their services are be-

                    <p>From the point of view of the shareholders of the North Egypt Land Company
                        Limited a melancholy interest attaches to the sale of some of that Company's
                        effects, which took place yesterday at Hammam in the Mariout district. The
                        objects disposed of comprised horses, donkeys, mules, carts, wood, cement,
                        etc., and the sale was conducted by a Maowen from Kafr Dawar by order of the
                        authorities, as the Company owes about £280 to the Government. Very low
                        prices ruled. An excellent donkey fell to one bidder for P.T. 520 and two
                        good horses were knocked down for P.T. 620 each, while two mules fetched £16
                        apiece.</p>
                    <p>The North Egypt Land Company was regis- tered in May 1905. The directors were
                        the Earl of Galloway, Sir Bradford Leslie, A. Durant, E. E. Pullman, Khalil
                        Pasha Khayat and Lusena Bey. The capitalist £230,000 in a similar number of
                        £1 shares. The object of the company was to acquire and develop a freehold
                        estate in the Mariout district. This estate comprised about 14,500 feddans
                        at Hammam. We extract the following from the prospectus : —"Taking a broad
                        view of the whole matter, we feel that we can recommend the property, and

                        formed to acquire and work the estate should prove a success.</p>

                        by Sir Douglas Fox and Partners in their report, for the extension of the

                    <head>THE GARIBALDI CENTENARY.</head>
                    <head>CELEBRATIONS IN CAIRO.</head>
                    <p>On Sunday the Italian Colony of Cairo fittingly celebrated the centenary of
                        the birth of Garibaldi, their national hero. At seven o'clock punctually, a
                        large concourse of Italians bearing national flags, a deputa- tion of the
                        Greek oommunity, and a dele- gation of the French Chamber, assembled in
                        Ataba el Khadra Square to form the body of a procession, which was preceded
                        by an international band. Among the as- sembly gathered to do honour to the
                        mem- ory of Garibaldi we noticed many mem- bers of the Italian Philodramatic
                        Society, the Societa dei Reduci delle Patrie Battaglie, composed of veterans
                        of the War of Inde- pendence, the Societa Opersia Italians Cir- colo
                        Operaio, Societa di Beneficenza, Gruppo Novelli, Seuola da Vinci, Unione
                        Militare, the Italian Masonic Lodges and several other societies, wbioh
                        space precludes us from enu- merating.</p>
                    <p>The cortege, comprising several hundreds of people, paraded the principal
                        streets of Cairo, and eventually stopped before the French Consulate, where
                        the band struck up the "Marseillaise." In Kasr el Nil Square a congested
                        throng of vehicles awaited the party, in order to drive them to the Civil
                        Cemetery, where a magnificent demonstration took place. Here, Mr. Pasqnale
                        Isabella, the well known Italian lawyer, delivered an eulogistic address,
                        which was met by a storm of applause. Later a memorial plate was unveiled
                        and a deputy of the French Ma- sonic Lodge made a patriotic speech before
                        presenting a crown of laurels. Dr. Yatron, on behalf of the Greek community,
                        also con- tributed a wreath of laurels together with a few well chosen words
                        of esteem for the memory of Garibaldi and the Italian nation. The party
                        dispersed at about 11 o'clock, but reformed in the afternoon, and then
                        proceeded to the Italian Schools, where ano- ther memorial plate was
                        erected. After Mr. Taragni, of the Italian Philodramatic Society, had mode
                        an excellent speech and many stirring songs had been delivered by the
                        students, the scene of animated patriotism was transferred to Sheik Salama
                        Theatre, where an amateur theatrical company gave an appropriate
                        performance.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Philip Snowden, M.P., speaking at a miner's demonstration at Crumlin,
                        Monmouth- shire yesterday, criticized the proposed grant to Lord Cromer for
                        his services in Egypt, and pointed out that when Mr. Asquith was asked for
                        money for old-age pensions he wanted to know where the money was to oome
                        from. Lord Cromer had for the past twenty-five years been taking from the
                        taxpayers of the country £6,000 a year. Working men were told to be thrifty,
                        but the men who were receiving £6,000 a year had no need to make provision
                        for old age.</p>

                    <head>ALEXANDRIA MOTOR BUSSES.</head>
                    <p>The Alexandria Tramway Company has been obliged to temporarily suspend its
                        motor bus service from Mohamed Aly Square to Ras-el Tin. The reason of this
                        step is solely due to the necessity of having to repair the 'rubber tyres of
                        the busses, which have been prematurely worn out owing to the state of the
                        route along the quay. As soon as it was discovered that the wear and tear
                        suffered by the rubber was proceeding at an abnormally rapid rate the
                        company immediately sent to Europe for a fresh stock of tyres. At the
                        present time the manufacturers of automobile tyres in Europe have a huge
                        amount of orders to cope with and some delay has therefore ensued. The
                        service will be resumed on the Ras-el Tin line as soon as the tyres
                        arrive.</p>

                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE."</p>
                        <p>Sir,—The above title to my letter will strike some readers as somewhat
                            peculiar, but the idea is by no means far fetched, and it is believed
                            that behind the soenee a steady movement is going in the South for the
                            overrunning of Egypt from that quarter at the least sign of trouble
                            here, and not with Egyptian troops. From a well informed source it has
                            been ascertained that steady recruiting is going on in the Sudan with,
                            it was gathered, the eventual attainment of a strong majority of
                            Sudanese troops over Egyptian, both in Egypt and the Sudan, and further
                            it was averred that Sudanese troops would by degrees be substituted in
                            Egypt for the "Gippy", whose destination would be "down south" and, in
                            parenthesis, out of mischief. A still more interesting item in a most
                            interest- ing programme is the creation of a Camel Corps of British
                            soldiers, and I was assured that this was being carried out with
                            considerable despatch.</p>
                        <p>It is evident that Great Britain's extremely ambiguous position here will
                            sooner or later demand a solution and final decision : the position is
                            logically untenable and calls for a practical settlement to which end
                            there are two courses open. The abandonment to its own dices of this
                            country would be most sure- ly eventually proved more than indefensible,
                            in fact reprehensible, and the results of such abandonment would reflect
                            very little credit on Great Britain, to put it mildly, and things would
                            be indeed shameful if after the British left Egypt to look after and
                            govern herself, one of the Powers was obliged to step in and restore
                            order: because England had washed her hands of the country after having
                            risked valuable lives and enormous capital.</p>
                        <p>The other course is too manifest to need remark, but a perusal of these
                            few lines should show the careful observer that England is not such a
                            fool as so many people think, and that despite party politics and
                            agitators, a true and forcible illustration of the survival of the
                            fittest will eventually result, and it is more than possible that the
                            change will be effected in such a manner that most people will be
                            distinctly and agreeably surprised to wake one fine morning and find
                            themselves British subjects in the most pleasant manner, without even
                            applying lor a Consular certi- ficate.</p>

                    <p>"A thousand and our Grammar Questions" has been announced as being in
                        preparation some years ago, but illness compelled the author to lay it aside
                        when only a few pages had been written, and since then his health has seldom
                        permitted him to attempt any work outside his daily routine as a
                        school-master and editor of "The Oriental Scholar Magazine." This glossary
                        of grammar questions and answers has been written to supply a want often
                        felt by candidates preparing for examina- tions in English Grammar in
                        general. It is not intended to supersede the careful study of any of the
                        excellent manuals now in use, but to serve the purposes of a handy book of
                        reference. Almost every examination paper in this subject contains at least
                        four questions, and experience has proved that the answers to such questions
                        are often most unsatisfactory. Even when students have carefully read the
                        text-book, they frequently show serious ina- bility to apply their knowledge
                        to the questions set, many essential poruta being overlooked.</p>
                    <p>We have also received the first form gram- mar and analysis by the same
                        author.</p>
                    <p>This work is divided into two parts. The first for the first primary year
                        pupils, the second for the second primary year pupils.</p>
                    <p>The examples and the exercises have been chosen with great care, and will be
                        found to contain instances of all the commoner constructions. The Arabic of
                        some definitions and the difficult words found in every lesson is also
                        given. The method of analysis adopted in this book has been tried with boys
                        between the ages of nine and twelve years, and the results have been
                        satisfactory.</p>

                    <p>Le Caire, Lundi 8 juillet.</p>
                    <p>Le taux de l'escompte libre à Londres s'est maintenu a 3 3/8 pour cent. Au
                        Stock Exchange, le Consolidé anglais a haussé samedi passé de 1/8 a 84 1/2
                        et l l'Unifiée de 1/2 à 101. La Na- tional Bank a avancé de 1/8 à 20.
                        L'Agricole, qui avait perdu 1/8 vendredi a 7 7/8, l'a rat- trapé le
                        lendemain a 8. La Daira Sanieh est demeurée inchangée à 13 1/2. La Delta
                        Light a bénéficié de 1/8 à 9 1/4.</p>
                    <p>A Paris, le Crédit Foncier Egyptien a perdu 2 francs vendredi, mais en a
                        regagné 8 samedi, soit en reprise de 6 francs à 686. La Banque d'Athènes est
                        renseignée en avance de 3 francs à 118.</p>
                    <p>Malgré la meilleure tenue des places diri- geantes d'Europe et malgré le fait
                        indéniable que l'horizon local tend de plus en plus a s'é- claircir, notre
                        marché n'a guère brillé, ce matin, par l'entrain. Il est vrai que la morte
                        saison commence a battre son plein et qu'il serait. passablement extravagant
                        de s'attendre, en ce moment, à un gros courant d'affaires. Au sur- plus, il
                        est de coutume de se montrer réservé an début de la semaine, d'attendre le
                        vent qui soufflera de Londres et de Paris, depuis que les effets de la crise
                        nous ont placés sous la dépen- dance directe des marchés d'Occident.</p>
                    <p>Mais, pour avoir été inactive, la séance n'a. ese nullement mauvaise. La
                        tendance generale a ete meme ferme et on a remarque que les offres étaient
                        loin de présenter le volume de ces jours derniers. C'est d'un bon présage,
                        et il y a lieu de s'attendre à un. raffermissement a bref délai, d'autant
                        plus que les evenements s'attachent a donner des démentis constants aux
                        prédictions das pessimistes a outrance.</p>
                    <p>Dans le comparitment des Banques, la Na- tional a avance a 19 11/16-8/4.

                    <p>cet establissement de credit est un fait accom- pli depuis vendredi soir a
                        Alexandrie et depuis ce matin au Caire.</p>

                        fléchi à 5 1/4. L'Allotment est retombé à 1 7/8-15/16.</p>

                    <p>Dans le groupe des valeurs hôtelières, les Egyptian ont été bien tenus à 4
                        3/8. Les autres titres du compartiment sont restés à leurs prix
                        précédents.</p>
                    <p>Parmi les petites valeurs, les New Egyptian se sont alourdis à 14 sh.6 et les
                        Abdy à 0 7/16. Les Markets ont avancé a 24 sh.3.</p>
                    <p>Nous détachons d'une correspondance dé Londres, en date du 2 Juillet lé
                        passage suivant :</p>
                    <p>"La situation monétaire n'est pas cequ'elle devrait être à la fin d'un
                        semestre. En d'au- tres termes, l'argent devrait être plus abon- dant ayec
                        l'immense rentrée des dividendes de Juillet Toutefois, à Lombard Street, les
                        taux d'escompte ont sérieusement baissé. Le "Stan- dard" fait remarquer à ce
                        propos, qu'il reste à voir si les banquiers qui spéculent sur un abais-
                        sement du loyer de l'argent ne vont pas trop loin dans leurs prévisions,
                        mais que, pour l'instant, la plupart des facteurs sont défavo- rablés a ceux
                        qui s'efforcent dé maintenir les taux d'escompte à leur niveau actuel.</p>
                    <p>"Au Stock Exchange, des velléités de re- prise ont pu être constatées cette
                        semaine. C'est M. Asquith qui a donné le signal de ce mouvement en déclarent
                        que, cette année, le gouvernement ne demanderait au marché mo- nétaire tout
                        au plus qu'un million de livres sterling sur des bons à courte échéancé. A
                        cette annonce rassurante se sont joints des avis favorables du çontinent et
                        des Etats-Unis. On raconte, en outre, qu'un vaste syndicat de la Cité s'est
                        formé pour soutenir le marche et qu'il a groupé dans ce but une trentaine de
                        millions sterling.</p>
                    <p>"Quoi qu'il en soit de cette intervention, il est certain que les achats de
                        placement ont reparu en bon nombre et se sont spécialement étendus à des
                        valeurs fort malmenées tout ré- cemment encore, entre autres aux bons titres
                        égyptiens, qui sont réellement à des cours tentants.</p>
                    <p>"La liquidation s'est effectuée sans aucun embarras, avec des reports fort
                        peu différents des précédents."</p>
                    <p>On sait que l'assemblée générale ordinaire de la Société Anonyme du Béhéra,
                        tenue le 19 Mars dernier, avait approuvé la distribu- tion, à tître de
                        dividende extraordinaire, des 50,000 actions privilégiées 5 % de £5 restées
                        a la souche, soldé des 100,000 créées en vertu de la délibération de
                        l'assemblée générale ex- traordinaire du 14 Mars 1905.</p>
                    <p>Or, on annonce d'Alexandrie que ces actions privilégiées jouissance du 1er
                        Juillet 1907, seront délivrées aux actionnaires de la Béhéra, une pour une,
                        à partir du 15 du mois conrant.</p>

                        dernier ont été de L.E. 4,234 contre 4,006 en 1906, soit en aug- mentation
                        de L.E. 228. Les recettes totales depuis le 1er Avril 1907 se chiffrent par

                        <p>Useful work is quietly proceeding in putting the navy and coast defences
                            of the Pacific into as good condition as appropriations permit. A
                            drydock is being constructed at Puget Sound. It is expected that a
                            special effort will be made to dredge the channel of the Mare Island
                            navy yard and make it accessible for heavy battle- ships. It is rumoured
                            that Mr. Root during his forthcoming visit to Mexico will negotiate for
                            the purchase of a site for a naval station at Magdalena Bay (Lower

                    <head>"RAPID AND REMARKABLE PROGRESS"</head>
                    <p>The tenth annual general meeting of the Egyptian Hotels, Ltd., was held on
                        the 1st July 1907 at the offices of the company, 11, Ironmonger-lane, E.C.,
                        Lord Claud Hamilton, Chairman of the company, presiding.</p>
                    <p>The notice convening the meeting and also the report of the auditors having
                        been read by the Assistant Secretary,</p>
                    <p>The Chairman said: Gentlemen, — It is sel- dom that a Board of Directors is
                        in the happy position of presenting to shareholders accounts which show,
                        within about ten years of the in- corporation of a company, a more rapid and
                        remarkable progress than that indicated in the report and accounts of the
                        Egyptian Ho- tels, Ltd., now in your hands. We started with a debenture debt
                        of £280,000, of which £230,000 was offered to the public, but was left very
                        largely on the underwriters' hands, and with our ordinary shares »t a very
                        nomin- al value. In the brief period which has elapsed since then, we have
                        been able to redeem, partly by the operation of the sinking fund, but
                        chiefly through the realisation of surplus lands on our Ghezireh estate, no
                        less than £141,400 of our debentures, leaving the total outstanding
                        debenture debt at the pre- sent time at £138,600. This extraordinary
                        development is due to a combination of caus -es, of which I will indicate
                        two or three. Firstly, the prosperity that has attended our company could
                        not have been realised but for the able administration of affairs in Egypt
                        by Lord Cromer, and the stability secured under the protection afforded by
                        the British Govern- ment The productions of the country have shown great
                        expansion, and this has reacted on the prosperity of the people and the
                        revenues of the Government and has been accompanied by the investment of
                        large sums of European capital in Egypt The effect of this has been a great
                        increase in the value of land in Cairo and elsewhere in Egypt, and in this
                        increase we have had the good fortune to share. When we took over the
                        Ghezireh domain there was in- cluded in it a large area of surplus land in
                        the neighbourhood of Ghezireh Palace. The sale of a part of this surplus
                        land has realised a net sum altogether of over £250,000, of which we have
                        still to receive a sum of £120,000. We have yet in our possession at
                        Ghezireh an area of 78,000 square metres of land, including that on which
                        the Ghezireh Palace Hotel stands, situated on and near the Nile, in what has
                        become a very fashionable suburb of Cairo, which will on the opening of the
                        new bridge across the Nile, opposite our property, be within a few minutes'
                        tram ride of the centre of Cairo. Those who are acquainted with the value of
                        land in Cairo will realise what is the total value of 78,000 square metres
                        of land in such a position. I am informed by the directors resident in Cairo
                        that the land has quadrupled in value in the last four years. This estimate
                        is in addition to the value of Ghezireh Palace Hotel bails lings and their
                        equipment, and the value of the Shepheard's Hotel property. Secondly, the
                        undoubtedaalubrity of the climate of Egypt the Oriental scenery and customs,
                        and the interest attaching to the monuments of Egypt, have combined to
                        attract vast num- bers of visitors annually from all nations. This has, of
                        course, greatly increased the demand for hotel accomodation.</p>
                    <p>"THE WORLD WIDE REPUTATION OF THE HOTELS."</p>
                    <p>Thirdly, the world-wide reputation of our hotels, which, thanks to the able
                        manage- ment of Mr. Baehler with his staff of assist- ants, was never
                        greater than it is to-day, coupled with the comfort they afford and the
                        careful attention given to the cuisine and to sanitation, has largely
                        increased our revenues, so that the profits of the hotels, after charging
                        all costs of working and main- tenance, now reach a sum of £47,995 10s 8d,
                        against £22,304 certified by the audi- tors in the debenture prospectus
                        issued in 1897. But, gentlemen, it is only right that I should remind you
                        that the Board would not have been in a position to have fully availed
                        themselves of the advance in the prosperity of Egypt, to which I have allud-
                        ed, had it not been for the invaluable advice and assistance they have
                        always re- ceived from Mr. Peat, at one time the sec- retary, and now one of
                        the directors of the company. In the earlier days of the company's history,
                        ami especially during the negotiations for terminating the working ar-
                        rangements with the Compagnie Internation- ale dee Grands Hotels, the
                        financial abil- ity and unfailing courage of Mr. Peat alone made it possible
                        for the Board to overcome the difficulties with which they were then
                        confronted, and to achieve the position on which they are to-day able to
                        congratulate the shareholders. As pointed out in the di- rectors' report,
                        our property, after the re- ceipt of the £120,000 referred to above, and the
                        payment off of the outstanding deben- tures. will consist of Ghezireh Palace
                        Hotel with its furniture and equipment, 78,000 metres of land at Ghezireh,
                        including that on which the hotel stands, Shepheard's Ho- tel and its
                        equipment, with a lease having 65 years to run at a rent of £1,850 per
                        annum. These assets are available to meet liabilities and capital, together
                        estimated at a total figure of £280,000, as shown in the directors'report.
                        As regards the acoounts, there is little to add to what may be seen from the
                        accounts themselves. The addition to land, buildings and plant include the
                        purchase of the German dairy, the milking of new roads at Ghezireh, the
                        addition of a third storey at Shepheard's Hotel and the necessary equip-
                        ment, and the enlargement of the dining room and grill room at Shepheard's
                        Hotel. I may remark that the additional storey at Shepheard's Hotel has
                        increased our accommodation by 100 beds, making it now 510 beds.</p>
                    <p>INCREASED PROFITS.</p>
                    <p>The profits of the hotels alluded to above, and amounting to £47,995 10s 8d,
                        compare with a figure of £45,168 10s 7d in the previous year, representing
                        an increase of £2,827 Os 1d. Our net profits are £30,234 19s 2d, as against
                        £27,098 Os 1 11d in the previous year, an increase of £3,141 18s 3d. On the
                        complete amortisa- tion of the debentures and the compensation paid to the
                        Comapgnie Internationale des Grands Hotels there will be a relief to the
                        profit and loss account of more than £15,000 per annum. I now beg to more :
                        "That the report and accounts for the year ended 30th April, 1907, as
                        submitted to the shareholders, be received and adopted."</p>
                    <p>Mr. E. A. Harrison seconded the motion, which was carried unanimously.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman next moved : "That divi- dends of 5 per cent, on the preference
                        shares and 20 per cent on the ordinary shares of the company for the year
                        ended 30th April, 1907, be and the same are hereby declared payable on and
                        after Tuesday, the 2nd July, 1907."</p>
                    <p>Mr. JJ. Hug seconded the motion, which was carried.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman next moved the re-election of Messrs W. B. Peat and Em. C.
                        Zervudachi, the retiring directors, which was seconded by Mr. Baehler and
                        carried.</p>
                    <p>Mr. W.B. Peat: I now beg to move: "That the shareholders desire to record
                        their high appreciation of Mr. Charles Baehler's able management of the
                        hotels and of the assistance rendered him by his staff." I ought to say just
                        a word or two iu proposing that. I have had the advantage this year of being
                        in Egypt and seeing our directors there, particularly making myself
                        acquainted with the hotel and also seeing the new storey which has been
                        added to it. My previous experience of going to Egypt was a year or two
                        before, on which occasion I accompanied his Lordship. Upon my recent visit I
                        found vast improvements in the hotel, not only in the structure, but also in
                        the furniture, the cooking, the materials supplied, and, in fact, in
                        everything which makes life, to a visitor, oomfortable and con- venient. All
                        that has been done under the able direction of Mr. Baehler, who is the life
                        and soul of the place. I therefore have very great pleasure in moving the
                        resolution which I have read.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Harrison : As a resident director in Egypt it affords me very great
                        pleasure to testify to the complete accuracy of every word that Mr. Peat has
                        said. I have lived in the hotel myself now for the last thirteen years, and
                        therefore am more or less competent to express an opinion founded on
                        experience, and I therefore cordially second the motion which Mr. Peat has
                        submitted to you.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman : In putting that resolution I would like to say that, although
                        I have not had the advantage of being in Egypt dnring the last few years, I
                        have heard on all sides of the great ability shown by Mr. Baehler incon-
                        ducting these hotels, and of his universal courtesy, which has earned for
                        him popularity with every visitor who enters the hotel. I think aw are
                        exceedingly fortunate in having a gentleman of such position to manage our
                        affairs in Egypt. (Hear, hear).</p>
                    <p>The vote was unanimously accorded, and, on the motion of Mr. A. Wright,
                        seconded by Mr Baehler, Messrs Turquand Youngs and Co. were reappointed
                        auditors.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Harrison proposed a vote of thanks to the Chairman for the great
                        assistance he had rendered in the interests of the company since its
                        formation, and also for presiding, and this having been seconded by Mr Hug
                        and carried, the proceedings terminated.</p>

                    <head>THE OXFORD PAGEANT.</head>
                    <byline>(FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT).</byline>
                    <p>London, July 1.</p>
                    <p>The pageant which is at present being per- formed on the banks of the
                        Cherwell at Oxford may fairly be said to be the most perfect representation
                        of its kind that has as yet been given in England ; and now that pageants
                        have become so fashionable and attracted such keen attention and
                        competition, this is no small boast for Oxford to be able to make. The old
                        University City lends itself peculiarly well to this form of enterprise ;
                        tor it has a romance about it possessed by no other town, save perhaps its
                        sister on the Cam, a romance blended of reverend age and perennial youth to
                        which all who know it fall enchanted vic- tims ; it can boast too an
                        historical past of more than usual interest, for within and around its walls
                        epoch-making events in politics, science, and art have taken place ; and
                        further it possesses a scenic beauty and adaptibility surpassed by none.
                        Consequently it is not to be wondered and that all competent critics
                        proclaim the Oxford pageant to be the pageant per excellence of modern
                        times.</p>
                    <p>The spot chosen is the corner where the Cherwell divides just short of
                        Magdalen Bridge, and there a stand spanning the tongue of land has been
                        erected, capable of holding some 3000 people, from which one looks forth on
                        to an entrancing scene of river, meadows and the old City walls and gateway
                        beyond.</p>
                    <p>The representations or scenes given amount to 16 and take in all some three
                        hours to per- form. They run chronologically, commencing with the legend of
                        Saint Frideswide, circa A.D. 727, around which the origin of the City hangs,
                        and ending with a glimpse of St. Giles' fair in the reign of George III,
                        circa 1785. It would of course be impossible to attempt any descrip- tion of
                        the individual scenes in the space of a short article; enumerated they are
                        as follows:—</p>
                    <p>The legend of Saint Frideswide, circa A.D. 727. The coronation of Harold
                        Harefoot, A.D. 1036. The beginnings of the University. circa A.D. 1110 King
                        Henry II gives a charter to the City Of Oxford, circa A.D. 1160. Friar
                        Bacon, circa A.D. 1270. St Scholastica's day, A.D. 1354. Masque of the
                        Medieval Curricu- lum. Wolsey receives Henry 8th at Oxford, A.D. 1518.
                        Funeral of Amy Bobsart, A.D. 1560. State progress of Queen Elizabeth, A.D.
                        1566. Visit of James 1, A.D. 1605. Charles 1st at Oxford. The happy days
                        A.D. 1636. Charles 1st at Oxford. The early days of the Civil War, A.D.
                        1643. Charles 1st at Oxford. The surrender of Oxford, A.D. 1646. Expulsion
                        of the fellows of Magdalen by James 1st, A.D. 1687. Scene in the 18th
                        century.</p>
                    <p>Some of the scenes deserve particular praise but all were good ; nothing had
                        been spared in trouble or expense to secure historical ac- curacy or scenic
                        effect. Perhaps the most unique and attractive scene was the masque of
                        mediaeval learning, for which the author de- serves all praise, for in
                        conception as well as execution it was as pleasing and beautiful a piece of
                        symbolism as it has ever been my good fortune to witness. The theme in short
                        is this—a student in search of Good Learning is received by the Seven
                        Liberal Arts and the Three Philosophies. He makes his choice be- tween
                        Theology, Law and Medicine, and with some reluctance chooses Theology ; but
                        his companion is lured aside by the Pleasure and Joy of Life, and fells a
                        victim to the Tempta- tions which assail youth. The music and dancing or
                        pleasure's minions was as exquisite as their costumes, and I confess that I
                        felt more than a sneaking sympathy with the student who threw in his lot
                        with them.</p>
                    <p>But I might wander on at length describing the gorgeous effects of the
                        varying scenes, some pompous, such as the kingly episodes, others humourous,
                        such as the Town and Gown riot on St Scholastica's day, while others again,
                        such as Amy Robsart's funeral, touched a deeper chord. Suffice it to say
                        that each seemed to go by only to he surpassed by that which followed ; and
                        when at the grand finale the entire body of performers, numbering I should
                        think some 2000 souls and ranging from the merest babes to aged and reverend
                        sires massed in a brilliant human parterre and joined in one swelling chores
                        of "O God, our help in ages past" one felt that there was something more
                        than mere passing pageantry, some insight into the inner meaning of Oxford's
                        glorious past.</p>
