                    <head>A GARTER FOR LORD CROMER</head>
                    <p> What is to be Lord Cromer’s reward ? On every side the desire is expressed,
                        says the Liberal organ, "The Tribune," that the services of the great
                        Pro-consul shall be recognized by the conferment of some signal honour to
                        mark the nation's gratitude upon the completion of the memorable epoch in
                        the history of the Empire.</p>
                    <p> What form the reward shall take is already, the subjet of keep discussion,
                        but such a wealth of honours has been heaped upon Lord Cromer during his
                        diplomatic career that the <cb n="6"/> choice of elevation has become
                        somewhat circumscribed He is a member of tho Privy Council. He has received
                        the Grand Cross Of the Oders of the Bath and the St. Michael and St. George.
                        He is a Knight Commander of the Star of Indian, a Companion of the Order of
                        the Indian Empire, and one of the fifteen British members of the Order of
                        Merit. Finally, during his administration he has been successively created
                        baron (1892), viscount (1898). and earl (1901).</p>
                    <p>Among the many suggestions which are being thrown out, the moat general
                        appear to be that Lord Cromer shall be given a further step in the peerage
                        or receive a money grant. As far as can be ascertained there is no precedent
                        whatever for the grant of a sum ol money to a retiring diplomat. It has
                        often been done in the case of a military commander fresh from a successful
                        campaign, and the cases of Lord Kitchener and Lord Roberts are still fresh
                        in the public mind.</p>
                    <p>But the great civilian is not similarly favoured, and the case of Lord
                        Dufferin is decisive as to the practice on such occasions. Lord Dufferin had
                        rendered unexampled services to this country during his occupancy of the
                        offices of Viceroy of India, Governor-General of Canada, and Ambassador at
                        St Petersburg, Constantinople, Rome, and Paris, but though notoriously a
                        poor man, he received no financial recognition beyond the customary pension
                        on his retirement from the Diplomatic Service in 1896 Not only slid he not
                        receive a giant on leaving the Paris Embassy, but he was not specially
                        honoured in any way.</p>
                    <p>Precedent also is against Lord Cromer in the circumstances receiving a
                        marquisate. The Earl of Hopetoun was certainly created Marquess of
                        Linlithgow on resigning tha Governor-Generalship of Australia in 1902, but
                        this was merely an enhanced dignity for an old peerage. The same applies to
                        the marquisate conferred upon Lord Ripor upon the settlement of the Alabama
                        claims in 1871, and in a less degree to the title bestowed upon Lord
                        Dufferiu in 1888 at the close of his Viceroyalty. In neither case was the
                        marquisate conferred at the close of a career, and neither recipient began
                        public life as a commoner, as Lord Cromer did. It is further pointed out
                        that even a Prime Minister of this country sitting in the Commons has no
                        claim upon a higher title than that of EarL Walpole, the elder Pitt, and
                        Disraeli received earldoms, and it is an open secret that Mr. Gladstone
                        refused one.</p>
                    <p>There is, however, an honour far transcending that of a step in the peerage
                        which may fittingly and with sufficient precedent be conferred upon Lord
                        Cromer In well-informed quarters the belief is entertained that be will be
                        offered the Garter. By tradition the Garter is the gift of the King, and its
                        conferment upon Lord Cromer would have an international significance, seeing
                        that it is the order associated with sovereignty. The precedent is a very
                        striking one— that of Lord Stratford de Redcliffe, “the Great Elchi,” who
                        received the Garter in 1869 in recognition of his services as Ambassador at
                        Constantinople. Stratford Canning’s Garter was especially noteworthy because
                        it was one of the extremely rare instances of that favour being bestowed
                        upon a peer below the rank of an Earl.</p>
                    <p>At the present moment the Order of the Garter has its full complement of
                        twenty-four knights, the most recent vacancy having been filled by Earl
                        Carrington, Lord Stratford had to wait for a vacancy before receiving the
                        Garter, but there is a precedent for temporarily raising the number of
                        knights in exceptional circumstances. When Disraeli and Lord Salisbury
                        returned from Berlin in 1878, after negotiating the famous treaty, both
                        statesmen were given the Garter, although there was only one vacancy.</p>
                    <p>If Lord Cromer becomes a Knight of the Garter on his return from Egypt a
                        deserved honour will have been conferred without creating the possibility of
                        a dangerous precedent.</p>

                            in the Canal till the afternoon when a large number of steamers came out
                            of the Canal. The same thing was done in the Suez roads, and several
                            steamers were waiting to enter. Towards the evening a procession of no
                            less than 15 steamers entered the Canal.</p>

                            hydrant. This brings the total number of fires up to 70 this year.</p>

                        <p>Donkey Polo in Sennar</p>
                        <p>There is a delightful touch of humour contained in that portion of Lord
                            Cromer's Report which deals with the Sudan. In summarising Major
                            Wilson’s report on the province of Sennar, Lord Cromer remarks that the
                            “following observation is characteristic of British administration.
                            Major Wilson writes : ‘Advantage was taken of the pressence of numerous
                            head sheikhs at the cotton show to initiate them into the game of polo
                            on donkeys. Matches were played between teams of sheikhs, who took to
                            the game in an extraordinary manner. ” The “Spectator" in commenting on
                            this passage remarks : “It seems to us that Major Wilson by his bold
                            experiment with the Sennar sheikhs may have unconsciously produced
                            world-wide results. Polo on donkeys would be an admirable new sport for
                            elderly men of action for whom real polo has become too dangerous. We
                            also recommend donkey polo to enterprising hostesses in country houses
                            anxious to find amusement for their guests. Most mining villages, as
                            well as most seaside resorts, ought easily to be able to produce eight
                            donkeys to make a beginning, while country houses in Kent and Essex
                            would have the whole of the coster donkeys of the East End to draw upon.
                            We wonder whether the donkeys soon get keen on the game like ponies, and
                            learn to follow the ball. Also, do their ears get in the way ?”</p>

                    <head>TROUBLES IN CAIRO.</head>
                    <p>SERIOUS DISTURBANCES.</p>
                    <p>MILITARY DEMONSTRATION</p>
                    <p>A serious state of affairs prevails in Cairo and there is a very uneasy
                        feeling prevalent that troubles of a grave nature may break out. So
                        seriously indeed is the situation regarded by the officials that Mr Machell,
                        Adviser to the Ministry of the Interior, who had left on a journey to
                        Mariout, has had to be recalled to Cairo. The strike of the cabmen, as we
                        announced on Friday, is over and on Saturday the cabs were plying as usual.
                        But as soon as this strike had been settled the carters began to rise up and
                        a grave series of outrages took place on Saturday, which has alarmed the
                        inhabitants of the Capital, for the movement is not considered to be solely
                        provoked by economical reasons. At 11 am. a large mob, consisting of many
                        hundreds of natives, assembled suddenly at the khalig near Darb el Gamamy
                        and at once began to savagely attack the trams. The mob broke the windows,
                        maltreated the employes of the Tramway company and the passengers: all
                        traffic was stopped and the street blocked. At the same time another huge
                        mob gathered together in the Gouvernoat square Mansfield Pasha harangued
                        them in Arabic and the mounted police cleared the square. Twenty employes of
                        the Cairo Tramway Company have been injured and forty-three tram cars have
                        been damaged. It is considered that these outrages have been inspired by
                        some well-known persons who want to encourage disorder for their own
                        purposes.</p>
                    <p>The serious outrages in the trams have no perceptible connection with either
                        the strike ol the cabmen or the carters. There were other outbursts of the
                        mob and at Abou el Ala bridge a crowd assembled. The manifests, who had a
                        threatening attitude, were prevented from doing any harm and the police made
                        some arrests. All traffic on the tram lines at Boulac, Old Cairo, and the
                        Khalig was suspended at 6 p.m. and on the other lines at between 9 and 10
                        p.m. Egyptian troops were stationed at the poliee posts.</p>
                    <p>POPULAR ALARM.</p>
                    <p>The Cairo newspapers express the alarm felt generally at these disorders.
                        “Les Pyramides" remarks “what is particularly disquieting in this one is
                        that the outcry is not made against the employers, as is usually the case in
                        strike troubles, but against the Government and its agents. Some people are
                        asking themselves whether these demands, whose object is to alarm public
                        opinion and which, moreover, are not due to trade interests, do not conceal
                        political issues are fomented by some people whose interest it is to disturb
                        the water in order to fish the better.”</p>
                    <p>The “Journal du Caire” in its issue of Saturday also expresses the popular
                        alarm at these sudden and simultaneous outbreaks ot disorder after the
                        cessation of the cab Strike. It remarks : ‘We had good reason to declare in
                        ourlast issue that there were evilly disposed persons who wished to fish in
                        troubled water. This cannot any longer admit of the slightest doubt in view
                        of the fresh outbreak of disorder this morning. The cabs are plying again
                        and yet the trams are attacked ! Why is this ? What can he the motive for
                        it! Who are the people who are directing it. We hold that we have the right
                        to put these questions and it is the duty of the police to answer. This
                        stupid but suggestive agitation has continued too long. These recent events
                        clearly show that at the present time there is a large number of people in
                        Cairo without any occupation, whose pleasure it is to utilise their leisure
                        in the refined amusement of maltreating the passengers and the staff of the
                        tramways. In such a case the poliee in every country in the world sweeps
                        them away and clears the town of this disagreeable class. When are we to
                        have a clearance at Cairo ?’</p>
                    <p>It is to be noted as a coincidence of some significance that both these
                        newspapers, from which we have quoted, and which appear at the same
                        time,make use of the same expression “pecher en eau trouble.”</p>
                    <p>LATEST NEWS.</p>
                    <p>Our Cairo correspondent telephoning to-day at 1 p.m. states that there has
                        been no renewal of the disorders to-day. Last night the whole force of the
                        Cairo City Police were on duty and in readiness for any emergency. The
                        Ministry of the Interior had taken special measures to ensure the safety of
                        the Cairo Gouvernorat from attack and it was guarded by soldiers. Throughout
                        yesterday there was a vague presentiment of coming troubles and a renewal of
                        the disturbances but no incidents of a serious character are reported.</p>
                    <p>The carters of Cairo, who are among the roughest elements of the populace,
                        remain quiet.</p>
                    <p>The troops of the Anny of Occupation were called out last night and paraded
                        round the Boulac quarter, where the troubles appeared to be the gravest.</p>
                    <p>The demonstration has had, it is hoped, a good effect. If, however, the
                        disorders continue the most severe measures will be token to ensure
                        quiet.</p>
                    <p>Extraordinarily disquieting rumours were afloat at Alexandria this morning as
                        to the state of affairs in the Capital and it was confidently announced that
                        the troops of the Army of Occupation had had to be called out. The news
                        exerted a very bad effect in the Bourse and considerable nervousness was the
                        result.</p>

                    <head>LORD CROMERS RESIGNATION</head>
                    <p>MEETING AT ALEXANDRIA.</p>
                    <p>The special committee of the Alexandria Municipal Commission couvened a
                        general meeting at the Municipal Palace at 11 o’clock yesterday morning in
                        order to discuss the question of a memorial to Lord Cromer. The attendance
                        was very representative, with the noticeable exception that outside the
                        representatives of the Press there was not a single Moslem present. The
                        discussion was long and desultory and the meeting did not break up until
                        1.30 p m. Some confusion has been caused owing to the fact that after the
                        special committee of the Municipality had sent a letter to Lord Cromer and
                        had received a reply from his lordship in favour of a tuberculous
                        institution, a letter was received from the President of the Council of
                        Ministers asking Alexandria to join with Cairo. The Cairo committee had
                        nominated some Alexandria to serve on a general committee but had neglected
                        to ask the Alexandria Municipality to select some of its members for this
                        purpose. Mr. Salvago strongly protested in the name of the Municipality at
                        this treatment. The Municipality was the most important representative
                        institution in Egypt and was representative of Alexandria, and it was a
                        grave want of taste not to ask it officially to select some of its members
                        to serve on the committee and to ignore the fact that the Municipality had
                        taken the initiative in the matter.</p>
                    <p>It was decided that Schiess Pasha, Mr. Salvago and Pados Bey should go to
                        Cairo in order to discuss the question with the committee there and put
                        forward Alexandria’s views. It was also agreed that Alexandria should take
                        part in the manifestation at the Khedivial Oprea House and that the city
                        should be represented on that occasion by delegates of the Municipality and
                        the corporations. There was a strong feeling that the memorial should be in
                        Alexandria, but at the same time the meeting was in favour of working in
                        accord with Cairo and the rest of Egypt. It was decided that a tubercolous
                        institution was the most useful form which a memorial should take and that
                        if such an instution should come into being, it was to be international and
                        undenominational and that arrangements as to the food supply should be such
                        as not in any way to impinge on Jewish or Moslem scruples in the same way as
                        the Rudolph Home. </p>

                    <head>CAIRO COMMITTER</head>
                    <p>The committee provisionally formed to organise a public demonstration iu
                        honour of Lord Cromer has decided that the ceremony shall take place on May
                        4th at 6 o'clock in the Opera House. A sub committee will prepare and issue
                        invitations to as many as the theatre will hold. There will be two speeches
                        in the name of the committee and Lord Cromer will reply. The committee has
                        approved in principle the opening of a general subscription to be devoted to
                        such a purpose as shall be eventually determined ; it has, moreover,
                        recommended that the Municipality of Alexandria be invited with a view to
                        the dignity of the occasion to cooperate with the Cairo committee by
                        delegating such of their members as they may think best. Similar invitations
                        will be issued to the other towns of Egypt, in order to allow all who are
                        desirous of joining in the demonstration the opportunity to associate
                        themselves with the measure finally adopted by the committee.</p>

                    <p>The former of these contracts effects:-</p>
                    <p> (a) A modification of the contract, dated the 27th of Septemeber, 1906, and
                        made between the Ritz Hotels and Development Co Lts. of the one part and

                        part and the Nile Land and Agricultural Co. of the 3rd part, whereby Charles

                        the payment by the company to the development company of the sume of twenty
                        thousand pounds sterling.</p>
                    <p>By the latter of these contracts, which is part of the same arrangement, the
                        company agrees to indemnify the development company against all claims by
                        Mr. Ceaser Ritz under an agreement dated 20th November 1906, referred to in
                        a prospectues of the Company and also in respect of an agreement made by the
                        company with Barson Hand Pfyffer, dated the 6th December, 1906, under which
                        these gentlemen would have become entitled to share in the future
                        commission, and the benefits of such agreements are transferred to the
                        company, Mr. Ritz and Baron Hans Pfyffer releasing all claim to the £20,000
                        above referred to.</p>
                    <p>On the motion Mr. Mosseri, seconded by Matire Carton de Wiart, it was
                        resolved unanimously that tese contratcs be approved. Neither Baron Pfyffer,
                        Mr. Matesdorf nor Mr. Bacos voted.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Matesdorf then addressed the meeting on behalf of the chairman as
                        follows. :-</p>
                    <p>"As you are aware, the issue has been a great success , and the building of
                        the hotel has been commenced and is going ahead with all speed compatible
                        with good contraction Unfortunately contract prices for building material
                        and operations had gone up considerably. We shall call you to an
                        extrordinary meeting soon which will lutve several questions to
                        consider.</p>
                    <p>“It is desirable to transferthe management to Egypt instead of having it in
                        London, and the London board cannot under these circumstances continue the
                        responsibility of control. This will necessitate a number of changes in the
                        articles of association, which will to submitted for your approval. Then we
                        are going to considerably enlarge the sphere to operations and do other
                        hotel and property buisness at Cairo and Alexandria, and probably elsewhere.
                        Again, we propose to abolish entirely the founders’ shares and we will
                        submit to you an arrangement which we consider equitable. All these
                        proposals will require an increase of capital. We trust, subject to other
                        arrangements, to obtain a sufficient guarantee of capital by the placing of
                        shares at a suitable price. I hope that these projects will contribute to
                        the success of our enterprise.’’</p>
                    <p>Mr. Matesdorf on behalf of the chairman then thanked the shareholders for
                        their attendance at the meeting. The proceedings were then terminated with a
                        hearty vote of thanks to the chairman.</p>

                    <p>The Company has been formed to acquire and take over as a going concern and
                        to develop and extend the well-known business of Stockbrokers, Bankers and
                        Estate Agents, carried on at Cairo by the firm of H. de Vries and Boutigny
                        and for the other purposes mentioned in its Memorandum of Association.</p>
                    <p>The Business was established in the year 1905 by the present partners, Messrs
                        Henri Heiman de Vries and Boutigny, and has been remarkably successful. Its
                        great development has so increased the magnitude of the undertaking, that
                        Messrs. deVries and Boutigny consider that the time has arrived for
                        converting the business into a public Company.</p>
                    <p>Messrs, de Vries and Boutigny have agreed to act as Managing Directors of the
                        Company for a period of five years.</p>
                    <p>In addition the Company will acquire the lease of the offices in Kasr-el Nil
                        Street, held for a term expiring on the 10th of March, 1908, and of the
                        offices in Soliman Pacha Street, the term of which expires on the 28th
                        February, 1909, as well Ks the furniture and effects therein. </p>
                    <p>The books of the business have recently been investigated by Messrs. Russell,
                        Kerr and Wyatt, Chartered Accountants, who have given the following
                        certificate:</p>

                    <p>H. de VRIES BOUTIGNY, LIMITED.</p>
                    <p>We have investigated the books and accounts of Messrs. H. de Vries &amp;
                        Boutigny, Cairo for the period from 1st of May, 1905, to 22nd March, 1907,
                        and we certify that the Profits of the business for that period, before
                        charging interest on Capital or Partners’ Salaries amount to £329,404
                        sterling. </p>
                    <p>Of these Profits, £195,780 sterling is derived from land transactions, and
                        £133,624 sterling from share transactions and other sources.</p>
                    <p>The Profits derived from land transactions include an amount of £88,577
                        sterling, payable at dates subsequent to the close of the financial period
                        under review, and therefore unrealized at this date. </p>

                    <p> The chief of the Liberal-Radicals, Herr Mullet Sagan, member of the

                        Conference. This article may be looked upon as indicating that entire public
                        opinion in Germany, even in the Radical middle class circles, does not
                        desire a discussion of the question of disarmament at the Hague Conference.

                    <p>The twelfth annual exhibition of the Alexandria Horticultural Society was
                        held at San Stetano on Saturday.’ and Sunday. The Khedive, who had arrived
                        from Cairo on Friday evening to attend the performance at the Zizinia
                        Theatre for the Orwa el Woska Society opened show. His Highness arrived at
                        San Stefano at the four o’clock accompanied by the Grand Master of
                        Ceremonies and Lewa Watson Pasha and was received by Prince Hussein Pasha
                        Kamel and the committee of the Society, after which he went round the
                        exhibition, showing great interest in the many exhibits.</p>
                    <p>In consequence of the easino being rebuilt the usual rooms were not available
                        and therefore the whole of the large terrace by the sea was tented in and
                        the groups arranged in the form of a garden. The effect was certainly
                        striking and the large groups of annuals competing for the handsome objet
                        d’art offered by Baron Felix Menasce gave brightness to the scene. There was
                        good competition in this class and the winner was Ahmed Yehia Pasha whose
                        plants were well arranged and showed on the whole better cultivation than
                        the others. The second important feature of the show was the mass of
                        magnificent gladioli which were competing for the large silver vase offered
                        by Prince Hussein Kamel. As every competitor had to produce fifty stems and
                        these were arranged on rows of tables, the effect was very striking. Prince
                        Omar Toussoun who gained the prize certainly staged the finest exhibit of
                        gladiolus that has ever been seen in Egypt, but the competition was close
                        enough among the seven competitors to make the judges’ task a difficult one.
                        Prince Omar Toussoun staged a very large collection of palms on the new
                        balcony of the terrace and close by were three large azaleas, which came
                        from the greenhouses of Mr. Salvago. Mr. Tramontina arranged a large group
                        in front of the entrance which made quite a fine collection of cyclamen,
                        which must be rather rare so late in the year. It was interesting to see
                        that the exhibitors who won the £30 objet d’art last year for fancy
                        pelargoniums were able to produce quite as good specimens again this year,
                        showing that good attention must have been paid to their plants and that
                        they had been able to keep them through the hot summer.</p>
                    <p>The table decorations were arranged in the hotel diningroom, which was just
                        large enongh for the seven exhibits and for the vases arranged by amateurs.
                        Miss Hewat took the first prize with her table very effectively decorated
                        with single white roses arched from a high vase in the centre to the four
                        corners of the table-centre, and small vases of the same flower were
                        prettily arranged on the table, while each finger-bowl contained one
                        blossom. The second prize was accorded to Miss G. Atkin, whose table, which
                        was close to the door, was decorated with white flag iris and petuniasin
                        vases and iris spread over the table. The third table, decorated by Miss
                        Allen, was carried out in spirea. Miss Allen arranged a very artistic vase
                        of hibiscus and Miss Hewat’s simple vase of swan river daisies was quite
                        charming. There were many tables of cut flowers, including roses,
                        pelargoniums, and annuals, but the light was bad and we should recommend the
                        committee to see next year if some arrangement could not be made by which
                        the tenting could be abandoned and the terrace closed in with glass.</p>
                    <p>The vegetables occupied a large tent by the sea. With the exception of the
                        fine exhibit of Bartau Bey, for which a special prize was given, there were
                        few amateur exhibits, the only collection worthy of mention being a good
                        general exhibit by Mr. F. Haselden which was “hors concours.” With regard to
                        the natives it is quite certain that there has been great improvement not
                        only as far as attendance is concerned but also in the quality of vegetable
                        exhibited.</p>
                    <p>The Municipality, who had a special test reserved for them last year, showed
                        their plants in a large corner of the terrace. There is or doubt that every
                        year the Municipality shows better plants and a better arrangement and
                        although this exhbit was not for competition yet the judges recommended that
                        a silver gilt medal should be offered to Mr. Monfront, chiei of the parks
                        together with the thanks of the committee to the Municipality.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Fish, the new Secretary of the society showed himself most indefatigable
                        throughout the exhibition and the preliminary work, and we can congratulate
                        the Society having secured the services of one so capable and wh shows such
                        great intrest in the work.</p>
