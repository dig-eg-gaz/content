                    <head>OPENING OF PARLIAMENT.</head>
                    <p>Yesterday was the opening day of what is generally believed will be the last
                        session of the present British Government, and the Dissolution, which cannot
                        under any circumstances be very much longer delayed, is a subject of anxious
                        interest. To contemplate as beneficial a General Election in the spring, it
                        is necessary to feel pretty sure that the war will yield no untoward
                        developments, no menacing surprise, at about that time. Without a feeling of
                        this kind, how should Mr. Balfour propose to give the country up to the
                        turmoil which is expected of the next General Election? Such an election is
                        not an affair of a day or a week. Between the dismissal of this Parliament
                        and the completion of its successor there would be time enough for things to
                        happen, whether by accident or design. The war bas opened the door to so
                        many possibilities, so many mischances, that the most gitted seer is unable
                        to say in February what may be the outlook in March, nor could there be any
                        surety that an election in April would not be interrupted by some
                        distracting cause of popular infuriation or alarm from abroad. Under our
                        Parliamentary system a General Election may come in the way of such events
                        unavoidably. To put an election in their way as a matter of choice is quite
                        another thing; and only to be justified, in cases of extreme hazard like the
                        present, by reasons of extraordinary weight.. Do any sach reasons exist 1
                        The Liberal leaders and others may honestly answer-Yes. But, in the first
                        place, they cannot take from Mr. <cb n="6"/> Balfour the responsibility of
                        deciding the matter, and in the next there seems to be a difference of view
                        between himself and them. Almost, though not quite, always they regard the
                        future through the fiscal-lens. Prime Minister. 'He fobs the fiscal leris,
                        and, beyond the 'customary and expected duties of Government, gives but
                        little attention to anything else at present than the course of the war, its
                        consequences and its portents. So we are taught, at any rate, by all that we
                        know of it, of him, and of the nature of things.</p>
                    <p>But there is much more than this to be said, of course. The risk of being
                        caught in the midst of a General Election by some threatening accident or
                        startling surprise. is a serious consideration, yet not so serious as some
                        others for a man in Mr. Balfour's position. And they are perfectly obvious
                        too. It is plain that he cannot contemplate a Genéral Election in April or
                        at any later time of the year with a confident assurance of success. He may
                        think the chances in his favor; may rely upon being able to increase them
                        greatly as soon as the conflict begins; but yet he must be conscious that he
                        would offer himself for defeat as well as for victory. Unless superseded by
                        very grave events (in which case volunteer dissolution would become
                        impossible), fiscal reform is the question upon which a General Election
                        this year would almost entirely turn. Naturally, all the forces of the
                        Opposition would be employed in making Free Trade c. Protection its chief
                        battle-ground; and we express no opinion of our own in recalling the fact
                        that the best-known judgment in such matters is clear that on this ground
                        the Government would be defeated. That is Mr. Chamberlain's opinion, and he
                        has given friends and foes alike to understand that his proceedings and
                        anticipations are based upon it. It is only quoted here, however, as further
                        justifying the assumption that the Prime Minister, if and when he
                        contemplates a dissolution of Parliament this year, must also contemplate
                        being beaten at the polls as rather more than a possibility.</p>
                    <p>The Government have, we must confess, used the Recess in a suicidal way. They
                        have brewed much trouble for themselves in Parlia ment. Whatever the outcome
                        of the Com mission of Inquiry may be, the Prime Minister's handling of the
                        affair, in words if not in action, has not aroused entire satisfaction,
                        amongst his supporters. During the Recess the. Artillery Rearmament scandal
                        has been dragged very fully to light. Not content with the damage thus done
                        to their reputation, Ministers-Mr. Balfour and Mr. Arnold-Forsterhave
                        proceeded to make it as irreparable as possible by attempted evasion and a
                        defence. founded on initial delusion. The gross mis. management of our Army
                        and the dangerously chaotic condition in which all the talk of reform has
                        left us has formed the subject. of a remarkable correspondence in a.
                        Unionist organ. And finally, not content with all that, the Government,
                        under the tactless guidance of Mr. Brodrick, in whom past experience might
                        have induced a certain messure of caution, has blundered into the pus
                        blication of their somewhat ungenerously-conducted dispute with Colonel
                        Younghusbandand the publication, even more than the Government's attitude,
                        has, we fear, put the fiuishing touch to the irritation provoked by all the
                        other blunders in the minds of far too many staunch Unionists, "</p>

                    <p>Another new tarbine steamer, the "Lanka” (Capt. Wilson), arrived at Port Said
                        this morning bound for Colombo. She was built by Messrs. Denny and Co., of
                        Glasgow, for the British India Steam Navigation Company. Her speed from
                        Glasgow, which she left on the 4th inst., has averaged 147 knots, but she is
                        capable of 19. She has accommodation for 48 first-class passengers, and will
                        probably run between Calentta and Rangoon.</p>

                    <head>SMUGGLING AT ALEXANDRIA.</head>
                    <p>The Coastguards at Alexandria have been very busy the last few days in
                        seizing contraband goods in the shape of firearms, hashish, ammunition,
                        powder, etc.</p>
                    <p>On Sunday morning, 143 kilos of hashishi was seized near the landing-stage
                        inside the enclosure of the Ports and Lighthouses Ad. ministration.</p>
                    <p>Yesterday, on searching the Italian S.S. "Nina," the Coastguards found two
                        large portmanteaux, containing 70 kilos of hashish, | and also the following
                        treasure trove : 101 breech-loading rifles of all kinds, including
                        Martini-Henry, Chassepot, and Gras, 11 revolvers, some of them exquisitely
                        mounted with ivory handles, 1,490 ball (rifle) cartridges, 1,474 ball
                        (revolver) cartridges, 250,000 per cussion caps for Arab sporting guns, 19
                        tins of sporting powder, and 4,900 choice Havana cigars.</p>
                    <p>The night previous to this haul the smugglers had kept the Coastguards baay
                        in the harbour and there were some exciting chases.</p>
                    <p>It is surmised that the rifles and ammunition were intended for the Tripoli
                        coast, where the vessel would land them on her return voyage. The arms are
                        too unwieldly. to be landed at Alexandria without detection. This is the
                        largest haul of valuable contraband that has been made at Alexandria this
                        year.</p>

                    <p>UN RAID AU MARIOUT</p>
                    <p>Trois bédouins, dont l'un était gaffir et les deux autres locataires de
                        Moussa Maatouk, vendirent il y a quelque temps à Bolonachi les terrains de
                        leur propriétaire. Un hodget en règle fut rédigé par le Gouvernement
                        Egyptien. Le contrat de vente, signé par le gaffir et les deux locataires,
                        et fabriqué comme tant d'autres dans des circonstances analogues fut régu
                        lièrement transcrit. On sait qu'ici, comme en tous pays latins, la
                        transcription se borne à un simple paiement des droits, sans être soumise
                        aux investigations qui sont de rigueur dans les pays où le système Torrens a
                        été adopté. Les transactions immobilières obtiennent done en Egypte, par le
                        seul fait de leur transcription, la publicité requise, sans jamais acquérir,
                        pourtant, force probante.</p>
                    <p>L'acte de vente enfin signé et dûment transcrit, il restait à M. Bolanachi de
                        prendre possession des terrains. Il organisa un raid sur la propriété de
                        Moussa Maatouk à l'aide d'une bande de bédouins. Une vingtaine de tentes
                        furent plantées çà et là. Le légitime proprié taire, ne disposant pas de
                        forces suffisantes pour faire respecter ses droits, eut recours à la police
                        qui mit en fuite les agresseurs.</p>
                    <p>Alors commença la procédure. M. Bolanachi et ses vendeurs assignèrent M.
                        Maatouk par devant le tribunal de justice sommaire et demandèrent à être
                        réintégrés dans leur possessions interrompue de 1,725 teddans. Ils of
                        frirent de prouver comme d'ordinaire qu'ils possédaient paisiblement et de
                        temps immé morial les terrains en litige. Cette preuve leur fut d'autant
                        plus facile qu'ils avaient pour témoins des compères de la même tribu et
                        vivant des mêmes expédients.</p>
                    <p>Bien que M. Maatouk ait fait la preuve contraire, M. Bolonachi obtint gain de
                        cause. Maatouk vient naturellement de faire appel de ce premier jugement. Il
                        prétend que l'action en réintégrande, intentée par Bolonachi, manque
                        absolument de base, son intrusion sur les terrains litigieux, qui a duré
                        seulement quelques jours, ne pouvant être assimilée à la détention paisible
                        et publique, requise en pareil cas.</p>

                        Pauline Patry, surtout dans la scène du troisième acto ot sa mimique
                        désopilante a secoué toute la salle d'un éclat de rire général. Très réussi
                        également M. Cooper dans le rôle de Lepailleur où il se trouvait d'ailleurs
                        dans son élément. M, Laurent manque parfois d'aisance et de haturel dans ses
                        rôles. Son interprétation de Radiguais s'en est un peu ressentie. M. Duboco
                        a été comme d'habitude d'une indifférence qui lui sied à merveille en
                        d'autres occasions, mais qui dans le rôle d'Anatole Guillemard ne lui allait
                        pas du tout. Bien que Mme Lelières arrive rarement à passionner son public,
                        elle se tire assez bien des rôles qui ne demandent pas d'animation, comme
                        c'était le cas dans Mme Radiguais. Mile Georgette Loyer promet comme
                        débutante. Elle l'a bien montré dans le Petit Lord et hier soir dans Mme
                        Lepailleur. M. Diamand a été un président fort convenable; comme acteur,
                        entendons-nous. Les autres roles sont trop. effacés pour mériter une
                        mention. Certains d'entre eux ont été d'ailleurs absolument ratés, tel celui
                        de Gilbert.</p>
                    <p>Malgré tout la pièce a plu à tout le monde, ce qui montre bien que le choix
                        des représentations doit être la principale préoccupation du directeur.</p>

                    <p>London, February 4.</p>
                    <p>The programme of reliefs for the trooping season of 1905-06, just issued,
                        shows that the 2nd Battalion Rifle Brigade, now at Khartoum, will move to
                        India, and will be replaced by the 2nd Battalion Dublin Fusiliers, now in
                        Malta. That is the only change to be made in the infantry brigade.</p>
                    <p>The Royal Garrison Artillery reliefs have not yet been issued, but to-day I
                        received private intelligence from Bertauda to the effect that No. 2 Company
                        R.G.A. has been ordered to embark there to-morrow for Southampton, where
                        it will be transhipped to the S.S. "Dilwara" en voyage for Alexandria. No. 2
                        Company is commanded by Major R. Percy-Smith and the other officers are:
                        Captains W. N. Gordon, H. R. Brancker, and Lieutenants N. C. S. Simpson,
                        F. W. Willis, C. H. M. Furnell, and G. Grylls.</p>
                    <p>Major and Brevet Lieutenant Colonel G. F. W. St. John, late commanding the
                        Royal Artillery in Egypt, has been formally appointed brigade major for, R.
                        A. at "Gib."</p>
                    <p>The five battalions of the Royal Garrison Regiment will be broken up on the
                        1st April. Officers who elect to do so may go on retired pay, and the
                        remainder will be transferred to other regiments. The rank and file will be
                        generously dealt with in the matter of bounty and inducements to settle down
                        in South Africa, where the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Bat talions are, or
                        Canada, where the 5th Battalion is stationed. Men of 14 years' (or over)
                        service will be discharged on a modified pension.</p>
                    <p>The smart girdle lately issued to the R.F.A. is only to be worn on home
                        service. Gunners going abroad will not be served out with it.</p>
                    <p>The 1st Battalion, Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers will move from Derry and
                        Enniskillen to Belfast in the coming trooping season.</p>
                    <p>The King will inspect H.M.S. "Drake"- flagship of Prince Louis of Battenberg,
                        commanding the Second Cruiser Squadron-about the end of this month, prior
                        to the squadron leaving England for an extended cruise in North and South
                        American waters. As already announced in these notes, the cruise of this
                        powerful 24-knot squadron is for the purpose of letting some of the more
                        distant foreign nations see that "britanuis rules the waves" is no empty
                        boast.</p>

                                <p>Herndon, Va. The Peruna Medicine Co., Columbus, O.: Gentlemen-"I
                                    cannot speak too highly of the value of Peruna. I believe that
                                    I owe my life to its wonderful merits. I suffered with catarrh
                                    of the head and lungs in its worst form, until the doctors
                                    fairly gave me up, and I despaired of ever getting well
                                    again.</p>
                                <p>"I noticed your advertisement and the splendid testimonials given
                                    by people who had been cured by Peruna, and de termined to try a
                                    bottle. I felt but little</p>
                                <p>better, but used a second and a third bottle and kept on
                                    improving slowly.</p>
                                <p>"It took six bottles to cure me, but they were worth a king's
                                    ransom to me. I talk Peruna to all my friends and am a true
                                    believer in its worth."</p>

                                <p>to Peruna. Tens of thousands owe their health to Peruna. Hundreds

                    <p>In spite of rain and very cold weather, the above teams met on Shebin School
                        playground yesterday afternoon. Among those who were present were H.B. the
                        Moudir, the wekil, the mamour, the judge, the two doctors of the province,
                        the sanitary inspector, Rev. W. T. Fairman, the head of the English school,
                        Mr. Hewett, the agent of the National Bank's branch here, and other
                        notables. The result of the game was unfortunate for Shebin. They were the
                        losers, having failed to secure a single goal against Tantah's four.</p>

                        Mr. Barnard applied for a stay of execution from a judg ment of Sir Francis
                        Jeune, given in December last on an application of the husband for a
                        variation of the marriage settlement in his favor. The President then made
                        an order directing the trustees of the settlements to pay over large sums to
                        the husband, and the application was now for a stay of execution pending
                        an appeal by the wife.</p>
                    <p>The judge granted the application..</p>

                    <head>ABBAS HELMY THEATRE.</head>
                    <p>CARMEN.</p>
                    <p>Another large and fashionable audience assembled on Monday evening at the
                        Abbas Helmy Theatre to witness the first production by the present company
                        of Carmen, that delightful single gem left for our enjoyment, and possibly
                        our moralising, by Bizet that story, now so familiar, of a tickle maiden,
                        disappointed love, and the consequent tragical overthrow of the hopes and
                        aspirations of all concerned. The great attraction of the evening was the
                        appearance in the title role of Signora Gemma Beltincioni, so justly
                        celebrated for her interpre tation of the character. Carmen does not lend
                        much scope to the artiste for brilliant vocalisation, but abundant
                        opportunites are afforded for the display of histrionio ability, and not one
                        of these was missed by Signora Bellincioni, who impersonated the character
                        of the wanton flirt to the life. It is scarcely necessary to add that her
                        various vocal numbers were rendered with that care and skill now so well
                        known to Alexandrians, and those present on Monday were not slow in showing
                        their appreciation of her splendid performance, and on every possible
                        occasion applauded frantically this truly distinguished artiste. Signora
                        Bellincioni was very ably supported by Signor Pagani, who was in excellent
                        voice; his performance throughout the opera merits the highest commendation.
                        Signor Badini was distinctly disappointing as Becamillo, and missed a fine
                        opportunity in the famous Toreador song in his apparent anxiety to get
                        through with it as quickly as possible. A word of praise is due to Signora
                        Tadolini for her sympathetic impersonation of the rather thankless role of
                        Micaela. The other characters were in good hands and the chorus well up to
                        their work. The staging of the opera was exceptionally good, and the
                        orchestra did its work well under the able bâton of Siguor Donizetti, who
                        deserves great credit.</p>
                    <p>This evening, Il Barbiere di Siviglia will be produced, with Signora Svicher,
                        and to-morrow: evening Signora Beltincioni will appear in Cavalleria
                        Rusticana, which will be preceded by I Pagliacci.</p>
