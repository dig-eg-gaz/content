					<head>THE ROYAL TOUR. RENOWN'S PORT SAID STAY.</head>
					<byline>(From our correspondent.)</byline>
					<dateline><placeName>Port Said</placeName>, Saturday.</dateline>
					<p>Now that the Royal party have left us on the continuation of their Tour, it
						may be interesting to review the progress of the trip up to the time of
						their departure. H.M’s. battleship Renown left
							<placeName>Portsmouth</placeName> on Sunday, 15th inst, for Genoa, where
						the <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q269412">Prince</persName>
						and <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q76927">Princess</persName>
						of Wales embarked. From Genoa to the Straits of Messina the Renown was
						accompanied by H.M.S. Lancaster, Suffolk, Terrible, and Cambrian, with
							<persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q323773">Lord Chas.
							Beresford</persName> on board. Just as the Royal party were leaving
						Genoa the Italian Fleet rounded the point The fleet consisted of Sicilia,
						Marco Polo, Delfino, and other vessels. When the Renown and her escorts
						arrived in the Straits of Messina, they were met by the whole of the
						Mediterranean Fleet, consisting of H.M.S. Bulwark, Queen, Formidable,
						Implacable, Venerable, Irresistible, Sentinel, Prince of Wales, Goliath,
						Venus, 14 destroyers, and others. The actual place of meeting was off
							<placeName>Cape Pellaro</placeName>. The usual Royal salute was fired,
						after which manoeuvres began and lasted till sunset. Later in the evening
						there was a grand display of illuminations and fireworks. The fleet returned
						to Malta as soon as Reggio was passed, and the Terrible proceeded to Port
						Said at full speed, in order to have time to coal at Suez before the arrival
						of the Prince. It was expected that the Renown would arrive here at 8 a.m.
						on Friday, and as a matter of fact no one expected her on Thursday,until
						about 11 a.m., when Capt. Tottenham informed the British Consul that he had
						received a wireless telegraphic message from H.M.S. Suffolk saying they
						would arrive at 3 p in. The Renown, on her arrival, moored opposite the
						Canal Company’s office. The band of the Lancaster played "God bless the
						Prince of Wales" while the Renown was mooring, and immediately after the
						Renown's band struck up "God save the King." The Princess, who was on the
						bridge with the Prince, looked charming in a black skirt with a white bodice
						and yachting cap. Their Royal Highnesses remained on the bridge until the
						ship was moored and the boats returned. They then retired to their private
						rooms, and afterwards received some official visits. After the visitors had
						left the Renown, the Prince of Wales was to be seen strolling on deck
						conversing with the Captain Soon after 7 o’clock his Royal Highness retired,
						and most of the people who had been waiting on the shore, in the hope of
						seeing the Royal party land, left. Early on Friday morning the Prince and
						Princess, accompanied by some members of their suite, left the Renown and
						boarded the Surprise, where they took lunch. Afterwards, the Prince
						inspected the yacht and shortly after 3 p.m. he and the Princess proceeded
						to the Lancaster. Here the Prince inspected the ship and, as already
						reported, rang the silver bell which was presented to the vessel by the
						ladies of Lancaster. Subsequently the Royal party went on board the Suffolk.
						Tea was the chief item on the programme on the Suffolk. The stern of the
						ship was very prettily decorated with flags, etc. The Prince, on leaving,
						shook hands with all the officers, and the sailors gave three cheers for the
						Prince and Princess, and another three for the King, as the Royal Standard
						was Hauled down. From H. M. S. Suffolk the Prince and party went to the
						Powerful, where they were met by the captains of all four ships. Dinner was
						served later in the evening, after which a ball was held, and the Prince and
						Princess returned to the Renown soon after mid-night The Renown finished
						coaling about 2 p.m. yesterday and by 6 p.m. everything was as clean and
						white as possible. Over 700 "Jacks” came ashore last night and the streets
						were full until the early hours of the morning. At 6 a.m. to-day the boats
						of the Renown were lowered and manned and by 6.15 the Renown was under way.
						Twenty-one guns were fired as a salute from the shore battery, and a little
						cheer went up from the few people gathered on shore as the Renown moved off.
						The Prince appeared on deck just as the bridge bell rang "Slow ahead.” An
						hour later H. M. S. Powerful left her moorings and entered the Canal, and at
						9.45 H. M. S. Lancaster left for <placeName>Malta</placeName>.</p>

					<head>A QUESTION OF PROPRIETORSHIP.</head>
					<p>Our readers will remember that some months ago the property of Aly Pasha
						Cherif on Rhoda Island was put up for sale by the Wakfs Administration, and
						was knocked down to Messrs. Zervadachi AND Co. at the price of £1,360 the
						feddan. This price was thought by the Wakfs Administration to be
						insufficient, and consequently it was decided to have a new adjudication. We
						hear that few companies were prepared to compete owing to certain drawbacks
						connected with this property, such, for instance, as the fact that all the
						river frontage, amounting to 14 feddans, had been sold by the heirs as
						private property to various persons, and consequently would not enter into
						the general sale. Another drawback was the fact that a portion of the
						property was understood to be leased for a period of seven and a half years
						and that under no circumstances would the lessee give it up to a purchaser
						until the expiration of his term. We now hear that the lessee has officially
						notified the Wakfs Administration of bis intention to hold his land for the
						entire period of his lease, although the administration only recognises his
						right to a part of it A good deal of discussion took place about this at the
						time of the first adjudication, as several important persons are said to be
						in interested in the matter, and the point is one that has an important
						bearing on the renewed sale of the lands, which has been fixed for the first
						of next month.</p>

						<head>BAD WEATHER IN THE HARBOUR</head>
						<byline>(From our Correspondent).</byline>
						<dateline>Port Said, Sunday. </dateline>
						<p>The last few days have seen a long of more or less serious accidents in
							the harbour of Port Said largely owing to the somewhat protracted spell
							of bad weather which we have experienced here. The night before the
							arrival of the Royal party in the Renown it blew hard from the east, and
							in a short space of time a sea got up which did considerable damage to
							the new East breakwater. Towards morning some 30 yards of newly placed
							block of concrete had disappeared and a large hole had been breached by
							the sea in the small jetty. Some forty native craft, wind bound, laden
							with coal, took refuge under the lee of the jettes and one was sunk The
							Messageries Senegal hooked some mooring chains with her anchor and,
							drifting round, smashed he windlass, and divers lifting material were
							sent at daylight on Saturday to assist her. During the early hours of
							Saturday, a collier, the Appledore, to avoid a collision with some of
							the native vessels which at all times are to be seen crossing and
							tacking in the sea channels, let go both anchors and did so much damage
							to herself that she was obliged to slip both chains ; which chains and
							anchors it took over a day to recover and replace on board. The record
							was completed last night, when Bell’s Asia Minor steamer, the Bear,
							coming into port, in the main channel, ran into and sank a very large
							Arab dhow laden with some 100 tons of coal and carrying no lights —
							which, by the way, is after all not at all an uncommon state of affairs
							in the harbor and on the coast line of Port Said. The sound of the crash
							of torn and rending timber, accompanied, as it was, by the noise of
							falling spars and the howls and screams of the vessel’s crew and of
							those of many other similar vessels at anchor in the vicinity, was
							awe-inspiring and terrifying in the extreme. The Bear apparently went
							astern on the engines, for her rudder could clearly be seen from the
							breakwater in a mass of foam and spray, and a circle of some yards of
							churned-up water was remarked, by many among the witnesses of the
							collision, Which occurred at 8 p.m. The Canal Company's launches were in
							the Vicinity and very quickly had lines on to the sunken vessel
							endeavouring to tow her out of the channel, with little chances of
							success, for the dhow bad completely sank in a minute after the shock,
							which most have cut her nearly in two. I have heard that no lives were
							lost and that her entire crew of 16 were picked op almost immediately.
							The Bear, after examination, slowly proceeded to her berth, having
							suffered no apparent damage, and to-day shear-legs and divers are at
							work getting the sunken ship dear of the channel, which, however,
							remained dear on its western side.</p>

						<p>A leper came to my office yesterday and I made enquiries as to how he

					<head>THE PISANI CASE. FURTHER HEARING OF WITNESSES</head>
					<p>Pisani, the Malteese, was again brought before the British Consular Court
						both on Friday and Saturday, on the charge of having attempted to murder
						Victoria Dehan, and Austrian subject, at the Pension Krauss, on the 13th
						inst Mr. A. D. Alban presided, Mr. Favargi acted as registrar, and Maltre
						Sciortino appeared for accused. In giving evidence on Friday, Captain Arthur
						Quartier, inspector of the secret police, deposed that he was called to the
						Pension Krauss in the Old Zaptieh street on the 18th inst. and that on
						entering he found there a man who was connected with [ ] "Imperiale," an
						employe of the Telephone company, and the landlady. He was handed a revolver
						which he selt in order to convince himself that it had been fired recently
						and which he then put in his pocket. The mirror was broken and the carpet
						and two chairs were blood-stained. He found Victoria Dehan in the next room
						standing up and holding her right side from which blood was flowing. There
						was also a man in the room who proved to be Giorgio Mascarelli, the woman's
						lover. He took her to the Gards Medicale, where she was attended by a
						doctor. Shortly afterwards the Commandant of Police and the chief of the
						secret police arrived, and in their presence he unloaded the revolver, which
						contained two loaded and three empty cartridges. Accused came to the pension
						in te custody of the mamour of Mousky ceracol and witness examined his
						hands. He found the top right hand between the thumb and fore-finger
						discoloured, and there was a slight bruise on the fore-finger, the left hand
						was much discoloured and both smelt of gunpowder. Victoria Dehan, who had
						returned to the pension, was confronted with accused, who she identified as
						her assailant. VIncenza Zuixef, mother of the injured woman, was next called
						and said that she cae to Cairo to take her daughter back to Port Said, where
						her husband lived. She next accused at the railway station and afterwards
						went to the pension, having first visited the Hotel de la Poete. At the
						pension witnesses, Victoria Dehan, Pisani, and the landlady went into a
						parlour. Accused told Victoria that he had sent for her mother to take her
						back to Port Said. Victoria said she could not ge at present, and told
						accused to leave the room as she wished to speak to her mother. The landlady
						then told witness that she could not allow her daughter to leave as she had
						been recommended to her by someone. Accused asked Victoria why she would go
						with [her] mother, and the woman replied she did not wish to, whereupon
						Pisani drew a revolver from his coat pocket and fired at Victoria. The
						landlady rushed out of the room and locked herself into the opposite one,
						while witness ran out calling for help and as she was going downstairs heard
						another shot. Witness did not go back to the house but took the next train
						to Port Said. Emin Wasfi, mamour of the Mousky ranebl, was the next witness
						heard on Friday. His evidence differed in no essential detail from that of
						Captain Quartier, and Said Mustaqha was next called and deposed to having
						arrested accused. The first witness examined on Saturday morning was the
						medical adviser to the Austrian Consulate. The woman Victoria deposed
						witness, had two wounds which had evidently been inflicted by one bullet.
						The first wound was on the under surface of the right arm, oblique in
						direction, and superficial, it being caused by the Bullet grazing the arm,
						which the woman held up to protect herself. The second wound was serious. It
						was on the anterior right side of the thorax and had penetrated into the
						thoracic cavity, lacerating a portion of the rights lung. He had sent her to
						hospital and thought she would not be able to appear for at least ten days
						Giorgio Mascarelli, who lived with Vitoria Dehan, next gave evidence. The
						woman, he said, was married and her husband lived at Port Said, in which
						town he had made her acquaintance. He came into the pension where he and
						Victoria were living, just after the shots had been fired. A revolver was
						produced in court, and witness said it was similar to the one which he had
						seen lying on the floor of the room when he entered. He was aware that
						accused had had relation with VIctoria Dehan; accused and witness had not
						quarrelled about her. Dr. Ismail Hamadi, attached to the Cairo city police
						deposed to having examined the accused. He said that he found a wound on the
						left side of the neck at the junction of the head and neck and behind. THere
						was an irregular opening with a diameter of about half a centimeter. The
						hair in the neighbour-hood of the wound was signed; the wound might have
						been self-inflicted by the left hand. There was also a burn and wound on the
						right cheek, which might possibly have been caused by a piece of glass.
						There were black marks on both hands, especially the left, and also and
						abrasion on the right hand. Dr. Battista Mazzoli was the last witness called
						and deposed to having examined Victoria Dehan at the Garde Medicale. His
						evidence was similar in every respect to that of Dr. Basker the first
						medical witness called the case was then adjourned until the 7th pox. when
						it is hoped that the wounded woman may be able to give evidence.</p>
