                    <head>THE SUDAN &amp; BRITISH MANUFACTURERS.</head>
                    <p>The Director of Works on the Head Quarters Staff of the Egyptian Army,
                        Kaimakam Kennedy Bey, has drawn up a very instructive report which should be
                        of considerable interest to British manufacturers who desire to push their
                        business in the Sudan.</p>
                    <p>The following remarks from Kaimakam Kennedy’s report are of sufficient
                        interest to quote in full:—</p>
                    <p>A great deal has been written, more especially within the last few months, on
                        the subject of the treatment of British man ufacturers and the question of
                        British trade abroad. In the expenditure of large sums of money on public
                        works throughout the Soudan and on the construction of the new tow and
                        harbour at Port Sudan, this Department has had occasion to deal with
                        manufacturers and contractors of all nationalities, and in this connection 1
                        beg to make the following remarks I have several times lately seen it stated
                        in the home Press that it seems useless to expect the Egyptian Government,
                        which is supposed to be directly under the influence of the British
                        Government, to assist the British manufacturer; and that the British
                        manufacturer need not expect fair play, for ha does not get it Granted that
                        the British manufacturer’s work and methods are up to the standard of his
                        continental competitors, I fully agree that reasonable preference should be
                        given to him; but, speaking generally, I consider that the British
                        manufacturer, as exemplified by his agents in Egypt and the Sudan, is not
                        nearly so much in touch with local masters and local requirements as his
                        continental rivals, and, furthermore, he is badly represented technically.
                        With a few exceptions British manufacturers— I speak of engineering firms
                        only—are represented in Egypt by general business men, or general agents,
                        who know little or nothing of the technicalities of the engineering
                        profession ; they are merely selling agents, whose business it is to sell as
                        large a quantity of the goods of the firms they represent as they possibly
                        can. Speaking generally, this is not the case with the better class
                        continental firms represented in Egypt Most of the continental firms of any
                        standing are represented in Egypt both by their business</p>
                    <pb/>
                    <p>men and by their technical men. 1 had occasion to call for quotations for
                        steel water towers for the storage of water for a town supply. Of the two
                        quotations which were received from ‘British firms, one was forwarded with a
                        drawing showing a water tower and tank of a design antiquated in the
                        extreme, evidently copied from an old catalogue, and quite unsuited to local
                        conditions. The other British quotation was accompanied by a design for a
                        tower which was structurally faulty, and which could not, therefore, be
                        accepted as a contrast to the above, the two quotations received at the same
                        time from Belgian firms represented in Egypt were for water tanks and towers
                        designed in a thoroughly practical manner, up to date in all respects, and
                        suited to local requirements. Another instance, even more instructive: I had
                        occasion to arrange several contracts for structural steel work, laying of
                        water mains, etc., at Port Sudan. Representatives of various firms came down
                        to Port Sudan to go into these questions’ and to tender. Of the two British
                        firms represented, one was represented by their business; agent only, who
                        could give no prices and I furnish no details till he communicated withhis
                        home firm; the other British firm was represented by an engineer, but his
                        knowledge ' of the somewhat intricate work in questionwas insufficient to
                        enable him to tender forthis particular service. The German firm
                        wasrepresented by a first-rate engineer, who wasalso their business man This
                        representative,without any consultation with his headquarters in Germany,

                    <p>quotation and tender, complete specification, and full technical details and
                        calculations The Belgian firm sent as their representatives one of their
                        chief business men and their chief engineer, by whose conjoint efforts
                        completely satisfactory plans, specifications, and tenders were produced a
                        few days after the various projects were laid before them at Port Sudan.</p>
                    <p>As I write I have a reply before me from the agent of one of the largest
                        British engineering firms represented in Egypt. I had pointed out to him
                        that, in my opinion, he was very badly at fault in one of his prices for
                        carrying out work in the Sudan. Although he represented both the engineering
                        and business sides of the undertaking, he replied to the effect that he
                        could not answer my questions till he had referred the matter to the firm at
                        home. The latter have since replied that the price is correct, and it is
                        evident that they are basing their reply on home practice, and not on the
                        state of conditions obtaining here. I do not for a moment say that the above
                        is the state of things-with all British manufacturers; on the contrary, I
                        could point to some very much up-to-date and businesslike quotations and
                        proposals from British firms representing the bridge and dredger building
                        interests ; but I emphatically state that the better class of continental
                        firms trading in Egypt are better represented than their British rivals. Can
                        we wonder, therefore, that a great deal of trade, which might go to British
                        manufacturers is snapped up by their continental competitors if It appears
                        to me that British engineering firms and manufacturers trading in Egypt and
                        the Sudan would be well advised to appoint as their representatives
                        engineers of experience and ability who would be able to advise purchasers
                        as to what they really require, and who would have authority to act on their
                        own initiative. As regards the quality of the goods supplied by British
                        manufacturers, I have one or two general remarks to make. Generally
                        speaking, the machinery and plant we have received from England have been
                        excellent, the machine work especially being of a first rate
                        description.</p>
                    <p>Large quantities of Portland cement have been imported for building works
                        during the year, and the quality throughout has been of the highest
                        standard, so much so that no further supplies of either natural or
                        artificial cement are now being obtained from Belgium. The prices of the
                        Belgian cement are considerably lower, but the quality is distinctly
                        inferior to British brands. On the other hand, I regret to say, as regards
                        building stores generally, that many British manufacturers with whom we have
                        been dealing appear to have wait may be termed an export quality of
                        material, t-s, material which has not been passed as being up to the home
                        standard, but which is sent out to this and other countries is being quite
                        good enough for export The result is that many repeat orders’ which would
                        otherwise have been placed at home are not repeated on account of bad
                        materials having been received in the first instance. I can point to a great
                        many instances of this. ‘Ab regards structural steelwork : A considerable
                        quantity of this has been received from Belgium, and has throughout been
                        entirely satisfactory both in quality and workmanship. Curiously enough, I
                        happen to know that some orders placed by me in England were sub-contracted
                        for in Belgium and shipped direct from Belgium to the Sudan. As regards
                        American machinery: A certain amount of special plant has been received from
                        America, and this, though excellent in design, has been in every single
                        instance of an inferior quality structurally. For example, some well-boring
                        plant—of the American oil- well type—though admirably designed, was of the
                        very worst description, with faulty castings and bearings, and unfinished
                        machine work. Some steam road-rollers also, designed for special work, were
                        found to be manufactured and finished in a manner that certainly fall far
                        short of the ordinary British standard. In consequence of this, it has in
                        some oases been found advisable, in the case of special plant of American
                        types, to obtain the detailed designs from America, and have the manufacture
                        of the same carried out in England.”</p>

                        <p>In order to prevent the continuous fall of local securities the committee
                            of the Cairo Stock and Sharebrokers Association (Corporation des Agents
                            de Change du Cairo) has decided to fix prices below which nobody is to
                            be allowed to sell The Alexandria Stock and Sharebrokers Association
                            yesterday evening at an extraordinary meeting decided to follow the
                            example of the Cairo Bourse. The advocates of this step consider that
                            the firm tone shown this morning in the Alexandria Bourse justify this
                            strong measure. On the other hand a number of competent financiers
                            consider that these proceedings will not be of any permanent benefit and
                            they are of so extraordinary a character that discredit will be thrown
                            on the Alexandria and Cairo bourses in the opinion of the European
                            financial centres. It is objected that if there are any public auctions
                            of shares the fixed prices cannot be maintained and that in other cases
                            sellers, who are unable to find a free market here, will be forced to
                            sell in London. It is further urged that it is as impossible to stop the
                            fall in shares as to prevent water reaching its proper level, and
                            however strictly these remedial measures are enforced there will always
                            be means of evading them. At the same time it is acknowledged that
                            Alexandria was obliged to follow the example set by Cairo as otherwise
                            an impossible situation would have arisen.</p>
                        <p>The latest failure at Alexandria is that of a broker in the share market,
                            whose liabilities are estimated at £70,000.</p>

                        <head>OVERLOADING ANIMALS.</head>
                        <p>To the Editor of the “Egyptian Gazette.”</p>
                        <p>Sir :— Now that the hideous structure called the Rodah bridge is nearing
                            completion, I write to call your attention to the excessive height to
                            which they are obliged to raise the roadway at Ghizeh in order to reach
                            tile level of the bridge. What will this mean when traffic is opened !
                            It will mean the greatest suffering and cruelty for all beasts of
                            burden. Owing to the remarkable flatness of the country animals are
                            always loaded to the very last pound they can possibly draw—and with the
                            greatest effort The moment the least ascent is arrived at- there are
                            cruel scenes. The animals cannot draw their loads. They strain every
                            nerve, fall every moment on their knees, while fierce blows are rained
                            on them. Shoubra bridge is bad enough, and there, daily, disgraceful
                            exhibitions of cruelty occur. But Rodah bridge will be terrible. The
                            S.P.C.A., excellent in every way, can do nothing in this matter. But
                            might not the Government make some regulations as to loading animals
                            Would it be impossible to fix a legal weight for a donkey, horse, or
                            mule, and if this rule were not obeyed to imprison or fine the owner of
                            the overloaded animal ? If others would kindly take up the subject of
                            overloading animals something in time might be done to alleviate the
                            unnecessary sufferings of our four-footed, dumb, willing, and helpless
                            friends. Yours etc.</p>

                            of loads carried by animals were made last year.</p>

                        <p>Recently two penniless Germans got through to Berber from Wady Haifa on
                            one occasion, and a Syrian Jew on another. These people talked along the
                            river over six hundred miles. They were fed the whole way through the
                            charity of the inhabitants. The Governor of the Berber province, Sir
                            Henry Hill, some of the sheikhs that it was very charitable of them to
                            assist people of a different race and creed, and they replied that when
                            they sat down to their evening meal they could never allow a hungry man
                            to pass without giving some of their food. Such genuine hospitality is
                            one of the most attractive features of Oriental character.</p>

                    <p>The following particulars of the Egyptian trade in chemical fertilisers are
                        taken from a report by the French Consul at Cairo, reproduced in the
                        “Moniteur Officiel du Commerce." The large increase in the area of land
                        under cultivation in Egypt, due to the irrigation works carried out in that
                        country, has led to it correspondingly large demand for chemical
                        Fertilisers. On cotton plantations superphosphates are employed at the rate
                        of 100 to 150 kilogs per feddan (4,200 square metres), to which are often
                        added 50 kilogs of nitrate )f soda or sulphate of ammonia. For wheat
                        cultivation, nitrate of soda is employed at the rate of 100 kilogs per
                        feddan, mixed with 40 0r 50 per cent of superphosphates. The prices :>f
                        chemical fertilisers in Egypt vary from week to week, averaging as follows
                        in Alexandria:—Sulphate of ammonia, 338 fr. per ton; nitrate of soda, 312
                        fr. per ton; superphosphates, 78 fr.. per ton. The Society Khediviale
                        d’Agriculture supplies cultivators with Fertilisers specially mixed for
                        different crops, % the rate of 46 fr.. per feddan for cotton, 11 fr. 50
                        cents for maize, and 28 fr. 50 cents For wheat. The value of the imports of
                        chemical fertilisers into Egypt increased from L.E 16,417 in 1903 to L.E
                        28,625 in 1904, and to L E 56,801 in 1905. Belgium holds by Far the largest
                        share of the trade, the imports from that country having risen from L.E. 255
                        in 1903 to L.E 51,000 in 1905.</p>

                        the purchase of steamers and tugs, L.E 5,000 for providing a building for

                    <p>It is also stated that in its last meeting the Council of Ministers decided

                    <p>It is further said that according to a recent report of his Excellency the

                        the Blue Nile will be commenced. Sir William Garstin estimates the cost of
                        building the proposed barrage and excavating the canal which will cross the
                        Gezira at L E 3,000,000. The land which will be reclaimed through this canal
                        will have an area of half a million feddans on which a tax of P.T. 50 per
                        feddan will be levied bringing in an annual total of LE 500,000.</p>
                    <p>These funds will be advanced as loans on which an interest of 3 % will be
                        paid by the Sudan Government.</p>

                        <head>REMAINS IN UPPER EGYPT.</head>
                        <p>Mr. F.F. Ogilvie writes from Assouan :— That body known as the Comite de
                            Conservations des Monuments de l’Art Arabe has done so much to preserve
                            the chief features of mediaeval Cairo that it is to be regretted that
                            some such institution does not exist for the preservation of ancient
                            buildings (other than temples) in Upper Egypt</p>
                        <p>Such a place as the Kubbet el Howa on the summit of the hill at Assouan
                            is a case in point. A plain and simple structure in itself, its
                            commanding position makes it a point of great importance in the
                            landscape, and all admirers of the beauty of Assouan would regret its
                            loss should it fall</p>
                        <p>There is danger of this happening before long, for one of its four piers
                            and part of the dome have already fallen, and the remaining piers are
                            much eroded by the action of blown sand. In addition to its elegance and
                            appropriateness to its surroundings there are curious legends connected
                            with it which are of interest to those who study the history and
                            folklore of the district</p>
                        <p>Seeing that many similar places of historic interest near Assouan, and
                            further south through Nubia are to be destroyed by the raising of the
                            dam (for being mostly built of crude brick they will go down at once
                            when reached by the water) such a body as the Comite de Conservation
                            would do well to take the matter in hand and save what can be saved
                            while there is yet time, if the Antiquities Department of the Government
                            does not consider buildings other than temples to be within its
                            scope.</p>
                        <p>Had the Comite de Conservation been active in Upper Egypt in past years
                            such destruction as that of the tomb-mosque of El-Sahaba at Assouan
                            might have been prevented and the tank necessary for the town
                            water-supply might still have been built in a suitable position without
                            the pulling down of a building of great historic interest</p>
                        <p>It is perhaps too much to hope that in future any authority can interfere
                            to control the vagaries of officials and others responsible for the
                            erection of such places as the grotesque and tasteless villas,
                            resthouses, etc., that have been put up on conspicuous places round
                            about Assouan.</p>
                        <p>On utilitarian grounds alone surely it is a mistake to allow the beauty
                            of this place to be spoiled in this way, or to permit one of the chief
                            attractions of Assouan—-the scenery of the Cataract—to be defaced by the
                            blasting and removal of the polished rocks that are so great a source of
                            interest to visitors. Of the great numbers of people who visit Assouan

                        not share the fate of the Austrian Lloyd, which has been compelled to
                        abandon its services on the East African route A Bill has accordingly been
                        submitted to the Reichstag, in which it is proposed that on the main route
                        one voyage round Africa every three weeks should be substituted for the
                        present monthly service, while the present monthly service on the
                        intermediate lines of route is to be changed into a mail and cargo service
                        every six weeks. In return for these concessions the company offers to call
                        at German South-West African ports an may be necessary in order to make up
                        for the retirement of the Woermann Line from these waters.</p>

                    <p>BRITAIN'S GOLD EXPORT.</p>
                    <p>To the Editor of the “EGYPTIAN Gazette” London, April 13, 1907.</p>
                    <p>In your leading article of April 5th it is stated that, during the last 10
                        years 63 millions of gold have been exported from Great Britain to Germany,
                        and the fact is supposed to be some proof of damage or impoverishment to
                        us.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps a little consideration may dissipate the gloomy apprehension’s of
                        your writer, and restore some confidence in the common sense of our
                        businessmen. Supposing that it is correct that a sum of 63 millions more
                        gold has been sent to Germany than we have in the last 10 years received
                        from there, and as imagined by you that it was all retained in Germany and
                        not some of it enroute to other countries in payment for our investments in
                        their loans, it is obvious we have not made a present of it to the Teutons,
                        but they have only obtained it by being compelled by us to give us something
                        we thought worth having in exchange.</p>
                    <p>It is also evident pace Mr. Seddon, that it was not sent away to the loss of
                        Great Britain in payment for an excess of imports, because the stock of gold
                        here is greater than it was 10 years ago. It must therefore form part of our
                        excess of gold imports during that period which we did not require to retain
                        here. It has been sent to pay for imports of some kind but then it formed
                        part of our exports, which we all desire to augment, and so maintained the
                        balance of trade.</p>
                    <p>Were it true that by such transactions we had parted with our necessary stock
                        of gold as suggested, to pay for excess imports, the balance of the Bank of
                        England would have vanished in three months and a panic in finance have
                        occurred in the first fortnight.</p>
                    <p>The interesting point about the matter is that your remarks lead up to an
                        exposition of the fact so galling to foreign countries that Great Britain by
                        some means or other has secured to itself, in South Africa, Australia, India
                        and Klondike, almost all the gold producing territory upon our planet Within
                        our Empire we obtain the precious metal, it is sent to the Empire’s capital,
                        London, and other countries requiring the precious metal are forced to
                        obtain it from us, we taking care to secure a substantial profit on the
                        business.</p>
                    <p>Did they refuse to do this there would be but little object in our gold
                        mining all over the Empire, beyond what would be needed for the wastage of
                        the metal, and the supplying of our increasing population within our own
                        dominions.</p>
                    <p>Germany’s population having increased some 8 millions in the decade, and much
                        gold being there used in arts and manufactures, they have had to purchase
                        from us some 63 millions worth, but as stated, we did not give it to them.
                        We had delved for it, and refined it for the very purpose of selling it to
                        someone.</p>
                    <p>That we were paid for it by the excess of our imports over exports to
                        Germany, or from elsewhere, is possible but that those imports, were any
                        injury to us is an absolute assumption. Some have been in the form of
                        securities which, if all were so paying 5% interest will in 14, years double
                        the 63 millions. All of them might have been in securities and it is strange
                        that British investors do not more largely invest in the shares of the
                        German mercantile marine companies, so that we should obtain the benefit of
                        the huge subsidies the German tax payer gives to them:</p>
                    <p>Some of the payment for the *d may have been in raw material which we
                        reworked up into goods and then resold at a profit to our colonies to pay
                        for the gold they sent us to sell to Germany.</p>
                    <p>I know personally of a case where in consequence of obtaining a large supply
                        of iron from Germany below its cost we were able in quoting for rails into
                        which it was worked, for a South American Railway, to name such a low figure
                        that we obtained the order as against a higher German tender because the
                        home “Cartel” compelled the German firm to pay much more for iron than the
                        price at which they sold it to us. Your suggestion that because the gold we
                        have sold to Germany might there be used in the construction of warships,
                        therefore we might refuse to sell the surplus of this our one exclusive
                        product necessary for the world’s expanding commerce, would if carried out,
                        justify foreign countries in a league to obtain some of the gold producing
                        territories for themselves.</p>
                    <pb/>
                    <cb n="3"/>
                    <p>What good either to us would it be to retain gold we do not need in
                                vaults at homer instead of, as in this case, selling it to Germany
                                at a profit, internationally benefitting by the business. Finally,
                                supposing some of it has been exported to pay for imports of 'food,
                                of which however little comes to us from Germany, providing that
                                excess of food imports has not been beyond the profit upon our
                                exports, we have not financially last a penny by the transaction,
                                whilst our teeming population has by means of these imports been
                                better fed instead of being compelled to emigrate.</p>
                            <p>We sent Egypt some millions of gold last year but you do not appear
                                to think that injured England ; we had to pay India, South Africa,
                                and Australia for it, we wanted your cotton to make into goods so
                                that in paying our Colonies we could do so in some manufacture out
                                of which we obtained a large profit and so sent Egypt gold. Soon wo
                                may send you other articles wanted by you and obtain some of it
                                back; and so commerce, unfettered by high duties, keeps old England
                                a going concern.</p>

                    <p>To the Editor of the ’’Egyptian Gazette.”</p>
                    <p>Sir,—Some five years ago I wrote to yon under the above heading to draw the
                        attention of the municipal authorities to the fact that there were four open
                        grills leading direct to the sewer at the intersection of the Rue Antoine
                        with the Rue Marietta Pacha. My predictions of the consequences were
                        unfortunately fulfilled in my own family, as my boy had a severe attack of
                        small pox, and I then removed to another quarter of the town. Since then the
                        same disease has appeared in the locality where these grills ate still
                        situated. My object in writing this letter is not merely to point out one
                        particular defect in the sanitation of our streets, but to express my
                        surprise that the inodorous siphons of the “A Plesch” system have not been
                        put down in all the main thoroughfares in substitution of the noxious open
                        grills. I have noted over and over again that where these siphons have been
                        adopted by the Municipality in different parts of Alexandria there are no
                        offensive effluvia discernible to the passers by To publicly call on the
                        population of a large city to get vaccinated in the presence of our epidemic
                        of small-pox is a commendable action on the part of a Municipality ~ but it
                        appears to me to be a more practical course of combating disease to provide
                        an efficient system, such as I have alluded to, that prevents sewer-gas from
                        getting into the streets. — I am, Sir, your obedient servant W. F.

                    <head>EMBALMING IN ANCIENT EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>Prof. Elliot Smith has applied to the stiffly of mummification the accurate
                        and thorough methods of observation which have won for him a foremost place
                        among the younger generation of anatomists, the result being an
                        authoritative memoir, which will serve both the expert and the uninitiated
                        as an excellent introduction to the art and significance of embalming its
                        practiced in ancient Egypt. As professor of anatomy in the medical school at
                        Cairo he has free access to the material necessary' for a first-hand study
                        of the subject So well has he pieced his evidence together that one obtains
                        on reading it a very complete picture of the actual process employed by the
                        embalmers during the twenty-first dynasty. The memoir is based on a study of
                        forty-four mummies of priests and priestesses of Ammnon, belonging to that
                        dynasty.</p>
                    <p>Although the chief object of the author was to unravel the details of the
                        embalmer s art, he carefully collected-all evidence which might throw light
                        on the significance of a custom which was practiced for a period of at least
                        two thousand years in Egypt—from the seventeenth dynasty until about 600
                        A.D.During the twenty-first dynasty, embalming culminated in an elaborate
                        technique which aimed at preserving the integrity of the skin and restoring
                        the living form to the body. In ex- planation of the elaboration of
                        technique during this period, Dr. Elliot Smith brings forward a suggestion
                        of Dr. Reisner (in charge of the Hearst Egyptological Expedition of the
                        University of California), namely, that the procedure had as its object a
                        life-like preservation of the body so that it might serve as an abode for
                        the Ka or –a “double,” in place of the statue which was usually placed in
                        the tomb along with the dead body to answer this purpose. Whatever the
                        object may have been, there can be no doubt as to the tedious and
                        complicated nature of the means employed.</p>
                    <p>Before the twenty-first dynasty, the process of embalming resulted in a mummy
                        which was simply a skeleton wrapped in a wrinkled covering of shrivelled
                        skin. In this dynasty, or at the close of the twentieth, the process of
                        packing or "stuffing” was introduced to avoid the shrivelling of the flesh
                        and distortion of the body which marred the work of the older embalmers. The
                        mortal flesh was replaced by subcutaneous packings of durable material such
                        as mud, sand, lime, and sawdust, with occasionally an addition of aromatic
                        vegetable substances such as onion. The eyes of the great Rameses IV. were
                        replaced by onions. After the twenty first dynasty, the art of embalming
                        declined. Subcutaneous packing was discontinued, the surface form of the
                        body being restored by swathing the limbs and body by an artistic
                        application of bandages ; later still all distortion was hidden by a free
                        application of pitch and bandage to the shrunken trunk and limbs.</p>

                    <cb n="4"/>
                    <p>In the course of his investigations, .Elliot Smith was able to verify certain
                        statements made by Herodotus and by Diodorus Siculus concerning the methods
                        of embalming employed by the ancient Egyptians. Herodotus describes the
                        extraction of the brain through a small opening made on the roof of the
                        nasal cavity— a procedure -which Greenhill characterised as “amusing and
                        impracticable.” It was found that all the mummies belonging to the
                        seventeenth and later dynasties showed clear evidence of the truth of the
                        ancient description ; early in last century, T.J. Petti- grewalso verified
                        it. In the writings ofPettigrew and in Brugsch’s translation of the Rh’nd
                        Papyri, the author of the memoir /bund much that assisted him in re
                        instructing the details of the process used by the embalmers. Broadly
                        speaking, there were three stages : (I) the viscera were removed from the
                        body through a wound in the left Bank, the heart being invariably left in
                        the trunk ; (2) the body was then placed in brine for a period of thirty or
                        forty days; the viscera were preserved in a similar medium within the four
                        "Canopic Jars,” each of which was dedicated to one of the four children of
                        Horns ; (3) after removal from the salt bath the body, now much shrunken,
                        was packed ; from the arrangement of the packing, Elliot Smith found it
                        possible to tell the exact manner and order in which this had been
                        accomplished; it is unnecessary here to mention the details, but one may
                        safely state that these ancient embalmers must have had a very considerable
                        knowledge of the anatomy of the human body.</p>
                    <p>The process of packing was finished by returning the contents of the four
                        canopic jars to the body cavity; they were arranged in four packages, and
                        were usually replaced within the cavity in a certain definite order. In each
                        package it was the custom to enclose the image of one of the four children
                        of Horns —"funerary genii,” as they are named in this memoir.</p>
                    <p>The following statement of Pettigrew is quoted in this connection,.</p>
                    <p>"To Amset were dedicated the stomach and large intestines; to Hapi the small
                        intestines ; to Smautf (Tuamautef) the lungs and heart; and to Kebhsnuf the
                        liver and gall bladder.”</p>
                    <p>On this Prof. Elliot Smith makes the following commentary :—</p>
                    <p>"The examination of a still larger series of mummies of this period
                        (twenty-first dynasty) has convinced me that, in spite of frequent
                        irregularities, a definite association was intended—but the guardianship of

                    <p>FUNERAL MEATS.</p>
                    <p>By W. St. Chad Boscawen.</p>
                    <p>The custom of depositing food in the graves . of the dead is one common to
                        all aucient nations. It may have originated in a belief that j the deceased
                        would one day come to life, and require them, but there is no proof that the
                        ancient Egyptians believed in a resurrection which implied a return to
                        material life. That they believe that the ka, or immaterial double, had all
                        the wants of the earthly form is proved by the religious texts of all
                        periods—and, therefore, the relatives placed with the body, and later with
                        the mummy, portions of all objects that formed the staple food and drink of
                        the living on earth.</p>
                    <p>No nation presents so continuous a sequence of burial customs as the
                        inhabitants of the Nile Valley—from the far remote neolithic ages to the
                        early centuries of Christianity, we have a variety of customs, and if is
                        mast, interesting to see how many of these survived in but slightly modified
                        forms until Christian times. One of these is the placing of food in the
                        graves. The discovery of vases and food dishes in the graves of the
                        prehistoric age show that the custom was prevalent then—but the’ nature of
                        the deposits is still obscure. The cereals not being known no bread is found
                        ;or, apparently, any beer, but that the vessels had contained food is clear
                        in many cases by the deposits showing some vegetable matter. Nor do the
                        graves yield any bones of animals, though a vase from Geblen had a small
                        collection of fish bones and some shells of freshwater crustacea. With the
                        incoming of the dynastic Egyptians, who came certainly from the Asiatic
                        Continent, and probably from a land contiguous to Babylonia, the food
                        deposits become more varied. These newcomers brought with them many new
                        comforts for the living and the dead. The advent, or rather, infiltration,
                        began in the later neo lithic period—when the shallow brick grave was being
                        replaced by the funeral hut or house. The funeral meats were placed around
                        the grave, or in the more extensive Royal tombs at Ballas and Nagada, and
                        especially at Abydos, in store chambers built round the central chamber of
                        the dead.</p>
                    <p>In the earlier stages of this period we may assign an interesting series of
                        objects which have been brought to this country. There are curious clay
                        models of courtyards or enclosures, some oval, others square. They evidently
                        represent an excavated space which was cleared in the primitive cemetery, in
                        the centre of which was the grave of the deceased. Some of them have
                        staircases at the four comers leading down to the sacred enclosure, “the
                        temeros,” or holy ground around the chieftain’s grave. Later, instead of the
                        excavated enclosure, a wall was built, and the holy space entered by a
                        gateway. In the space enclosed are models of the offerings for the dead. In
                        the centre there is a round hole or pool with a drain leading through the
                        gateway ; this is evidently the receptacle for liquid offerings, beer, And,
                        later, wine. At the top is a bull’s skull, while on either side are placed
                        the thighs .of the victim, which are deemed so important in the later
                        ritual. Loaves of bread, flat and conical, are arranged, in heaps down the
                        sides, and other fiat objects looking very like skins are stretched on the
                        ground. Here there is the most primitive form of the ceremonial funeral
                        feast on which the double of the deceased was nourished. It is very
                        primitive, for many of the objects which appear in the funeral texts of the
                        fourth and sixth dynasties do not yet appear. The formula of these texts is
                        most explicit : “May they give to the double funeral offerings of bread and
                        beer, oxen or fowl (ducks), linen, incense, wax, and all good and pure
                        things that the earth produces or the Nile brings forth from his
                        storehouse.”</p>
                    <p>It is probable that in ancient times the actual objects were deposited at the
                        graveside or in the funeral chamber ; hut soon, with the rise of imitative
                        magic, models or paintings of the objects began to do duty, and the models
                        of the sacred enclosures above belong to the first stage of this belief*
                        Each of these objects had a spiritual double, and thus ministered to the
                        wants of the deceased in the next world. The bread became then the “bread
                        that groweth not stale,” the beer “that which goeth not sour.’ Still further
                        spiritualisation took place, as Dr. Budge has recently shown in his work on
                        “The Egyptian Heaven and Hell,” when the bread on which the soul was
                        nourished was made from the eternal crop of wheat which sprang from the body
                        of Osiris. There can be little doubt that at stated period an actual feast
                        was at certain periods the festivals mentioned in the inscriptions, and that
                        the deceased was supposed in spirit to feast with his relations. This belief
                        did not die out, for in Graeco- Roman times we find the same prayers and the
                        same paintings or models of the funeral meats in the tombs, and in the
                        Coptic tombs at Akherim, the great centred Egyptian Christianity, small cups
                        and models of the holy paten with the Eucharistic cake are found. A curious
                        instance of survival may be mentioned. It was the custom of the Ancient
                        Egyptians to bury with their dead copies of the Book of the Dead; it
                        survived among the 1 Christians, for from the grave of a Coptic ' priest
                        came fragments of the Gospel and Apo. calypse of St. Peter, and from another
                        a copy of the Book of Enoch. Custom truly dies hard in Nile land. (“The
                        Globe”).</p>

                    <p>“I am now at work on the farm and feel well all of the time. I eat all I want
                        to and my friends say that I look better than ever before. I will ever
                        praise Pernna for its healing power.” </p>
                    <p>Pe-ru-na Is a Systemic Remedy.</p>
                    <p>If Peruna proves efficient for catarrh in one place, it will be equally
                        potent In any other place, because it is a systemic remedy.</p>
                    <p>The people generally are very much misinformed aa to the nature of catarrh
                        Catarrh Is usually believed to be confined to the head, nose and throat.
                        Latterly we sometimes hear of catarrh of the stomach and catarrh of the
                        bowels. Seldom, if ever, do we hear of catarrh of any other organs.</p>
                    <p>It is not because these organs are not subject to catarrh, nor that catarrh
                        of these organs is not a very common disease. hut simply because it is not
                        generally known that affections of those organs may be due to catarrh.</p>

                        may know about the farmer's vocation, he Is vitally dependent upon the
                        things which grow In the soil.</p>
                    <p>Farming is the basis of all wealth and is the bulwark of all
                        civilization.</p>

                    <p>The reuben and the country bumpkin have disappeared and in their stead a
                        practical well-trained business man, capable of the highest form ol
                        commercial activity, has arisen.’</p>
                    <p>Peruna Is a very popular medicine among the farming class.</p>

                    <p>Many a family depends largely upon Peruna as a family medicine and the family
                        physician.</p>
                    <p>Some farmers are far removed from physicians, and In any case they are far
                        more self-reliant and more liable to depend upon a household remedy than
                        people who live in the cities.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Hartman, who for many years was a farmer himself, and who still owns and
                        manages one of the best farms in the State of Ohio, is a friend of the
                        farmer, and it is with the farmer that the immense balk of his

                    <p>“I was afflicted with catarrh of the throat and bead for over ten years. I
                        was treated by many physicians, but grew worse until I was seldom able to go
                        out in cold weather.</p>
                    <p>“About one year ago I was advised to try Peruna, which I did, and 1 am now

                    <p>“Peruna is a necessity in our home. With the first symptoms of a cold we use
                        it, and are never afflicted with catarrh.</p>
                    <p>“I advise all who are afflicted with catarrh to try Peruna. There is
                        certainly nothing equal to it as a catarrh medicine.”</p>

                    <p>Notwithstanding Dr. Hartman’s busy professional career, he still continues to
                        be Interested in farming. He Is the owner and manager of one of the largest

                        appointment does not gain unqualified approval on the grounds, as has been
                        already pointed out in these notes, that the forces are top widely scattered
                        for one general to control in war time, apart from the endless complications
                        that would ensue in combined naval and military operations. The situation in
                        Morocco seems to be the prime factor in the new appointment.</p>

                    <p>Recruiting latterly has been very good, but the usual leakage of men to the
                        Reserve is going on steadily. In turn, the Reserve is steadily increasing,
                        and the anticipated figures of 120,000 men at the close of the year may be
                        realised. The home battalions are maturing the men for the drafts in the
                        coming season, for it seems that there will be no great change in the time
                        honoured procedure of leaving the home battalions like squeezed lemons.</p>
                    <p>There will be no further changes amongst the battleships and cruisers of the
                        Mediterranean Fleet this year, as their commissions will carry them over to
                        next year.</p>
