                        <head> The Rise in House Rent. </head>
                        <p>The excessive and continuons rise in honse rent in Alexandria and Cairo,
                            in the face of an acute financial crisis, is one of the economic
                            mysteries of Egypt. The same sort of thing has of late been going on at
                            Naples - where the inhabitants have adopted a drastic method of solving
                            the difficulty. Naples is.in the throes of something very closely
                            resembling civil war owing to the rise of house-rent, which has been
                            artificially pnt up by a syndicate of builders. Nearly 6,000 people have
                            refused not only to pay their rent, but even to leave their houses, and
                            the number of these passive resisters is so large that it is. impossible
                            to dislodge them. Now the authorities have decided to evict them by
                            force. The garrison has been reinforced hy 500 soldiers, 1,000
                            carabiniers, and 250 police men, to meet all possible emergencits. </p>

                        <p>Towards nine p m. on Friday week the German Levarit Line's S.S. "Milos,"
                            of Hamburg, was signalled in distress and on fire five miles westward of
                            Ushant Light. The Maritime Pre- fecture immediately ordered Torpedo-boat
                            170 to proceed to the assistance of the "Milos," and three steamers and
                            several fishing-boats also went to help her. Eight men belonging to the
                            crew were still on board, but twelve others had taken to a boat, and
                            nothing has since been seen of them. On the following day, north of
                            Moléme, the Hull steamer "Douro" tovk the "Milos" in tow, with the
                            object of bringing her to Brest; but after encountering serious
                            difficulties was compelled to relinquish the attempt, the tow rope
                            having been burned. It is feared that the "Milos," before she can be
                            towed into safety, will run upon the rocks and become a total wreck.
                            Lifeboats have gone in search of the twelve missing sailors, but it is
                            feared that they have perished.</p>

                    <p>(Gazette's Special Service).</p>
                    <p>London, Tuesday. The former Roman Deputy. Signor Ostini, in the last number
                        of the "Rivista Coloniale," makes an. interesting comparison between England
                        in Egypt and Italy in Erythrea. He holds up Lord Cromer's administration to
                        the admiration of his own countrymen, stating that Lord Cromer's foremost
                        aim was to gain the confidences of the native population, and he eulogised
                        his great public works in the protection of the small native proprietor
                        against the foreign capitalist, and his financial policy. He further remarks
                        that in less than a quarter of a century Egypt has passed from bank- ruptcy
                        to a state of prosperity such as no other purely agricultural country of the
                        old world has attained. He proceeds to point oat to public opinion that
                        Italy still regards the Red Sea colony with suspicion, due to the errors and
                        disasters of the past. Yet, under the | ministration of the late Governor
                        Martini, Erythrea had made considerable progress, and would have made more

                    <p>REX v. CANNON.</p>
                    <p>The last case to be heard at the Alexandria sessions of the Supreme Consular
                        Court came on for hearing this morning. It is of interest as it is the first
                        case of the trial of an English- man for the murder of another Englishman
                        that has come before the Cons" larCoart within. living memory. Mr. Whitworth
                        was counsel. for the accused, Thomas Cannon, who has been in Hadra Prison
                        since the 24th October, when he was arrested by Mr. Blattner, the
                        Superintendent of the Port City Police at Alexandria. The prosecution was
                        conducted by Mr. Preston, the Crown Prosecutor for Egypt. </p>
                    <p>The crime was committed on board a petroleum steamer, the 'Baku Standard" at
                        Alexandria at about 1 a.m. on the 24th October last. Cannon cut the throat
                        of a fellow fireman, named Henry King, who on his return to England was to
                        have married. The Captain and several officers of the S.S. "Baku Standard"
                        arrived on the 10th inst. from England by the S.S. "Heliopolis" in order to
                        attend the trial. Several fireman belonging to the same steamer have been
                        detained at the Sailors' Home at Alexandria since the crime in order to give
                        evidence before the Court. </p>

                    <p>Miss Janet Lewis has returned for her se: cond winter in Cairo, and is
                        already exhibit- ing a few of her charming sketches in the salon of M. Zola,
                        the well-known photographer, in Sharia Manakh. Miss Lewis has had the.
                        advantage of a thorough training in art, for after her early education at
                        South Kensington she spent three years of real hard work in Paris, where she
                        studied under Jean Paul Laurem the late Benjamin Constant and other well
                        known masters. Shé has studied in Holland, and has done good work in the
                        best studies, and has exhibited in the Paris salon. Her sketches are but few
                        in number, but they show real signs of c'everness and originality. They ate
                        spontaneous in expression and good in colouring, and Miss Lewis has a very
                        happy faculty for reproducing those clean, soft effects which cast so much
                        aglamour over Egyptian scenes. Very noticeable in this respect is the sketch
                        of the sheikh's Tomb at Old Cairo, altogether an admirable bit of work, and
                        the clean fresh treatment of the river bank of Ghizeh is also well worth
                        mention.: The series entitled "The Wayside Restaurant," "Pickle | shop," and
                        "Drapers shop" showmore ambitious composition, but they are very ,happily
                        con- ceived and are executed with nite judgment of detail and colour. The
                        most important of these sketches on show is that ofa street in Old Cairo,
                        somewhat sombre m tone, but very able in its treatment. Miss Lewis is
                        collecting material for a small exhibition in Piccadilly next spring, but
                        prices are attached to her sketches now on view which should do much to make
                        them popular. Miss Lewis is also a miniature painter of considerable suoces
                        and is prepared to undertake portraits from photographs or personal sittings

                        Development— The "D" level south has advanced 5 ft., making a total distance
                        of 103 ft. from the main shaft vrosseut. Driving in this level was stopped
                        on 3rd October. Wince C.8. 2 has been started at a distance of 45 ft. north
                        from No, 1 shaft, and at the end of the month had been sank to a depth of 20
                        ft. below ''C" level. The reef carries an average value of 4.1 dwts per ton
                        over an average width of 40.5 ins (The portion of this winze sunk during the
                        present month shows an improvement in both the value and width of the reef.)
                        Stoping—The ore stoped during - month amounted to 710.9 .tons,° this being
                        obtained from the C and D blocks. Mil ling—During ethe month the 10- -stampt
                        mill treated 1,100 tons of ore, which yielded 299,446 ozs fine gold,

                        <p> "L'Africaine" was the first intimation of failure in the company, not so
                            much from Mlle | Robertson's unfortunate errors in the septet, but from
                            the apparent inability of anyone to put her right, and save the
                            situation. Mlle Robertson-one cannot escape from the factsang very
                            badly, and was hopelessly out of tune, but she should never have had the
                            part, and she gave the impression that she disliked it. She should not
                            be judged by it. · I cannot agree with the opinion of those who praised
                            Mme Magne and M. Soubeyran true, Mme Magne was as correct as usual, but
                            except for a moment or two in the second act, I. she was by no means
                            impressive ; M. Soubeyran, in his more forceful moments displayed
                            compass and tone, but in the 'piano' passages he was practically
                            inaudible; no doubta critio in one of the first five rows may have heard
                            and esteemed certain shades of expression inandible to those in the last
                            rows of the stalls. Certainly some of the praises I read earned a seat
                            in high places ! M. Valette was admirable in the 'Batlade' and deserved
                            his encore, but for the rest he was less impressive than usual. M.
                            Coiglio, as Don Pedro, was praised, but he seemed to me,-1 must confess
                            it-timeless, crude, and devoid of vigour I notice that his good acting
                            is mentioned ; perhaps the characteristics I mention ed suit the part of
                            the nervous commander of an ill fated expedition. The chorus was again
                            really excellent, instinct with decision, force, and accuracy, far more
                            so than the orchestra ; and some of the voices seemed unusually good. |
                            Indeed it seems as though the chorus this </p>
                        <p> year will prove the main stay of the operatic season ; except for M.
                            Valette and Mlle Gene </p>
                        <p> vois (in her special parts) the promise is not | phenomenal-good,

                        <p> the harrowing discords of last year, but distinctly provincial. I
                            anticipate Don Juan and, Lohengrin with mixed 'feetings. Of course
                            L'Africaine' is not the opera one would choose to show off the best
                            points of a company ; it is long pretentious, and uninteresting except
                            for a few places, and eveu these seem inappropriate; </p>
                        <p> it is distinctly Mid-Viotorian and to carry it off | the soloists must
                            be super-excellent. Still we </p>

                        <p>Yet another: excellent piece of work was "Traviata," and in many respects
                            far more suited to the company, than the pieces they have so far given,
                            (though it is not the first performance of "Traviata" by this company).
                            | Mlle. Genevois has a most charming voice, clear, flexible, rather full
                            for a light soprano, with certain very telling intonations in the middlo
                            register. Her singing in the second act was all that could be hoped for.
                            Mr. Flachat, when roused to efforts of passion or delicasy, is also most
                            pleasing. At his best he should be really delightful : he was not always
                            definite, and seemed to hesitate over his effects at times. M. Gorins,
                            as the father, sang with great truth but rather too much sustained
                            vigour. The chorus was as before, unusually good. What a reliet it is
                            see nice costumes ; "talou rouge", periwigs and all the aceessories are
                            each an improvement on the Mid-Victorian costume now again adopted in

                    <p> NATIONALISM AND JUSTICE. </p>
                    <p> The recent Press Case at Cairo has bad a deplorable effect on Europeans in
                        Egypt, as the decision of the Court was generally recognised to have not
                        been free from politieal influences. The latest issue of the "African World"
                        contains an instructive analysis of the case by a Cairo correspondent, from
                        which we extract the following : </p>
                    <p> Justice was dominated by political passion, the judge being a Nationalist,
                        while the accused journalists were Syrians and Copts well known as ardent
                        Anglophiles, and therefore hated by the more fanatical of the Egyptian
                        Nationalists. Not only was the sentence severe, bat, it afforded an
                        opportunity for rejoicings on the part of the Nationalists, who gave a
                        banquet in honour of the judge, at which function, I am reliably informed,
                        'Temarkable toasts were drunk to the over-throw of the Oecupation l' Hence
                        the Nationalists Press, sotnated by the same hatred and the same fealiogu of
                        joy, took advantage of the occasion. to publish the text of the judgment 'in
                        extenso', as well as a French translation thereof, which was designedly
                        inaccurate. </p>
                    <p> The above-mentioned facts show &amp; deplorable state of affairs. First, the
                        liberty of the Press, which, according to Lord Cromer, is in Egypt "a
                        guarantee that no abuse of authority shall pass unnoticed," has been rudely
                        shaken by a judgment which will render henceforth impossible the publication
                        of any criticism opon, or information unfavourable to, public
                        functionaries—&amp; state of things that appro aches to the Oriental
                        conceptions of freedom of conscience and publie opinion. </p>
                    <p> These journalists did not merely seek to incriminate a police official. By
                        mentioning, one in particular they endeavoured 'to draw public attention to
                        certain abuses that were suspected. But, as I have already said, the
                        principal evil is not the technical wrongs and errors coinmitted by the
                        Pressmen. Generous principles are more to be considered : "the liberty of
                        the Press and the liberty of native justice. In this connection it may be
                        per-1. missible to quote the Comte de Collato, a doctor of laws, who has
                        devoted a pamphlet to the case :- "The first quality of a people that
                        aspires to self-government is to know how to render justice even to its
                        adversaries. For the work ing of all other branches of the public
                        administration the Occupation is in reality rezponsible. The law courts are
                        autonomous. Therein three natives freely exercise, according to their
                        consciences, full power as to the lives and property of their
                        fellow-countrymen. These tribunals, therefore, constitute a permanent
                        attempt at self-government. If the Egyptians show themselves incapable of
                        rendering justice without prejudice, how shall they claim the right to levy
                        and disburse taxes, to regulate the franchise, to administer the property of
                        the State, etc. ?" </p>
                    <p> It is quite certain that since this affair mistrust of the Egyptian
                        magistracy has penetrated into the European colonies. We have evidence to
                        show that the foreign diplomatic agents have informed their respective
                        Governments concerning this new difficulty which has suddenly sprung up in
                        the way of Reform of the Capitolations in Egypt. More substantial guarantees
                        will be demanded by the colonies, for the abandonment of their penal
                        immunity The unknown factor in the Reform will'not be the police alone. The
                        introduction proposed by Lord Cromer-of a Habeas Corpus Act into the penal
                        legislation as to Europeans in Egypt seems no longer sufficient to guarantee
                        the colonies against abuse of power by politician judges. And the net result
                        of the affair is to postpone the coming of self-government in Egypt, a
                        postponement for which the Nationalists are entirely responsible. </p>

                    <head> CAIRO WATER COMMISSION.</head>
                    <p> Now that it is practically an understood thing that the special Water
                        Commission, appointed by the Government to report upon the water of the Rod
                        el Farag wells, have submitted a favourable report to the Authorities, &amp;
                        contemporary proceeds, as indeed it might be expected to proceed, to attempt
                        to destroy confidence in the finding of the Commission by delating upon the
                        dread loss of hair 'which will follow the continued drinking of these
                        waters. </p>
                    <p> Indeed the whole thing, Commission, report and all is apparently looked upon
                        by the journal in question as a colossal farce, designed by the Government
                        in order to throw dust in the eyes of the public, for it affirms that the
                        Government do not wish to change the water for two reasons ; "the microbes
                        that are found in the Nile waters, and the present financial embarrasment,"
                        and it further points out that "both reasons are groundless, for the
                        microbes can be avoided by filtration, and the Government can open credits
                        from its reserve funds." </p>
                    <p> Really these two last points are important and it is to be hoped that the
                        Government will only make note of them for future reference. </p>
                    <p> It was quite to be expected that, should the report prove to be of a
                        favourable nature, there would be many wise acres ready and willing to prove
                        that the report was false, but criticism of such a weak and pointless nature
                        was hardly anticipated </p>
