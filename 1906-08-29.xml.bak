                    <head>COMPANY LAW AMENDMENT.</head>
                    <p> In our previous articles on this subject we have dealt with the proposals of
                        the committee to meet the following points:— (a) The growing practice of
                        issuing companies without prospectus; (b) the registration outside the
                        United Kingdom of companies carrying on business in England, and appealing
                        to English investors; (c) the extension of the provisions of the Companies
                        Act of 1900 in regard to the registration of mortgages and charges, so as to
                        include all mortgages and charges, as well those created before as after 1st
                        January, 1905. We have now to deal with:— (d) The amendment of Table A in
                        the first schedule of the Act of 1862. We should explain that in the Act of
                        1862 it was thought advisable to include a specimen set of articles which
                        embodied all that was at that time considered necessary or desirable for the
                        regulation of the details for the internal management of limited companies
                        as such, and that (unless excluded by by special articles) these articles
                        appended to the Act should apply to all companies registered under the Act.
                        At first this statutory form was generally adopted with some special
                        articles added, but gradually it has become obsolete, partly in consequence
                        of its being incomplete, and partly because it is inappropriate and does not
                        meet the excellent regulations of the London Stock Exchange.</p>
                    <p>The Committee now report “that the time has come for amending Table A so as
                        to bring it up to date, and as far as practicable render it available for
                        use without being supplemented by voluminous supplemental regulations.”
                        Following up this proposal in a prompt and business-like manner the
                        Committee recommended the Board of Trade to at once make use of their powers
                        under the Act of 1862 to issue a new form to be substituted for Table A. To
                        their credit be it said, the Board of Trade lost no time in submitting to
                        the Committee a proposed new form, which with certain modifications the
                        Committee considered could with advantage be adopted. This new Table A has
                        now been officially published in the “London Gazette” of the 31st of July,
                        and all companies registered from the 30th September next will be within its
                        pro- visions. The new form has been drafted by Mr. Parker and Mr. Clauson
                        upon the business-like lines adopted by the Committee, i.e., in a manner to
                        meet the practical wants of the business community. It is not retrospective,
                        but companies who adopted the original Table A would do well to substitute
                        the new table, which they can do by moans of a special resolution. It is
                        impossible in the compass of this article to even name the many alterations
                        found in the substituted table, but those of importance are (a) Clause 3,
                        which gives power to issue preferred, deferred shares, or shares with
                        special rights and restrictions; (b) Clause 4, which gives powers by
                        three-fourths majority in writing, or with sanction of an extraordinary
                        resolution to be passed at a separate general meeting of holders (not less
                        than one-third present) of the shares of the class, to vary the rights
                        attached to any class of shares; (c) these clauses (9 to 11) which give the
                        company a lien on their shares, and the clauses referring to the alteration
                        of capital and “share warrants.”</p>
                    <p>There is no question as to the utility of these changes, which tend to widen
                        the discretion of directors, and to prevent legal obstructions hitherto
                        severely felt. For instance many companies are in an impasse as regards
                        Founders’ and other special shares which they are not able to deal with to
                        the interest of the shareholders in general. Others are suffering from not
                        being able to issue shares with special or limited rights. Again, the lien
                        on shares will enable companies to deal promptly and effectually with those
                        who are behindhand in paying calls, and meets a widely-felt want. It is to
                        be hoped that a large number of companies will pass the necessary
                        resolutions to enable them to adopt this revised Table A., as uniformity is
                        most desirable so that the decisions of the courts should be a guide to all.
                        We commend these changes to all directors of Limited Companies, who should
                        lose no time in dealing with so important a matter. If the change is made
                        now in company with many others, so to speak, under the auspices of the
                        Board of Trade much difficulty may be saved in the future. </p>

                            lamp he was carrying set fire to a tin of the spirit, and before he knew
                            where he was, the unhappy man was set about with flames and was badly
                            burnt. The fire was checked in time.</p>

                            Garden” in the wrestling matches between Messrs. Bazzarini and Williams,
                            both experts in the art. The second evening’s straggle took place last
                            night, and excitement rose to a high pitch, both men being lustily
                            cheered and encourage by their respective backers. Two bouts were
                            engaged in. The first was a severe tussle, and Williams was thrown
                            heavily, but managed to roll over, thus saving himself from being
                            completely “downed.” In the second bout some very severe handling took
                            place, but ultimately Williams was again cleverly thrown, and Bazzarini,
                            amidst tremendous excitement, was declared the victor. The variety
                            entertainment was up to the usual standard, and comprised several

                        <head>PRINCE'S LAST MOMENTS.</head>
                        <p> Telegraphing from Thiberville on Monday week, the correspondent of the
                            “New York Herald” says The operation of trepanning on Prince Mohamed
                            Ibrahim was carried out at the hospital of Bernay in the night of
                            Saturday to Sunday.</p>
                        <p>For some hours after the operation there was a slight improvement in his
                            condition, but this did not last, and at half-past four in the afternoon
                            of Sunday he succumbed, without having recovered consciousness. All the
                            family is at Bernay and will remain there until the body is removed to
                            Paris. From Paris the remains will be conveyed to Cairo for burial.</p>
                        <p>It has been stated that the collision of the automobile of Prince Mohamed
                            Ibrahim was with a tramcar, not with a train. This is not so. At the
                            same time it should be stated that the place where the accident happened
                            is not a level crossing in the strict sense of the word. The railway
                            from Corneilles to Bernay runs alongside the public road and is crossed
                            by the Paris-Trouville road near Thiberville.</p>
                        <p>On the latter road the Touring Clhb bas put up a notice board 200 metres
                            from the point where the two roads cross. But this is difficult to see,
                            as there is a row of trees on either side of the road. This passage,
                            therefore, constitutes a danger.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Etable had a narrow escape in April last at this point, his carriage
                            being almost run into by an automobile travelling in the same direction
                            as that of Prince Mohamed Ibrahim. The danger was so acute that the
                            automobile, in avoiding the doctor’s carriage, crashed into a tree.</p>
                        <p>Commenting on the accident, the “Herald” says: - With regard to the
                            particular spot where the Prince lost his life, there is unanimous
                            feeling that it is an exceedingly dangerous one, probably the most
                            dangerous on the Paris Trouville road. M. Charley, who is in the habit
                            of making the run to Trouville and back many times during the season,
                            says he considers the warning signs totally inadequate. It is not until
                            the driver is right on the level crossing that he observes the sign
                            warning him of the situation.</p>
                        <p>At this point, or rather many yards before it is reached, M. Charley
                            contends that a huge notice should be displayed similar to road signs
                            found in America, which no driver could fail to observe and act upon.
                            Several times at this point, he declares, he has been within a few
                            inches of losing his life. The train shoots across the road without any
                            more warning than a bell, which is inaudible to those travelling quickly
                            in the neighbourhood.</p>

                        <p>While Lord Cromer is seeking to abolish the capitulations in Egypt, the
                            Congo Reform Association has addressed an appeal to Sir Edward Grey,
                            signed by forty British missionaries now resident in England, urging the
                            assumption of consular jurisdiction in the Congo Free State, in order to
                            protect British subjects, on the ground that from their experiences on
                            the spot of the Congo judiciary, they realise that in proceedings
                            against a British subject it is almost impossible to obtain independent
                            witnesses, owing to the intimidation of the State. Even if the judiciary
                            on the Congo were removed fom the control of the executive, freedom
                            would be but nominal, because, although judical decisions might possibly
                            be free from executive control, the facilities for arriving at those
                            decisions must remain in the hands of the executive. They ask that an
                            early opportunity may be found to place their appeal before the
                            Government. </p>

                        <head>LAUNCH OF NEW STERN-WHEELER.</head>
                        <p> Yesterday afternoon, a representative of the “Gazette” assisted at the
                            launching of the first of two new stern wheel steamers which the Hamburg
                            and Anglo-American Nile Co. are building for passenger traffic on the
                            Nile.</p>
                        <p>The vessels of this company have been well known for many years to those
                            who have made the delightful journey to Assouan and Wady Halfa by river
                            as being particularly comfortable and well-found in all respects, but
                            the company appears to have no wish to rest on the laurels which it has
                            earned, being moved by a laudable, if somewhat ambitious, desire to
                            eclipse in the present two steamers any other boats which they have on
                            the Nile. These two boats are, therefore, being fitted up in a most
                            luxurious style, regardless of expense. The dining saloons, ladies’
                            saloons, and smoking rooms are to have Louis XVI. electric fittings,
                            moulded ceilings, and furniture both artistic and comfortable. The
                            cabins, which are exceptionally spacious and airy, will be fitted with
                            brass bunks of the latest pattern, and, what will rejoice the hearts of
                            lady passengers—ample accommodation for hanging dresses and the like. A
                            very liberal proportion of these cabins are single, for the benefit of
                            those who desire seclusion.</p>
                        <p>The vessel, which was launched yesterday and christened the Nubia with
                            due eremony by Mrs. E. C. Porter, the popular wife of the manager of the
                            Nile Engine Works attached to the company, is the smaller of the two new
                            boats. She has accommodation for some forty-two passengers and is
                            destined for the service between Assouan and Wady Halfa, where she will
                            run in connection with the company’s boats from Cairo. She has an
                            over-all length of 130 feet and is fitted with very powerful compound
                            surface condensing engines. The tore part of the main deck is devoted to
                            the boilers, which are of the locomotive type, and the kitchens, cold
                            rooms, and offices. The engine-room is in the stern, and amidships will
                            be the luxurious dining room. The middle deck carries the smoking room
                            and some of the cabins, while ample space is provided for promenade. On
                            the upper deck are more state rooms and the ladies’ saloon. On this deck
                            there is also a magnificent free space forward fitted with a wind screen
                            where passengers may sit in comfort and admire the splendid views of the
                            country which are unfolded as the vessel passes on her way. The sanitary
                            arrangements are on the latest principles, with spacious bathrooms on
                            each deck.</p>
                        <p>A great deal of consideration and forethought has been expended in
                            ensuring the safety of the passengers, as well as their comfort, and to
                            this end the vessel will be supplied with the most modern fire
                            appliances, with specially strengthened hull and water-tight
                            compartments, and with an efficient system of filtration for drinking
                            water.</p>
                        <p>We can honestly compliment the company on having placed on the Nile a

                        <p>The London Tribune” of Wednesday last says :—The new twin screw steamer
                            Osmanieh, constructed on the Tyne to meet the demand for first-class
                            Mediterranean service, has just returned from her test trials in the
                            North Sea. Weather conditions were unfavourable, but the big ship proved
                            excellently seaworthy, and exceeded her guaranteed speed by half a knot.
                            In her final run from the Tyne to Southampton her average speed was
                            sixteen knots.</p>
                        <p>Sir Auckland Colvin, the chairman of her owner, the Khedivial Mail
                            Steamship Company, gave the guests on board some details of the progress
                            made by the company since they took over the line of steamers from the
                            Khedivial Government. They had encountered difficulties, but had fought
                            hard and had won, and although they had received no assistance from
                            their Motherland, they clung to her, and their fleet carried the British
                            flag.</p>
                        <p>Alexandria, Constantinople, and Athens will be the willing ports of the
                            Osmanieh, which will maintain a weekly service, and will carry mai's. In
                            addition to accommodating 144 first class and 76 second-class
                            passengers, she has an imperial suite of cabins especially intended for
                            Eastern potentates, and furnished in exquisite style. There are spacious
                            dining, drawing, and smoking rooms, and also capacity for carrying 2,000

                        <head>MUMMIES AND TUBERCULOSIS.</head>
                        <p>A remarkable theory has been started by Dr. Rafaelle Sorgnac, who holds
                            that the great spread of tuberculosis and consumption throughout Europe
                            and America in the past one hundred years found its causation in the
                            disinterment and shipment broadcast over the land of the mummies which
                            had reposed for thousands of years in the tombs of the Pharaoh.</p>
                        <p>That the disinterred mummies started the spread of tuberculosis germs in
                            Egypt, he says, cannot be doubted. There are more tuberculosis germs in
                            the almost impalpable dust around a mummy case than in many cspidors of
                            effluvia.</p>
                        <p>These germs live for thousands of years, as has easily been proved, and
                            the exhumation of the bodies, even the well preserved ones, caused an
                            epidemic of consumption among the workmen and scholars who first exhumed
                            the cases.</p>
                        <p>It is also well known that the keepers of the mummy cases have been
                            subject to the disease.</p>
                        <p>The start of tuberculosis in France in a serious sense may be traced to
                            the great importation of mummies and mummy cases at the time of the
                            Napoleonic invasion of Egypt, and this start gave the disease its first
                            great foothold in Europe, whence it has spread all over the Eastern
                            World and throughout the Western Hemisphere as well.</p>
                        <p>Dead bodies may not secrete the germs, but the bodies preserved in the
                            manner peculiar to the Egyptians of the time of the Pharaohs are
                            undoubtedly favourite lodging places for the tubercular bacilli. The
                            bacilli from the mummies are undoubtedly of great age and it has been
                            shown by experiments in Paris that these aged bacilli are infinitely
                            more deadly than those obtained from the sputum of live persons who are
                            infected.</p>

                        <p>A Syrian survivor of the wreck of the Florio-Rubattino S.S. Sirio, which
                            sank recently in the Atlantic, has arrived at Alexandria, and has given
                            an account of the catastrophe. The first and second class passengers, he
                            said, were all drowned, except a gentleman and a lady, because they were
                            all asleep when the steamer capsized and sank. The Syrian passengers on
                            board the Syria were 50 in number, of whom 16 were drowned. The latter
                            are natives of Beyrout, Damascus, Nasira, and Iskandaroun.</p>
                        <p>The gentleman states that a number of little children were devoured by

                        <head>REPORT FOR 1905.</head>
                        <p>The gross earnings of the telegraphs during 1905 and their comparisons
                            with those of 1904 were respectively L.E. 101,304 and L.E. 83,674. These
                            gross earnings were derived from message traffic : L.E. 74,063 in 1904
                            and L.E. 93,596 in 1905 ; and contributions, such as subventions, annual
                            taxes, and terminals.</p>
                        <p>There has been a slight falling off in the number of European telegrams,
                            but a considerable increase in the number of Arabic and interchanged
                            messages. The increase in the total number of telegrams is 164,579, of
                            which 158,630 are Arabic.The receipts of the trunk telephone lines show
                            an increase of L.E. 305 over the previous year. By the employment of an
                            electrical device, a third or superimposed circuit has been obtained on
                            the Cairo- Alexandria trunk lines, and the pressure which was thrown on
                            the two circuits during periods of Stock Exchange activity has, thereby,
                            been sensibly relieved.</p>
                        <p>The receipts for local messages in 1905 have been considerably augmented
                            by a sum of L.E. 11,925 due from the Ottoman Administration, of which
                            L.E. 6,397 should have figured in the receipts for 1903 and 1904. The
                            remaining L.E. 5,528 may be considered as money earned in 1905, and the
                            actual increase in receipts for message traffic is therefore L.E.
                            13,136. The number of words transmitted for Renter’s and Havas’ Agencies
                            was 903,139. There was a slight decrease in the number of service
                            telegrams, which tends to show that, although the traffic is increasing,
                            efforts are being made to reduce the number of unnecessary service
                            messages.</p>
                        <p>The reduction in the amount of “Subvention” is in consequence of a
                            modification of the agreement between the Government and the Eastern
                            Telegraph Company, which came into operation on 1st August, 1905,
                            whereby, in consideration of a reduction in the Company’s rates between
                            Egypt and Europe, the Government consented to reduce the amount of
                            “Subvention” formerly paid by the Eastern Telegraph Company.</p>
                        <p>The working expenses were L E. 74,707, as against L.E. 59,076 in 1901.
                            This gives an increase of L.E. 15,631, a large proportion of which was
                            absorbed by increases of salaries, and by improving the situation of the
                            lower grades of the staff. During the year, 638 kilometres of new wire
                            was erected, including new lines between Galioub and Zagazig ; Cairo and
                            Benha ; Ismailia and Port Said ; Abou Kebir and Mansoarah ; Tantah and
                            Athmoun ; Boulac Dacrour and Maghaghs, and Boulac- Dacrour and
                            Beni-Souef.</p>
                        <p>The following lines have also been duplexed:— Cairo Port Said;
                            Cairo-Zagazig; Cairo-Tantah; Alexandria-Tantah; Cairo-Assiout, and
                            Cairo- Halfa.By the duplexing of the last named wire, the department has
                            been enabled to cope with the increasing traffic with the Sudan.</p>
                        <p>Seven new offices have been opened at Faw. Tarh, Bousseily, Sayala,
                            Denshal, Mena, House and Kagoug,and three offices at Nagada Mit-
                            el-Absi, and Pont Limoun have been closed. There has been a general
                            improvement in the working of the department. The measures taken during
                            the year to improve the conditions of service are already making their
                            effect felt.</p>
                        <p>The department has been considerably handcapped by shortness of staff. At
                            the dose of the year, however, the Telegraph School was nearly full, and
                            it is hoped that in the course of a year sufficient pupils will pass out
                            to adequately strengthen the staff. There has been a large decrease in
                            the number of “urgent” telegrams, which points to an improvement in the
                            transmission of ordinary messages.</p>

                            the latest issue of the “North American Review.” He remarks :</p>
                        <p>“The prevalent notion that Mohamedan women are very materially restricted
                            in their property relations—that, in fact, they are little better than
                            slaves, possessed of few rights which man is bound to respect—is quite
                            erroneous. In general terms, “woman’s rights” in respect to property and
                            material possessions of pecuniary value exist in the largest sense among
                            Mohamedan people, and have so prevailed for many centuries. In fact,
                            Mohamedan women, whether single or married, are absolutely free in
                            respect to property relations.”</p>

                        <p>Sir,—In reference to the great and noble work which Miralai Hopkinson Bey
                            is doing in trying to stamp out immorality in Alexandria, I should like
                            to point out that it would be advisable if any practical good is to
                            result for the authorities to come to a decision to adopt a system of
                            licensing as is done in many parts of Europe. The greatest tact and
                            caution must be used, and I was much surprised to read of the police
                            methods stigmatised in the letter of "Observer” in your issue of
                            Saturday last If Miralai Hopkinson Bey pursues his campaign against
                            sexual vice he will obtain the lasting gratitude of all good men in
                            Alexandria, but at the same time he should take precautions to see that
                            the zeal of his lieuenants does not outstrip the limits of
                            discretion.</p>
                        <p>Up to now matters have been more or less at a standstill became the
                            International Society at Alexandria for the Suppression of the White
                            Slave Traffic as not been managed in a satisfactory manner owing to the
                            fact that the chief executive employe of the society, the late
                            secretary, was not the man for the delicate work that was entrusted to
                            him to do.</p>
                        <p>The Alexandria City Police ought to have taken up the matter many years
                            ago, and I have for years and years past been urging the police to
                            seriously start a crusade. However, better late than never, and new that
                            Miralai Hopkinson Bey has shown himself a zealous supporter of sexual
                            propriety in Alexandria, it is to be hoped that the good work will never
                            slacken until Alexandria has been freed from its great reproach of one
                            of the most immoral cities on the shores of the Mediterranean.— I am,
                            etc.</p>

                        <div type="item"> <p>Sir,—The terrible state of affairs prevailing in Alexandria could he
                            easily stopped if the following regulations were laid down by Miralai
                            Hopkinson Bey, the Consular Corps, and the Municipality :—</p>
                        <p>1. Every owner or tenant of a house who lets or sub-lets apartments to a
                            demimondaine should be fined £10 for the first offence, £100 for the
                            second offence, and if convicted a third time his property should be
                            confiscated for the benefit of the town.</p>
                        <p>2. Every person, who is the owner, lessee, manager, eta, of a place of
                            amusement, bar, cafe, or other public resort, who admits demimondaines,
                            should be fined £10 for each woman who is found entering and in the care
                            of a second offence the place should be permanently closed.</p>
                        <p>If some such stringent regulations were adopted the moral pest which now
                            invades Alexandria would soon be a thing of the past, and Miralai
                            Hopkinson Bey would gain lasting fame as the great reformer of the
                            morals of Alexandria. — I am, etc.,</p>

                            up the peasants, and are succeeding beyond all expectations.

                        <p>Beneath Pompey’s Pillar a strange and awful incense ascends into God’s
                            pure heaven. It is the night offering to the Altar of Human Misery and
                            Abomination, whose high-priest wafts it, if the votary bribe him
                            sufficiently with bakshish, to the gods of Apathy and Selfishness who
                            have their thrones in the Pantheon of Alexandria’s Babylon. That incense
                            has been rising into the air during the ages ; its sacrificial offering
                            is a traditional ceremony ; and day by day, night by night, the high
                            priest is at his wonted post, of which he has the perpetual curacy.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="bold">The Silent Sphinx.</hi></p>
                        <p>A dusty lane skirts the Pillar grounds from the main street where the
                            Arab fruit sellers have their stalls to the summit of the mound on which
                            the monolith stands. Within the fence that divides the grounds from the
                            road crouches a sphinx, grey and grim in the scant light from the
                            distant street lamps. He had seen many strange things, that sphinx,
                            until the dust of centuries covered him; to-day, unveiled, he is a
                            witness to a state of civilization of which he had no ken, for the place
                            when he last surveyed it was the most noble quarter of the Roman city,
                            and breathed a wholesome atmosphere. Bat the Sphinx, like his brother
                            near Cheop’s Pyramid, has secrets and opinions that he keeps to himself,
                            and I could get nothing out of him. Possibly he could have told me much
                            about the past, but mine was a journey into modern sociology, of which
                            he could know but little. We therefore parted company : he for
                            reflexions of the past ; I for impressions of the living present.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="bold">Oil-Tin Hovel.</hi></p>
                        <p>As I neared the summit, in pitchy darkness, I stopped for a moment to
                            recover breath and plan my further movements. Close by me there appeared
                            what in the uncertain gloom looked like a pile of discarded petroleum
                            tins. A whiff of smoke, however, showed that I was mistaken. It came,
                            not from the chimney, but from an opening in which a whole family were
                            crowded closely together, round a miserable fire; the father, a
                            disreputable looking coal heaver with unwashed hands, was frying
                            aubergines ; the woman was attempting to quiet a sickly babe, and
                            besides the other children there were one or two men folk ; all huddled
                            together in a space of the size of a bathroom.</p>
                        <p>The hovel was thatched with sacking, tinsheets, and rotting prim branches
                            ; the discarded and rusty oilcans were filled with earth and kept in
                            position by daubs of mud.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="bold">A Child's Cry.</hi></p>
                        <p>Quitting this scene of desolation, I turned into a goat’s walk where some
                            Municipal attempt had been made to number the houses ; where the tin
                            placards failed, chalk figures were made instead. At various points I
                            had to step over, or walk aside of some heap of reeking offal where cats
                            were fighting over some more cherished tit-bit; or, as often happened,
                            to avoid the body of some vagabond sleeper, sprawled on a filthy mat
                            across the narrow thoroughfare ; corpse-like, he made no sound even
                            though I trod upon him.</p>
                        <p>As I groped my way I was arrested by a cry—one that went through my very
                            being — the wail of a lonely child. Following the direction of the
                            sound, I saw a flicker of light in the bowels of the earth. By its
                            feeble aid I could just distinguish the silhouette of a sheep, while
                            beneath its feet lay the lone child of poverty, huddled together in rags
                            upon the same straw as the animal, which as it moved about had probably
                            trodden the wee mite, and caused it to cry out in pain or terror. The
                            mother was at the corner engaged in a hot quarrel with her husband, and
                            her screams had collected the neighbours, no less slatternly than
                            herself. A ghaffir looked on. It was a woman’s affair, though he, and so
                            why should he interfere? And with an oath he entered a qualid café and
                            began to interest himself in a game of gamar— or draughts. My thoughts
                            all the while had returned to the wailing child. Poor miserable babe!
                            Who knows of your offerings during the day when you are turned out into
                            the sloppy street to be pestered by the flies, or daring the night, when
                            you are the prey of horrors that are nameless !</p>
                        <p><hi rend="bold">Unhallowed and Unleavened</hi>.</p>
                        <p>Emerging from the tense shadows of this track of stinks, I came upon
                            another spot of light : the village oven. Vividly in the glare of the
                            furnace stood a group of half-nake figures, with unwashed, unholy bodies
                            and souls. They were handling the Staff of Life Not the healthy white
                            bread of our table, but the evil-smelling Oriental chupatee, greasy and
                            of inferior quality flour. These were cast upon boards which bad never
                            known a dusting and which harboured the vermin of the Tropics. The mud
                            walls reeked with foetid moiture which, oozing from their blackened
                            surface, evaporated as it met the heat. Unhallowed and unleavened, the
                            product of this night’s industry would be distributed to the neighbours
                            on the morrow.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="bold">A Goat’s Diet.</hi></p>
                        <p>Disgusted with what I had seen, I hurried off, and traversing another
                            avenue of darkness, tripped on what I feared to be a large dog. It was
                            however a goat, and I had disturbed it while it stood feeding from a
                            heap of excrement. To-morrow that excrement would be milk for the babes
                            of Kom-es-Shoughafa !</p>
                        <p>The Poison Pool. Nor was the souk with its lighted booths any better. The
                            shops were none the cleaner than the dwellings behind them, and the
                            gaudy display could easily hide a multiplication of filth. The pavement
                            was of atone, where it had been of mud, and instead of absorbing,
                            carried off the swillings to points of collection. Thus trickling on to
                            a surface strewn with matter in various stages of decomposition, it
                            formed into an open cess, whose sole conduit was the action of the
                            morrow’s sun. In the meantime, aided by the hot, stifling air of night,
                            it was gradually fermenting, and giving vent to fumes that filled the
                            air-breathing pestilence everywhere.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="bold">Life and Death.</hi></p>
                        <p>I had had enough of the horrors of the jail to which these outcasts of
                            the human race are interned for life—and my voluntary imprisonment was
                            but for one half-hour. Hurriedly I retraced my footsteps to the summit
                            whence I had descended. Over the way, under the stars that are reserved
                            for the immortal souls of these tormented bodies, the white washed tombs
                            of the Arab cemetery loom invitingly beneath acacia and sycamore. Here
                            at least in the midst of death there are the decency and cleanliness
                            that are lacking in life : a remarkable contrast.</p>

                        <p>HORRORS IN THE YEMEN.</p>
                        <p>The grave news which was published in this column some time ago of the
                            grave state of affairs in the Yemen is more than confirmed by more
                            recent information from the province. The insurgent Arabs still remain
                            undefeated in the field ; while the Turks, harassed by ceaseless
                            guerrilla tactics, and wasted by disease, famine, and every species of
                            hardship which combine with the most horrible insanitation to ravage the
                            camps with pestilence, are reduced to a helpless condition. In one way
                            or another the almost incredible computation is made that more than
                            50,000 Turkish troops, mostly from Europe, have perished during the past
                            15 months,while the Syrian and Mesopotamian battalions are too
                            disaffected to be trusted for operations in the open against their
                            brother Arabs. Reservists are being embarked in large numbers at Smyrna
                            for the Yemen, though they are deceived into the belief that their
                            destination is Macedonia. The Turks still hold the Red Sea forts, and
                            can probably continue to do so, but the Arabs are masters in law.
                            Rumours begin to circulate that Italy meditates an active policy which
                            may create a sphere of influence in the Yemen</p>

                        <p>The “Morning Post” considers the situation in the Near East especially in
                            regard to the possibility of Great Britan initiating a policy which will
                            at once conduce to the restoration of order in the Balkans and
                            strengthen our own position with Turkey. The journal comes to the
                            conclusion that the situation is hardly favourable for suh
                            olcearly-defined action on the part of Great Britain It cannot be
                            claimed by the most optimistic that the intervention of the Powers has
                            proved a success. It has not secured the Macedonian Christians nor
                            improved the conditions of 1ife for any of the population, and it has
                            strengthened the hands of certain turbulent neighbouring Christian
                            States, who have lost no opportunity of stirring up trouble for the
                            Turks—still nominally responsible—to put down. . . . This being the case
                            and the difficulties of effecting an entire political reconstruction
                            being so great, it may well be worth while for Great Britain to consider
                            whether it would not be in the best interests of the countries most
                            directly concerned (though not convenient to others) to return to Lord
                            Beaconsfield’s declared policy of strengthening an ancient
                            Empire—essential to the maintenance of peace."</p>

                        <p>The traveller, says the “County Gentleman and Land and Water," who has to
                            make a long railway journey with bank notes or other valuables in his
                            possession, is often obsesed by the fear of loss through accident or
                            theft. It becomes necessary to keep an eye on every atom of luggage,
                            taking handbags eve into the dining car, should they contain anything of
                            special value. Why should it not be possible to set aside a compartment
                            in long-distance trains in which travellers might leave money, small
                            luggage. &amp;c., in a safe, under the care of responsible official ? As
                            a fee would in most cases be gladly paid, it is not likely that railway
                            companies would be tin losers by this arrangement. </p>

                        <head>THE ENGLISH IN EGYPT.</head>
                        <head>BY WILLAM JENNINGS BRYAN.</head>
                        <p>The Hon. William J. Bryan, the probable Democratic nominee for the
                            American Presidency, paid a visit to Egypt last season, and the
                            following are his impressions upon the political conditions of this
                            country.</p>
                        <p> The Government of Egypt defies definition. Nominally the Khedive is the
                            supreme authority, aided by a native Legislative Council and Assembly
                            (their business is to advise, however, rather than to legislate), but
                            back of the Khedive is Lord Cromer, the Agent and Consul-General of
                            England, whose power is undefined and almost unlimited. England’s
                            authority in Egypt rests upon the Articles of Capitulation signed after
                            the bombardment of Alexandria in 1882. In these articles it was
                            announced that England’s occupancy would be of brief duration, but in
                            1904 she secured from France, Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy
                            consent to postpone the fixing of a date for her withdrawal, she at the
                            same time announcing that it was not her intention to interfere with the
                            political situation in Egypt.</p>
                        <p>England’s reasons for remaining in Egypt are very dearly stated by Lord
                            Milner in his book entitled "England in Egypt.” He says: "On the one
                            hand, oar commercial interests in Egypt are so great and growing that
                            her prosperity, which would be immediately wrecked by misgovernment, is
                            a matter of concern to us. Secondly, and chiefly, the geographical
                            position of Egypt compels attention to her political condition. We have
                            nothing to gain by owning the country ourselves, but we should have a
                            great deal to fear from its falling into the possession of another
                            Power.</p>
                        <p>The second reason given by Lord Milner is emphasied by him and is
                            probably the paramount one—viz, that she cannot afford to have the
                            valley of the Nile held by a rival Power. Her interests in the Sudan ad
                            in India lead her to guard the Suez Canal with jealos care. Lord Milner
                            suggests as a reaso why England should remain in Egypt that her
                            withdrawal might be followed by such an abuse of government as to lead
                            to bankruptcy and French intervention. The old argument, “if we don’t do
                            it somebody else will,” is presented as the strongest support of British
                            interference.</p>
                        <p>English influence, however, has been less harmful in Egypt than in India,
                            and this is probably due, in the main, to two causes ; first, her
                            influence is exerted through a native government, whose authority she
                            acknowledges ; and second, because the interests which other nations
                            have in Egypt make them oppose any encroachments on the part of England,
                            while in India she has a freehand. As an illustratian I might cite the
                            fact that she compels the Indian to support the Indian army, while she
                            pays the ordinary expenses of the 3,000 British soldiers in Egypt, and
                            only asks Egypt to pay for the extraordinary expenses. It is no
                            reflection upon England to say that she is better for being watched. We
                            believe that in regard to our own public men, and it is simply a
                            recognition of the frailty of human nature. Lord Cromer has been in
                            Egypt for 26 years, and his reports indicate a desire to advance the
                            welfare of the people of Egypt, He has doubtless been helpful to the
                            Khedive. He has insisted upon honesty in the public service, and has
                            been a friend of education.</p>
                        <p>While the national debt contains a large amount of usurious interest and
                            is therefore much heavier than it ought to be, it has been funded at a
                            lower rate of interest, and is being gradually paid off. The debts that
                            are being incurred for the extension of irrigation will be more than
                            redeemed by the sale of the land reclaimed, and the country will then
                            have the benefit, not only of the reclaimed land but of the increased
                            value of lands indirectly benefited. Although the salt tax (contrary to
                            Lord Cromer’s advice) is still over 200 per cent, the per capita rate of
                            taxation has been reduced ; agricultural and postal banks have been
                            established, and the Government railway, telegraph, and telephone
                            systems have been extended. In his 1903 report Lord Cromer presents an
                            argument in favour of Government roads as against roads owned
                            privately.</p>
                        <p>The great danger that Egypt has to fear is the disinheritance of the
                            fellah and the alien ownership of the land. Unless great care is taken
                            Egypt will drift into the condition of Ireland and India and be drained
                            of her resources by foreign landlords. It is very difficult for a
                            foreign representative to arbitrate impartially between his own people
                            at home and the natives among whom he temporarily resides, and Lord
                            Cromer will deserve great credit if he is able to protect the Egyptians
                            from exploitation. However well meaning the English advisers are now or
                            hereafter may be, Egypt’s safety must lie in the development of her own
                            people. The legislative council understands this and insists upon the
                            extension of the school system. It is wise in so doing, for every
                            educated man or woman adds to the moral force that restrains and directs
                            the government.</p>
                        <p>An increase in the number of the educated not only tends to the
                            preservation of law and order, but furnishes a larger number fit to be
                            officials and thus lessens the excuse for the employment of foreigners.
                            There has been, among reformers, some discussion of a constitution, but
                            as that would curtail the powers of England, it would probably be
                            opposed at present by the Moslem leaders. </p>

                        <head>THE PAN-ISLAMIC BOGEY.</head>
                        <p>Sheikh Mushir Hosein Kidwai, joint secretary to the Pan-Islamic Society
                            has sent the following letter to the Morning Post:—</p>
                        <p>When I was leaving England about a month ago for a tour in Europe I
                            noticed in the English Press a great fuss about Pan Islamism, and by the
                            perusal f those papers here I see that that agitation is still
                            continuing, and you have published a leading article on Pan- Islamism in
                            your paper of the 6th inst. Even most sober papers have described
                            “Muslim fanaticism” under the heading of Pan-Islamism, thus mixing np
                            one with the other, and the British public which is already prejudiced
                            against Islam, is led to understand that the whole of the Islamic world
                            is like a ferment which will burst any moment if Great Britain does not
                            use her mighty strength to suppress the spirit of Pan-Islamism, or so
                            called fanaticism. Responsible Ministers have brought forward that
                            successfully misleading excuse of putting down that spirit to justify
                            acts which any civilised people would call barbarous, and which aroused
                            indignation in the minds of a few conscientious people ; and so-called
                            authorities and experts have warned other nations to be ready for a
                            Muslim fanatical movement all over the world if they do not back and
                            support the measures which Great Britain has adopted to suppress it.</p>
                        <p>As a great devotee to the cause of Pan- Islamism and as one of the
                            workers of that spirit in India and in England, I have a right, I think,
                            to take exception to that fanatical and ignorant agitation which is
                            being carried on by the English Press denouncing that spirit and
                            misrepresenting it for that purpose. Let me tell them at the very
                            beginning that Pan- Islamism has nothing to do with fanaticism nor to
                            any secret political movement. The movement is a child of enlightenment
                            and progressive age, and is carried on by educated people on very
                            peaceful and moderate principles, and its object, AS I have explained
                            over and over in the meetings of the Pan-Islamic Society in London, is
                            to educate Muslims as well as non-Muslims on Islamic doctrines,
                            literature, and other matters concerning Islam. to present Islam before
                            every nation, even before the Japanese if possible, in its true and
                            simple form, and to defend Islam from the calumnies piled upon it by the
                            "charitable” Christendom. Undaunted frankness, instead of diplomatic
                            hypocrisy, is the guiding principle of its workers. The headquarters of
                            the society are in London—the metropolis of such a Great Power which has
                            the greatest number of Mussulman subjects, which is the cradle of
                            independent views and enlightened spirit, and which could never be
                            selected as the headquarters of the society had there been the least
                            idea of spreading Islam by fanning the fanatical spirit of Muslims.</p>
                        <p>We do not deny that it is, and it shall always remain to be, our best
                            effort to unite the Muslims of different sects, opinions and countries,
                            and to create in them self-respect, self- confidence and a knowledge of
                            their duties as well as in spirit to defend their rights and privileges.
                            If this effort be called fanatical I for one would be only too glad to
                            call myself a fanatic, as, I think, would any Pan-American if his
                            efforts were to be called fanatical.</p>
                        <p>The British Press also seems to be labouring under the idea that Turkey
                            is secretly fanning fanaticism among Muslims. I boldly say that nothing
                            could be farther from the truth. The Turkish Government is
                            over-considerate, and would never like to hurt the feelings of the
                            European Powers. Unfortunately, it does not even take a lesson from the
                            Christendom which is using to such an advantage the religion for
                            political purposes —as a means of aggression in non-Christian countries
                            and as a means of coalition and common cause among Christian Powers. I
                            wish every Muslim State, and every individual Mussulman should take a
                            warning from these extremely cutting lines : "Despite the optimism of
                            the promoters of The Hague Conference it is hard to see how such a
                            !!modus vivendi !! can be reached unless the Muslim world continues to
                            feel that respect for Europe which only military efficiency can
                            command.”</p>
                        <p>As to the unfortunate incident in Egypt which has given rise to all this
                            anti-Muslim agitation in the English Press, these who know some thing of
                            India know that such affrays between soldiers and villagers have nothing
                            extraordinary in than, and "Muslim fanaticism” has nothing to do with
                            them Indians have long been complaining that even and impartial justice
                            is overlooked when such incidents are dealt with. As in Egypt the excuse
                            for extraordinary methods is to keep down "the Muslim fanaticism,” so in
                            India it always is to keep up "the British prestige.” Both shall have
                            the pernicious effect of undermining the faith in the British justice
                            and impartial treatment of people of different races, creeds and colour
                            which no well-wisher of Great Britain should like. </p>

                        <head>EGYPT FOR THE EGYTIANS.</head>
                        <head>BY MUSTAPHA PASHA KAMEL.</head>
                        <p>Mustapha Pasha Kamel has sent the following letter to the “Daily Graphic”
                            :—</p>
                        <p>I lately read, with interest, in the “Daily Graphic” an article in which
                            you compare with one another the two propositions, “Egypt for the
                            Egyptians,” and “The Egypt of the Caliphs.” This question has often been
                            treated in the English Press, and mischievous or ill- informed persons
                            have gone so far as to delare that the Egyptian patriots who are
                            striving for the liberation of Egypt merely wish to exchange the English
                            yoke for another. That is calumny the object of which is to deprive the
                            Egyptians of the sympathy of the honest people who wish success to the
                            efforts of a nation that deserves to be free and is striving for its
                            independence. An explanation is needed. We want “Egypt for the
                            Egyptians.” No foreign yoke and no foreign rule. Those who believe that
                            the Egyptians hate England because she is a Christian Power are greatly
                            mistaken. The Egyptians only bear a grudge against the occupier who has
                            stolen their independence and erased their country from the list of free
                            nations. If any other Power—it matters not which—had been in the place
                            of England, the feeling would have been the same, for the loss of
                            freedom can never be borne.</p>
                        <p>The rights conferred on Egypt by the Treaty of London of 1840 ought to be
                            respected by all, and it is not Turkey who can be accused of having
                            forgotten them or sought to abolish them. There is not a single Egyptian
                            worthy of the name who accepts for himself, or his family, or his
                            country the loss of autonomy which was accepted by Turkey and guaranteed
                            by Europe. We deem ourselves quite capable of self-government, and will
                            not admit for an instant that we have need of anyone to rule over us or
                            to tutor us.</p>
                        <p>Sir E. Grey said at the last sitting of the House of Commons that there
                            are but two solutions to the Egyptian question : the annexation of the
                            country to England, or the establishment of a native Government, who
                            would put it into the hands of the Turks. Sir E. Grey purposely avoided
                            mentioning the only natural and logical solution : that of giving back
                            Egypt to the Egyptians, and bestowing on the country a really national
                            Government. Yet that is the solution which England has always promised
                            to perform.</p>
                        <p>Perhaps he meant by “Turks” the members of the Khedivial family. But, if
                            he considers them such, why did he display such zeal in the Tabah
                            affair, in pretending to defend them and their rights against Turkey? A
                            nation is not like a flock of sheep, the property of one man, and to be
                            managed as he likes. The Sovereign has but one part to fulfil, that of
                            representing the country in which he reigns. But the Government ought to
                            be in the hands of natives-- who are capable of managing it and who
                            would be under the control of the people. And for that we require a
                            constitution. England has just given the Boers a constitution which
                            which places them on the same footing with the English inhabiting South
                            Africa; but she conquered the country of the Boers in a long and
                            horrible war.</p>
                        <p>Egypt has not been conquered. England annulled the constitution of Egypt,
                            but promised to restore it on a firmer basis. That was twenty-four years
                            ago, and England still occupies Egypt, and we still ask her to redeem
                            the promise she made to us. The want of a constitution in Egypt becomes
                            more and more terrible and injurious to the welfare of the country, for
                            the power that Lord Cromer wields is that of an absolute ruler. That
                            Liberal England should leave in the hands of her representative at Cairo
                            an ab- solute authority equal to that of the Tsar, is one of the most
                            astonishing spectacles of the age.</p>
                        <p>Sir E. Grey told the House of Commons that Lord Cromer’s guiding
                            principle was not to interfere with the internal affairs of the Egyptian
                            Government, and that the State machinery of the country is so
                            complicated that his responsibilities cannot be gauged.</p>
                        <p>We may be permitted to reply to Sir E. Grey that a perusal of Lord
                            Cromer's annual report proves that he is all powerful and holds
                            unlimited sway over Egypt. He defends himself against those who protest
                            against his absolute power by saying that he is controlled by the
                            British Parliament and public opinion in England, as well as by the
                            Egyptian Press. Lord Cromer is “the Egyptian Government” in his own
                            person. Such Ministers as we have only accept their positions to enable
                            Sir E. Grey to say, when Parliament interests itself in the affairs of
                            Egypt, that the Egyptian Government still exists. It is the absolute
                            power of Lord Cromer which has created the Extraordinary Court, the work
                            of which at Denishwai is now a matter of history. It is his power which
                            has caused the European living in Egypt to hold more steadfastly than
                            ever to the “Capitulations,” not wishing to be treated like the fellahs
                            at Denishwai. It is his power which wounds and ruffles all Egypt.</p>
                        <p>I know that Lord Cromer is one of those who believe that there are
                            superior and inferior races, and will not admit that Egypt can be
                            governed like a European country. But let his lordship allow me to
                            remind him that Egypt has two high civilisations—that of the Pharaohs
                            and that of Islam—and that, more than a century ago, she welcomed
                            European culture. If there are noble races and others not so noble, I do
                            not think he can deny our claim to belong to the former, for the
                            Egyptian race has outlived many misfortunes and invasions, and has been
                            one of the greatest races in the world. Moreover, if the East ought to
                            be governed by Orientals, and not by Occidentals, let the Europeans
                            remain at home and leave Egypt to the Orientals.</p>
                        <p>No civilisation can rule, and endure, unless there is equal justice for
                            all men. To have striven against iniquity and injustce is the chief
                            glory of our age. The continual wounding of the feelings of the Egyptian
                            nation can lead to no good results. History has shown what are the
                            deadly fruits of tyranny. There may be a difference of opinion on great
                            political questions but no one will dispute the right which every nation
                            has to justice. It is the duty of every nation which calls itself
                            "civilised and civilizing” to spread the benefits of that justice
                            wherever it has the power to do so. </p>

                        <head>LORD CROMER'S POSITION.</head>
                        <p>Last Friday we published a remarkable tirade which was made against the
                            Earl of Cromer by “Al Minbar,” which continues its attack, though, it
                            appears, our contemporary prefers to rely upon inventions rather than
                            facts, as is shown by the following article:—</p>
                        <p>We have said that Lord Cromer, or the Tsar of Kasr el Doubara, having
                            gained the confidence of his countrymen, could not have thought that
                            there would be such a change in three months that people should be now
                            asking who will be his successor. This change, however, is not so sudden
                            as it appears to be. It is said that Lord Cromer was about to leave his
                            post before the fall of the late Conservative Ministry. Mr. Balfour
                            hinted to him that it was time that he should resign on account of his
                            health. Lord Cromer asked that he should be allowed to remain until the
                            opening of the Red Sea railway, which is a monument to his work of
                            extending British influence along the shores of the Red Sea. Lord
                            Cromer’s request was granted. We obtained this news from a reliable
                            source.</p>
                        <p>There are different opinions as to the causes which made Mr. Balfour hint
                            to Lord Cromer to resign. Some say that Mr. Balfour thought it was time
                            to inaugurate a new policy in Egypt, a policy to which Lord Cromer would
                            not agree. Others said it was Mr. Chamberlain's doing, that he wanted
                            all British officials in the colonies to be protectionists like himself.
                            Others said that it was the King who desired Lord Cromer’s removal in
                            order to please the Khedive, with whom he cannot agree.</p>
                        <p>Whatever may have been the reason, the Conservative Ministry fell before
                            the opening of the Red Sea railway ; Lord Cromer became secure in his
                            post for although the new Ministry was Liberal and naturally wished for
                            some one of their own party to come to Egypt, they did not dare to send
                            anyone so soon after coming into power. When Lord Cromer said at Port
                            Sudan, “I will remain in the Valley of the Nile so long as my health
                            permits” and “When one Englisman goes another comes in his place,” he
                            knew that he was to have left, but circumstances had changed and he felt
                            secure.</p>
                        <p>But in the instance of the Denishwai affair we find that the Foreign
                            Secretary upholds Lord Cromer’s policy, while the “Tribune” (published
                            and founded by the Liberal party) condemns it. This paper said that Lord
                            Cromer had erred in the Denishwai affair and in making the charge of
                            fanaticism. It said also that if there is no fanaticism in Egypt, this
                            charge will cause it; if it exists the charge will aggravate it. All the
                            Liberal papers are against Lord Cromer, but the Conservative organs
                            uphold him. The Liberal Government has found itself obliged to support
                            Lord Cromer and not defy the wishes of the native. But he who reads Sir
                            E. Grey’s reply to Mr. Robertson finds in it a new spirit. It declares
                            that the word fanaticism is objectionable, and that the Administration
                            is in a chaotic state.</p>
                        <p>EGYPT AND GERMANY.</p>
                        <p>Apropos of the telegram from our London Correspondent yesterday in regard
                            to Germany’s attitude towards Lord Cromer’s reforms, the following
                            remarks by the “Globe” are apposite:—</p>
                        <p>At this moment no one who pays any attention to international affairs can
                            fail to speculate upon the consequences of the Turkish Throne becoming
                            vacant during the near future. That event might give rise to a revival
                            of certain shadowy claims in connection with Egypt, which would affect
                            us very nearly, and we may be sure that the King will take care to make
                            England’s attitude upon this subject perfectly plain. It has been
                            suggested that Germany desires to magnify her own inconsiderable
                            interests in the Nile Valley in order to make their surrender a “quid
                            pro quo” for concessions in the Persian Gulf. No English Government
                            could enter into any such bargain, and the good feeling which has of
                            late began to show itself between England and Germany would be seriously
                            imperilled if any attempt were made to force it upon us. The inducement
                            held out to us of "regularising” our position in Egypt is no inducement
                            at all. We are satisfied that our action in the country has been of the
                            greatest possible benefit to all concerned, and we do not admit that it
                            stands in any need of justification. Germany suffers no wrong, but very
                            much the reverse, by our presence there, and she has no historical
                            associations with the country which could give her the right to approve
                            or disapprove of our rale. German diplomacy is, of course, fully
                            entitled to press every legitimate point which can be used for the
                            advantage of Germany, but the Kaiser would show less than his usual
                            wisdom were he to countenance a reproduction in Egypt of the marnoeuvre
                            so successfully carried out in Morocco. We occupy Egypt partly for the
                            good of the Egyptians and the preservation of peace, and partly because
                            it is the high road to our Eastern dominions. We were forced into the
                            occupation against our will ; but having set our hand to the plough, we
                            shall assuredly not look back. Our rule there must be accepted as one of
                            the permanent footers of the international situation, an King Edward
                            will increase the many obligations which the world already owes him if
                            he succeeds in convincing the Kaiser that we shall neither permit it to
                            be questioned nor allow it to be made the subject of a bargain with any
                            Power however great. </p>

                            Recognized.<!--contains image--></head>
                        <p><hi rend="bold">A Cold Settled in Kidneys, Causing Serious Trouble.
                                Pe-ru-na Restores Health.</hi></p>
                        <p> CATARRH of the kidneys ss a very much neglected disease.</p>
                        <p>It is not until the disease has a firm hold upon the kidneys that the
                            patient begins to realize that there is some derangement of these
                            organs.</p>
                        <p>The slight backaches, the feelings of lassitude, and other warning
                            symptoms of kidney disease are overlooked.</p>
                        <p>They are not serious enough to detain the patient from his regular
                            work.</p>
                        <p>Even when he discovers that the kidneys are affected, he does not
                            recognize the difficulty as being caused by catarrh.</p>
                        <p>Catarrh is sometimes so very gradual in its approach and its earlier
                            symptoms cause such slight discomfort that it is not noticed.</p>
                        <p>However, when it is once firmly seated in the kidneys it becomes a
                            difficult disease to exterminate.</p>
                        <p>Indeed, catarrh of the kidneys is more serious than catarrh affecting
                            some of the other organs of the body.</p>
                        <p>In the kidneys it is liable to terminate in Bright’s Disease or diabetes,
                            both of which are recognized as very serious ailments, if not fatal.</p>
                        <p>The thing to be done, when catarrh of the kidneys is discovered, is to
                            take some internal, systemic catarrh remedy, one that reaches the very
                            source of the catarrh and removes the cause of the difficulty.</p>
                        <p>Such a remedy has been found in Peruna. ( <hi rend="bold">PE-RU-NA FOR
                                KIDNEY DISEASE.</hi>) It reaches catarrh, no matter where it may be
                            located in the body--whether in the more exposed membranes of the nose
                            and throat, or whether in the remotest part of the kidneys.</p>
                        <p>That Peruna is at once the safest and most reliable remedy for catarrh of
                            the kidneys is proven by the many testimonials written by those who have
                            experienced its benefits.</p>
                        <p>The testimonials given here are only specimens of the many testimonials
                            on our records, pertaining to the relief afforded by Peruna in severe
                            cases of kidney trouble.</p>

                        <p>Mr. Samuel A. Paxton, 1118 Troost Ave., Kansas City, Mo., member I. O. O.
                            F., and National Annuity Association, writes: “I am a well man today,
                            thanks to Peruna. I was troubled with catarrh and kidney disease of long
                            standing when I first began using Peruna.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Isaac Rosenzveig, 9 Dumarals street, Montreal,Can., writes:</p>
                        <p>“About three years ago, I suffered with a bad cold. It settled in the
                            bladder and kidneys, causing serious trouble.</p>
                        <p>“I tried several advertised remedies, but it was Peruna which finally
                            cured me, and I had taken only a few bottles.</p>
                        <p>"I feel that it saved me, and it certainly restored me to such perfect
                            health as I had not known in years.</p>
                        <p>“I have good reason to give your remedy my highest endorsement.”</p>
                        <p>“I soon found I was getting better and continued taking it for four
                            months. It cleaned out the system leaving me well and strong and feeling
                            better than I have in years.”</p>

                            suite de réalisations. Etant donnée la valeur intrinsè que du titre,
                            c’est là un prix qui se recommande tout particulièrement à l’attention

                        <p>Nous détachons d’une lettre de Paris, en date du 21 Août les lignes
                            suivantes :</p>
                        <p>"Les rentes françaises et les fonds russes n’ont pas trop participé au
                            mouvement favorable qui s’est dessiné cette semaine. Les premières sont
                            un peu délaissées, et les seconds donnent des signes évidents d’une
                            nouvelle baisse. C’est la résultante des informations in quiétantes qui
                            arrivent de Russie. On craint que le gouvernement du Tsar se trouve hors
                            d’état de réprimer le mouvement eu automne lorsque la récolte, assez
                            mauvaise, étant terminée, un grand nombre de paysans se trouve ront sans
                            travail, et que La famine amènera encore plus d’adhérents à la
                            propagande révolutionnaire. D'autre part, au point de vue financier, on
                            n’attache pas d’importance à la déclaration de M. Stolypine relative à
                            la bonne situation du Trésor. Qu’un emprunt nouveau soit nécessaire ou
                            non, un fait certain, o’est qu’il serait de toute impossibilité d’en
                            contracter un pour le moment.”</p>
                        <p>On annonce d’Alexandrie que M. Périclès Glymenopoulo sera probablement de
                            retour d’Europe ces jours ci, afin d’assister à l’assem blé
                            extraordinaire de la Building Lands of Egypt, convoquée pour mardi
                            prochain 4 septembre. On sait que cette assemblée doit se prononcer
                            définitivement sur le rejet ou la ratification du contrat de fusion
                            intervenu entre cette Société et l’Egyptian Trust and Investment
                            Ltd.</p>
                        <p>En attendant, le baron de Kusel bey, directeur général du Trust, qui
                            souffrait d’une fièvre intermittente, est parti hier soir pour l’Europe,
                            voie de Port-Saïd, en vue d’un changement d’air.</p>
                        <p>Hier, à la Bourse d’Alexandrie, les Building Lands ont été cotés 5 3/8 et
                            les Glymenopoulo 1 11/32 3/8.</p>
                        <p>The “Egyptian Gazette’ d’hier publie une Lettre, an Rédacteur concernant
                            l’Egyptian Land and General Trust (Hooker) à la suite du rejet du projet
                            de fusion avec la Delta Land Co.</p>
                        <p>L'auteur préconise la liquidation immédiate du Trust. Il conseille aux
                            actionnaires d’agir sans retard. En se bornant à attendre, ajoute-til en
                            substance, “nous nous exposons à on règlement beaucoup moins avantageux
                            qu’ l'heure actuelle, car cette attitude contemplative nous coûte £3,000
                            d’administration paran, sans compter la moins-value que pourrai peut
                            être subir notre actif.’’</p>
                        <p>Les parts de jouissance de la Société des Tramways électriques du Caire,
                            qui étaient cotées Frs. 947,50 à Bruxelles à la date du 14 Août courant,
                            ont haussé à 958,75 le 17, pour revenir à 901.25 le 20 Août.</p>
                        <p>Carnet de l'actionnaire.</p>
                        <p>Il est rappelé aux actionnaires de l’Express Nile Steamers Co. que le
                            versement da 2ème quart sur leurs titres, soir L.E. 1 par action, est
                            exigible depuis le 20 Mai dernier et qu’en cas de retard ils s’exposent
                            à l’application des l’ article 7 des Statuts. </p>

                    <p>Les valeurs conservent leurs positions de la veille, mais demeurent à
                        peu-près sans transactions. Quelques rares affaires ont lieu seulement en
                        Agricole, National Bank, Cassa di Sconto, Delta Land, Trust, Estates et

                    <p>Les commentaires vont leur train concernant la fusion da Trust et de la
                        Building Lands. Les partisans de la fusion semb’ent l’emporter en ce moment,
                        puisque le Trust se maintient excessivement ferme à 1 3/8, tandis que la
                        Building perd encore 1/16 à 5 1/8; leur principal atout est la prochaine
                        arrivée de M. Glymenopoulo.</p>
                    <p>La lettre que nous avons publiée à propos de la Land and General Trust a
                        produit sur cette valeur une réaction sensible. Le cours est tombé à 15/16

                    <p>On attend sans trop d’inquiétude la liquidation de fin du mois, attendu que

                        <p>Our understanding with France is not, as Sir Edward Grey lately declared,
                            directed against any other country, but other Powers will do well to
                            realize and to take to heart his further statement that “it must be
                            recognized that that understanding must not be impaired by any other
                            development of our foreign policy.” “The more clearly,” he went on to
                            say, “that both these things are borne in mind, the more clearly it will
                            appear that for neither country is that good understanding a barrier or
                            hindrance to good and cordial relations with other Powers.” The French
                            do bear both these facts in mind; if the Germans will only do so with
                            the like sincerity, there is no sort of reason why our relations with
                            her, which have improved so much, should not improve yet more. Of
                            course, it must be understood that, however excellent they might become,

                            advocated by the “Deutsche Revue” and the newspapers, which are now
                            striving to renew in regard to Egypt a campaign with a strong family
                            resemblance to that which they prosecuted under distinguished patronage
                            in Morocco, until they brought Europe close to a catastrophe. The
                            Morocco campaign did not lead to results on which Germany has had much
                            cause to congratulate herself in the long run. We can assure these
                            organs that the Egyptian campaign will not be one whit more successful.
                            We do not desire to attach too much weight to the articles in question,
                            but the history of the Morocco crisis warns us that it might be unwise
                            to ignore them altogether. (“Times”).</p>

                        <p>There is, for instance, an admirable example of the need for good working
                            terms between England and Germany supplied by a telegram from
                            Constantinople which we publish to day. It is announced from the Porte
                            that Sir Edward Grey has refused to accede to the Turkish request for an
                            increase in the Turkish Customs from eight to eleven percent. That
                            refusal has been clearly foreshadowed by the British Foreign Secretary’s
                            speeches and replies to questions in the House of Commons. He does not
                            see his way to agree to the imposition of an additional handicap upon
                            British merchants and traders, unless valid reasons are forthcoming
                            showing the increase to be imperatively necessary. The practical
                            influence which Great Britain can bring to bear upon the Porte in these
                            days is so small that to throw away so important an advantage would be
                            folly. Her chief political interest with Turkey at the present moment is
                            to secure some sensible improvement in the lot of the Christian
                            populations of Macedonia, on whose behalf she, in common with the other
                            Great Powers, has repeatedly intervened. Sir Edward Grey does not refuse
                            point-blank to agree to the increase of the Turkish Customs ; he
                            demands, it is understood, guarantees that at least part of the extra
                            revenue shall be employed in financing the Mace Ionian reforms, which
                            Austria and Russia have pressed on the Sultan as the mandatories of
                            Europe. (“Daily Telegraph.”)</p>

                        <p>The visit of the King to Cronberg has been an unqualified success. We
                            find it very hard to believe that it will prove—as some assert— a
                            prelude to German interference in Egypt, nor do we imagine that Sir
                            Edward Grey will make any mistakes if he be asked—as is also hinted—to
                            revive the Bagdad railway project. This is not a time when it would be
                            wise for Great Britain to increase her commitments in the Middle East,
                            except upon the most prudent terms. There is, however, as we have
                            pointed out, every reason for the European Powers maintaining the
                            friendliest possible relations with one another. The health of the
                            Sultan and the age of the Austrian Emperor would be reasons enough. even
                            if they stood alone. But behind these considerations lies the Russian
                            revolution, still steadily proceeding, despite the optimistic view to
                            which our correspondent at St. Petersburg is always careful to do full
                            justice. The actions of the Socialists are doubtless violent, but was
                            anything else expected? The Court Party itself appealed from reason to
                            force when it dissolved the Dums, and force is now the only remedy.

                        <p>It is seldom that within less than six months there succeed each other
                            commotions of such magnitude as the fierce eruption of Vesuvius, the San
                            Francisco earthquake, and finally this upheaval in the most important
                            region of Chile. We do not yet know, and probably shall not know with
                            certainty for some time, what has been the extent of the damage. It will
                            be remembered how in the case of San Francisco hopeful and pessimistic
                            rumours came by turns, and that is the natural course of things when
                            communication is uncertain and alarm still rife in the devastated area.
                            Over and above the genuine human sympathy which every one feels for the
                            victims of these appalling shocks, there is in this country, whose
                            business connexions with Chile are so large, a keen interest in
                            ascertaining the truth. The representatives of British and American
                            firms in Chile are among our chief witnesses as to the facts, and it is
                            satisfactory to find that their messages are mostly reassuring. At the
                            same time, it has to be remembered that these brief reports are only
                            partial. The writers are chiefly concerned to send information about
                            their own premises and interests, and news about the general situation
                            is only given by way. Putting together even arch comparatively meagre
                            intelligence as we have, there can be no doubt that the shook has been
                            widespread and severe. (“Times”).</p>

                        <p>Fifty years ago it would have passed almost unnoticed as a domestic
                            episode in a remote and only half-civilized region of the earth, which
                            scarcely came within the sphere of our knowledge and or sympathy. In
                            that state the Spanish Americans had their own remedy of temperament and
                            custom. They took life easily : they lived amid a turmoil of revolution
                            and change. An earthquake was an episode like another, which altered
                            little where nothing was stable and assured. Their habits of thought and
                            emotion had been designed like some natural aptitude acquired in the
                            struggle for existence to discount and parry the effects of calamities
                            which would shake a northern society to its foundations. To-day all this
                            has changed. Revolutions are a thing of the past. Commerce has been
                            built up on an international basis. The very population itself has
                            ceased to be purely Spanish through the great influx of English, North
                            American, and German immigrants. Suh a catastrophe as this means, one
                            fears, a far graver disaster than it would have done when Chile was
                            still a primitive society. (“Tribune.”).</p>

                        <p>We think that the Foreign Office has been wise in reopening diplomatic
                            relations with Servia. The horrible conspiracy which destroyed the
                            Obrenovich dynasty ought not to blind us to the fact that Servia is a
                            nation, and as a nation entitled to our consideration. The regicides
                            were contemptible and cowardly scoundrels, actuated by the meanest of
                            motives. But Servia herself is a bigger entity than a regicidal gang of
                            ruffians, and we must never forget how gallant was her struggle against
                            the Turk for liberty and independence. The Servians are not popular as a
                            race. They lack the virile qualities which are attributed to Bulgarians
                            and Montenegrins. But even the Servians belong to the small peoples
                            towards whom it is a tradition that Great Britain should entertain warm
                            feelings, and it is to be hoped that no further calamity may arise to
                            estrange the public opinion of Europe. What the Balkans now imperatively
                            require is a truce to inter-racial leads. In view of external menaces,
                            Bulgar and Greek and Serb will do well to moderate their conflicting
                            ambitions—lest worse befal. (“Daily News.”)</p>

                        <p>It is certain that mere motives of policy will restrain the Government
                            from administering the law in any way likely to stir up religions
                            passions. They do not want to have a revival of those uncomfortable
                            incidents which marked the taking of the inventories. Hence M. Briand
                            dismisses any idea of closing the churches by force, and declares that
                            the Government can achieve its end just as well by a painless and
                            automatic process of sequestration. But that the Government, however
                            discreet in their methods, will adhere firmly to the law, seems to be
                            made sure by the temper of the Chamber. It is significant that even the
                            Moderate Republican organ, the “République Française” has addressed a
                            warning to the Catholics in this respect. Among the Anti Clericals the
                            Encyclical has provoked, indeed, talk of a revision of the law, but only
                            in the direction of recalling concessions and making it more stringent
                            for the Church. (“Times”).</p>

                            to these exiles it depends whether they will go back to warn their

                            liberty is dead, or to serve as willing missionaries in the cause of a

                            in Egypt, has been placed on duty with the Egyptian draft of the 6th
                            Inniskilling Dragoons, and will embark for Alexandria about the 29th

                        <p>Lieutenant E. E. B. Mackintosh, Royal Engineers, Gravesend, has been
                            selected for service with the Egyptian Army, and will leave for Cairo at
                            an early date. Mr. Mackintosh joined the Royal Engineers in June,
                            1899.</p>
                        <p>In military circles, the removal of the troops recently sent to Egypt
                            during the Tabah crisis is greatly condemned. It is pointed out that at
                            least 9,000 troops, if not 10,000, are required in the present state of
                            affairs, and there is not the slightest doubt that the late Government
                            would have sent that number ont if so advised.</p>
                        <p>The putting of the wild untamed Bedouin into the trammels of discipline
                            will be an interesting experiment. If successful, two or three regiments
                            of these ancient warriors will be a fine asset in the army of the
                            Khedive. The addition of three Sudanese battalions is favourably
                            ommented on by ex-Egyptian officers. There are no two opinions about
                            "Fuzzy Wuzzy” being a "fust class fightin’ man.” If the Bedouin Arab
                            battalions prove a success another old-world belief will be knocked on
                            the head.</p>
                        <p>In these days of Army Reform, it is interesting to note that the
                            authorities have at last extended permission for the wearing of plain
                            clothes to sergeants, for purposes of recreation and amusement. They
                            will now be allowed to keep them in their barrack rooms. N.C.O.’s and
                            men of good character proceeding on furlough will also be allowed them
                            when actually away from their regiments.</p>
                        <p>In the interests of recruiting, this new order is much to be applauded.
                            Over and over again I have heard the very best of N.C.O.’a say that they
                            don’t care to go to theatres or music-halls as frequently as they would
                            like to, for one reason only—they don’t care to be conspicuous in their
                            red tunics. They don’t want to do anything wrong—that is not the cause
                            of the objection. They simply prefer to remain away unless they can go
                            as private individuals. I can quite understand their feelings. If we had
                            conscription and halt the audience were in uniform like abroad, N.C.O.’s
                            would then have no objection to appearing at all times !!en g ande tenue
                            !!. As we have not, the least we can do is to allow them the same
                            facilities for recreation as the commissioned ranks have long
                            enjoyed.</p>
                        <p>Whilst Mr. Haldane is mooning about over his new alleged scheme of army
                            reform, and the abolition of 20,000 men for the purpose of making it
                            more effective, he finds it necessary to offer substantial bounties to
                            the men of the doomed battalions to extend their service to battalions
                            in India. The eligible men of the 4th Battalion Royal Warwickshire
                            Regiment, Curragh, are being offered a bounty of £10 to extend their
                            service to seven years with the 1st Battalion Northamptonshire Regiment
                            at Jullundur, Punjab, and the same bounty to 350 men of the 2nd and 4th
                            Battalions Lancashire Fusiliers to extend their service to seven years
                            with the 1st Battalion South Lancashire Regiment, Jubbulpore, and the
                            1st Battalion King’s Liverpool Regiment, Nasirabad. A smaller bounty of
                            two guineas is being offered to the men of the 4th Battalion
                            Northumberland Fusiliers for extension to the 2nd Battalion Border
                            Regiment, Potchefstroom, Transvaal.</p>
                        <p>It appears that the Admiralty has given permission to Captain Young, of
                            the Liverpool Salvage Association, to attempt to salve the four big guns
                            of the wrecked battleship Montagu. These hge guns have a diameter of 12
                            inches and weigh over 45 tons each. Owing to the peculiar way in which
                            they are in the heavily armoured barbettes and the want of appliances no
                            attempt was made to salve them daring the recent Admiralty operations.
                            Roughly speaking, the four guns are worth about £100,000.</p>
                        <p>The commission of the battleship Formidable expires on the Mediterranean
                            Station on the 1st October, She will be again recommissioned by her
                            present skipper, Captain E. A. Simons, for another hour of service on
                            the same station. </p>

                        <p>MR. S. J. DAWSON'S XI v. MR. J. C. MACLAREN'S XI.</p>
                        <p>Played on 27th inst., Mr. Dawson’s XI. winning by the narrow margin of 4
                            runs. The winners won the toss and went in to bat, but could not do much
                            with Bailey’s bowling, being all out for 104. Harrison played a good
                            innings of 36, being well caught in the long field. Nairn stayed for
                            some time before getting l.b.w. Sutton was not out for a quickly hit 23.
                            Bailey took 7 of the 8 wickets that were bowled for 49 runs only.</p>
                        <p>MacLaren’s XI. started well and looked like winning, but after Peel and
                            MacLaren left wickets fell regularly, only Foster being able to make
                            runs. The first-mentioned was splendidly caught by Evans from a skyer
                            right on the edge of the far boundary. MacLaren was well caught at the
                            wicket and Foster bowled after a good innings. Scores:—</p>

                    <p>A BROKEN-DOWN SYSTEM.</p>
                    <p>This is a condition (or disease) to which doctors give many names, but which
                        few of them really understand. It it simply weakness—a break-down, as it
                        were, of the vital forces that sustain the system. No matter what may be its
                        causes (for they are almost numberless), its symptoms are much the same; the
                        more prominent being sleeplessness, sense of prostration or weariness,
                        depression of spirits and want of energy for all the ordinary affairs of
                        life. Now, what alone is absolutely essential in all such cases is increased
                        vitality—vigour--</p>
                    <p>VITAL STRENGTH &amp; ENERGY</p>
                    <p>to throw off these morbid feelings, and experience proves that as night
                        succeeds the day this may be more certainly secured by a course of the
                        celebrated life-reviving tonic</p>

                        "used up,” and valueless. This wonderful medicament is purely vegetable and
                        innocuous, is agreeable to the taste —suitable for all constitutions and
                        conditions, in either sex; and it is difficult to imagine a case of disease
                        or derangement, whose main features are those of debility, that will not be
                        speedily and permanently benefited by this never-failing recuperative
                        essence, which is destined to cast into oblivion everything that had
                        preceded it for this wide-spread and numerous class of human ailments.</p>
