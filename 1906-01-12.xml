                    <head>GERMANY AS THE WORLD POWER.</head>
                    <p>Germany will, it appears, be rather isolated at the coming conference, and
                        the forward policy of the Kaiser in regard to Morocco has, we are told
                        to-day in a telegram from Rome,, even excited the antagonism of the Press of
                        Italy, which is quite secondarily in- terested in the fate of Morocco
                        compared with England, France, and Spain. In fact, throughout the Bourses of
                        the world there is a very anxious feeling as to the part which the Kaiser
                        intends to play. The uneasiness caused by the German Emperor’s policy is due
                        to the fact that he represents a nation which is very strong on land, so
                        that none Pf its neighbours would care to quarrel with it, which is creating
                        a great Navy, and which; as its statesmen have preached to its people,
                        thinks itself entitled to a fall share of the good things of this world,
                        among them trade, ship- ping, and colonies. If Germany has set her heart
                        upon anything the nation that stands in her way mast be very strong and
                        courageous, or mast be discreet enough to star.d aside and be polite. For
                        the Germans have been brought up for several generations on the Prussian
                        doctrine, which is that of Philip and Alex- ander and of the Roman
                        republic—that if a nation thinks a thing right it mast be strong enough to
                        make it so. They have had occasion to observe that what seems to one nation
                        righteousness sometimes seems to, another na- tion to be wrong, and that
                        when the two views come to be argued out the logic employed is that of
                        force.. They are naturally anxious that righteousness as they see it should
                        prevail, and for that end they rend their young men to barracks their boys
                        .to training sqaudrons. The result is that the Gorman nation has a certain
                        consciousness of power. The effect upon <cb n="6"/> the national character
                        is like that of athletic training upon some men we have seen, who are
                        perhaps not always as tactful. as some of their less muscular friends. The
                        German notion of policy is expressed by the word Realpolitik, which means
                        policy that deals with the world as it island eschews sentiment. Now we
                        venture to suggest that in all these German charac teriatics there is a
                        good- deal of practical wisdom Ivy no means out of place in a world of which
                        we are told that the principle is the struggle for existence and the
                        survival of the fittest, but at the same time each charac- teristics do not
                        make for confidenoe in the dur- ability of peace in Europe, especially at
                        such a moment as the present.</p>
                    <p>Of course the jealousy we feel in regard to Germany's recent policy in
                        Morocco and elsewhere is historically quite justifiable, for Great Britain
                        mast necessarily oppose the state, which desires to have a preponderance in
                        Europe. But it mast be confessed that Ger- many is equally justified in her
                        policy. What would German policy naturally be? The Ger- man Empire was
                        created int 1871 by the perpetual federation of twenty-six German States,
                        some of which had long been among the independent Monarchal of Europe. The
                        Empire has a population of fifty-six millions, so that there are more
                        Germans in Germany than there are white men in the British Empire. A State
                        like the German Empire cannot exist without patriotism, and what should we
                        expect to be the natural idea of every patriotic German? Sorely he will want
                        Germany to flourish and be powerful and to have as much influence in the
                        world as she can possibly get. His nation is civilised. It does a fair share
                        of the world’s work in literature, science, and art, in industry and trade,
                        and in all that belongs to national life. Its army has proved itself second
                        to none. Its people are as well acquainted with geography and' history as
                        any other, perhaps better than any other. The German may very well ask
                        himself—Why should Germany be second to any other Power ? What answer can
                        be. given him? Where is he to look for,4he answer? Probably to history, in
                        which he has had excellent instructors, for though England boasts of Gibbon,
                        that great historian wrote in the century before last, and his work ends
                        with, the year 1453. Since then the Germans have had Ranke, who has written
                        for them the history of German}, of France, and of England, as well as the
                        history of the world. Moreover, while every Englishman buys Gibbon, few read
                        him, but a great many Germans read Ranke. What, then, is the lesson of
                        history, the question to which our hypothe-. tical German seeks an answer?
                        Perhaps, first of all, that unity is strength. Well, the Germans have united
                        and are fifty-six millions; what next ? Perhaps that a nation should not
                        grow lazy and neglect the arts of war. The German feels that his country is
                        sound on that point, for every man is trained to arms, and German generals
                        within his time or his fathers; defeated all the generals or Austria and of
                        France. Perhaps that sea power gives a Commanding influence in the world-,
                        and that sea power rests on trade and a mercantile marine. Very good;
                        Germany is cultivating her trade and her mercantile marine, is sedulously
                        applying her military experience to the creation of a great Navy, and is
                        picking' up coaling stations'-' as fast as opportunity offers. Why should
                        Germany not be as much entitle 1 as any other Power . to compete for the
                        first place in the world b . These are the questions which an Englishman has

                    <p>Th-to arc other questions which perhaps an Englishman, and certainly a
                        British statesman, may pat to himself. On what ground are the forty-one
                        million British of Great Britain and the ten or twelve more millions of
                        Greater . Britain ‘entitled to expect to retain for their ' . country the
                        pre-eminence in the world which they believe it has acquired? History shows
                        that there have quite a number of Empires, including vast territories,
                        compact or scattered resting on land power or on sea power. None of them has
                        hitherto been permanent; why should the British Empire have a title to long
                        dura tion? What plea can the British advance which would rightly bar the
                        ambition of Ger- nany to be a very great Power in the world?</p>

                    <p>The official and popular assurances which have been made in Germany and
                        elsewhere have dissipated the fears which had been entertained concerning
                        the outcome of the Morocco Conference. Russia’s loan of eleven millions from
                        the French bankers and the im- proved condition of that country have caused
                        tho general political outlook to be greatly improved.</p>

                    <p>Our Cairo Correspondent telephones: The Cairo opera season began with Fedora
                        last night. Fedora is rather a good introduction to an opera season ; the
                        “book” is fairly modern and not uninteresting of its kind The music is
                        midway between a reminiscent of Wagner and Verdi on one side and Puccini on
                        the- other, and the house is or was last night— fall, well dressed, and
                        quiet. The whole per- formance centred on Signs. Bellincioni, who proved
                        herself to be all- that we had heard or expected of her,—a most admirable
                        artiste with a delightful voice, sympathetic' in the highest degree from
                        beginning to end. We are. indeed lucky to have the honour of hearing her in
                        Cairo, and we shall look forward most eagerly to her appear- ance in the
                        other operas. Traviata, for ex- ample, is a part which she plays us few can
                        play it—in a word, she is an event in the history of Cairo opera. The rest?
                        Well the list of names and programme synopsis would serve at a pinch to make
                        an extra paragraph. They are much the same as usual so far. Sig. Polese
                        appeared here for the second time and his voice seems rather stronger than
                        last year. He was distinctly (good as the french diplomatic. Signs. Zeppeli
                        was graceful and clever as Countess Olga. The tenor, as Loris,-well, it
                        would-be wisest to hold one’s hand and cease criticism herewith.</p>

                        rapidly as was anticipated, owing to delays caused by local contractors. It
                        is hoped that part of the lines will be completed, and ready for working by

                        of this line was obtained from the Government in December, 1904. The
                        directors are pleased to state that since that date the Government has
                        consented to a modification of the terms of the concession, covering this
                        section of line, by extending the date upon which Government has the option
                        of purchasing the line by al period of 25 years to April, 1927. The traffic
                        receipts from this section’ of line have proved satisfactory, and when the
                        contemplated im- provements and additions to the rolling-stock are effected,
                        similar results are anticipated. Under the o’d statutes of the Helouan Rail-
                        way, power was given to set aside a special, reserve, before Government
                        participated in the profits, subject to such special reserve being formally
                        authorised at a general meeting of the shareholders of the company. In 1904
                        this formality was omitted by the old Holouan Company, and it is-therefore,
                        at the request of the'Government, necessary to pass a formal re solution
                        authorising the retting aside, to a 1 special reserve, of the sum of LE.

                        immediately commenced when official sanction has been received:</p>
                    <p>New Capital.—In view of the outlay neces sitated on the Helouan Railway and
                        also for the construction of new lines in the Menoufieh, Province and for
                        the purchase of adequate rolling stock to cope with the increasing traffic,
                        an issue of 18,538 5 1/2 per cent. Comulative Preference Shares of £'0 each
                        was made to May. 1905, pro rata to the exiting share- holders at a premium
                        of £2 10 0 per share. A farther issue of £10,000 4% Debentures at par has
                        also been made.</p>
                    <p>Egyptian Delta Land and Investment Company.—In January, 1905, this company
                        increased its authorized share capital to £250,000 by the creation of an
                        additional 150,000 Ordinary shares of £1 each, of which, in May, 1905,
                        100,000 shares were issued pro rata to the shareholders at the price of £2
                        per share. The 10,000 shares to which this company was entitled were taken
                        up.</p>
                    <p>Alteration of Financial Year.— As the present financial year, of the Company
                        closes during the busiest season of the year it is considered advisable to
                        alter the date from the 30th September to 31st March. It is proposed
                        therefore, to issue a report and statement of accounts in June next for the
                        half year ending 31st March, 1906, after which the report and statement of
                        accounts will be issued annually,</p>
                    <p>Resignation of Directors. — The directors have with much regret to report the
                        resignation of Lieut-Col. E.L. Marryat, R.E., to whose energies and
                        experience the company is very largely indebted for its successful
                        development since its incorporation in 1898.</p>
                    <p>Directors — Sir Elwin PalmerK K.C.B,, K.C.M.G. Baron Jacques de Menasce, and

                        FUTURE.</head>
                    <p>The sixth annual report of the directors of the Egyptian Cotton Mills,
                        Limited, will be. presented to the shareholders at the seventh ordinary
                        general meeting, to be held at Winchester Home, Old Broad street, London, on
                        Thursday, the 25th inst. The following is the text of the report The
                        directors submit herewith the balance sheet and profit and loss account of
                        the com- pany for the year ending 30th September, 1905, duly audited and
                        certified. They regret to announce the death during the summer of their
                        chairman, Mr. Isidor Ellbogen, of Paris. His place has not yet been filled.
                        You will remember that at the last annual meeting,' which took place very
                        late, in April a second or additional report-to that made up at- 30th-
                        September, 1904, was read, which gave the position of your undertaking up to
                        date That additional report was of a very gloomy nature, the outlook at that
                        time causing your directors considerable uneasiness. In May, however, your
                        affairs began to look considerably brighter, and from then to the dosing of
                        this financial year we have had a very successful run, which altered the
                        final results completely, as will be seen from a perusal of the accompanying
                        balance sheet.</p>
                    <p>Your directors, wish to draw your, attention to the following point, that,
                        whereas the profit on manufacture last year was £992 10s 3d., this year it
                        is as much as £14,409 6s. 10d. This increase has been brought about by the
                        good margins we have Obtained between the cost of raw cotton and the sale
                        price of our goods, con- sequent, to a large extent; upon the great wave ‘
                        of prosperity in the cotton trade, which bene- fited us during the last five
                        months and caused a very good demand for our cloth and yarns, and also by
                        the considerable' reduction in the cost of manufacture on previous years,
                        owing to the increase in the output of the mill. Your directors, since the
                        closing of the books, have arranged to suppress the selling agency which up
                        to the present has been so expensive to your company, and in its place have
                        appointed a salaried salesman.' They are confident that this course will
                        effect a consider- able saving to the company in the future, without in any
                        way reducing its volume of sales. No depreciation has been written off the :
                        plant and machinery, but your directors consider that the considerable
                        increase in the value of your land since its purchase may be regarded as in
                        some measure a set-off against the depreciation that has' taken place on.
                        the remainder of your property since commencing work. The goods made at the
                        mill have greatly improved in quality and sell easily and well. In
                        conclusion; your directors feel that your company has now weathered a
                        critical period ; in its exigence, and that, given ordinary, conditions of
                        trade, the outlook for the future in considerably more hopeful.</p>

                    <head>FINANCIAL ADVISERS NOTE.</head>
                    <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette, Sir, -I happened to take up a copy, of
                        the 'Egyptian Gazette,’’ with the Financial Ad- viser’s Note, which is very
                        interesting to people in this country. I think, however, that a word to calm
                        the fears which the Financial Adviser seems to have in reference to the
                        excess of imports over exports would not be out of place. Taking the figures
                        as they stand, it would not be at all surprising if this differ- ence
                        consisted entirely of profit, but in any case a disparity cf this kind need
                        give rise to no uneasiness. This suggestion that "we are paying for our
                        imports with capital provided by the foreign investor" is very far fetched,
                        and to judge by the Adviser’s subsequent artiole it would appear as if the
                        foreign in- vestor, who is no doubt an essential, and is both beneficial and
                        useful in a country of rapid development, was a sort of bogey haunting his
                        thoughts even "in cathedra.”</p>
                    <p>Comparison of the imports and exports in the United Kingdom and the United
                        States, for example, show enormous differences, which can only be accounted
                        for in the most round- about way. The truth that 'every import demandds an
                        export and vice versa is very illusory. It is highly probable that in the
                        present case the profits arising from trade are mere wanted in specie than
                        in any other form, and the figures would point to the country being somewhat
                        bare of precious metals. If you care to insert this letter, I think it might
                        be worth while doing so — Yours truly,</p>

                    <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                    <p>Sir,—Apropos of the Note, I may mention that there is one passage that has
                        caused some surprise in Alexandria. The author therein states that it is
                        time to do something for the third class passenger on the railways, and not
                        only for the first class passenger and the alien merchant prince. Now, in
                        the first place, I understand that this way of speaking of our local
                        merchants has not been highly appre- ciated in our town, and it seems to me
                        not to be particularly good taste to refer to such an important class in
                        such a facetious strain. After all the Alexandrian merchants are an
                        important class in this country and it is a pity to entitle them in such
                        terms.— I am, etc. Enquirer.</p>

                            Cols. Mizagushi and Yoshikawa, late of Kuroki’s forces. In con-
                            versation with one of the Japanese officers, many of whom, by the way,
                            seem to be better acquainted with German than English, I learned that
                            they were all very delighted to return to Japan. Contrary, however, to
                            other reports, they expressed themselves as fairly well satisfied with
                            their treatment. They especially spoke well of the courteous behaviour
                            of Russian officers with whom they had been associated. There also
                            seemed no desire on the part of any of them either to disparage their
                            late, enemies or to mini' mize the fact that they considered it might
                            have been more satisfactory to have fought out the war to a finish,
                            instead. of conclud- ing a peace in which, from a diplomatic point of

                    <head>EGYPT’S TRADE. NOVEMBER IMPORTS.</head>
                    <p>Anyone giving a casual glance at the Customs return for November,, and
                        comparing them with the same period last year, would be liable to arrive at
                        the incorrect conclusion that trade during tho month in question.received a.
                        somewhat severe check. It is true that the total imports only-amounted to
                        L.E. 1,969,345 against L.E. 2,447,129 in 1904, the decrease being L.E.
                        477,784, but it the must be remembered that the clearances during November
                        and December last year were phenomenally, heavy. About that time 'merchants
                        arid retailers, through commission agents, apparently all thought it
                        necessary to lay in heavy stocks, presumably on the assumption that the
                        country would readily assimilate tho Fame. There is no doubt that in many
                        trades the theory was a false one, and buyer's have had to curtail their
                        purchases this year.</p>
                    <p>In November 1904 the gross imports totalled L.E. 2,447,129 against L.E.
                        1,652,231 Jot the same month’ the previous year, the difference being an
                        increase of no less than L.E. 794,898. This latter sum included such
                        substantial gains as L.E. 154,580 in cotton fabrics, L.E. 126,699 in wood,
                        and fifteen other increases of over L.E. 15,000 each. In view of this
                        enormous expansion, it is hardly astonishing to find that the present
                        November figures fall considerably short of those for 1904, but the fact
                        that they are L E. 317,114 greater than the returns for 1903 is in itself a
                        proof that trade is not mak- ing a retrogressive movement.</p>
                    <p>Out of the 15 categories into which the whole, of the imports are divided, we
                        find that, compared with 1904, only two of them show an increase for
                        November viz: "Cereals” and “Chemical Products” the latter being a very
                        minor division may practically be elimi- nated. Every other group was down,
                        the losses ranging from L.E. 267,356 in textiles to under L.E. 1,000 in
                        paper etc.</p>
                    <p>With the exceptions of sacks and carpets (the former due to tho requirements
                        of the cotton season) each class under textiles was lower than last year.
                        There is no doubt mer- chants are finding the present season a bed one for
                        Manchester goods, though thanks to large, arrivals during February, March
                        and April, the Customs figures for cotton fabrics only show a loss of L E.
                        31,481. from the 1st January. For November, however, the returns for this
                        particular class wore L.E. 155,557 lower than in 1904 Woollen goods, which
                        are L.E. 94,709 down on the year, lost L.E. 40,982 during the month.</p>
                    <p>The classification comprising timber, coal, furniture, etc;, had a drop of
                        L.E. 122 743, the loss on the first named being L.E. 55 527 and on coal L.E.
                        57882. Duty was paid on 54,893 tons against 119796 in 1904, the decrease
                        being thus 64903 tons.</p>
                    <p>The metal class, which showed an expansion of L. E. 110,235 for October,
                        shared in the falling off during November to the extent of L. E. 60,192, the
                        main contributions to this figure being. "Iron and ironwork” with a loss of
                        L. E. 48,400 and “BrasS, copper and bronze” goods L. E. 16,553 The returns
                        here would have been worse had it not been for a slight activity in the
                        imports of machinery, including engine, which were up by some L.E. 24,000.
                        No railway or tramway rolling stock was passed through the Customs during
                        the month, whereas last year the arrivals were valued at L. E. 10,630.</p>
                    <p>The wine, liquor and oil group had a loss of L. E. 35,675, mainly due to a
                        shrinkage of L. E. 29,117 in the petroleum figures, which showed a decrease
                        of 138,453 cases and 1,703 tons in clearances.</p>
                    <p>The sugar imports for November were 1,733,531 kilos lower than during- the
                        same * period in 1904, the loss in the value returns J being L. E.
                        54,322.</p>
                    <p>The only merchant’s for whom November produced satisfactory increases were
                        those deal- ing in wheat, maize and flour,—though the drug and chemical
                        trade did a larger business by L.E.(indistinguishable number) than last
                        year. Month by month the cereal class is going ahead, and we are now
                        L.E.(indistinguishable number)higher than last year for the period 1st
                        January to 30th November. For the month under discussion, the wheat imports
                        were up by 4,350,799 kilos, and floor by 3,868,470 kilos, the increased
                        value being L.E. 33,207 and L.E. 31,833 respectively. The maize returns were
                        higher by LE. 44,738. It is only natural when a large decrease takes place
                        in the total returns for the country that we should have correspondingly
                        heavy shrinkage, in Great Britain’s figures. It is, therefore, not
                        surprising to find that, out of the gross decrease of L.E. 477,784 the home
                        country was responsible for no less than L.E. 278,258. A perusal of the
                        fifth column of our usual monthly statistics shows the large decreases of
                        L.E. 155,835 in cotton fabrics, L.E. 56,968 in coal, and L E. 25,148 in
                        woollen goods. These are pitted against increases of L.E. 7,869 in
                        locomotives, L.E,5,991 in furniture and L.E. 3,022 in the category “Other
                        colonial produce.”</p>
                    <p>The member who very kindly compiles our Manchester Goods Report has touched
                        on the reason for the tremendous drop in the returns for cotton fabric, and
                        it is;therefore unneces- sary for us to say anything on the subject. We may
                        perhaps just mention that the imports of cotton goods during November were
                        1,350,641 kilos and 661,011 meters less than during the same period last
                        year.</p>
                    <p>After Manchester goods, the heavie t diminution occurred in coal, where the
                        values cleared were down by L.E 56,968. The figures from the 1st January for
                        this item are now L.E. 69,667 lower for the corresponding months of
                        1904.</p>
                    <p>The returns for woollen fabrics suffered to the extent of L.E. 25,148 during
                        November.</p>
                    <cb n="4"/>
                    <p>The "Iron and ironwork” figures were lower by L.E. 13,233, and “Brass Copper
                        and bronze” goods decreased to the extent of L.E. 5,855 Under the heading
                        -of “Instruments”, a shrinkage of L.E. 8,996 took place, after which came
                        losses in “Jewellery’’ and ‘ Ironmongery" of L.E. 5,318 and L.E. 4,291
                        respectively. As regards the increases, compared with 1904, there was only
                        one class under which the expansion was more than L.E. 5,000 viz :
                        “Locomotives" with a gain of L.E. 7,869. The total imports of steam engines
                        were -valued at L.E. 8,650, of which Great Britain contributed L.E. 8,361,
                        Germany being responsible for the remaining L.E. 289.</p>
                    <p>The combined furniture returns for all countries were practially identical
                        with those of last year, though’ England’s share was L.E. 5,991 greater.

                    <head>EGYPTIAN ANTIQUITIES. BRITISH COMPETITORS.</head>
                    <p>"We hope can only that the authorities at the Treasury are aware of the,
                        competition which is taking place in the purchase of Egyp- tian and Assyrian
                        antiquities, and will deal liberally with the British Museum.” In these
                        words oneof the' leading English Egyptologists, in conversation with a
                        ‘Standard’ representative, summed up a situation which is causing some
                        concern amongst British anti- quarians at the present moment. It is an open;
                        secret that the museums of other countries (especially those of Germany) are
                        running the trustees of the British Museum very hard, particularly as they
                        are prepared to pay what a few years ago would have been considered fabulous
                        prices for good objects. Besides this, the Egyptologist remarked, "it has
                        become fashionable for American millionaires to give to their native towns
                        an Egyptian museum or museums, and these institutions send out enterprising
                        agents to Egypt who, having an abundant supply of money, snap up everything
                        in the shape of Egyptian or Assyrian anti- quities. Certain it is that if
                        the trustees of the British Museum are not assisted (indistinguishable)
                        effectually than has been the case hitherto, and the objects offered to them
                        are not pur- chased as they appear, the chance of acquiring them will be
                        lost for ever.”</p>
                    <p>Many priceless treasures have slipped through the fingers of the British
                        Museum for want of Treasury grants, and in the ab sence of that patriotic
                        sentiment amongst wealthy Englishmen which is so conspicuous amongst our
                        friends on the other side of the Atlantic. Only during the past week it has
                        been reported on the best. authority that Mr. Rockefeller has commissioned
                        an American Egyptologist to survey the whole of the Sudan, beginning at
                        Khartoum, and going to the sea, and has given him the means to collect any
                        antiquities he may meet with.</p>
                    <p>Those win remember the department of Egyptian and Assyrian antiquities in the
                        British. Museum in the old days, during the directorship of Dr. Birch, will
                        recollect that as acquisitions arrived they were simply damped into the
                        museum, -and that owing to insufficiency of staff and pother reasons full
                        use was not made of the valuable information acquired, and the objects were
                        not.arranged any consecutive order. When the great revival of interest in
                        Egyptian antiquities took place, however, after the Egyptian war, a flood of
                        relics poured into the national treasure house, and the authorities of the
                        British Museum decided to set their house in order.</p>
                    <p>With the view of making the collection valuable not only to the recondite
                        archaeologist and antiquarian, but also as a great educa- tional
                        institution, they inaugurated a new policy, the immediate effect of which is
                        that each gallery, and room in the department has been overhauled in the
                        coarse of the last 16 year? Practically every room has been fitted with new
                        cases,and the objects are now exhibit-, ed in a manner which enables them to
                        be seen and appreciated. They were never so well seen before. In addition to
                        this, the trustees ordered that every object should be labelled fully, and
                        this work has been going on steadily now for a considerable number of years.
                        Year by year, first the Nineveh gallery, then the Nimroud gallery,- the
                        Assyrian saloon, the Babylonian room, and the four Egyptian rooms one by one
                        emerge from the bends of the authorities rearranged and relabelled. It has
                        been pleasing also to note the appearance of three excellent guide books,
                        fully illustrat- ed, relating to the antiquities exhibited in the rooms
                        referred to.</p>
                    <p>But it is in the Egyptian Gallery, which for many years remained in the same
                        condition, that the. change is most marked. A com- prehsnsive system of
                        re-arrangement is here manifest. The vestibule, which was formerly a sort of
                        storeroom for antiquities of all periods, has been emptied and refilled with
                        cases, and has a new hut priceless collection of monu- ments of the first
                        six dynasties of Egyptian civilisation. One may be mistaken, but one does
                        not remember having seen anything similar to tLe finest of these objects
                        anywhere else, except in Cairo. The Mastaba door of P-tah-mes is at once a
                        valuable, historical, and interesting object. Walking down the gallery from
                        north to south, a great many new objects are to be seen, and these, it is
                        under- stood, have been acquired within the last few years. The authorities
                        are making the re- arrangement chronologically, and in order to carry their

                    <p>Despite the effects cf the foreigner to out bid us in the Egyptian antiquity

                        tional value of the department is considerable. The Assyrian and Babylonian
                        objects appeal to every student in the world, and four fifths of all' the
                        history of these two countries written in clay, is in the British Museum
                        Unquestionably the public is getting full value for the meagre amount of
                        money voted for the museum. The director, Sir Edward Maunde Thompson, and
                        the keeper of the department, Dr. Wallis Budge, Are to be con- gratulated
                        upon the success which has attend- ed their efforts to popularise the most
                        ancient and valuable collection of antiquities in the world.</p>

                        <head>MODERN EGYPT.</head>
                        <p>"Al Moayad” says :—Egypt, as described by Herodotus and other writers
                            after him, is a wonderful country, but the state of the Egyptian
                            Government nowadays is much more surprising. All though it his got a
                            very wide reputation for dealing out justice and freedom to the nation,
                            and has obtained a great deal of praise arid thanks, the Government’ has
                            still many serious defects. On its heads are bestowed the qualities of
                            deities. For example, Lord Cromer is entitled the ‘Creator of Modern
                            Egypt” and so on. The external condition of the country, is indeed
                            bright but beyond these outward and visible signs there are many
                            troubles and much misery, proving that the Government pays but little
                            heed to the most essential questions. The Egyptian Go- vernment does not
                            take as its motto.'Work for the welfare of the nation," as other Go-
                            vernments do, and the lack of education and the wretched state of the
                            people afford evidence that the Government does not' deserve any such
                            praise. The British Government, which used to raise no obstacles to
                            personal freedom, has recently decided to reject from England every
                            foreigner who may be found unable to' supply himself with his own,
                            needs. Why does not Egypt, which receives thousands and thousands of
                            foreigners from every part of the world, adopt the same system! It must
                            be noticed that the real danger which menaces Egypt is not the loss of
                            indepen- dence, but the influx of the thousands of people who come every
                            week to live in the alley of the Nile under the protection of the
                            Capitulations. If this danger is not stopped by the Government the
                            foreign elements of the population will preponderate in Egypt, overwhelm
                            the natives, and deprive them of the comforts of life and make the
                            present confusion worse confounded.</p>

                        <p>"AL Moayad” publishes a leading article, seven columns in length; which
                            is the seventh of a series of articles entitled "In the Valley of
                            Thoughts.” It purports to be signed by a native Christian but appears to
                            have been written by a Moslem. Wd make tin following, extracts : The
                            sons of Egypt, who, it was ex- pected, would support us in improving our
                            present condition, have deserted us, and, think- that they are quite
                            secure, they gave themselves up to a licentious life and spoiled, our
                            state of society. Thus, it is no wonder if our most cherished belongings
                            pass finally into the hands of the people of the West.</p>
                        <p>What a shame ! Do the Egyptians expect, after such behavior and such a
                            tacit consent, to secure their own prosperity in their mother- land? O,
                            my brethren, what excuse can you offer for yourselves? The English are
                            human beings just as you are. Why do you neglect the land of your home
                            while they, being surrounded by its fortunes, take the greatest interest
                            in it? Do you think to find a better and more pros perous home ? You are
                            diligent and intelligent, Europeans, you have been the first to study
                            our country and learn of. our shortcomings, and so you benefit by our
                            precious land as long as you fee us slumbering. You are wonderfully hard
                            workers, and we are wonderfully slothful. But we are the sons of those
                            forefathers who filled the world with wisdom and culture and who held
                            themselves far above the potentates of the Eastern Empires and the
                            Persian kings. Our youthful countrymen have filled their minds with the
                            longing for vain luxury and thereby have lost precious time ; but should
                            they begin energetically to put an end to their desperate condition; and
                            better their understanding, the outcome would be good and they would get
                            back what they had been losing for so long.</p>
                        <p>We clearly observe those who get their education in European languages
                            look entirely to the countries of Europe, we can see also marry young
                            natives wearing hats ‘a la mode' and masquerading as Europeans because
                            they have studied the European languages much more than, their own. This
                            class of youth can be noticed doing its utmost to adopt European habits,
                            style, fashions, and sentiments, knowing nothing or very little of their
                            own country and people. How can such people love their home ? He was
                            quite right who said, "In losing your language you lose yourself.” The
                            English are politically ruining our language with a vow to undermining
                            our society and undoing our unity for ever. Some people, however, would
                            say, perhaps, "How is that did not the English reform our land and
                            beautify our capital !' Are not our people living in a glorious state of
                            unlimited freedom, through the reforms the English have intro- duced !"
                            Wo.reply to such questions in the affirmative, but add 'that our
                            friends, the English, are only working for themselves. They are
                            improving the land of Egypt for their own benefit and not for the sake
                            of the natives, who have not there’ y advanced to any hotter state. The
                            authority of the Go vernment being in British hands our Egyptian
                            Ministers, who occupy the highest positions, find very little to do for
                            the welfare of their Fatherland.</p>

                    <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette:.</p>
                    <p>Honorable Sir:—Kindly oblige the author by inserting in the columns of the
                        organ of freethought and civilisation, the "Gazette,” the following laconic,
                        medico-phraseological remarks.</p>
                    <p>The elicited reply of the honorable medical gentlemen is only partially
                        enlightening, to the mass in general on their decision regarding the medical
                        practitioners’ fde. The essential part is still, unanswered, i e. to
                        elucidate to the public the ones responsible for this deci- sion, so that
                        those who do not wish to pay the fee decided upon, may know whom to
                        avoid.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless, their reply testifies to the Alexandrians and the inhabitants
                        of Egypt in general will severely ensured the medical body of Alexandria as
                        non-scientific . and Mammon worshippers, that tire body thus collectively by
                        the Press and otherwise, did not all participate in these proceedings. The
                        word "Order” from a phraseo-philolo- gical stand point of view implies a
                        harsh mandate to enforce that upon which decision . fell. This is legible
                        but’but to governments where the failure to comply with, or carry oat, an
                        order, can be enforced.</p>
                    <p>In modern usage, this is limited to military spheres and districts where
                        'partial or complete martial law is proclaimed, such as In some of the
                        Russian Provinces.</p>
                    <p>Civil authorities generally call “Attention” simply to what they proclaim. No
                        one dreams of martial law proclaimed at Alexandria, for it is too well
                        governed to have affairs leading thereto. Yet the honorable gentlemen employ
                        the word "Order” for what they have decided. This is well instanced by the
                        Director General of the Sanitary Dept., when he calls practitioners'
                        "Attention" regarding antidiph- theric serum and the sporadic cases of
                        diphthe- ria .that have already infested certain parts. He does not “Order”
                        the doctors concerned, but merely calls their ”Attention," though there are
                        certain laws that impose certain obligatory duties on practitioners to the
                        State in connection with the public Health. This calling -of "Attention'
                        inflicts penalties on those who fail to execute the caution; Yet with this,
                        the sharp word "Order” was not used. If by the decision, is only meant the
                        few pertaining to the honorable Society, the form of the decision as
                        published, impressed the public and the reading world at large, with the
                        idea that it was the mandatary of the Medical Body of Alexandria; this
                        presumption, of course, is not entertained by the honorable gentlemen, for
                        they are quite aware that they forgot to consult the opinion of their
                        colleagues of the City.</p>
                    <p>When the decision was first made public, it ought to have been so formulated
                        or phrased a9 to inform the public that 'the decision was not the ordeal of
                        the Medical Corps of Alex andria. It is hoped that the respected gentle- men
                        will make known to the public those who thus decided that sequent blame may
                        not fall on the shoulders of the others who did not share this opinion.</p>
                    <p>By the elucidative answer the honorable gentleman gave, the public panic
                        which was unfoundedly aroused, ought now to be appeased to serene
                        tranquillity and censure no further the Medical Body, for in their last
                        communica- tion the honorable gentlemen concerned,retract their former
                        decision to cling to humanitarian- ism. Truly yours,</p>

                        giving the gun-layers more praotice during the current year, that the annual
                        practice allowance of six-pounder ammunition, for those vessels shall be
                        increased, from 40 to 80 rounds per gun. The attention of officers command
                        of torpedo-boat destroyers has also been, drawn to the necessity of
                        exercising the utmost care in carrying oat target practice, bearing in mind
                        that the object of all such practice is training for battle, the gunnery
                        efficiency for which is judged by the present battle practice. The Admiralty
                        has ordered that a derailed summary of all mis- fires, delays, and failures,
                        to fire are to be included in the report of the captain, and the attention
                        of officers in command of flotillas has been called to the necessity of
                        furnishing this information.</p>

                    <head>CHRONIQUE THEATRALE THEATRE ZIZINIA</head>
                    <p>La troupe de Comédie 'française a débute hier soir au Zizinia par la pièce de
                        Molièré "Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme".</p>
                    <p>Il y avait peu de monde dans Ja salle, mais les loges étaient bien garnies. A
                        peine Coquelin Cadet a-t-il fait son apparition sur la. scène qu’il a été
                        salué par de vifs applaudissement! La pièce a été bien exécutée jusque dam
                        ses moindres détails : ce qui frappe, en effet, do- l’abord, c'est le choix
                        judicieux qui a été fait des éléments secondaires et l’habileté avec
                        laquelle lès rôles ont été distribués : 'à M, Daragon, le rôle belliqueux du
                        maître d’armes, à Al. Bayle celui plus- retors de maître de philosophie, à
                        M. Fremont celui de maître de danse et à M. Lorain celui de maître de mu-
                        sique. M. Monteux, que nous avons déjà eu l’occasion d’apprécier l’année
                        dernière a é é insinuant à souhait dans le rôle de Dorante. Lis actrices out
                        toutes été ravissantes : Mme Patry en Mme Jourdain, Mme Franqueten Dorimène,
                        Mme Baylat en Nicole et Mme Guerraz en Lucile. Mlle Mariette Lamberti a été
                        exquise dans la danse de là Gavotte au ler acte.</p>
                    <p>Qaant à M. Coquelin Cadet, nous n'avons guère besoin de faire valoir ses
                        qualités, car il est universellement goûté et applaudi. Il a fort bien
                        personnifié le bourgeois gentilhomme dat s ses manies de grandeur.</p>
                    <p>Voilà pour l’interprétation. La comédie elle- même n’a pas plu à tout le
                        monde. Que que uns, lui trouvent l’air an peu démodé. C’est cepen- dant
                        une-oomédie d’an genre qui ne peut vieillir, car si certains tours de
                        phrases sont maintenant hors de mode, le thème lui-même ' reste éternel : le
                        bourgeois gentilhomme a tou- jours existé et existera toujours.</p>
                    <p>La représentation a pris fin avec trois mono logues de Coquelin Cadet :
                        "Salut à Molière", "l’Art d’être Moderne”, et ‘La Grenouille et le. Boeuf”.
                        Inutile de dire que le succès a été ... bœuf.</p>

                    <p>Caire, 11 janvier.</p>
                    <p>Le taux d’escompte à Londres vient d’être diminué de £ à 3 f. Cette nouvelle
                        réduction indique; assurément, que l’aisance monétaire continue à
                        s’accentuer sur les marchés finan- ciers.</p>
                    <p>Le Consolidé anglais est resté invarié hier à 89 3/8. Les valeurs égyptiennes
                        ont également clôturé à leurs cours de la veille, à la seule exception de la
                        National Bank, qui a encore perdu &amp; de livre à 25 1/2.</p>
                    <p>A Pans, l’action Crédit Fonder est rensei- gnée en baisse de 4 francs à 801.
                        Pur contre, la Banque d’Athènes a haussé de 2 francs à 134. Ici, le marché
                        des valeurs a été, ce matin encore, calme avec très peu d’affaires et des
                        cours généralement faibles, notamment dans le compartiment des Banques.</p>
                    <p>La National a fléchi de 1/16 à 25 11/16 ; la nouvelle a baissé à 24 7/8.</p>
                    <p>L’Agricole a clôturé offerte à 9 9/16 ; là nouvelle est restée a 9 1/8.</p>
                    <p>La cassa di Sconto a perdu 3 francs à 312 ; l’action nouvelle est également
                        tombée de 211 à' 208.</p>
                    <p>Par contre, la Banque d'Athènes a regagné 1 franc à 134.</p>
                    <p>Le Comptoir Financier et Commercial s’est maintenu entre 4 9/16 et 4 5/8.</p>
                    <p>Le Crédit Foncier a avancé de 2 francs à 804. L'obligation à lots 1886 est
                        revenue a 333 ; la nouvelle reste à 274.</p>
                    <p>La Béhéra a fait 35 1/8.</p>
                    <p>L’Immobilière a atteint 365 pour clôturer à 359, en hausse de 4 francs sur le
                        cours d’hier. L’Alexandria Ramleh Railway s’est inscrite à 6 7/8 acheteurs.
                        Les Dividendes Tramway.; d’Alexandrie sont revenus a 325.</p>
                    <p>La Delta Light esc faible à 11 5/8.</p>
                    <p>L’action Agncjie da Nil a, perdu 2 francs à 248. La Wardan Estate a clôturé à
                        5 7/8, en baisse de 3/8.</p>
                    <p>Dans le groupe des Hôtels, les Nungovich ont été offerts a 11 11/16. Les
                        Baehler sont revenus a 3 13/16 ; les Anglo-American à 5 7/8 ; les Upper
                        Egypt à 5 3/16.</p>
                    <p>Parmi les petites valeurs, les Estates sont toujours demandés à 1 19/32; les
                        New Egyptian s’inscrivent à 28 sh. 9. Le Trust Glymenopoulo a fait 1 3/16.
                        Les Oasis sont à 0 7/8 ache teurs, et la and Soda à 19 sh. 9.</p>
                    <p>Suivant nos informations d’Alexandrie, la hausse qui s’est produite sur des
                        actions du Comptoir Financier et Commercial aurait été déterminée par la
                        nouvelle que cette Société se propose distribuer prochainement un dividende
                        provisoire.</p>
                    <p>On annonce que la propriété dite "Batigelli Aillas” située près le Savoy
                        Hotèl, qui avait récemment été achetée par l’Egyptiàn Estates Company, a été
                        revendue, ces jours derniers, à un riche indigène au prix de £ 14 le mètre.
                        Cette petite affaire laisserait un assez joli bénéfice’ à la Société.</p>
                    <p>Les cours du coton sont arrivés en baisse d’A- mérique. Le Mai a perdu 11 et
                        l’Octobre 13 points. Le disponible continue à rester invarié à 11.75.</p>
                    <p>Les arrivages ont.été de 43,000 balles contre 28,000.</p>
                    <p>Le marché de Liverpool est également plus faible.</p>
                    <p>La baisse est attribuée an rapport des G i un ers estimant à 9,721,773 le
                        nombre des balles égre- nées an 31 décembre dernier. Cette évaluation
                        semblerait indiquer une récolte supérieure à 10,650,000 balles.</p>
                    <p>Ici, le Mars a ouvert, ce matin, à 15 5/8 pour cloture a 15 11/16.</p>

                        <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers
                            the accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by
                            which they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange
                            them as accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that
                            none of them are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home
                            there are several things to be considered. To begin with there is the
                            difference in climate between Egypt and the various points at which you

                        <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                            January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so
                            warm as Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more
                            uniformly warm than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt
                            far too early in the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is
                            perfect. The warmest place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                        <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent
                            at sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on
                            each of the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of
                            Europe.</p>

                        <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth,
                            Southhampton, London or Liverpool—occupy about 4 days. The short ones
                            are as follows:—</p>

                        <p>The steamers, of the P.&amp;O. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageriea
                            Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines
                            are also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by
                            travellers to Egypt.</p>
                        <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to
                            Alexandria, without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made
                            without change in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                        <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                            Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German
                            Levant line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                        <cb n="5"/>
                        <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by
                            P.&amp;O. Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd
                            Trieste Vienna express from Alexandria.</p>
                        <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little
                            luggage is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several
                            good and responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed
                            charge to deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                        <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by
                            the fast Mail Steamers “Osiris" and “Isis” to Brindisi. One of these
                            leaves port Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the
                            Indian <cb n="6"/>mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                        <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                            attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats"
                            having been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to
                            Brindisi. If you are going straight through to England you will find the
                            train waiting at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without
                            changing. It has complete arrangements for sleeping and eating on board,
                            and you should arrive in London on the fifth day from leaving Port
                            Said.</p>

                        <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.’s steamers
                            which leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to
                            TAORMENA, one of the most charming and popular places on the island.
                            Giardini is the station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina
                            is most delightful, occupying about one hour. In and around the town is
                            much to interest the visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but
                            restored under the Romans. CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent
                            of Etna and here also is a fine Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and
                            Saracenic remains that are found all over the island, are an endless
                            sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting history, having been a
                            Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C. 413, and taken by
                            the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb is to be
                            seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                            about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                            delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city.
                            The Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of
                            S. Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The
                            Cathedral, Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also
                            worth a visit.</p>

                    <div type="item">
                        <head>CENTRAL ITALY.</head>
                        <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every
                            Wednesday during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3
                            days.</p>
                        <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino
                            Co.’s steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave
                            it without wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely
                            places on its bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that
                            takes you to Sorrento [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                        <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can
                            will devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and
                            interesting portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are
                            too well-known to need comment here.</p>
                        <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five
                            hours brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent
                            admiring the City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence
                            itself the churches and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the
                            local promenades and excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is
                            the most attractive and fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the
                            Viale dei Colli, one of the finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago,
                            goes winding up through the hills a distance of four miles. The most
                            delightful excursion outside Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its
                            Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea level. This is made first by ordinary
                            train from Florence to St. Ellero, thence by cog-wheel railway to
                            Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks takes an hour, and most
                            striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                        <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; hero there is a
                            fine Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night
                            should if possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile
                            at sunset.</p>
                        <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near
                            Pisa and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient
                            half-way house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable
                            and the air and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                        <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy,
                            with the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European
                            cities and a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and
                            deliciously cool breezes from the surrounding mountains and the
                            Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                        <p>The patriarchal home of Italy’s most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                            gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings,
                            are a constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn
                            in Genoa. Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches
                            containing exquisite marble columns and historical paintings, and the
                            incomparable Campo Santo filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                        <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                        <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                            Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful
                            windows illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and
                            the monumental cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                        <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                            SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal
                            springs, change trains at Borgo San Donino and in half-an-hour you are
                            at Salsomaggiore.</p>

                        <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                            delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                            vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage
                            or bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every
                            turn. The approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any
                            other sea port. The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of
                            the sea, no hills behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of
                            Campaniles appear above the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering
                            town rises like a fairy mirage out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                        <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                            lakes.</p>
                        <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in
                            one-and-a-quarter hours by train by way of Monza :</p>
                        <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is
                            very beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                            enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo,
                            Cadenabbia, and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio
                            opposite. The walk from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio
                            is most enjoyable. A steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake
                            Lugano in three-quarters of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in
                            two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                            is an excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated
                            above the town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings,
                            “Entombment," by Ciseri, and ‘Tho Flight into Egypt,” by Bramantion.</p>

                        <p>Many people visit Greece after wintering in Egypt, as it is so easily
                            reached from Alexandria ; the climate in April is charming. The best

                        <p>It is worth while to spend a few days in CORFU on account of the beauty
                            of the scenery. There is also good snipe and quail shooting to be
