                <p>INDIAN COTTON.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="bold">The reckless gamblers who ran up the price of American cotton so
                        high that many Lanca Eshire manufacturers almost ceased production have
                        proved beneficial instruments after all. Owing to their manipulations,
                        scientific cotton cultivation has already made a successful start in many
                        parts of our Empire, and there can be little doubt that in the course of a
                        few years, it will be self-supplying at reasonable prices, and so be
                        independent of New Orleans, The Bombay Agricultural Society has even gone a
                        step farther. India has always been a large producer of the coarser
                        varieties, but until now, no systemátic effort was ever made to grow those
                        finer sorts which the Lancashire mills require to maintain the high quality
                        of their manufactured pro- ducts Apart from this, the local industry.
                        absorbed more and more of the raw material every year, while of late years
                        Japan has been a large and regular purchaser in India. The supply
                        consequently had a more or less intermittent character, and could never, be
                        depended on to make good any serious failure of the American crop.
                        Recognising the favourable opening thus presented for extending and
                        improving the cultivation of the plant in India, the Bombay Agricul- tural
                        Society experimented with the intro- duction of American and Egyptian
                        varieties into Scinde, where the conditions of soil and elimate are almost
                        identical with those of the Nile Valley. It was a risky venture, as pre-
                        vious attempts of a kindred character had more or less failed. But in the
                        present in- stance, the success is so complete in every respect that Scinde
                        bids fair to take rank as one of the greatest cotton-growing countries in
                        the world. The sandy and largely barren area of the province could never
                        have reached that destiny had not the Indian Government conferred upon it
                        the inestimable boon of perennial irrigation with overflow water from the

                <p>"PEACE WITH HONOUR."</p>
                <p>LONDON, October 28. Mr. Balfour, speaking at Southampton, stated that the matter
                    had been referred to an inter- *national enquiry court. He said that events have
                    happened which have stirred to the depths the feelings of all Englishmen and all
                    English- speaking nations of the world, in fact, he thought he might say of all
                    civilised Europe; but, as far as he was able to see, war would be avoided
                    without dishonour to us. Two stories had been put before them with the result
                    that the matter would be referred to impartial international enquiry, thought it
                    is impossible to doubt which of the two versions is true. The Russian
                    representatives would participate, and both sides would abide by the decision of
                    the, tribunal, which would consider all questions at issue.</p>
                <p>Mr. Balfour further said that Russia had</p>
                <p>promised to make an enquiry, and had ordered the detention at Vigo of that part
                    of the Baltic Fleet which was concerned in the attack. Officers held responsible
                    would not proceed to the Far East but would be tried and adequately punished.

                    she was thrown under an omnibus. She was at once removed to St. George's
                    Hospital, but was found to be dead. The wheels of the omnibus passed over her
                    sneck.</p>
                <p>No one for the moment thought of warning the family. A stranger picked up the
                    bicycle, which had on it the address. He took it to Cheyne-gardens, warning the
                    servant to break the news gently. The husband, however, was in the hall and
                    heard the sad intelligence con- veyed by the stranger.</p>

                <p>SERIOUS ALEXANDRIA FIRE</p>
                <p>"LA REFORME" PRINTING OFFICES DESTROYED.</p>
                <p>A fire which at one time threatened to be attended with very disastrous
                    consequences broke out yesterday afternoon between four and five o'clock in
                    Penasson's printing office in General Earl Street.</p>
                <p>The outbreak was due to the fall of a boy with a paraffin oil lamp in his hand,
                    in the bookbinding department of the establishment, P which is installed in a
                    loft about 3 feet from the roof.</p>
                <p>The fire spread to the adjoining piles of E paper with alarming rapidity, and by
                    4.55 o'clock, when the Fire Brigade received the alarm by telephone, the whole
                    of that portion of the building was like a roaring furnace, the flames shooting
                    out of the windows and lapping the second-story balconies.</p>
                <p>At 5.2 p.m., when our representative was on the spot, the Fire Brigade arrived
                    upon the scene under the superintendence of Firemaster Lynn, who at once set
                    about coping with the flames. Hoses were brought to play on the burning mass and
                    every effort was made to save the adjoining property. These efforts were happily
                    crowned with success, for in the space of 25 minutes, thanks to the energetic
                    efforts of the Brigade; all danger of the fire spreading</p>
                <p>was over.</p>
                <p>At one time it was feared that the con- flagration would spread to the dwelling
                    houses above, but the hoses were kept playing on the roof over the fire, which
                    was successfully confined to the corner of the building where it broke out.
                    Considerable damage was however done, amounting, it is said, to £2,000 to
                    £3,000, mainly among the type and paper which were used for the printing of the
                    Réforme newspaper. All this, we believe, was destroyed.</p>
                <p>The boy who was the cause of the outbreak has been missing since, and no trace of
                    him can be discovered. It is sarmised that he must have fled from the building
                    panic- stricken.</p>
                <p>The fire broke out again among the smoking embers about 10.30, but was
                    immediately got under by the firemen who were on the spot.</p>
                <p>We understand that the loss was not covered by insurance.</p>
                <p>Much credit is due to Superintendent Lynn and the firemen under him for their
                    promptness in subduing the flames. Half-an-hour before the outbreak was
                    extinguished, no one would have dared to suggest that the flames would be
                    completely mastered before they had gutted the whole building. The Brigade
                    received a good deal of ready assistance from some of the spectators, especially
                    Mr. Harry Barker, who was nothing loathe in hauling about the hoses.</p>
                <p>FIRE AT RAS-EL-TIN PALACE.</p>
                <p>A fire broke out in the kitchens of Ras-el-Tin Palace about 9 o'clock yesterday
                    morning, but was extinguished with buckets of water, before much damage was
                    done, by the Palace fire- brigade.</p>

                <p>On Wednesday night we heard the best performance yet given by Sig. Castellano's
                    company, and a far better performance than the great majority given at the Cairo
                    or Alex- andria opera-houses. Puccini's Manon should end with the 3rd act; the
                    fourth is rather an anti-climax after the extraordinary power of the scene on
                    the quay at Havre. Signor Apos- tolou's performance was in every way worthy of
                    his reputation. He made the very most of his voice, phrased admirably, and acted
                    as well as ever. In a word, his performance was that of a thorough artist. The
                    part of Manon was taken by Siga. Malaspina, who filled the rôle with great
                    success. She made a charming heroine, acting admirably and singing at her very
                    best, and her rendering of the beautiful opening air in the 2nd act was so
                    excellent that had we shut our eyes we might have ima- gined ourselves in one of
                    the great opera-houses -but we could not shut them.</p>

                <p>HASHISH DEN IN TANTAH.</p>
                <p>RAID BY POLICE</p>
                <p>(FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT.)</p>
                <p>Tantah, Friday.</p>
                <p>The police made a raid on one of the build- ings in Moudirieh-street three nights
                    ago in a search of hashish. Here, as everywhere, there 1 are certain shops that
                    seem to carry on an ordinary trade but whose principal source t of income is
                    hashish.</p>
                <p>An employé in one of these shops, induced e probably by the reward offered by the
                    authorities for the discovery of the drug, left r the service of his master and
                    went to the c police station to divulge the secret of his late w employer's
                    illicit traffic. After his declaration, T being afraid of remaining here, he was
                    sent off f to Alexandria by the night train. About /2 I o'clock in the morning
                    the police surrounded n the suspected house and entered a flat in the a same
                    building as the shop occupied by one of f the relatives of the shop-owner. Two
                    boxes, containing about 160 kilos of hashish, were p found in the flat.</p>
                <p>The police were unable to enter the shop as U the owner's consul refused to allow
                    this on the s ground that already two searches had been p made recently and had
                    proved unsuccessful, al-s though there were strong evidences that the u drug had
                    been deposited there but had been taken away in time.</p>
                <p>The police kept watch until yesterday, with u the hope of seizing some more of
                    the drug, but b finally gave up the search.</p>
                <p>In one of my previous notes, I had occasion of to call the attention of the
                    responsible autho-m rities to the smuggling of hashish in Tantah. t As in every
                    other town in Egypt, you see f everybody point out the different shops in n
                    which it is sold, the native coffee-shops a where it is smoked, and the
                    different in-s dividuals who are more or less concerned in a the traffic, etc.;
                    and, to cap all, the police w know all about it but keep quiet for certain
                    reasons, only from time to time making con-c traventions to keep up appearances.
                    The great difficulty appears to be to obtain the respective t consuls'
                    permission to search the suspected I premises, and here of course we have to
                    blame those blessed Capitulations.</p>

                <p>SUDDEN DEATH OF MR. ONOFRIO, It is with the 'deepest regret that we have to
                    announce the death of Mr. Francis Onofrio, sub-director of the accounts
                    department, Ministry of the Interior, which occurred at Cajro on Thursday, at
                    about 10.30 p.m. Mr. Onofrio, who had been in failing health for the past 18
                    months, died very suddenly from heart disease. He leaves one daughter, about 20
                    years of age, and unmarried, His wife predeceased him about three years ago. Mr.
                    Onofrio, after having served in the Malta Civil Service, joined the Consular
                    Service in the early sixties and was transferred to the British Consulate at
                    Corfu, and sub- sequently to the Alexandria Consulate. He was appointed
                    Vice-Consul of the Island of Santa Maura (Ionian Islands) in 1877. In 1884 he
                    joined the Egyptian Government service, and was attached to the Cairo City
                    Police. He was transferred to the Ministry of the Interior in March, 1890, as
                    chef du bureau of the ac- counts department, being appointed sub-direc- tor of
                    that department on January 1, 1899. The funeral yesterday was largely attended.
                    There were present Mr. Machell and Mr. Carter Wilson and numerous members of the
                    personnel of the Ministry, with many old friends of the deceased, by many of
                    whom wreaths were sent. The cortège, preceded by police, left the deceased's
                    house at 3.15 p.m. and proceeded on foot to the Catholic Church at the Mousky,

                <p>ALEXANDRIA MUNICIPALITY.</p>
                <p>HOW TO WASTE MONEY.</p>
                <p>A Municipal critic writes:- The Municipality has a large sum to spend an and it
                    is racking its brains how to get rid of it. go The latest hobby is to spend the
                    money on le washing out the Jewel filters. It is said that m this operation will
                    require four thousand cubic re metres of water. This quantity is evidently the
                    exaggerated.</p>
                <p>The water so used, according to M. Arcouda- ea ris, who claims Dr. Bitter's
                    opinion in his favour, Sh can only be employed for the one purpose and ha will
                    afterwards have to be run into the sea. an The sewer the Municipality propose to
                    construct for this purpose will cost from L.E. 25,000 to to L.E. 30,000. In the
                    first place it is worth of noting that Dr. Bitter is by no means an pr advocate
                    of this project, as is shown by the wh following extract from his report. be</p>
                <p>"Les eaux mentionnées au N°4 sont celles ci provenant des filtres pendant la
                    première demi- heure de leur fonctionnement, après lavage, th Un écoulement
                    convenable doit être prévu pour Co se débarrasser de l'eau mentionnée au N° 4 et
                    nu pour les eaux de lavage, de manière que per- re sonne ne puisse s'en
                    approcher ou en faire the usage.</p>
                <p>These precautions are necessary because it would be very unwise to allow the
                    water to be used for drinking or cooking purposes. But because the public is to
                    be prevented. from th thus using the water, it does not follow that a costly
                    sewer must be made, when there are so many other necessary requirements on which
                    the public money could be spent. The water, ro for example, could easily be
                    diverted into the moat of the fortifications, where it would dis-appear by
                    infiltration. All the expense neces- sary would be to construct a cheap conduit,
                    at w a cost of not more than L.E. 100, whereby the in water could be taken from
                    the filters to the W moat, which is not far off. There is no question g of
                    diverting the water into that portion of the moat extending from Rosetta
                    Gate-street to the sea, but the site suggested is between the Rosetta
                    Gate-street and Moharrem Bey station. There can be no inconvenience in such a
                    scheme as for the last six years the large Rosetta Gate A sewer has emptied into
                    the moat, and all the m A liquid matter has disappeared by infiltration. These
                    waters would of course be far less obnoxious than sewage fluid. There is a far
                    better use for this immense quantity of water. It could be used to cleanse our
                    streets and irrigate our gardens. But the Municipality t wants to spend L.E.
                    30,000 on constructing a 8 drain to carry the waters to the sea. Cui bono?
                    Somebody is going to make a good thing o b out of it.</p>
                <p>The Delegation, will object that the portion f of the east sewer from Rosetta
                    Gate-street to t the sea will cost only £12,000. That is true, A but the portion
                    situated between the Gate and -the Mahmoudieh will have to be continued V and
                    the total cost will then exceed £30,000, as above stated. Moreover, the
                    construction of the east sewer is not wanted at all because, firstly, seven
                    years ago, the Municipality spent £1,200 on the continuation of the Rosetta Gate
                    sewer to the sea, and lately £1,000 more for the extension to Silsiley: this
                    drain has been of no use, since the waters have continued to flow into the moat;
                    secondly, the sewer to be under-P taken will pass over desert land; and thirdly,
                    a hundred pounds will be more than sufficient to direct the filter waters into
                    the existing sewer.</p>

                <p>COMING TOURIST SEASON.-</p>
                <p>PREPARATIONS AND PROSPECTS.</p>
                <p>Though it is perhaps a little early to make any forecasts, all the news we have
                    received goes to show that the coming season will be at least as successful as
                    the last, and probably more so. Great numbers of bookings have been received at
                    the principal tourist agencies and the chief hotels, and in the opinion of most
                    of the hotel managers the season will be a very early one. There are over 80
                    tourists now at Shepheard's, where the royal suite of rooms has been taken by
                    the Maharajah of Jhalawar, and many others are expected shortly.</p>
                <p>At the Ghezireh Palace Hotel, which will open towards the middle of December and
                    remain open till some time in May, 1905, great im- provements are being made in
                    the gardens, which are already very fine, the terrace is now being enlarged, and
                    a Tzigane band of great celebrity has been engaged for the season.</p>
                <p>Messrs. Cook inform us that they expect their bookings for Egypt at their London
                    and Continental offices will exceed last year's in number, but in accordance
                    with instructions received from the head-quarters of the firm, they regret to be
                    unable to give in advance the names of the visitors who have already chartered
                    dahabeahs from the firm. It appears that many British visitors to Egypt have in
                    the past expressed some annoyance at finding their intention of visiting Egypt
                    widely known almost as soon as it had been formed, and have urged, in our
                    opinion with good reason, that if their hotels, their dahabeahs, their routes,
                    and their visits were known beforehand, their hope of spending a quiet winter in
                    Cairo or on the Nile would not easily be fulfilled.</p>
                <p>Among the visitors who intend to pass the winter on the river is Mr. Mond, who is
                    hav ing a dahabeah built for him by Messrs. Cook. We have already reviewed
                    Messrs. Cook's pro- gramme for the winter.</p>
                <p>The Anglo-American Nile Steamer and Hotels Company also anticipate an excellent
                    season, and inform us that their bookings in the London and New York offices are
                    well advanced. Their first regular steamer, the May- flower, leaves on December
                    9, and there are so many demands for rooms in the Savoy Hotel, Assouan, that it
                    is possible that the hotel may. open shortly before December 1, which is the
                    official date.</p>
                <p>Mena House has already been mentioned in our columns, and we need merely add that
                    there, too, the season's prospects are sufficiently promising. Mr. Wild, the
                    manager of the Savoy Hotel, informs us that he has received orders for rooms
                    from the Earl of Londes borough and Lord George Cholmondeley and from Mr. and
                    Mrs. Paravicini, of Basle. Among the habitués of the Savoy the Misses Hurley,
                    Mrs. Atherlow and party of Sloane-square, Mrs. Joseph Healy and her daughter,
                    and Mr. W. A. Hoppin and party of New York are expected. Six new suites of rooms
                    have been added and a new card-room will shortly be opened. This room will be
                    decorated and as far as possible furnished in the Arab style, and the
                    decorations designed by Signor Napo- leoni strike us as being a remarkably
                    successful imitation of good Arab work. The restaurant is also to be enlarged
                    and will hold 200 persons; it will now take in a part of the terrace. Between
                    the entrance and the restau- rant will be two large private dining-rooms, and a
                    room is being constructed for the band which will enable all the dining-rooms,
                    public and private, as well as the restaurant, to get the full benefit of the
                    music. This music-rooms at a height of about 16 feet above the floor of the
                    restaurant, is really a sort of stone- railed platform or square balcony with
                    its sides opening to each of the rooms above- mentioned at a good height above
                    the ground. All the new work has been carried out in accordance with plans
                    prepared by Fabricius Pasha.</p>

                    been unsatisfactory, chiefly owing to the difficulty that mer- chants there have
                    experienced in getting rid of their supplies. The result has been that stocks on
                    hand at Red Sea points are still large and are sufficient to supply the demand
                    for some time to come. What inquiries there have been were for 8.50 and 8.95

                <p>BRITISH RULE IN EGYPT.</p>
                <p>The October number of the Quarterly Review has a lengthy article upon "British
                    Rule in Egypt" elaborating the many benefits conferred upon this country by our
                    more than score of years of administration. Commencing with s summary of the
                    political vicissitudes of the country from the time of the Napoleonic in- vasion
                    at the close of the eighteenth century, the author, in bringing down the
                    narrative to the date of the new entente cordiale with France, dwells, and
                    correctly so, upon the contention offered by Great Britain to the Sultan and the
                    Powers in May 1887 by which we agreed to withdraw the British Army of Occupation
                    within 3 years, and to terminate the British control over the Egyptian Army
                    within a further period of 2 years,--an agree ment supported by Germany,
                    Austria, and Italy, but opposed and finally refused at the instigation of France
                    and Russia.</p>
                <p>A large portion of the article is devoted to the necessity for irrigation, and
                    the immense benefit already obtained by Egypt from the great public works of
                    that character designed and carried out by British engineers. Full explanation
                    is also afforded of the farther. projects advocated by Lord Cromer in this
                    year's report, the financial benefits that are certain to accrue being tersely
                    set forth.</p>
                <p>The present position of the railways in Egypt is considered and the completion of
                    the Suakin-Berber line prophesied for 1906; but little is suggested as to
                    further extensions which to anyone fully acquainted with the country are certain
                    to be as successful, from a pecuniary point of view, as additional bar- rages
                    and canals. If Egypt is to occupy the high position she is justified in aspiring
                    to in the gomity of nations it can only be achieved by exploiting and occupying
                    the Cyrenaic Northern Coast of Africa, cultivating its once- fertile soil,
                    restoring its rainfall by arbori- enlture, and constructing a new Alexandria
                    therein to be connected some day by a fast line of steamers with Genoa and the
                    Simplon Tunnel. This future utiliterian revival of this tract of territory
                    requires railway communica tion with Alexandria and the Egyptian net- work of
                    lines, and would be an investment both financially and politically sound.</p>
                <p>The same may be said of a line from Suez to Mecca, which would have the benefit
                    of the vast pilgrim traffic, a source of re- venue that has proved so beneficial
                    to some Indian lines. This railway would join on to the new route being
                    constructed by the Sultan from Damasens to Meccs and Medina, and be an important
                    link uniting the great Mussulman races of Turkey with the Nile Valley.</p>
                <p>Whilst the many striking improvements and blic works constructed in Egypt during
                    the last quarter of a century are all, and very properly, lauded, the crying
                    need for many less noticeable but not less required works. is but little alluded
                    to. Perhaps, however, for consumption at home, and quotation by Continental
                    publicists, it is better that the</p>

                <p>account of our work should be solely laudatory. The crying need for additional
                    prisons and reformatories, hospitals and dispensaries, asylums for lunatics and
                    the feeble-minded, is not touched upon. The cattle plague natu rally is not</p>

                    extension of its ravages, is therefore unsuggested. The fact that in five years
                    the imports of gold have exceeded exports by 12 millions, and that this vast
                    sum, owing to the Mohamedan theological objection to placing money out at
                    interest, has practically disappeared among the secret hoardings of the people,
                    is duly set forth. The review may be fully explained by saying it displays
                    admirably the official British. view of affairs here. Not that it is intended by
                    this coin ment to indicate that this kind of survey is incorrect. But such, a
                    platform necessarily omits many items that long residents here and the more
                    intelligeut natives have requently in their consideration, and which we hope,
                    now that political peace and perennial plenty are practically assured to Egypt,
                    will also have attention and be carried out. JOSEPH OFFORD</p>
                <p>EGYPT'S RUINS IN DANGER.</p>
                <p>A correspondent, writing to the Pall Mall Gazette, says-One result of this
                    increase in the irrigation area is to be dreaded, and that is the effect it will
                    have on the ruins and temples of Upper Egypt and the Pyramids of Ghizeh. These
                    monuments are not built of very solid stone, and they have only succeeded in
                    weather- ing 3,000 odd years, because of the dry atmo- sphere to which they have
                    been exposed. Now for a short period of every year the overflow of the Nile
                    comes almost up to their base. This, of course, eats away the foundations,
                    through the filtration, and causes the stones to crumble, and in course of time
                    it is to be feared very- shortly), these silent watchers of centuries will
                    subside. The ruins at Phile also give cause" for anxiety, as they are now
                    submerged for a great part of the year. The soil of Egypt being sandy,
                    filtration is very speedy, and so a high Nile makes itself felt for a very great
                    distance inland. The Assouan Dam and the Wady Rayan Reservoir are, without a
                    doubt, marvels of the age, and the greatest enterprises that engineering gepius
                    ever conceived? They will enrich Egypt beyond all calculation, but, alas, it
                    will be but another proof of the truism, "One man's loss is another man's gain,"
                    for, where the agriculturalist and merchant will gain by the increase of
                    cultivatable land, the antiquarian and Egyptologist will lose by the inevitable
                    damage to the ancient ruins which must arise through the tremendous evaporation
                    consequent on the enlargement of the irriga- tion area.</p>

                <p>EGYPTOLOGICAL NOTES.</p>
                <p>A DISCOVERY AT SINAI.</p>
                <p>M. Raymond Weill has communicated to the Academy des Inscriptions another inserip
                    tion of Sneferu discovered at Sinai, this time by Herr Borchardt. Like its
                    predecessors, it comes from the Wady Magharah, although not from sinong the
                    inscriptions of the Memphite dynas- ties, but from a spot close, according to M.
                    Weill, to the rock-carvings of Mersekha or Semerkhet, whom Prof. Petrie would
                    assign to the First, and of Zeser, whom he makes one of his famous O dynasty.
                    Like Semerkhet's well- known Sinai tablet, it shows, in one scene, the king
                    striking a kneeling Asiatic with a club, and in the other two figures of the
                    monarch passant, and wearing in the one case the white, and in the other the red
                    crown. Only the hawk-name Neb-maat (Lord of Truth) of Sneferu is given, which
                    bears out the conten- tion of most Egyptologists that this was the correct usage
                    in Thinite times, from which the monument was probably copied from a kind of
                    Wardour Street motive. As for dating, if it indicates anything at all, it is
                    that both Semerkhet and Zeser were a good deal nearer to the time of Sneferu
                    than some would be willing to allow.</p>
                <p>M. MASPERO AND M. AMELINEAU,</p>
                <p>This is the time of year when M. Maspero apparently works off his arrears of
                    Egypto- logical books, and the Revue Critique has lately been full of notices
                    from his able pen. He is most courteous to Dr. Sethe, Dr. Erman, and the rest of
                    the Berlin school, even Dr. Steindorff's new edition of the "Koptische

                <p>BRITISH RULE IN EGYPT.</p>
                <p>The October number of the Quarterly Review has a lengthy article upon "British
                    Rule in Egypt" elaborating the many benefits conferred upon this country by our
                    more than score of years of administration. Commencing with s summary of the
                    political vicissitudes of the country from the time of the Napoleonic in- vasion
                    at the close of the eighteenth century, the author, in bringing down the
                    narrative to the date of the new entente cordiale with France, dwells, and
                    correctly so, upon the contention offered by Great Britain to the Sultan and the
                    Powers in May 1887 by which we agreed to withdraw the British Army of Occupation
                    within 3 years, and to terminate the British control over the Egyptian Army
                    within a further period of 2 years,--an agree ment supported by Germany,
                    Austria, and Italy, but opposed and finally refused at the instigation of France
                    and Russia.</p>
                <p>A large portion of the article is devoted to the necessity for irrigation, and
                    the immense benefit already obtained by Egypt from the great public works of
                    that character designed and carried out by British engineers. Full explanation
                    is also afforded of the farther. projects advocated by Lord Cromer in this
                    year's report, the financial benefits that are certain to accrue being tersely
                    set forth.</p>
                <p>The present position of the railways in Egypt is considered and the completion of
                    the Suakin-Berber line prophesied for 1906; but little is suggested as to
                    further extensions which to anyone fully acquainted with the country are certain
                    to be as successful, from a pecuniary point of view, as additional bar- rages
                    and canals. If Egypt is to occupy the high position she is justified in aspiring
                    to in the gomity of nations it can only be achieved by exploiting and occupying
                    the Cyrenaic Northern Coast of Africa, cultivating its once- fertile soil,
                    restoring its rainfall by arbori- enlture, and constructing a new Alexandria
                    therein to be connected some day by a fast line of steamers with Genoa and the
                    Simplon Tunnel. This future utiliterian revival of this tract of territory
                    requires railway communica tion with Alexandria and the Egyptian net- work of
                    lines, and would be an investment both financially and politically sound.</p>
                <p>The same may be said of a line from Suez to Mecca, which would have the benefit
                    of the vast pilgrim traffic, a source of re- venue that has proved so beneficial
                    to some Indian lines. This railway would join on to the new route being
                    constructed by the Sultan from Damasens to Meccs and Medina, and be an important
                    link uniting the great Mussulman races of Turkey with the Nile Valley.</p>
                <p>Whilst the many striking improvements and blic works constructed in Egypt during
                    the last quarter of a century are all, and very properly, lauded, the crying
                    need for many less noticeable but not less required works. is but little alluded
                    to. Perhaps, however, for consumption at home, and quotation by Continental
                    publicists, it is better that the</p>

                <p>account of our work should be solely laudatory. The crying need for additional
                    prisons and reformatories, hospitals and dispensaries, asylums for lunatics and
                    the feeble-minded, is not touched upon. The cattle plague natu rally is not</p>

                    extension of its ravages, is therefore unsuggested. The fact that in five years
                    the imports of gold have exceeded exports by 12 millions, and that this vast
                    sum, owing to the Mohamedan theological objection to placing money out at
                    interest, has practically disappeared among the secret hoardings of the people,
                    is duly set forth. The review may be fully explained by saying it displays
                    admirably the official British. view of affairs here. Not that it is intended by
                    this coin ment to indicate that this kind of survey is incorrect. But such, a
                    platform necessarily omits many items that long residents here and the more
                    intelligeut natives have requently in their consideration, and which we hope,
                    now that political peace and perennial plenty are practically assured to Egypt,
                    will also have attention and be carried out. JOSEPH OFFORD</p>
                <p>EGYPT'S RUINS IN DANGER.</p>
                <p>A correspondent, writing to the Pall Mall Gazette, says-One result of this
                    increase in the irrigation area is to be dreaded, and that is the effect it will
                    have on the ruins and temples of Upper Egypt and the Pyramids of Ghizeh. These
                    monuments are not built of very solid stone, and they have only succeeded in
                    weather- ing 3,000 odd years, because of the dry atmo- sphere to which they have
                    been exposed. Now for a short period of every year the overflow of the Nile
                    comes almost up to their base. This, of course, eats away the foundations,
                    through the filtration, and causes the stones to crumble, and in course of time
                    it is to be feared very- shortly), these silent watchers of centuries will
                    subside. The ruins at Phile also give cause" for anxiety, as they are now
                    submerged for a great part of the year. The soil of Egypt being sandy,
                    filtration is very speedy, and so a high Nile makes itself felt for a very great
                    distance inland. The Assouan Dam and the Wady Rayan Reservoir are, without a
                    doubt, marvels of the age, and the greatest enterprises that engineering gepius
                    ever conceived? They will enrich Egypt beyond all calculation, but, alas, it
                    will be but another proof of the truism, "One man's loss is another man's gain,"
                    for, where the agriculturalist and merchant will gain by the increase of
                    cultivatable land, the antiquarian and Egyptologist will lose by the inevitable
                    damage to the ancient ruins which must arise through the tremendous evaporation
                    consequent on the enlargement of the irriga- tion area.</p>

                <p>EGYPTOLOGICAL NOTES.</p>
                <p>A DISCOVERY AT SINAI.</p>
                <p>M. Raymond Weill has communicated to the Academy des Inscriptions another inserip
                    tion of Sneferu discovered at Sinai, this time by Herr Borchardt. Like its
                    predecessors, it comes from the Wady Magharah, although not from sinong the
                    inscriptions of the Memphite dynas- ties, but from a spot close, according to M.
                    Weill, to the rock-carvings of Mersekha or Semerkhet, whom Prof. Petrie would
                    assign to the First, and of Zeser, whom he makes one of his famous O dynasty.
                    Like Semerkhet's well- known Sinai tablet, it shows, in one scene, the king
                    striking a kneeling Asiatic with a club, and in the other two figures of the
                    monarch passant, and wearing in the one case the white, and in the other the red
                    crown. Only the hawk-name Neb-maat (Lord of Truth) of Sneferu is given, which
                    bears out the conten- tion of most Egyptologists that this was the correct usage
                    in Thinite times, from which the monument was probably copied from a kind of
                    Wardour Street motive. As for dating, if it indicates anything at all, it is
                    that both Semerkhet and Zeser were a good deal nearer to the time of Sneferu
                    than some would be willing to allow.</p>
                <p>M. MASPERO AND M. AMELINEAU,</p>
                <p>This is the time of year when M. Maspero apparently works off his arrears of
                    Egypto- logical books, and the Revue Critique has lately been full of notices
                    from his able pen. He is most courteous to Dr. Sethe, Dr. Erman, and the rest of
                    the Berlin school, even Dr. Steindorff's new edition of the "Koptische
                    Grammatik" failing to stir his wrath, though it does call forth, a refutation.

                <p>SUDAN IRRIGATION.</p>
                <p>By Sir Hanbury Brown, K.C.M.G., late In- spector-General of Irrigation in Lower
                    Egypt, and formerly in Upper Egypt. (Continued.)</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, this project of a Lake Tsana reservoir is, for the present,
                    shelved, and reluctantly abandoned by Sir W. Garstin with the following
                    remarks:-</p>
                <p>There can be no two opinions as to the suitability of Lake Tsana as a storage
                    reservoir for the Blue Nile. The river, after it leaves the lake, has a heavy
                    fall, and, for a great portion of its course, a rocky bed. The loss of water
                    would be comparatively small, and with a system of weirs constructed in the
                    river bed between Rosaires and Khartoum, with canals taking off above them on
                    either side, the summer irrigation, both of the Ghezireh and of the eastern
                    provinces, could be easily and simply effected. Unfortunately, owing to its
                    situation, the political difficulties appear to be so great that the chance of
                    any such work being carried out must be relegated to a very distant future, if
                    not abandoned altogether. Doubtless, at some future period in the world's
                    history, these difficulties will disappear, and advantage will be taken of the
                    obvious suit- ability of this lake as a great natural reservoir." All will agree
                    with Sir William in regretting that "the time is not yet."</p>
                <p>So it appears there is no present prospect of the Sudan alongside the Blue Nile
                    getting sum- mer water from the river: How, then, is it to be developed The
                    logic of the situation decides this, and Sir W. Garstin accepts the situation.
                    He recommends the introduction of flood and winter irrigation for the
                    cultivation of cereals, and quotes from a former report of his the following
                    passage expressive of his views, which, in my opinion, are absolutely
                    sound:-"The true agricultural future of the tracts adjoining the Blue Nile does
                    not, how- ever, lie in the direction of summer irrigation, but rather in the
                    delopment of those crops which can be ripened during the winter months. The soil
                    of the Ghezireh and of a large portion of the lands lying to the east of the
                    river much resembles that of those parts of India which produce the finest
                    wheat. The climate of the two countries is very similar, But in the Sudan one
                    important agent is wanting, viz., a winter rainfall. Without this, winter crops
                    cannot be raised, except in com- paratively small areas adjacent to the river.
                    Canal or basin irrigation must then be supplied as a substitute for the absence
                    of rain in winter. Were this provided the province of Sennaar and the southern
                    portion of the pro- vince of Khartoum might become one of the finest
                    wheat-producing areas in the world."</p>
                <p>The winter discharge of the Blue Nile falls by the end of January or February to
                    200 cubic metres a second; or to about 17,000,000 cubic metres a day. Sir W.
                    Garstin reckons that "such a discharge would be sufficient for the irrigation of
                    800,000 acres of winter crop at the least." Considering that 17 million cubic
                    metres a day is the discharge at the end of the winter waterings in February,
                    and that the discharge is some 43 millions a day in December, and some 30
                    millions a day in January, I think it would be safe to reckon the winter
                    discharge of the Blue Nile sufficient for one million acres. No attempt is made
                    by Sir W. Garstin to calculate what use could be made of the flood in filling
                    basins and raising crops by inundation of the land during flood, as is done in
                    Upper Egypt without any winter waterings. I imagine that another million acres
                    might be so treated.</p>
                <p>To distribute the winter water, Sir W Garstin recommends barrages, similar to the
                    Delta Barrage, with the usual distributing canals and works on both banks of the
                    river. He writes:-"As a commencement it would 1 seem to be advisable to begin
                    with the irriga- tion of the northern portion of the Ghezireh, and of those
                    tracts on the eastern bank lying t to the north of Wad Medani. Here the t
                    country is open, and comparatively free from 1 bush and forest. Moreover, from
                    its vicinity to Khartoum and the railway, it would appear to be more likely to
                    lend itself to improvement than do the remoter areas to the south. This barrage
                    would most probably be constructed w somewhere downstream of the point where i
                    the Rahad River joins the Blue Nile, so that v the east bank can could be
                    carried down to the North without having to cross any stream t of importance.
                    Should it be found necessary h in the future to extend irrigation to the south-
                    a ern tracts, one or more barrages further up y the river would have to be
                    constructed; but it does not seem likely that any large develop t ment of
                    irrigation in the country south of Sennaar will be required for many a year to
                    i</p>

                <p>Our London Letter.</p>
                <p>(FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT).</p>
                <p>LONDON, October 21.</p>
                <p>This is Trafalgar Day, and it is very right that we should keep it in a spirit of
                    profound thankfulness for a "crowning mercy," without which there would, in all
                    human probability, have been no British Empire at the present day. But it is
                    also, very necessary that we should manifest no unseemly exultation over our
                    gallant enemies, French, and'Spanish, against whom the fortune of war went on
                    that day, and we are convinced that neither in France nor in Spain will the
                    sentiment of the nation in this matter be misunderstood. Like- wise, we shall do
                    well to keep the memory of that great day in a spirit of humility. Are we quite
                    sure that we are facing the problems of national defence and accepting the
                    duties, as well as the privileges, of Empire in the same spirit as our
                    forefathers of Nelson's time? How do we know that we may not soon find
                    ourselves, like them, with our back to the wall, and with a powerful combination
                    arrayed against us? There is steady, stealthy prepara- tion going on-we all know
                    where to dispute our command of the sea. Will the challenge, if it comes, find
                    us fit to meet it? That is the question that every Briton should ask himself on
                    this Trafalgar Day.</p>
                <p>The general impression left by the fighting in the Far East is of a tedious
                    succession of gigantic massacres, resulting in no great decision, and turning
                    round no great issue. Our mind goes back to the prophecies of M. Jean de Bloch,
                    who foretold that war would end in this kind of colossal stalemate. He seems to
                    have argued wisely.</p>
                <p>The latest instalment of the story of the Lhasa Treaty is certainly very
                    disagreeable reading-all the more disagreeable because it is calculated to
                    create an impression that Colonel Younghusband's Mission was really the fiasco
                    which some of the Opposition newspapers are mischievously picturing. The India
                    Office would have acted more wisely had it taken the public into its confidence
                    from the moment that the first serious hitch occurred, instead of pretending
                    that there were no hitches at all, and that the ratification of the treaty by
                    China was a mere formality, the carrying out of which was assured.</p>
                <p>The Prime Minister has informed the country, through his letter addressed to the
                    Belfast Conservative Association, that the redistribution of seats is engaging
                    the most earnest attention of the Government. I am glad to hear it, and should
                    be glad, as soon as conveniently may be, to hear a little more. I should like to
                    be assured that His Majesty's Ministers regard the question as urgent, and that
                    they are pre- pared to deal with it at once. There is nothing upon which
                    Unionists are more thoroughly agreed; and after the promises they have re-
                    ceived they are justified in expecting that there will be no further delay. It
                    is too late to point but once again the flagrant anomalies of the existing
                    system, under which a few electors in some obscure Welsh or Irish constituency
                    wield the same power in the House of Com- mons as is exercised by a great and
                    intelligent English county or borough.</p>
                <p>I am glad to see that no countenance was given by Mr. Long at his conference with
                    the Poor Law Guardians. last week, to the notion that we are on the eve of
                    unusual distress in London. Nor is he disposed to rush into hasty legislation,
                    though he desires to deal with normal as well as with abnormal pauper- ism.
                    Legislation may be necessary, but it is so easy to do harm- in that way that it
                    is better to postpone it until competent au- thorities have settled the lines on
                    which it is to proceed than to rush incontinently into the making of new
                    laws.</p>
                <p>After a protracted period of depression, things in the Stock Exchange really look
                    as if the tide was on the turn. In the course of the last few weeks there has
                    been a remarkable revival of business, and if the upward move- ment continues
                    there will be something in the nature of a boom-that boom which everyone
                    expected to arrive at the close of the Boer war, but which has been so long
                    deferred that it had dwindled to a very faint speck in the visionary
                    horizon.</p>
                <p>Owing to the commercial depression and the severe competition now existing in the
                    hotel business, the Hotel Cecil has to report a considerable decrease in profits
                    for the year to August. The receipts amounted to £182,613, a decrease of
                    £43,759, and the trading profit, after charging the expenditure on the several
                    repairs and renewals of £10,120, is £32,486, as compared with £58,153, In order
                    to provide for future extensions of the British Museum and also, gradually to
                    minimise the danger from fire, the Govern ment, about ten years ago, bought a
                    lot of houses from the Duke of Bedford for £200,000. The first of the extensions
                    since the purchase is now about to be made; and consequently a large number of
                    houses in Montague-place, at the back of the Museum, have just been</p>
            </div>
            <cb n="3"/>
            <div type="item">
                <p>demolished. The plans for the new building' have been prepared, and show an
                    elevation. something on the lines of the front of the Museum. To this, wings
                    will be added later on. When,, finally, the houses at the sides are pulled down,
                    and the ground occupied by the farther extensions, the British Mu- tseum will be
                    one of the largest and finest buildings in the world.</p>
                <p>It would be a great pity if the show of the Royal Agricultural Society, held
                    annually for sixty-five years, with one exception, were to become a thing of the
                    past. That its continued existence, however, is seriously threatened is made
                    clear by a letter issued by the president, Lord Middleton, in which the holding
                    of next year's show is made contingent on the raising of a fund of £10,000. The
                    heavy losses on recent shows have brought about a financial f crisis in the
                    society's affairs, and a guarantee e fund has thus become a matter of absolute
                    necessity?</p>
                <p>Dermatitis, the disease which results from e experimenting with the X-rays, has
                    attacked Dr. Hall Edwards, of Birmingham,, a leading 1 authority on Röntgen's
                    discovery. His hands are fearfully disfigured, being almost covered with a kind
                    of wart. The nails are black and -skin coarse and dry. There is, it seems, no
                    specific remedy for the disease, the only thing to be done being to refrain from
                    operating.</p>
                <p>Sir Oliver Lodge has expressed the opinion fthat the X-rays themselves were not
                    responsible for the sores, but something which accompanies them, and which can
                    be screened off by suitable appliances, whereas no screen will completely
                    obstruct the rays. The danger does not affect the patients to the same degree,
                    though some unfortunate results have in the past been produced upon patients
                    also. With suitable precautions dermatitis may be avoided.</p>
                <p>Mr. Edison, the inventor, whose assistant recently died from the effects of X-ray
                    burns, is himself suffering terribly from the same cause. "I never expect to
                    recover," he said in an interview. "Sometimes the pains, across my stomach are
                    almost unendurable. Huge knots form. No medicine will dissipate, no treatment
                    seems to allay the awful suffering. I simply have to wear the pains away."</p>
                <p>One cannot help feeling very sorry for the lady's maid who applied to Mr. Rose at
                    the West London court a few days ago. Suffering from an eruption on her face,
                    she had feared she might lose her situation, and, accordingly, applied to a
                    woman "beauty doctor," who pro- mised to restore her looks in ten days for £20.
                    Instead of which, the face became "worse, and the lady's maid's cheeks and chin
                    were badly burnt. Unfortunately, Mr. Rose could hold out no hope to her of
                    recovering the £20.</p>
                <p>As so often happens with a man who has all his life been engaged in active work,
                    Mr. Charles Morton's retirement has been speedily followed by his death. To all
                    Londoners Mr. Morton was a familiar figure/ and the amount of amusement and
                    novelty which in the course of his long career he provided for the frequenter of
                    the music-halls is almost incal- culable. No man was more keen to light on
                    something fresh and attractive, and he may fairly be said to have placed himself
                    at the head of that remarkable movement which rescued the music-hall from the
                    blatant vul- garities of fifty years ago. Indeed, he has been called, with
                    truth, the "Father of the Music Halls," for he opened the Canterbury in 1850, 0
                    and the Oxford in 1861.</p>
                <p>Sporting boudoirs are ringing with the story of a "bridge" mishap in which a lady
                    of society. has actually made herself liable for £7,000. Her successful
                    competitors are two ladies of title. She played off one "bridge" against her
                    losses to the other, and fell before both. The poor husband cannot afford such a
                    terrible call upon his resources, but it is a debt of honour, which, if unpaid,
                    means social ruin to both the player and her lord.</p>
                <p>A practical turn was given by the Vége- tarians, who lately met in Congress at
                    Man- chester, to their discussion by raising the question whether the reluctance
                    of men to marry can be overcome by the adoption of a vegetarian diet.</p>
