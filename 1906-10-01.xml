                    <head>THE CRETAN QUESTION.</head>
                    <p>To-day the Greek battleship Psara is to return to
                            <placeName>Crete</placeName> bringing Prince George's successor in the
                        High Commissionership, M. Zaimis. It is now eight years since, after more
                        than half a <cb n="6"/>century of almost continuous insurrection under
                        Turkish rule, <placeName>the island of Crete</placeName>, having been taken
                        in hand by the four Protecting Powers—Great Britain, Russia, France, and
                        Italy—was by them constituted a separate State, subject, however, on the one
                        hand to the formal suzerainty of the Porte, and on the other hand to the
                        rule of a High Commissioner to be appointed by themselves. The second son of
                        the King of the Hellenes was the first High Commissioner; so well did he
                        succeed that his re appointment after his first three years' office came
                        almost as a matter of course. Peace and order, however, were not destined to
                        endure in the island. Within the past few years there has come to be more
                        and more clearly defined a radical opposition between the aspirations of the
                        majority of the Cretans and the policy of the Protecting Powers. The
                        Cretans—so far, at least, as they are represented in the National
                        Assembly—desire annexation to Greece. As part and parcel of this they desire
                        the removal of the real control exercised by the four Powers and enforced by
                        the presence of their troops, and the abolition of the formal suzerainty of
                        the Porte. Time after time the Cretan Assembly has passed resolutions
                        demanding oreven declaring as a fact the union of the island to the kingdom
                        of Greece. Time after time the Protecting Powers have met this demand with a
                        direct negative. Prince George's resignation of the High Commissionership is
                        a direct recognition of the incompatibility between the national aspirations
                        of which he made himself the spokesman and the policy of the Powers who set
                        him in office. His successor, <persName>M. Zaimis</persName>, is, of course,
                        also a Greek, and is no doubt under the circumstances one of the best men
                        who could have been chosen for the position. <persName>M. Zaimis</persName>
                        comes of a house which is one of the most distinguished in the political
                        life of modern Greece. He is himself a statesman of the highest position. He
                        is, in virtue of a partial concession of the Powers on September 17,
                        nominated not by the Powers themselves, but by the King of the Hellenes,
                        after consultation with their reprentatives, and subject to their assent.
                            <persName>M Zaimis</persName>, in fact, represents nearly all that the
                        Cretans might be expected to want, except the one thing that they are known
                        in fact to want—annexation to Greece.</p>
                    <p>Why, then, asks the "Morning Post," do the Powers not go this one step
                        further and allow the desired union of the island to the country to which
                        they allow such influence in the choice of a ruler? A variety of reasons may
                        be and are given, Union would mean the abolition of the formal suzerainty
                        still retained by Turkey, and would therefore not be accomplished without a
                        protest from that quarter. Again, the affairs of Crete are mysteriously
                        confused with those of Macedonia. Bulgaria would demand compensation in the
                        latter quarter if Greece were allowed to enlarge itself by the annexation of
                        Crete in the Mediterranean. A third reason, and one of quite another sort,
                        is to be found in the necessity for preserving in the island the peace to
                        secure which the Powers intervened in the first instance. In the words of
                        the Note addressed by them to the Cretan Assembly in July last, "every step
                        towards the realisation of the national aspirations must necessarily be
                        subordinated to the establishment and the maintenance of order and a stable
                        régime." In other words, the Powers cannot,' and will not, withdraw their
                        control in favour of Greece unless and until they are convinced that this
                        will not mean opening the door to insurrection and civil warfare. In so far
                        as there is any good reason for supposing that Greece could not with the
                        goodwill of the Cretans govern them at least as peacefully as the Powers can
                        against their will, this last argument is worth considering. But unless this
                        supposition can be reasonably made—and it clearly needs a great deal of
                        proving —it must be admitted that the arguments against allowing union to
                        Greece are rather weak. If the Powers should ever themselves become
                        convinced of the necessity for this union they clearly could and would
                        disregard the possible protests of Turkey and Bulgaria. The root of the
                        difficulty probably is simply that the Powers by their constitution cannot
                        easily be convinced in favour of any positive action. The dissent of any one
                        of them may baulk the harmonious action of all. Therefore, like all other
                        associations requiring unanimity for action, they tend to inaction and to
                        letting things drift.</p>

                            early periods, we find representations of him which are almost identical

                    <head>THE NILE FLOOD.<lb/>RECORD COTTON CROP.<lb/>IMPORTANT NOTE.</head>
                    <p>Mr. Webb has issued a note on the state of the Nile flood. During the first
                        part of August the flood was, although better than the series of low floods
                        experienced during the past twelve years, somewhat late in its arrival. The
                        level reached at Assouan were well below the average for thirty years past.
                        The levels of the Southern gauges, however, indicated that an improvement
                        would take place, and during the second half of August the level was
                        satisfactory, though still below the average of thirty years. During
                        September a still more satisfactory level was maintained, the average of
                        thirty years being surpassed. On the 8th September the maximum gauge at
                        Assouan was R. L. 92.68, (15 pics and 20 kinats). On the 14th September it
                        was 16 centimetres below the maximum average of thirty years. The usual fall
                        has now commenced, and will continue. Considerable difficulty was
                        experienced at the beginning of August in meeting very heavy demands for
                        irrigation of dhurra lands and the cotton crop simultaneously. This,
                        however, diminished before the middle of August and finally ceased before
                        the month was out.</p>
                    <p>The cotton crop promises to be the largest yet recorded.</p>
                    <p>Irrigation of basin lands in Upper Egypt began between the 10th and 15th
                        August and will generally be completed by the end of this month.</p>
                    <p>The levels for basin irrigation have been generally satisfactory as well as
                        for large areas of nubari dhurra planted on sahels and river islands, with
                        the exception of small areas in Assouan province and isolated sahels and
                        islands, which can only be flooded in years of very high levels. The whole
                        land in Upper Egypt will be irrigated and the discharge of the basins in the
                        Southern Provinces will begin on October 5th, and in Assiont and Minieh
                        provinces on October 10th. The flood, though late in its earlier stages, has
                        been satisfactory for the irrigation of the basin lands in Upper Egypt, and
                        at the same time the levels in Lower Egypt have been suitable for passing
                        away the flood withoat endangering the Nile banks.</p>

                    <byline>(From Our Suez Correspondent.) </byline>
                    <p>The plague at Suez is apparently increasing, especially in the Rue Colmar,
                        the principal street of the town. Europeans are beginning to take the matter
                        seriously, and by this morning's train five well-known families left
                        harriedly for Ismailia, and other places in order to avoid the danger.</p>
                    <p>Suspected cases of plague and fully diagnosed cases are conveyed by the
                        authorities to the isolation wooden huts in the desert, in a large covered
                        cart styled an "ambalance," which is the terror of the people. The majority
                        of the Europeans have made up their minds to absolutely refuse at any
                        sacrifice to be taken away in this manner, and owing to the agitation of the
                        people, all the Consuls will hold a meeting next Tuesday morning to
                        thoroughly look into the matter, and to arrange for the comfort of the
                        people.</p>
                    <p>If the sanitary authorities were to provide a suitable ambulance to convey
                        the people to the huts, I think the matter would be taken more calmly by the
                        public. Owing to the fact that the majority of the cases have proved fatal
                        in the isolation huts, the general opinion is that these huts are not
                        adapted to Europeans, owing to their being exposed to the sun.</p>
                    <p>It is strange to see that in localities which have been disinfected fresh
                        cases of plague occur, and it seems to be the general opinion that the
                        disinfection, and especially the whitewashing of the walls ought to be done
                        better.</p>
                    <p>Suez was once considered to be the healthiest town in Egypt, but of late the
                        contrary has been the case.</p>

                    <p>A marder of a peculiarly atrocious character was committed in the Karmous
                        quarter of Alexandria last Saturday afternoon. A young Greek went to the
                        residence of his aunt whom he knew kept her savings, amounting to about
                        £150, in her house, and asked her to lend him £20. The old lady refused to
                        part with the money, so the youth drew his dagger and proceeded deliberately
                        to plunge it again and again into her face and bosom until she expired. The
                        murderer then ransacked the house, and at last succeeded in discovering the
                        hoard. There upon he made off, and has not been seen since.</p>

                        appointed chairman of the Commissioners of Sewers. From 1899 to 1900 he was
                        one of the Sheriffs of London ; he was knighted before the expiration of his
                        term of office, and since then he has been alderman for the ward of
                        Farrington Without. He is the principal of the firm of Treloar and Sons, the
                        well known cocoa-nut fibre manufacturers and importers of Turkish carpets,
                        and is a director and trustee of Thomas Cook and Son, Egypt, Ltd. Sir

                    <head>ACCUSATION OF COWARDICE.<lb/>ALY BEY'S REPLY.</head>
                    <p>To the Editor of the "Egyptian Gazette." </p>
                    <p>Sir,—I was much astonished at reading the the letter contributed to your
                        esteemed paper of yesterday by a disguished writer who pretended to have
                        been present at my trial before a General Court Martial at Abbassieh in the
                        spring of 1896 where nobody is allowed to be present besides the members of
                        the Court.</p>
                    <p>I have been tried at the War Office and not at Abbassieh as what your
                        correspondent surmised.</p>
                    <p>This disguised gentleman is, as I believe him to be, an inspired person by
                        "Al Mokattam," if he is not one of his editors, the paper which first wrote
                        on this subject touching the same points wrongly.</p>
                    <p>When I explained the true circumstances of my case, in the reply, the
                        controversy was dropt down in the Arabic papers and renewed, by its first
                        manufacturers as I believe, in your esteemed paper.</p>
                    <p>My reply in the "Al Lewa" of the 25th inst. was as follows:—</p>
                    <p>I had tendered my resignation on Sunday the 8th of March 1896 and the
                        announcement of the orders issued to the effect of mobilising the Sudan
                        Expedition was made on the 15th of March after H.H. the Khedive's return
                        from the Mosque of Amr on Friday the 13th of March when His Highness
                        presided the Council of the Ministers held on that day to decide on the
                        despatching of the Sudan Expedition.</p>
                    <p>If "Al Mokattam" desires to know my case well, it may ask H. E. Mohammed
                        Zohry Pasha who was a member in the General Court Martial, held at the War
                        Office on the 21st of March 1896 for my trial and who was one of the great
                        opponents to the decision of the court when H. E. read the date of the
                        postal seal impressed on the envelope containing my application for
                        resignation and became sure that I addressed the letter to the War Office a
                        week before the announcement for despatching the expedition to Dongola was
                        made public and even before it was discussed by the Council of
                        Ministers,</p>
                    <p>If this does not suffice those who think that they can not defend the Syrians
                        whom we esteem so much, but by insulting others, we shall be obliged to add
                        a new page to Mr. Blunt's "Atrocities of Justice" in defence of the

                        Chitty Bey will finally leave the Customs, and will take up a post in the

                    <p>With full military honours the funeral took place at Heston, Middlesex, last
                        week, of Private James Foy, of the 21st Lancers, who met with his death
                        whilst playing in a football match last Saturday by sustaining a rupture of
                        the intestine in a fall. Private Foy had served 14 years with the 21st
                        Lancers. He went through the Egyptian campaign ; took part in the celebrated
                        charge at Omdurman ; and held the medal for the action and the Khartoum
                        clasp. A pathetic feature of Private Foy's death is that when he met with
                        his fatal accident he was about to purchase his discharge from the Army. He
                        was one of the best football players in the regiment, and for the last five
                        years he kept goal for the regimental team.</p>

                    <head>MR. BLUNT'S BOOK.</head>
                    <p>The criticism by Mr. Moberly Bell to which "Al Mokattam" refers, as noted in
                        our issue of Saturday appears in a letter of the "Times" signed "Your
                        Correspondent in Egypt 1865-1890." It runs as follows"</p>
                    <p>Sir,—Will you allow me to recall, and to me as a warning, some Egyptian
                        history of 25 years ago ?</p>
                    <p>In the year 1881 there was a beginning of trouble in Egypt—it was a cloud no
                        bigger than a man's hand—a military riot in Cairo barely noticed in your
                        columns. There had been another, apparently more serious, three years before
                        ; but, though it produced a change of Ministry, and eventually the
                        deposition of Ismail, it had been followed by no disorder,and there was no
                        reason to suppose that this insubordination of three Egyptian colonels would
                        have serious consequences.</p>
                    <p>But then, as now, the danger was not from Egypt, but from London. There is a
                        class of Englismen who have adopted as their motto "Against our country
                        whether right or wrong," and because we had already become partly
                        responsible for order in Egypt, Mr. Wilfrid Soawen Blunt felt called upon to
                        make himself the spokesman and supporter of whatever elements of disorder
                        might exist in that country.</p>
                    <p>It is not too muoh to say that the whole Egyptian question of 1881-2, with
                        all its consequences, ostensibly directed by Arabi and largely assisted by
                        the incompetence of the British Government, was due to the mischievous
                        interference of Mr. Wilfrid Blant, who, on the failure of his hopes after
                        the loss of many thousands of lives, consoled himself by making it the
                        subject of a poem.</p>
                    <p>Had the matter ended there, perhaps there might not have been much cause for
                        lament. The achievements of England in Egypt have in that quarter of a
                        century been so magnificent and benefioent that, even apart from the
                        production of that poem, they might well be worth the purchase at the price
                        of some blood and treasure.</p>
                    <p>But, unfortunately, that poem contained a a prophecy. Mr. Blunt was not
                        content with apostrophizing his victims: —</p>
                    <p>I oare not if you fled, . . . </p>
                    <p>It may be you were cowards. Let them prove it. </p>
                    <p>What matter ? </p>
                    <p>He was not content with announcing from his armchair that he himself would
                        "rather fly with the first craven" than "head the hottest charge." As a
                        matter of fact, he did neither, but he felt that the mantle of the prophet
                        was upon him, and, addressing his own countrymen, he said :—</p>
                    <p>Thou wentest to this Egypt for thy pleasure. </p>
                    <p>Thou shalt remain with her for thy sore pain. </p>
                    <p>Thou hast possessed her beauty. Thou wouldst leave her. </p>
                    <p>Nay—thou shalt lie with her as thou hast lain. </p>
                    <p>She shall bring shame upon thy face with all men. </p>
                    <p>She shall disease thee with her grief and fear. </p>
                    <p>Thou shalt grow sick and feeble in her ruin. </p>
                    <p>Thou shalt repay her to the last sad tear. </p>
                    <p>Well, a quarter of a century has elapsed and the prophecy remains not only
                        unfulfilled, but very gloriously disproved. This is naturally exasperating
                        to a prophetic poet, but again today there is another cloud no bigger than a
                        man's hand, and, mindful of past achievements, Mr. Blunt's hopes rise. Again
                        he struggles to convert chaos out of order; again he risks the sacrifice of
                        more British blood and treasure— perhaps again to find a subject for a
                        poem.</p>
                    <p>If we may judge from Sir Edward Grey's declarations, the Liberal Ministry of
                        1906 will not make the same fatuous blunder as their predecessors of 1881.
                        But, lest they should do so, it may be useful that they should read these
                        extracts from your files of 21 years ago.</p>
                    <p>In "The Times" of September 29, 1885, I wrote:—</p>
                    <p>Two men, each doubtless equally honest and equally injudicious, must share
                        between them the responsibility for these earlier incidents of our
                        operations in Egypt—Mr. Blunt, who assured Arabi that Mr. Gladstone was not
                        in earnset, and Mr. Gladstone, who was only in earnest when it was too
                        late.</p>
                    <p>In "The Times" of October 2, 1885, you published a correspondence from which
                        I make the following extracts :—</p>
                    <p>Mr. Gladstone to Mr. Blunt, September 29, 1885:—</p>
                    <p>My reason for declining to answer you is that I am reluctant to say what I
                        think as to your conduct in Egypt—I means as to its character and effect,
                        for I do not question its motives. Were Arabi Pasha to invite me to a
                        controversy I should have to make a similar answer.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Blunt to Mr. Gladstone, Setember 30, 1885:—</p>
                    <p>When the acount is drawn up between us, as it must be some day, in regard to
                        events so tragic in the world's history as the bombardment of Alexandria,
                        the massacres of June and July, Arabi's trial, your broken promises to
                        Egypt, and Gordon's death, I do not fear that honest men will hold me in any
                        way your debtor.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Blnnt's poem was entitled "The Wind and the Whirlwind." He sowed the
                        wind—much wind; he reaped the reproach alike of those he opposed and of
                        those he supported.</p>

                    <head>THE LATE MAJOR JOHNSTONE.<lb/>DEATH AFTER AN OPERATION. </head>
                    <p>Farther details concerning the death of <persName>Major L'Estrange
                            Johnstone</persName>, which have been telegraphed from London to the
                        Board of the State Railways Administration by Colonel Western, prove that
                        the supposition that death was due to an accident was erroneous, and that he
                        succumbed to a sudden illness which had necessitated the performance of an
                        operation.</p>
                    <p>The week before last Major Johnstone, says the telegram referred to, felt
                        seedy and he consulted a specialist. On Monday he entered a nursing home to
                        prepare for the operation which had been decided upon. This was performed on
                        Wednesday, but he died on on Thursday evening.</p>
                    <p>The funeral will take place to morrow at Alya, Sterling.</p>
                    <p>A memorial service in memory of the late General Manager of State Railways
                        will be held at All Saints' Church, Cairo, on Wednesday at 6 p.m.</p>
                    <p>A correspondent writes from Cairo : —</p>
                    <p>Universal and sincere regret was expressed on every side when the news of the
                        untimely death of Major L'Estrange Johnstone became known in Cairo, and
                        wherever Englishmen met together the sad tidings were the topic of
                        conversation. To him is due to a large extent the efficiency of the railway
                        service of which Egypt can now boast. I do not mean to suggest that the
                        service is on parallel with that of European countries, but it will be
                        granted by all that the progress which has been effected in the Railway
                        Administration is equal to that of any administration. You remarked in your
                        issue of Saturday that Major Johnstone could not be considered as an
                        administrator of the first rank, and such, indeed, was the case, but by his
                        indomitable energy he overcame many of the obstacles which oppose
                        responsible officialdom in Egypt. He instituted many reforms and during his
                        seven yean of presidency steady progress was made.</p>
                    <p>He was admired, respected, and even beloved by those who worked under him,and
                        he succeeded in gaining the confidence of the native employés of every
                        grade. His consideration for and great kindness to his employés gained for
                        him great popularity, and all feel that they have lost a kind friend as well
                        as a lenient master.</p>

                    <head>GERMANY ON THE NILE.<lb/>THE KAISER'S SCHEMES IN EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>With reference to the article which appeared in your issue of August 28,
                        writes a correspondent from Cairo to the "Pall Mall Gazette," under the
                        heading of "German Trading Energy," the impression in Egypt of the advances
                        made by Germany in this country, is that the German Government is at the
                        back of all these ventures. First came the direct line from Hamburg to
                        Alexandria, followed by the facilities offered by the Hamburg-American,
                        Norddeutscher Lloyd, and Deutsch Ost-Afrika Lines; then the combine between
                        the Hamburg-American and the Anglo-American Nile Navigation Company ; and
                        the latest is the establishment of the Deutsche Orient-Bank in Cairo. </p>
                    <p>I know as a fact that about eighteen months ago one of the German lines made
                        desperate efforts to under quote their English competitors and secure a hold
                        on the shipments to Egypt. It actually went so far as to quote a mining
                        syndicate a rate from London to Upper Egypt at the same price as it would
                        cost to transport the material from Alexandria to Upper Egypt. This rate
                        included conveyance from London to Hamburg, where trans-shipment into the
                        direct steamers was to be effected. Thus, the German line would have taken
                        the shipments, which were pretty considerable, from London to Alexandria,
                        viâ Hamburg, free—it would have incurred a loss on the working expenses for
                        those trips, besides paying out of its own pocket for the freight from
                        London to Hamburg. At present, too, the rates from Germany to Egypt are
                        ridiculously low, and all this would go to prove the truth of the statement
                        in your article of August 28, that £100,000 had been lost in the
                        Mediterranean in the last two years alone. </p>
                    <p>It is pretty generally admitted, too, that the combine on the Nile was a
                        political move. No doubt the step will increase the business done by that
                        company—all the Germans and German Americans, who formerly divided their
                        patronage, will naturally give it now to the new amalgamated service, but it
                        is understood, that as a strictly commercial enterprise, it is not attaining
                        the success that was hoped. In this instance it was plainly the ambitions
                        desire of the German Government to have the German flag floating on the Nile
                        that led to this deal, and since the intimate friendship between the
                        directors of the Hamburg-American Line and the Kaiser and his advisers is
                        well known, it has not been difficult to put two and two together. </p>
                    <p>The establishment of the Deutsche Orient Bank in Cairo is also a political
                        move. At, the time it was announced that the principal German banks were
                        interested ; the Deutsche Levante Line, which trades between Germany and
                        Egypt, has great interests in this new bank. All these ventures are
                        intimately in-woven, and are a series of wheels within wheels in a definite
                        plan, which has the German Government at the back of it. </p>
                    <p>When the time comes for Great Britain to introduce important reforms in the
                        higher administration of Egypt, when the time comes for England to take the
                        country under her direct control (as is confidently expected here at an
                        early date), then Germany will step in and say : "We have extensive
                        interests in Egypt, which we cannot allow to be overlooked. We have steamers
                        flying your flag on the Nile; through our bank we have a good deal of
                        commercial influence throughout the country ; besides which our trade with
                        Egypt is no small consideration. We do not want to obstruct your reforms,
                        but unless you give us a quid pro quo in the Near East (the Bagdad Railway
                        or Persian Gulf) we shall claim a conference to inquire into the Egyptian
                        question, or shall do our best to hinder our efforts"—or some such argument.
                        And if we get our own way without any concession on our part, it will be due
                        solely to the ability of our diplomats, for it is incontestably certain that
                        it is Germany's object to be able to say that she has certain interests in
                        Egypt, and so bring pressure to bear for concessions in other parts. The
                        Germans are smart business men ; they do not usually run commercial
                        enterprises at a loss without some very good reason, at any rate. And in
                        this case the German Government and its subsidy are the very good reason.
                        The trend of affairs is being watched with interest, and the ultimate
                        outcome of the present German ventures, although generally anticipated, is
                        being eagerly looked forward to. </p>

                    <p>In making a post-mortem examination of a boarded-out infant that died while
                        in the care of a registered nurse at North Melbourne, says the "British
                        Australasian," Dr. Mollison recently found a living caterpillar in a large
                        intestine. It is supposed that it was swallowed with food, either in its
                        existing form or as an egg. Dr. Mollison put forward a novel, yet probable,
                        solution of the story. He said that very likely the child had swallowed an
                        egg, or eggs, of a butterfly, or of a moth, and that the heat of the body
                        had completed the work of incubation. The curiosity has been forwarded for
                        examination to the Government entomologist. </p>

                    <head>CYPRUS.</head>
                    <p>''My Experiences of the Island of Cyprus." By B. Stewart. With Photographs.
                        London : Skeffington and Son. 6s. </p>
                    <p>Mr. Stewart has written an interesting book on Cyprus, and indeed no mind
                        with a sense for history and legend could fail to be inspired by an island
                        whose annals incarnate all the romance of the Crusades. Crete, perhaps, has
                        had a more exciting, or at least a more heroic, history; but the conquerors
                        who succeeded each other through the centuries left there no monuments of
                        their genius to compare with the castles and churches of Cyprus. </p>
                    <p>The Cretan themselves, who march about with a pride born of their secular
                        struggle for freedom, are certainly a more interesting race than the
                        Cypriotes. But they have no memories of Cœur de Lion and Guy de Lusignan.
                        Crete is certainly very beautiful, but it has, on the whole, the climate and
                        landscape of Southern Europe, and the traveller who goes aboard at
                        Marseilles feels no shook of surprise on landing at Suda. Cyprus, on the
                        other hand, though it is by race and history a Greek island, belongs
                        geographically to Syria. It is this strange combination of an architecture
                        which belongs to Gothic Europe and a climate that recalls Palestine which
                        makes its strange and peculiar charm. Mr. Stewart writes well on both
                        subjects. He is an engineer, and all his pages on the natural phenomena on
                        the island, its agriculture, and its material needs are decidedly
                        intelligent and informing. His descriptions of the architecture are also
                        clear and good. </p>
                    <p>With the inhabitants, unfortunately, he has less sympathy, and sees in their
                        Greek patriotism only so much sedition, which a really strong Government
                        would repress with a ruthless hand. He does not explain, however, by what
                        process we acquired a title to the devotion of their island when we took it
                        as a sort of pledge against Russian aggression on the Black Sea and saddled
                        them for the privilege with an annual tribute to the Porte. But Mr. Stewart
                        is under no illusions about the weak points of our rule. The revenue of the
                        island is only £170,000 per annum, and even with our grant-in-aid of some
                        £30,000 it has to pay about £60,000 yearly to the Turkish bond-holders. We
                        have done a very little to develop it of late, but nothing which at all
                        balances the expenses of an English administration. The irrigation system is
                        a partial failure, the new railway is ill placed, the harbours are
                        neglected, and the whole commerce of the island is paralysed by the want of
                        quick communication with the Egyptian market. Mr. Chamberlain tried to do
                        something to justify our rule. But 1rs efforts, tactful and well-meaning
                        though they were, have not compensated for a quarter of a century of neglect
                        and over-taxation. </p>

                    <head>EGYPTIAN COTTON AT MANCHESTER.</head>
                    <p>In reference to a recent report from the Alexandria General Produce
                        Association as to the exports from Alexandria during the season 1905-06, in
                        which it is stated that Manchester has made a new record in her imports of
                        Egyptian cotton with 185,128 bales against 153,956 bales the previous
                        season, a correspondent of the "Manchester Guardian" points out that the
                        actual figures of imports of Egyptian cotton to Manchester for the season
                        1905-6 were 212,257 bales, which compares with 183,297 bales in the previous
                        season. So, instead of Manchester receiving less than half of the
                        importations to Great Britain, as shown by the figures of the Alexandria
                        General Produce Association, this port has received considerably more than
                        half. </p>
                    <p>The London correspondent of the same journal, adverting to the rivalry
                        between the ports of Liverpool and Manchester, says : About Liverpool's
                        grievances against Manchester the latest I hear in London shipping quarters
                        is that the Egyptian cotton for Boston which formerly went by Liverpool is
                        now being transhipped at Manchester. </p>

                    <head>AN INTERESTING INCIDENT.</head>
                    <p>Considering the Sultan's views as to the proper position of women, a little
                        incident that occured when the Kaiser visited Constantinople acquires
                        significance. The Saltan, who, as is well-known, never leaves Yildiz Kiosk
                        except to go to prayers on Friday at noon, proposed to send various high
                        dignitaries to receive the Kaiser as he stepped on the shore of the
                        Bosphorus at the official landing place. The Kaiser required that the Sultan
                        must come and receive him in person ; and the Sultan had to yield, for he
                        keenly desired the glory in Mohamedan eyes of having a European sovereign
                        come to pay his respects to the Commander of the Faithful, and it was
                        intimated to him that personal welcome at the shore was an indispensable
                        condition. The Sultan was waiting, then, to receive the Emperor as he
                        stepped from his boat ; and two carriages were in readiness, one to convey
                        the two sovereigns, and one for the Empress. The Kaiser overturned the
                        arrangement by putting the Empress into the first carriage with the Sultan,
                        while he himself occupied the second. So it came about that the Saltan
                        endured the indescribable humiliation of driving through the streets of his
                        own capital before the eyes of his Mohamedan subjects, sitting side by side
                        with a Giaour woman. Such is the story that is told. I had not the good
                        fortune to be there to see. Nothing could be more humiliating to the Sultan
                        than that situation ; and the most effective counterblast to his Pan-Islamic
                        propaganda would be to circulate through all Islam the description of that
                        carriage drive, if any Mohamedan could be induced to believe it. The Sultan
                        himself will not forget, when the time comes, that the friendship of Germany
                        ashn ot been an unalloyod pleasure. (' Contemporary Review.") </p>

                    <byline>(From a Military Correspondent.)</byline>
                    <p>On Wednesday evening last a most interesting event took place at the British
                        Consulate, Cairo, the occasion being the marriage of Rifleman Hanet, 1st
                        King's Royal Rifles, to Miss M. E. Ogden. Lt.-Cpl Robinson and Miss A.
                        Watson, acted as best man and bridesmaid at the ceremony. </p>
                    <p>In order to show their appreciation, the members of the Inniskilling
                        Excelsior Lodge No. 109, in conjunction with the I. O. R. and friends, held
                        a social to entertain the happy couple. Both are members of the above Lodge,
                        and since their initiation have taken a keen interest in Templary generally. </p>
                    <p>Refreshments were provided, and full justice having been done to the good
                        things, the room was cleared and a most successful social followed. </p>
                    <p>Bro Brown, on behalf of Inniskilling Excelsior Lodge: I give you a hearty
                        welcome to this Lodge on your happy event. Yon have been earnest workers
                        during your membership here, and I trust you may be long spared to continue
                        your good work. </p>
                    <p>"It is very gratifying to see a young couple start life as total abstainers,
                        instead of what we are usually accustomed to—drunkenness. I trust many
                        members may follow your example, by having a sober, and sensible wedding. I
                        am sure all the members heartily join with me in wishing you every success
                        in your future lives. I now call on you to drink the health of the bride and
                        bridegroom in the only beverage God has provided, viz., "pure water"
                        (Cheers). Their healths were drunk amid applause. Bro Brown then called on
                        Bro Gervine, Blue Caps Pride Lodge, to preside. </p>
                    <p>The chairman in the course of his remarks congratulated the happy couple on
                        their marriage. </p>
                    <p>"I thank you Bros of Excelsior Lodge for asking me to preside, and moreover I
                        am very pleased to be once more amongst you for a shot time. The event just
                        celebrated is one to which we will all look back with pride, inasmuch as it
                        has been celebrated in a manner altogether at variance with the numerous
                        festivals we are accustomed to. </p>
                    <p>Strong drink predominates, the event usually culminating in a "free fight."
                        But at present Irishmen and Englishmen too are beginning to realise, and as
                        it were open their eyes to the fact that drinking whether in military or
                        civil life did not pay and we as good Templars had to congratulate ourselves
                        on the great strides that have been made in the last decade. </p>
                    <p>There cannot be any doubt that within the next generation the municipal
                        authorities will have control of the drink traffic, and "local veto will be
                        the order of the day" (hear bear). In wishing Mr and Mrs Hanett every
                        happiness, the only recompense required by good templars was that they
                        remained faithful to the principles they espoused, that they would work as
                        assiduously in the future as in past, and thereby solidify and augment the
                        order to which they were all so proud to belong (cheers). </p>
                    <p>The groom (Bro Harriett) in a few words thanked them for their complimentary
                        remarks, and said he would do all ill his power to promote the good cause
                        (cheers). </p>
                    <p>The following contributed to the programme. Sister Mrs. Hanett. Bro. Cpl.
                        Gervine, R. D. Fusrs, Bro.*. Taston, 1st Lanc. Fusrs, Bro.*. Ferguson,

                        Bro.*. Brown. </p>
                    <p>Dancing was kept up till about 12.30, when the chairman announced the
                        termination of the programme. </p>
                    <p>Bro.*. Brown C.I., proposed a vote of thanks to the chairman for presiding
                        which was seconded by Bro.*, Beatty and carred amid deafening applause. </p>
                    <p>The chairman thanked them for their kind remarks and trusted they would soon
                        meet again to consolidate the union already existing between the Lodges. </p>
                    <p>Bro.*. Beatty conveyed to the happy couple the best wishes of the Excelsior
                        Lodge and trusted they would have long life and happiness. </p>
                    <p>Mrs. Hanett thanked the members and friends for the pains they had taken to
                        make them happy,—words failed her to convey fully her heart—felt thanks, and
                        in the name of her husband she wished them success (Cheers). </p>
                    <p>The chairman suitably replied and the procedings terminated with the singing
                        of "for they are jolly good fellows" followed by the National Anthem. </p>

                        <p>To the Editor of the-"Egytian Gazette."</p>
                        <p>Sir,—In your issue of the 14th inst I notice that the Camel driver of the
                            "Al Lewa" is to be an "Hibernian patriot," and from other sources, I
                            have learnt that Gaelic is also to appear in this famous paper. </p>
                        <p>The Celtic editor is a well-known Highland sportsman, named Donaldus Ex
                            terra Mac A lister Dhue, from Ben Macdui, whose sires, in accordance
                            with the writings of an old fabulous Coptic scribe, named Kamel ebn
                            Khatam, were in Egypt in the antediluvian period, carrying on war
                            against the giants of Anubis when the North Sea or German Oman was
                            frozen over. I may as well quote a word or two here. "Donald Gorm Mac
                            Alister Dhue with 800 followers from Greenland's icy mountains to
                            India's coral strands on foot in 800 days and nights with nothing but
                            oatmeal from the Pictish country and dates from Egypt carried on Camel."
                            Kind readers, imagine what a chorus we are going to have when the "Al
                            Lewa" appears with English, simplified in American style, and Gaelic for
                            the sake of euphony. The Celtic editor, Mr. Biles, Mr. Kamel Pasha, Mr.
                            Robinson Mac Kimon, and Mr. Hardi Kerr, have been invited for a few
                            days' hunting in the Scottish mountains. Mr. Hardi Kerr, and Mr. Kamel
                            will look rather fanny in their kilts, sporans, and glengarry bonnets
                            dancing the sword dance among the hills. An Egyptian geomancer said that
                            Mr. Tonald Kamel was shortly to be a Presbyterian, being already
                            reported as a "German subject." I presume that the Revd. Saint </p>
                        <p>Peter of Alexandria will next declare that he pegged Kamel's conscience
                            before leaving the land of the Pharaohs, but the "Scotch intrigue"
                            completed the work. I am preparing a banquet for the Celtic editor, and,
                            I think for the sake of old Ireland, the English editor should be
                            entertained. No doubt Mr. Kamel will be looked up by the Rev. Saint
                            Peter, who is going to baptize him with Scotch whisky in one of the
                            hotels of Egypt, also Sheikh Blunt ebn Sheikh El Nadda, a terrible
                            Bedouin warrior from Siwa Oasis, is to give a lecture at this feast. The
                            (illegible) Tonald Kamel is leaving Egypt for Russia by order of the
                            Rev. Saint Peter to convert the Jews, Sheikh Blunt, the Egyptian
                            patriot, is to assist the Rev. Saint Peter in the purification of
                            Alexandria and Cairo. </p>

                        celui-ci n'opère bien que lorsqu'il est pris avec de bons aliments et des
                        boissons fortifiantes, telles que vin, café, thé. Chacun choisit, pour se

                        occupations. La fatigue de la purgation étant annulée par l'effet de la
                        bonne alimentation, on se décide aisément à recommencer autant de fois que
                        cela est nécessaire.</p>
