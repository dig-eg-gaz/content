                    <head>THE CRETAN QUESTION.</head>
                    <p>To-day the Greek battleship Psara is to return to Crete bringing Prince
                        George’s successor in the High Commissionership, M. Zaimis. It is now eight
                        years since, after more than half a <cb n="6"/>century of almost continuous
                        insurrection under Turkish rule, the island of Crete, having been taken in
                        hand by the four Protecting Powers—Great Britain, Russia, France, and
                        Italy—was by them constituted a separate State, subject, however, on the one
                        hand to the formal suzerainty of the Porte, and on the other hand to the
                        rule of a High Commissioner to be appointed by themselves. The second son of
                        the King of the Hellenes was the first High Commissioner; so well did he
                        succeed that his re appointment after his first three years’ office came
                        almost as a matter of course. Peace and order, however, were not destined to
                        endure in the island. Within the past few years there has come to be more
                        and more clearly defined a radical opposition between the aspirations of the
                        majority of the Cretans and the policy of the Protecting Powers. The
                        Cretans—so far, at least, as they are represented in the National
                        Assembly—desire annexation to Greece. As part and parcel of this they desire
                        the removal of the real control exercised by the four Powers and enforced by
                        the presence of their troops, and the abolition of the formal suzerainty of
                        the Porte. Time after time the Cretan Assembly has passed resolutions
                        demanding oreven declaring as a fact the union of the island to the kingdom
                        of Greece. Time after time the Protecting Powers have met this demand with a
                        direct negative. Prince George’s resignation of the High Commissionership is
                        a direct recognition of the incompatibility between the national aspirations
                        of which he made himself the spokesman and the policy of the Powers who set
                        him in office. His successor, M. Zaimis, is, of course, also a Greek, and is
                        no doubt under the circumstances one of the best men who could have been
                        chosen for the position. M. Zaimis comes of a house which is one of the most
                        distinguished in the political life of modern Greece. He is himself a
                        statesman of the highest position. He is, in virtue of a partial concession
                        of the Powers on September 17, nominated not by the Powers themselves, but
                        by the King of the Hellenes, after consultation with their reprentatives,
                        and subject to their assent. M Zaimis, in fact, represents nearly all that
                        the Cretans might be expected to want, except the one thing that they are
                        known in fact to want—annexation to Greece.</p>
                    <p>Why, then, asks the “Morning Post,” do the Powers not go this one step
                        further and allow the desired union of the island to the country to which
                        they allow such influence in the choice of a ruler? A variety of reasons may
                        be and are given, Union would mean the abolition of the formal suzerainty
                        still retained by Turkey, and would therefore not be accomplished without a
                        protest from that quarter. Again, the affairs of Crete are mysteriously
                        confused with those of Macedonia. Bulgaria would demand compensation in the
                        latter quarter if Greece were allowed to enlarge itself by the annexation of
                        Crete in the Mediterranean. A third reason, and one of quite another sort,
                        is to be found in the necessity for preserving in the island the peace to
                        secure which the Powers intervened in the first instance. In the words of
                        the Note addressed by them to the Cretan Assembly in July last, “every step
                        towards the realisation of the national aspirations must necessarily be
                        subordinated to the establishment and the maintenance of order and a stable
                        régime.” In other words, the Powers cannot,' and will not, withdraw their
                        control in favour of Greece unless and until they are convinced that this
                        will not mean opening the door to insurrection and civil warfare. In so far
                        as there is any good reason for supposing that Greece could not with the
                        goodwill of the Cretans govern them at least as peacefully as the Powers can
                        against their will, this last argument is worth considering. But unless this
                        supposition can be reasonably made—and it clearly needs a great deal of
                        proving —it must be admitted that the arguments against allowing union to
                        Greece are rather weak. If the Powers should ever themselves become
                        convinced of the necessity for this union they clearly could and would
                        disregard the possible protests of Turkey and Bulgaria. The root of the
                        difficulty probably is simply that the Powers by their constitution cannot
                        easily be convinced in favour of any positive action. The dissent of any one
                        of them may baulk the harmonious action of all. Therefore, like all other
                        associations requiring unanimity for action, they tend to inaction and to
                        letting things drift.</p>

                    <head>THE NILE FLOOD. RECORD COTTON CROP. IMPORTANT NOTE.</head>
                    <p>Mr. Webb has issued a note on the state of the Nile flood. During the first
                        part of August the flood was, although better than the series of low floods
                        experienced during the past twelve years, somewhat late in its arrival. The
                        level reached at Assouan were well below the average for thirty years past.
                        The levels of the Southern gauges, however, indicated that an improvement
                        would take place, and during the second half of August the level was
                        satisfactory, though still below the average of thirty years. During
                        September a still more satisfactory level was maintained, the average of
                        thirty years being surpassed. On the 8th September the maximum gauge at
                        Assouan was R. L. 92.68, (15 pics and 20 kinats). On the 14th September it
                        was 16 centimetres below the maximum average of thirty years. The usual fall
                        has now commenced, and will continue. Considerable difficulty was
                        experienced at the beginning of August in meeting very heavy demands for
                        irrigation of dhurra lands and the cotton crop simultaneously. This,
                        however, diminished before the middle of August and finally ceased before
                        the month was out.</p>
                    <p>The cotton crop promises to be the largest yet recorded.</p>
                    <p>Irrigation of basin lands in Upper Egypt began between the 10th and 15th
                        August and will generally be completed by the end of this month.</p>
                    <p>The levels for basin irrigation have been generally satisfactory as well as
                        for large areas of nubari dhurra planted on sahels and river islands, with
                        the exception of small areas in Assouan province and isolated sahels and
                        islands, which can only be flooded in years of very high levels. The whole
                        land in Upper Egypt will be irrigated and the discharge of the basins in the
                        Southern Provinces will begin on October 5th, and in Assiont and Minieh
                        provinces on October 10th. The flood, though late in its earlier stages, has
                        been satisfactory for the irrigation of the basin lands in Upper Egypt, and
                        at the same time the levels in Lower Egypt have been suitable for passing
                        away the flood withoat endangering the Nile banks.</p>

                    <head>PLAGUE AT SUEZ.</head>
                    <byline>(From Our Suez Correspondent.) </byline>
                    <p>The plague at Suez is apparently increasing, especially in the Rue Colmar,
                        the principal street of the town. Europeans are beginning to take the matter
                        seriously, and by this morning’s train five well-known families left
                        harriedly for Ismailia, and other places in order to avoid the danger.</p>
                    <p>Suspected cases of plague and fully diagnosed cases are conveyed by the
                        authorities to the isolation wooden huts in the desert, in a large covered
                        cart styled an "ambalance,” which is the terror of the people. The majority
                        of the Europeans have made up their minds to absolutely refuse at any
                        sacrifice to be taken away in this manner, and owing to the agitation of the
                        people, all the Consuls will hold a meeting next Tuesday morning to
                        thoroughly look into the matter, and to arrange for the comfort of the
                        people.</p>
                    <p>If the sanitary authorities were to provide a suitable ambulance to convey
                        the people to the huts, I think the matter would be taken more calmly by the
                        public. Owing to the fact that the majority of the cases have proved fatal
                        in the isolation huts, the general opinion is that these huts are not
                        adapted to Europeans, owing to their being exposed to the sun.</p>
                    <p>It is strange to see that in localities which have been disinfected fresh

                    <head> SHOCKING MURDER AT ALEXANDRIA.</head>
                    <p>A marder of a peculiarly atrocious character was committed in the Karmous
                        quarter of Alexandria last Saturday afternoon. A young Greek went to the
                        residence of his aunt whom he knew kept her savings, amounting to about
                        £150, in her house, and asked her to lend him £20. The old lady refused to
                        part with the money, so the youth drew his dagger and proceeded deliberately
                        to plunge it again and again into her face and bosom until she expired. The
                        murderer then ransacked the house, and at last succeeded in discovering the
                        hoard. There upon he made off, and has not been seen since.</p>

                    <head>ACCUSATION OF COWARDICE. ALY BEY’S REPLY.</head>
                    <p>To the Editor of the “Egyptian Gazette.” </p>
                    <p>Sir,—I was much astonished at reading the the letter contributed to your
                        esteemed paper of yesterday by a disguished writer who pretended to have
                        been present at my trial before a General Court Martial at Abbassieh in the
                        spring of 1896 where nobody is allowed to be present besides the members of
                        the Court.</p>
                    <p>I have been tried at the War Office and not at Abbassieh as what your
                        correspondent surmised.</p>
                    <p>This disguised gentleman is, as I believe him to be, an inspired person by
                        "Al Mokattam,” if he is not one of his editors, the paper which first wrote
                        on this subject touching the same points wrongly.</p>
                    <p>When I explained the true circumstances of my case, in the reply, the
                        controversy was dropt down in the Arabic papers and renewed, by its first
                        manufacturers as I believe, in your esteemed paper.</p>
                    <p>My reply in the "Al Lewa” of the 25th inst. was as follows:—</p>
                    <p>I had tendered my resignation on Sunday the 8th of March 1896 and the
                        announcement of the orders issued to the effect of mobilising the Sudan
                        Expedition was made on the 15th of March after H.H. the Khedive’s return
                        from the Mosque of Amr on Friday the 13th of March when His Highness
                        presided the Council of the Ministers held on that day to decide on the
                        despatching of the Sudan Expedition.</p>
                    <p>If “Al Mokattam” desires to know my case well, it may ask H. E. Mohammed
                        Zohry Pasha who was a member in the General Court Martial, held at the War
                        Office on the 21st of March 1896 for my trial and who was one of the great
                        opponents to the decision of the court when H. E. read the date of the
                        postal seal impressed on the envelope containing my application for
                        resignation and became sure that I addressed the letter to the War Office a
                        week before the announcement for despatching the expedition to Dongola was
                        made public and even before it was discussed by the Council of
                        Ministers,</p>
                    <p>If this does not suffice those who think that they can not defend the Syrians
                        whom we esteem so much, but by insulting others, we shall be obliged to add
                        a new page to Mr. Blunt's “Atrocities of Justice” in defence of the

                    <p>We hear on good authority that the following important changes in the

                        Chitty Bey will finally leave the Customs, and will take up a post in the
                        Ministry of Finance, which has yet to be named, but will probably bear with

                        Controller General will be direotly responsible to the Minister of Finance
                        and the Financial Adviser. The place which Chitty Bey has so worthily and so

                        King Lewis, Controller of the Department of Direct Taxation, whose great

                        week, of Private James Foy, of the 21st Lancers, who met with his death
                        whilst playing in a football match last Saturday by sustaining a rupture of
                        the intestine in a fall. Private Foy had served 14 years with the 21st
                        Lancers. He went through the Egyptian campaign ; took part in the celebrated
                        charge at Omdurman ; and held the medal for the action and the Khartoum
                        clasp. A pathetic feature of Private Foy’s death is that when he met with
                        his fatal accident he was about to purchase his discharge from the Army. He
                        was one of the best football players in the regiment, and for the last five
                        years he kept goal for the regimental team.</p>

                    <p>It is rumoured that the Pasha is contemplating the purchase of one of the
                        most important European daily newspapers in Cairo.</p>
                    <p>The servioes of a former French journalist at Cairo are to be engaged for the

                    <p>The English part will be under the control of an Irish Nationalist

                    <p>Many members of Parliament have promised the Pasha to favour his new English

                    <head>MR. BLUNT’S BOOK.</head>
                    <p>The criticism by Mr. Moberly Bell to which “Al Mokattam” refers, as noted in
                        our issue of Saturday appears in a letter ot the “Times” signed “Your
                        Correspondent in Egypt 1865-1890.” It runs as follows"</p>
                    <p> Sir,—Will you allow me to recall, and to me as a warning, some Egyptian
                        history of 25 years ago ?</p>
                    <p> In the year 1881 there was a beginning of trouble in Egypt—it was a cloud no
                        bigger than a man’s hand—a military riot in Cairo barely noticed in your
                        columns. There had been another, apparently more serious, three years before
                        ; but, though it produced a change of Ministry, and eventually the
                        deposition of Ismail, it had been followed by no disorder,and there was no
                        reason to suppose that this insubordination of three Egyptian colonels would
                        have serious consequences.</p>
                    <p> But then, as now, the danger was not from Egypt, but from London. There is a
                        class of Englismen who have adopted as their motto “Against our country
                        whether right or wrong,” and because we had already become partly
                        responsible for order in Egypt, Mr. Wilfrid Soawen Blunt felt called upon to
                        make himself the spokesman and supporter of whatever elements of disorder
                        might exist in that country.</p>
                    <p> It is not too muoh to say that the whole Egyptian question of 1881-2, with
                        all its consequences, ostensibly directed by Arabi and largely assisted by
                        the incompetence of the British Government, was due to the mischievous
                        interference of Mr. Wilfrid Blant, who, on the failure of his hopes after
                        the loss of many thousands of lives, consoled himself by making it the
                        subject of a poem.</p>
                    <p> Had tbe matter ended there, perhaps there might not have been much cause for
                        lament. The achievements of England in Egypt have in that quarter of a
                        century been so magnificent and benefioent that, even apart from the
                        production of that poem, they might well be worth the purchase at the price
                        of some blood and treasure.</p>
                    <p> But, unfortunately, that poem contained a a prophecy. Mr. Blunt was not
                        content with apostrophizing his victims: —</p>
                    <p>I oare not if you fled, . . . </p>
                    <p>It may be you were cowards. Let them prove it. </p>
                    <p>What matter ? </p>
                    <p>He was not content with announcing from his armchair that he himself would
                        “rather fly with the first craven” than “head the hottest charge.” As a
                        matter of fact, he did neither, but he felt that the mantle of the prophet
                        was upon him, and, addressing his own countrymen, he said :—</p>
                    <p>Thou wentest to this Egypt for thy pleasure. </p>
                    <p>Thou shalt remain with her for thy sore pain. </p>
                    <p>Thou hast possessed her beauty. Thou wouldst leave her. </p>
                    <p>Nay—thou shalt lie with her as thou hast lain. </p>
                    <p>She shall bring shame upon thy face with all men. </p>
                    <p>She shall disease thee with her grief and fear. </p>
                    <p>Thou shalt grow sick and feeble in her ruin. </p>
                    <p>Thou shalt repay her to the last sad tear. </p>
                    <p>Well, a quarter of a century has elapsed and the prophecy remains not only
                        unfulfilled, but very gloriously disproved. This is naturally exasperating
                        to a prophetic poet, but again today there is another cloud no bigger than a
                        man’s hand, and, mindful of past achievements, Mr. Blunt’s hopes rise. Again
                        he struggles to convert chaos out of order; again he risks the sacrifice of
                        more British blood and treasure— perhaps again to find a subject for a
                        poem.</p>
                    <p>If we may judge from Sir Edward Grey’s declarations, the Liberal Ministry of
                        1906 will not make the same fatuous blunder as their predecessors of 1881.
                        But, lest they should do so, it may be useful that they should read these
                        extracts from your files of 21 years ago.</p>
                    <p> In “The Times” of September 29, 1885, I wrote:—</p>
                    <p> Two men, each doubtless equally honest and equally injudicious, must share
                        between them the responsibility for these earlier incidents of our
                        operations in Egypt—Mr. Blunt, who assured Arabi that Mr. Gladstone was not
                        in earnset, and Mr. Gladstone, who was only in earnest when it was too
                        late.</p>
                    <p> In "The Times” of October 2, 1885, you published a correspondence from which
                        I make the following extracts :—</p>
                    <p> Mr. Gladstone to Mr. Blunt, September 29, 1885:—</p>
                    <p> My reason for declining to answer you is that I am reluctant to say what I
                        think as to your conduct in Egypt—I means as to its character and effect,
                        for I do not question its motives. Were Arabi Pasha to invite me to a
                        controversy I should have to make a similar answer.</p>
                    <p> Mr. Blunt to Mr. Gladstone, Setember 30, 1885:—</p>
                    <p> When the acount is drawn up between us, as it must be some day, in regard to
                        events so tragic in the world’s history as the bombardment of Alexandria,
                        the massacres of June and July, Arabi’s trial, your broken promises to
                        Egypt, and Gordon’s death, I do not fear that honest men will hold me in any
                        way your debtor.</p>
                    <p> Mr. Blnnt’s poem was entitled “The Wind and the Whirlwind.” He sowed the
                        wind—much wind; he reaped the reproach alike of those he opposed and of
                        those he supported.</p>

                    <head>THE LATE MAJOR JOHNSTONE. DEATH AFTER AN OPERATION. </head>
                    <p> Farther details concerning the death of Major L’Estrange Johnstone, which
                        have been telegraphed from London to the Board of the State Railways
                        Administration by Colonel Western, prove that the supposition that death was
                        due to an accident was erroneous, and that he succumbed to a sudden illness
                        which had necessitated the performance of an operation.</p>
                    <p> The week before last Major Johnstone, says the telegram referred to, felt
                        seedy and he consulted a specialist. On Monday he entered a nursing home to
                        prepare for the operation which had been decided upon. This was performed on
                        Wednesday, but he died on on Thursday evening.</p>
                    <p> The funeral will take place to morrow at Alya, Sterling.</p>
                    <p> A memorial service in memory of the late General Manager of State Railways
                        will be held at All Saints’ Church, Cairo, on Wednesday at 6 p.m.</p>
                    <p> A correspondent writes from Cairo : —</p>
                    <p> Universal and sincere regret was expressed on every side when the news of
                        the untimely death of Major L’Estrange Johnstone became known in Cairo, and
                        wherever Englishmen met together the sad tidings were the topic of
                        conversation. To him is due to a large extent the efficiency of the railway
                        service of which Egypt can now boast. I do not mean to suggest that the
                        service is on parallel with that of European countries, but it will be
                        granted by all that the progress which has been effected in the Railway
                        Administration is equal to that of any administration. You remarked in your
                        issue of Saturday that Major Johnstone could not be considered as an
                        administrator of the first rank, and such, indeed, was the case, but by his
                        indomitable energy he overcame many of the obstacles which oppose
                        responsible officialdom in Egypt. He instituted many reforms and during his
                        seven yean of presidency steady progress was made.</p>
                    <p> He was admired, respected, and even beloved by those who worked under
                        him,and he succeeded in gaining the confidence of the native employés of
                        every grade. His consideration for and great kindness to his employés gained
                        for him great popularity, and all feel that they have lost a kind friend as
                        well as a lenient master.</p>
