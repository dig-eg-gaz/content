                    <head>THE SALT MONOPOLY.</head>
                    <p>The withdrawal of lire salt monopoly from the Salt and Soda Company doses an
                        im- portant-little ohapter in the history of modern Bgyptian finance, and
                        the evolution of the oonoession will be of interest to many of onr readers,
                        especially at the present moment Daring the early period of Ismail Pasha’s
                        Khediviate, the Government sometimes under- took the distribution of salt to
                        the population: at times the revenue was farmed. The prioe of salt was
                        frequently changed, generally in the direction of increasing it The results
                        were apparently never satisfactory. The numerous abuses which had sprung np
                        in the administration of the Department attracted the attention of the
                        Commission of Inquiry whioh sat in 1878-79. It was then discovered that the
                        salt-tax had practically degenerated into a poll-tax, whioh was paid equally
                        by those who oonsnmed a great deal of salt, and by those who consumed little
                        or none. Com- plaints, indeed, were received that in som- ptaoes, although
                        the purchase-money had been paid, no salt had been delivered for more than a
                        year. </p>
                    <p>Some years previons’y, a rough calcnlation 1 been made of the population of
                        each Uge, and, irrespective of any ohanges which ight subsequently have
                        occurred, an exor- 'ant amount of salt was suppoUd to be pplied, for which
                        the villagers were obliged • pay whether they required the salt or not Vt
                        one rime the supply was based on an k«erage consumption of 25 lbs. per
                        head—a i(are which wu about donble the real rate. At a later period, the
                        quantity was reduced to 61 lbs. per head, but as the prioe was simul-
                        -aneonsly raised in proportion, the ohange was irrtfnl rather than
                        beneficial to the people. Toe practical working of the system was soffi-
                        neatly indicated by the instructions which sere issued to the provincial
                        authorities, who were told that, if the villages did not take the prescribed
                        amoant -of salt, they “must, as is righ\ punish the villages by inflicting a
                        free equal to the prioe of the salt whioh has not been taken, while obliging
                        them at the same time to pay for the salt” Redress against the obvious
                        injustice of this system eras impossible^. The Inspector General of Upper
                        Egypt, wE being asked by the Commissioners to whom the tax payer could
                        address himself if he had any complaint to make in connection with this or
                        other fiscal matters, replied with a naivity arising, without doubt, from
                        long familiarity with a system whioh he considered both just and natural,
                        "Pour les imp6ta le fellah ne pent se plaindre; il sait qu’on agit par ordre
                        sup5- rieur : C'est le Gouvernement lui mdme qni les reclame. A qui
                        voulez-vous qu’il se plaigoe.” </p>
                    <p>As a consequence of the report of the Commission of Irquiry, some of the wont
                        features of the system which had heretofore' prevailed were removed during
                        the period of the Dual Control. But it can scarcely be said that the reform
                        of this branch of the Administration was seriously taken in hand till some
                        years later, when Mr. Iforker was appointed Director-General of the Salt
                        Depart- ment. Under his auspices the consumption of salt had increased in
                        1899 from 33.000to60,000 tons or from rather less than 4 kilos to rather
                        more than 5 kilos per head of popu- lation. Although the prioe of salt had
                        been reduoed by 60 per cent, the revenue has since 1892—the first year in
                        which it can be truly said that thore was a complete absence of direct or
                        indirect compulsion to purchase—been steadily growing. In 1904 the
                        consumption was 60,000 tons, and the net revenue £B. 82,000. </p>
                    <p>It cannot be donbted that one of the main defects of the old Egyptian regime
                        was the exoe*aire interference of the Government, and more especially of the
                        Ruler of the State, in all the affairs of the oountry. Ismail Pasha not only
                        attempted to administer every de- partment of the State in person, he may
                        almost be said to have monopolised the com- mercial enterprise of the
                        oonntry. He was the largest landowner, the largest shipowner, and the
                        largest sugar manatacturer in Egypt In fact be was omnipresent In his
                        endeavours to combine all these separate functions in his own person, he
                        naturally failed to obtain success in any one of them. Daring the last few
                        years the Egyptian Go- vernment mindful of past errors, has en- deavoured
                        gradually and prudently to divest itself of Booh functions as may more
                        usefully be performed by private individuals, and to oonceotrate. its
                        efforts on duties which, iu a more healthy and advanoed condition ot so-
                        ciety, manifestly appertain to the State. In pursuance of this polioy, it
                        was thought that in 1899 the time had arrived when the distribu- tion of
                        salt to the population might with advantage cease to be oatried ont through
                        Government agency. In that year therefore an arrangement was made under
                        which the Government monopoly was oeded to a British company, under the
                        style of the Egyptian Salt &amp; Soda Company, Limited. The subse- quent
                        history of the oompanj is too well known to need recapitulation. Bnt now the
                        Government find that the fiaanoial situation of the oountry is so
                        satisfactory that the pre- sent salt monopoly is to be abolished, for, as
                        Lord Cromer remarked in his last report, it is “one of the greatest of the
                        remaining blots in the existing fisoal system.” At the same time the
                        Government Will endeavour to exercise great discretion, so as not to
                        interfere with the present prosperity of the Salt &amp; Soda Company, the
                        sphere of whose industrial operations is so wide that the abolition of the
                        monopoly shonld not affeot its fature success under its present oaptble
                        management.</p>

                    <p>St. Petersburg, November 16.</p>
                    <p>59.000 men are now on strike. It is feared that a hooligan outbreak may take
                        place at any moment. The situation is so grave that the British Embassy is
                        arranging to send away British single women and governesses. Those choosing
                        to remain, will do so at their own risk.</p>

                    <p>59.000 men are at present on strike, but here is some reason to question its
                        duration owing to lack of funds and the extreme distress it causes among the
                        working classes.</p>
                    <p>The employes of the St Petersburg-Moscow railway have struck.</p>
                    <p>M. Witte has issued an appeal to the factory hands in which he says :
                        “Brothers return to your work. Pity your wives and children, and pay no heed
                        to evil counsellors Listen to the man who loves: you and who will do his
                        utmost to give effect to the Emperor's solicitude in your behalf; only give
                        os time.”</p>
                    <p>Indignation and alarm are felt in South Russia on account of the fact that
                        two Imperial ukases commend the Governor of Bessarabia, whom the Jews hold
                        responsible for the massacres at Kishineff and elsewhere, and thank the
                        troops at Odessa for their exemplary conduct during the disorders.</p>

                    <head>FREEING THE SUDAN. THE RED SEA-NILE RAILWAY AND ITS RESULTS.</head>
                    <p>A week or two ago thero appeared in several of the London newspaper, a modest
                        little para- graph atating that the work of Ujnng the rails on the
                        Saakin-Berbor railway bad been com- pleted In this unobtrusive fashion was
                        the economic independenoe of the Sudan announc- ed. Ismail Pasha, when
                        Khedive, realised that if Egypt was to maintain ita hold on the Sudan the
                        means of communication most be improved. Unfortunately, in his wish to bring
                        the Sudan trade down the Nile, lie was led to abandon its natural outlet by
                        the route from Suakin to Berber, and deter- mined to make a railway along
                        the Nile from Wady Haifa, past the cataraots. On this project, which
                        oollapsod in 1877, half a mil- lion was spent on building fifty miles of
                        rails, which ended en Fair, or, rather, in the de sort The Suakin-Berber
                        line was later on strongly advocated by Genoral Gordon, and in 1885, after
                        Gordon’s death, the Ministry of Mr. Gladstone actually authorised the con-
                        struction of a railway to the Nile from Suakin, and a feeble start was made
                        in the building of the line. Then Mr. Gladstone decided to abandon the
                        Sudan, and the work came to an end—at considerable cost to the British
                        taxpayer. When at length the Sudan was reconquered by Lord Kitchener, a
                        rail- way, as all the world knows, was built across tbo dosort from Wady
                        Haifa to Khartoum, and the dream of Ismail realised after b quarter of a
                        century. The Khartoum line was built, however, for military purposes, and as
                        a commercial highway it boa been well-nigh nsoloss, for it is impossible to
                        tree trade into an unnatural channel. No one has re, cognised this more
                        clearly than Lord Cromer, and to his determination to give the Sudan a
                        chance of becoming self-supporting, to bring prosperity (and therefore
                        bappinessl). to its in- habitants, we owe the building of this lice. Be-
                        fore stating some cf the edvantrges which will result from its opening, a
                        few particulars con- cerning the railway itte'f may be given. </p>
                    <p>From Suakin (the presont sea terminus) the line, which is in all 333 miles
                        long, goes north, and then ascends the plateau, Borne 3.000 feet high, which
                        runs parallel to the coast The line then strikes south-west across the
                        desert- thero is a waterless stretch of over fifty miles — to the At bar a
                        river, reached at a point about SO miles below the junction of that stream
                        with, the Nile. The railway then rone by the side of the Atbara until it
                        joins the Kbartoum-Wady Haifa line, a mile north of the Atbara Bridge. The
                        steepest gradient is 1 in 100, and the sharpest curve 5 degrees.
                        Preparations for the construction of the line were begun in 1903, by the
                        makiog of a quay and the erection of a steam crane and similar works at
                        Suakin. The aotual building of the lino Was .commenced in the middle of
                        1904. under the superintendence of Lieutenant- Colonel Macauley. Work
                        progressed simulta- neously at the Suakin and Atbara ends, that from Suakin
                        involving much blasting of reck, being much the slowest. This work was also
                        delayed by the heavy rains and consequent wash-onts in 1 he Suakin bills,
                        but by March last the heaviest section of the whole line was done. The
                        greatest difficulties Colonel Ma- caoley had to overcome were the almost
                        entire absence of a regolar water supply and the scarcity of labour. The
                        Bedouin, as may be imagined, is not an ideal labourer,and employ- ment of
                        these nomads did not prove success- ful. Men from Abyssinia have been used
                        in the bridging work, but the bulk of the manual labour has been done by the
                        Nile Valley Nubians end by fellaheen from Egypt. The total coat of the
                        railway will be about £3,000,000, and the whole of the money has been
                        provided out of the aorplua revenues of Egypt The line is expected to be
                        opened for traffio early in the new year. </p>
                    <p>It will be netioed that Suakin has been described as the "present" sea
                        terminus o! the railway. Suakin, though it has been since the days of the
                        Pharaohs the chief seaport north of Massowah on the western shores o' the
                        Red Sea, is an inconvenient harbour, with a dangerous approach, and the
                        Sudan Govern- ment last year dee ded to eeleot another site as their Red Sea
                        outlet. The spot cboset was 8beikh Bargout ("My lord shrimp"), i place about
                        45 miles north of Suakin, with a better harbour than the old port, and ar
                        infinitely better water supply. Rechristened Port 8odan—which is a sacrifice
                        of the pic- turesque—the new tswn has already a popu- lation of over 2,000,
                        and the Sudan Govern- ment is busily building warehouses, Customs offioes, a
                        railway station, and all the things necessary to cope with the expected
                        trade. So far, the goods for the railway have been taken to Suakin, but the
                        laying of the raili from the new harbour to the point where the line
                        approaches nearest to Sheikh £a> gout has been begun, and should be finished
                        by Christmas. Thereafter the deviation t 8nakin will become superfluous ; it
                        is difficult to see how the old port will oontinue to exist </p>
                    <p>It is almost impossible to exaggerate the important results expected to flow
                        from tb« opening of this railway. Lest it be though- that our optimism bas
                        no substantial founds tion, we will not go beyond the language oaed by Lord
                        Cromer on the subject. The fine, it must be observed, passes through no
                        territon capable of much development rave for tbs few miles it follows the
                        Atbara; it is but a means to an end, a bridge over the waste o' desert which
                        separates the Eastern 8cdan from the outer world. But it will be a bridge of
                        sur- passing importance. To mention one item—it will immensely cheapen the
                        cost of fuel (coal) at Khartoum, and thus will permit commercial
                        developments impossible while, as at present, coal costs at Khartum some £4
                        a ton. Again, it will render possible the construction of subsidiary
                        railways in the fertile regions of the Sudan; a branch line to Kassala, and
                        a railway from El Obeid to Ed Dueim on the Nile are already contemplated.
                        The Kassala line will tap a region rich in cereals ; that from El Obeid will
                        enable the gum arabio of Kordofan to be put on the world's markets at a
                        consider- ably reduced prioe, while giving the merchants greater profit. Of
                        more immediate importance is the line now being built, from Abou Hamed to
                        the Dongola province ; by this means it is believed that Dongola will
                        capture the trade in cereals with Arabia. Besides all these things, there is
                        the probability—the great probability —of the Sudan becoming a very large
                        producer of ootton. </p>
                    <p>It is a mistake to suppose, as is sometimes done, that the new line will
                        injure Egypt It is not a question of taking trade away from Alexandria and
                        transferring it to the Red Sea ports. It is rather a question of creating a
                        new trade, which but for the railway oould not exist Hitherto (save gum and
                        ivory) scarcely an article produood in the Sudan could be sold in the
                        markets of Europe at a profit being weighted with tho cost of freight
                        between Khartoum and Egypt And these same heavy freights have gone far to
                        st;fle also the import trade. It cannot be doubted that the construc- tion
                        of the Red Sea-Nile railway is a distinct step in making the Sudan
                        self-supporting. The railway, in fact should prove as bent fioent for the
                        Sudan as the construction of the Assouan dam bas proved beneficont for
                        Egypt. </p>

                    <p>The "Deutschs Monatssohrift” publishes a review of Andreas Gildermeister’s
                        book cn England, and also devotes the whole of its back cover to an
                        advertisement of the volume. It describes it as a highly notable disclosure,
                        and reoommends the work in the following terms: "Because England—no semi-
                        official attempt to hush matters up, no sym- pathy and friendship between
                        individuals can obange the fact—is our most dangerous poli- tical enemy, we
                        must silently forge arms for our defence with all our strength. Although
                        Bngland is our enemy we must have the justioe and dignity to recognise her
                        great qualities. We must never forget that she is akin to us in her Geimanio
                        origin, and that we must keep on terms of intellectual community with her,
                        for she is in many respects more developed than we are, and we have moch to
                        learn from her both politically and socially. We desire before all things to
                        import from Great Britain a little aristocracy—not English, but Germanic —in
                        order to'resoscitate as powerfully as possible what we ourselves possessed
                        before the rise of this new German parvenu civilisa- tion. Therefore
                        chivalrous respect for England. Let us learn from and defend ourselves
                        strongly from her.” </p>

                    <head>HUNGARY AND THE HOHENZOLLERNS.</head>
                    <p>A very curious sign of the times in Hungary is the publication of a pamphlet,
                        called "The Hungarian Crisis and the Hoheniollems,” which was written by
                        Professor Julius von Zeysio. It was originally issued in Hungarian, and was
                        then translated into German, in which guise it has been circulated all over
                        the Austro- Hungarian Monarohy. The theme of the author is that the Bmpira
                        of the Hapsburgs is rotten to the core, and he formally invites the Kaiser
                        to intervene in the struggle now going on, to make Hungary an independent
                        kingdom, and to place one of his sons upon the throne. The Professor holds
                        that Hungary should be enlarged by the addition of Galioia, Dalmatia, and
                        Bosnia, and that in the future it shonld extend over all the oountry as far
                        as Salonioa. The Triple Allianoe is breaking up, and Professor von Zeysio
                        proposes that the Emperor William should lend his powerful aid to build up a
                        strong Hungary, which would be capable of taking the plaoe of decadent
                        Austria as the ally of Germany, whose interests are identical with those of
                        the Magyars. It is impossible to believe that these sentiments are shared by
                        the great majority of Hungarians, but the pamphlet has had a great snooess,
                        in spite of the.fact, which is not surprising, that its sale has been
                        forbidden in the Austro- Hungarian Monarohy. </p>
