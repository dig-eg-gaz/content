                    <p>The following note from Berlin on the reoen rtisle by Mastepha Pasha Kamel
                        appears ii be "Megdebotgiche Zeitaeg.” The italicized portions of the
                        article are printed in large type in the paper :— The principal organ of the
                        Social Democratic arty has onoe more made a great "ado about othing." A
                        Berlin paper has inserted an rtiole by the Anglophobe leader of the inde
                        etadent party in Bgypt Mostapha Kama ’aeha, in whioh he Complains that the
                        Raise Vilhelm, who has of tea shown himself a warm riend of Islam, did not
                        step forward at the ight moment to secure tie independence of Egypt. The
                        Pashoda affair would have been tin ight opportunity to assure himself of
                        Fraud assistance against the English protectorate designs. Mustapha Kamel
                        himself Could have given the reply to his article. Germany has never shown
                        any desire to meddle with other nation's affairs, the has alwyas been
                        content with securing her own interests. Only by the desires have we been
                        led into the Morocco affair, which has new been brought to a pacific
                        conclusion. The Vorwaests need not be afraid that in England the suspicion
                        could arise, that Germany intends to betray England owing to he
                        France-English understanding. Regarding Egypt we received a reliable state
                        ment straight from England to whioh German had no need to make any kind of
                        protest She has never intended to go against English cities, because the
                        good administration wkic iat been established in tki Nile Valley unde he
                        English protectorate is undoubtedly useful to German interests. The
                        difficulties which Ingland encountered in Egypt came mor rom other sources.
                        Certainly the appearance a Mustapha Kamel Pasha is of symptomatic im
                        portance, as was also that of Maharqjih Dhu leep Sing, who caused snob a
                        great sensation by his passionate oomplairfta against Boglam o 188'. The
                        English Press acts always as if danger meuaoed the British Empire onl rom
                        without. But here also is true the of proverb about the skeleton in every

                        probably have opened his eyes and ordered its non-paydment; thus ths unfor-
                        anato Susserian shareholders would be the richer by that amount. It must be
                        remembered that the Societe des Succeries issued mostly in France and Egypt
                        20,000,000 fnancs of debetures only nine months back—a earn twday pmetieelly

                        not received this semestrial installment, when due, immediate steps would
                        have been taken by the Corporation both against the Succeseries, which is
                        now covered by the Coaoordat, and the Dalra Banish Company, UmStei. This
                        latter company, on the 1st instant, issued a hurried notice calling a
                        general meeting for the 25th of this month for the purpose of winding up,
