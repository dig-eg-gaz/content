                        <p>The references to the new Mining Depart- ment in the Financial Adviser's
                            most inter- esting Budget Note will be of considerable interest to all
                            who believe in the future of Egyptian mining, and bear ample testimony
                            to the readiness of the Government to support all genuine attempts to
                            develop the mineral industry of the country. The great area of the
                            regions in which ancient workings have been found, and the probability
                            that modern ap- liances will revive an industry practically abandoned
                            since the early middle ages, if not earlier, have "induced the
                            expenditure of large sums of money within the next few years for further
                            exploration and develop- ment work, most of which money will be deriv-
                            ed from sources outside the country and spent in it." To this end a
                            Department of Mines has been formed. <persName>Mr. Wells</persName>, the
                            Inspector General of Mines, has an admirable record as a practical
                            mining engineer, and his knowledge of the industry and his energy in
                            scouring the <placeName>Arabian and Lybian desert</placeName> have
                            already borne fruit, and we understand that during his last leave be
                            examined various methods of motor transport with a view to improving
                            communi- cation between the mining areas and the Nile. New tri-car
                            motors have been adopted which have stood their trials over very rough
                            ground with real success, and it is stated that should the development
                            of the mining industry be such as to demand it, a regular system of
                            motor communication will be adopted. To prevent individuals or parties
                            going to or returning from the mines being in any way molested, either
                            by Bedouins, who, to do them justice, have hitherto been well behaved,
                            or by stray ruffians like the bandit who fell to a coast guard patrol a
                            few weeks ago, a special force of desert police has been organised. The
                            measure is a timely one and will have the development of mining may
                            possibly result in labour troubles. A strike or an affray at a mining
                            camp would lose half its danger if a police force were held in readiness
                            to start at once from Edfon to the scene of disturbance and patrols were
                            known to be constantly moving in the desert.</p>
                        <p>The development of motor transport and the possibility of adapting strong
                            and fast motor cars to desert work opens up fascinating cistas of the
                            future of the desert tracts of North Africa. Perhaps in the next
                            generation we shall see motor excursions to Siwa posts, wells, and
                            artificial cases created, thanks to the development of the machine, and
                            the Arabian and Syrian deserts yielding up their mineral wealth while
                            their cases are as prosper- ous as in Roman days. Fanciful Well, the use
                            of motor cars for purposes of cross-country travel and transport is only
                            in its infancy, the future may show us all these things or more, and
                            bolds fascinating vistas or adventure: the Sahara tamed by French

                        <head>THE EGYPTIAN QUESTION</head>
                        <p>In a leading article, our native contemporary "Al Zaher" remarks:-Many
                            people think that the Egyptian question is closed forever, and that the
                            Anglo-French Agreement of April, 1904, has put an end to Egyptian hopes,
                            thus causing many to despair in regard to England's withdrawal from
                            Egypt. Those people obtain confirmation intheir belief on seeing the
                            silence of the native Press on the subject, but they are mistaken. The
                            egyptian Question now is in the same position as it was in 1882.
                            Statesmen are sparing no efforts to call the attention of Europe to the
                            question, and the final decision is still to come. <persName>M.
                                Freyeinet</persName>, the ex-Minister of the French Foreign Office,
                            published a few months ago a book entitled "The Egyptian Question" in
                            which he dealt with all the details of this subject. He declared that
                            France had, for- tunately, done nothing to affirm the British authority
                            in Egypt, and that the British Occu- pation has still the same features
                            as befire, without any additional guarantees. Thus the Egyptian Question
                            still exists and the eventual withdrawal of the Occupation must be look-
                            ed for.</p>

                    <p>A Foundling. A newly born child was found by the police near
                            <placeName>Mustapha Pasha</placeName> yesterday and removed to

                    <p>Burned to Death. A native girl of 6, diving in the Custom house quarter, was
                        burned to death yesterday through her clothes catching fire from a candle
                        which she was holding in her hand.</p>

                    <p>Railway Fatality. To save a third-class fire from Cairo to Suez, a native got
                        on the roof of a carriage of the train which left
                            <placeName>Bab-el-Hadid</placeName> station at 7 a.m. on Saturday. At

                        bridge and he was killed on the spot.</p>
                    <p>International Chamber of Commerce. The International Chamber of Commerce at
                        Cairo met last night to elect a president in place of <persName>M.

                    <p>A Good Scheme. The Government proposes to supplement each year the Cassel
                        charity by the establish- ment of one or more permanent ophthalmic
                        hospitals, until every moudirieh shall have its own hospital. One will be
                        built next year for a sum of L.E. 4,000. The annual charge will be about
                        L.E. 5,000.</p>
                    <p>Union Artistique Francaise. The above society will give a dramatic per-
                        formance in their hall in Stamboul-street this evening, commencing at 9. The
                        programme consists of three parts, i.e., La Femme a conference in one act,
                        Monsieur Badin, a one-act comedy by <persName>Courteline</persName>, and Les

                    <p>New British Club. Donations of £5 each in aid of the founding of the new
                        British Club at Alexandria have been received from the London and Lancashire
                        Life Assurance Co. and the General Fire and Accident Assurance Corporation.
                        It is to be hoped that the other insurance companies will follow this
                        excellent example.</p>
                    <p>Appointment for <persName>Dr. Sandwith</persName>. <persName>Dr.
                            Sandwith</persName> has been appointed Lecturer on Tropical Diseases in
                            <placeName>St. Thomas’s Medical School</placeName>. <persName>Dr.
                            Sandwith</persName>’s wide experience of the subject should be a
                        sufficient guarantee, if it were necessary, for the distinct advantage which
                        St. Thomas’s students in the future will derive by the addition to their
                        teaching staff of so eminent an authority as <persName>Dr. Sand-
                            with</persName>. Every London Medical School in the near future will be
                        compelled to have a Lecturer on Tropical Diseases, and this is not
                        surprising when we come to consider that each hospital sends a large number
                        of its old students into the Services, and to practise abroad. It is,
                        therefore, essential for these men to have at least some idea of the nature
                        of the diseases which are commonly met with in the Tropics.</p>

                    <p>In his Note on the 1905 Budget, the Financial Adviser says :— Roughly
                        speaking, it may be said that Egypt is actually spending from L.E. 300,000
                        to L.E. 400,000 annually on public buildings ; not, I think, an extravagant
                        sum, having re- gard to the revenue of the country and the fact that
                        everything has to be provided ab initio, hospitals, post offices, prisons,
                        asylums, schools, police stations, to say nothing of Gou- vernorats, and
                        other Government buildings of practically every description.</p>
                    <p>Of course in the above figures are not in- cluded great works of public
                        utility of a remunerative nature, which are charged to Reserve Fund.</p>

                    <p>In remarking on the increase in the budget of the Ministry of War
                            <persName>Sir Vincent Corbett</persName> says:—</p>
                    <p>L.E 50,000 represents a portion of Army expenditure hitherto refunded by the
                        Sudanese Government and which will for the future be borne by Egypt. Seeing
                        that the Egyptian Army in the <placeName>Sudan</placeName> is employed to
                        all intents and purposes in guarding the Egyptian frontier and that its
                        movements are dictated by Egyp- tian interests, it seemed unfair any longer
                        to burden the nascent revenue of the Sudan with so heavy a charge. The sum
                        thus set free will be employed in the interior development of the country,
                        thus hastening the day, not, I am confident, very far distant, when the re-
                        venue of the <placeName>Sudan</placeName> will not only suffice for its
                        wants, but enable it to make a return on the considerable sums invested by
                        Egypt in that country.</p>

                    <p>It is regrettable that the last named institu- tion should not have seen its
                        way to effecting still larger economies, as its work is now practically
                        limited to the "payment of the coupon out of sums automatically paid into
                        its coffers by the State.</p>

                        provincial commissions : — The local Municipal Commissions, which
                        constituted a sort of middle term between governmental and municipal control
                        of local business, are working farly well, but owing to the regime of the
                        Capitulations, which hampers local reform at every turn, they are unable to
                        develop as satisfactorily as could be wished. The privileges of foreigners
                        render local taxa- tion to any reasonable extent an impossibility, with the
                        result that there is an ever-increasing demand under this head for aid from
                        the funds of the central Government.</p>

                    <p>The "Kölnische Zeitung" publishes a com- munication which, although dated
                        from <placeName>Cairo</placeName>, probably emanates from
                            <placeName>Berlin</placeName>, regarding a readjustment of the postal
                        tariff between Ger- many and Egypt. According to this communi- cation, the
                        Egyptian Government has entered into communication with other countries for
                        the purpose of bringing about a reduction of its postal tariff, similar to
                        that recently arrang- ed with <placeName>England</placeName> in order to
                        show that Egypt has not become a British colony. The German Government is
                        now considering the matter. Probably penny postage will be introduced

                    <p><persName>Mr. James Currie</persName>, Director of Education in the
                            <placeName>Sudan</placeName>, and Principal of the Gordon Memorial
                        College at <placeName>Khartoum</placeName>, reporting on the work of the
                        institution for 1904, makes mention of the great loss the collnge has
                        sustained by the death of <persName>Mr. Alfred Spalding Harvey</persName>,
                        the hon. secretary, and of his own indebtedness to <persName>Mr.
                            Harvey</persName>’s sagacity and wide knowledge of men and things. The
                        past year, he says, has been rather an eventful one, and several important
                        decisions have been taken, though these perhaps may be said to represent the
                        development of exiting agencies and do not constitute fresh departures. The
                        college, apart from the laboratories, as has been explained in previous
                        reports, has so far been divided into three sections: a Primary School, a
                        Training College for Schoolmasters and Judges in the Mohamedan Courts, and
                        the instructional workshops. The Primary School, attended by about 180 boys,
                        has now assumed a final form. The curriculum, in the event of a a boy being
                        unable to carry his education further, extends over four years, and is
                        calculat- ed to fit him to fill some minor Government post, such as junior
                        telegraphist, petty clerk, or land measurer. Apart from the normal increase
                        of numbers the only point worthy of special notice is the prosperity of the
                        boarding- house. This is now quite fall, some 25 boys be- ing in residence,
                        of whom all but two are genuine inhabitants of the Sudan and many of them
                        members of very well-known and influential families. The Military School,
                        intended for Sudanese cadets, prospective officers in the black battalions,
                        is now open and appears to have made a good beginning. It has been liberally
                        treated in the natter of staff. The Training College has also prospered, and
                        the progress reported in last year’s report has been well sustained. By the
                        end of 1906 it will be possible to judge whether or not the ex- periment is
                        going to be successful and whe- ther these young sheikhs have during their
                        period of training acquired sufficient know- lege of Mohamedan law to
                        administer it efficiently, and sufficient general culture to conduct that
                        administration in accordance with the principles that must obtain in all
                        countries where British influence is paramount. Every- thing possible is
                        being done by the staff of lecturers to make the experiment a success, and
                        one can only patiently watch results. The object of the workshops is to
                        provide practical instruction in carpentering, fitting, smith’s work,
                        moulder’s work, cotton ginning, and a primary stage of mechanical
                        engineering, which includes the management and repair of oil and steam
                        engines with electricity and water pressure as adjuncts, pumping machinery,
                        and turning. Ultimately only boys who have passed through the Elementary
                        Vernacular Schools will be admitted, but at present the supply of these is
                        too small to fill the work- shops, and many boys have been allowed to enter
                        whose general education does not come up to the standard required. In
                        addition to their practical work all the boys spend six hours a week
                        continuing their previous educa- tion. It is <persName>Mr.
                        Currie</persName>’s opinion that consequent on the general policy of the
                        Sudan and Egyp- tian Governments the economic development of the Sudan is
                        likely to be more rapid than anyone four years ago could have considered
                        possible.</p>
                    <p><persName>Sir Reginald Wingate</persName>, in forwarding lht| report to the
                        Earl of Cromer, says that a very important step has been taken in initiating
                        a system of secondary education and starting a small engineering school for
                        the training of over- seers of works and land surveyors. The college is
                        fortunate in having the services of a very competent instructor in
                            <persName>Mr. Rhodes</persName>. The in- vestigation work performed in
                        the "Wellcome” Laboratories under the able direction of <persName>Dr. Andrew
                            Balfour</persName> during the past year has been of increasing value and
                        interest, more especially in regard to the causes of sleeping sickness, both
                        in human beings and in animals. In this connection the recent journey of
                            <persName>Dr. Sheffield Neave</persName> on the <placeName>Upper
                            Nile</placeName> and in the <placeName>Bahr el Ghazal</placeName> should
                        furnish further valuable information. The chemical analyses by <persName>Dr.
                            Beam</persName> of the waters of the various rivers in the
                            <placeName>Sudan</placeName> are also of considerable interest and
                        importance.</p>

                    <head>AMATEUR PANTOMIME.</head>
                    <head>A SEASONABLE PERFORMANCE.</head>
                    <p>It was a happy idea that led the members of the E. T. C. Mess at
                            <placeName>Suez</placeName> to give so season- able and enjoyable an
                        entertainment as a pantomime on Boxing Day. The subject chosen was
                            <persName>Ali Baba</persName>, described as a pantomime pot pourri in 2
                        acts; but far from being the old story, it devolved itself into a topical
                        and distinctly humorous legend from the pen of <persName>Mr. O. D.
                            Harris</persName>. Music was introduced throughout, and the parodies on
                        well-known songs were much appreciated.</p>
                    <p>The story, which deserves mention if only for its originality, is briefly
                        this: <persName>Ali Baba</persName>, the captain of the 40 thieves, comes
                        down from the Attaca mountains, where he lives, in order to smuggle some
                        hashish from a ship due that day. Unfortunately, on his way from the hills,
                        his motor breaks down and he is forced to put up at the Suez Gulf Club,
                        where he is made much of in the guise of a stranger, and getting into
                        conversation with Aladdin, the coastguard chief, <persName>Ali
                            Baba</persName> learns the password "Open Sesame," which will enable him
                        to pass the sentinels along the docks road on his return from the 14th of
                        July celebrations at Port Tewfik, the occasion he has chosen for smuggling
                        the booty. The second act discovers <persName>Ali Baba</persName> at the
                        dance, but in a sore plight, for he has forgotten the password, but he
                        manages after much difficulty in his conversation with a French lady to
                        induce her to take a small parcel he resourcefully names chocolates. Just aa
                        Ali is kissing his hand in tender farewell to his innocent accomplice, his
                        wife <persName>Morgiana</persName> turns up and charges her husband with
                        infidelity. Ali’s explanations fail to convince the injured Morgiana, who
                        straightway goes to the autho- rities for a divorce, when Ali’s calling as a
                        desperado is soon revealed. Circumstantial evidence, however, foils to
                        convict <persName>Ali Baba</persName>, and his fair accomplice has passed
                        through the canal on her errand in a special tug. Pursuit is apparently
                        useless, for we learn in the con- cluding lines that the famous waterway is
                        closed owing to the explosion of the Chatham, and we hope for the sake of
                        the story that the State railways did not exist in the days of <persName>Ali
                            Baba</persName> and his forty thieves.</p>
                    <p>As regards the individual artists, <persName>Mr. Dug- more</persName>, as
                        Cinderella, repeated his former suc- cesses in the role of the "giddy young
                        thing" of the fairer sex, whose game of bumple-puppy in the first act can
                        only be described as "great." The lengthy role of Aladdin was made much of
                        by <persName>Mr. G. A. Evans</persName>, who fully entered into the humorous
                        side of the arduous duties of a conscientious coastguard official.
                            <persName>Mr. Menzies</persName>, described on the programme as the wife
                        of the deceased Blue Beard, was quite a fascinating if youthful creature,
                        but we do not wish to enquire at what age this charming damsel became allied
                        to her faithless husband. As Jack the Giant Killer, <persName>Mr. F. W.
                            Hamilton</persName> showed much cleverness in dealing with the awkward
                        situations brought about by his zealous compatriot, Aladdin. <persName>Mr.
                            Counsell</persName>, as Morgiana, and <persName>Mr. Mansell</persName>,
                        as Friday, under- took minor parts, but far from casting any reflection on
                        their capabilities let it be said that they were quite up to the standard of
                            <persName>Mr. Harris</persName>’s supporters. There only remains
                            <persName>Mr. O.D. Harris</persName> in the title role. We cannot say
                        too much of his rendering of Ali Baba and his two songs. " The captain of
                        the 40 thieves " and the " Local Limericks " intro- duced in the second act,
                        created roars of laughter. We think it a pity that <persName>Mr.
                            Harris</persName> does not find wider scope for his energies.</p>
                    <p>The piece was well mounted and the effec- tive scenery was due to the clever
                        brush of <persName>Mr. G. A. Evans</persName>. The costumes, especially
                        those of the female characters, lacked nothing in style, and <persName>Mme
                            Gasser</persName> is to be congra- tulated on her work. Other dresses
                        and wigs were by <persName>W. Waller</persName> of London.</p>

                    <p>(From our correspondent). <placeName>Helouan</placeName>, Wednesday. The
                        prospects for the races are bright, and the arrangements are practically
                        complete already. The course, which is very wide in extent, is in fine
                        condition, and extensive im- provements have been carried out in the
                        enclosure behind the hotel for the comfort of spectators and the convenience
                        of all concerned in the races. The grand stands afford a splen- did view of
                        the whole course, while the issue of each contest will be apparent to all
                        without the slightest difficulty. I also understand that special train
                        arrangements have been made for the day by the railway company.</p>

                    <p>In spite of the fact that up to the present the season has not been up to the
                        average, it is reported that visitors desirous of renting houses in
                            <placeName>Helouan</placeName> are in several cases unable to find the
                        necessary accommodation. Some residents prophesy that in future visitors to
                            <placeName>Helouan</placeName> will be confined to those requiring the
                        benefits of the sulphur baths, while others will go on to
                            <placeName>Luxor</placeName> and <placeName>Assouan</placeName>. Whether
                        that will be the case or not in the future, at present there is a demand for
                        houses which the provision is not able to supply. New houses are being built
                        in several parts of the town and others are being enlarged, so that soon
                        there ought to be a supply equal to the demand. During the present week,
                        American and other visitors have begun to arrive, and rooms have been
                        engaged in advance by many who have already gone to Assouan.</p>

                    <p>Helouan offers opportunities for an enter- prising fishmonger able and
                        willing reasonably to supply demands daily. We are not altoge- ther left
                        without fish, of course, and the prin- cipal establishments can always
                        obtain supplies from <placeName>Cairo</placeName>, but those who buy locally
                        have sometimes to content themselves with very coarse fish or to go without
                        any at all. Some of the gentlemen who tell fish stories in the hotels might
                        turn the tables on those in- credulous persons who smile at them, by turning
                        their attention to this matter now and then. People could not then say "ma
                        fish," for the fish would be there!</p>

                        some- how cannot help preferring the monotone to many tones.</p>

                    <head>'XMAS AT THE TEWFIK.</head>
                    <p>'Xmas was celebrated at the <placeName>Tewfik Palace Hotel</placeName> in the
                        good old English fashion. The larger hall was decorated with flags and ever-
                        greens and a motto, "Merry 'Xmas to All." An excellent dinner was served at
                        7.30, after which there was a Cindalerla dance, one or two veterans being
                        well to the front. An Italian string band "played during and after dinner.
                        Among the many guests we noticed that <persName>Dr. and Mrs.
                            Bentley</persName> entertained a large party, <persName>Miss
                            Smail</persName> a party of 4, <persName>Mr. Wyllie</persName> a party
                        of 4, and <persName>Mr. Grant</persName> also entertained a few friends.</p>

                    <head>'XMAS AT MENA.</head>
                    <p>’Xmas Day brought quite a crowd of Cairo people to <placeName>Mena House
                            Hotel</placeName> for luncheon and tea, but the ’Xmas dinner was the
                        crowning point of the day. The well-known dining-hall was tastefully
                        decorated with evergreens, and almost gave one the impression of being in a
                        palm garden. Little coloured lamps were studded all over the large and small
                        galleries, and happy parties one after another entered the fairy scene with
                        the sound of soft music greeting them. We will not dwell on the details of
                        the excellent dinner that was served, but we must, at least, mention the
                        fact that when the electric light was switched off and the ice brought in
                        illuminated, the visitors and guests staying at the hotel, with one accord,
                        broke into hearty applause. After the dessert the choir of the hotel staff
                        gave '"Teure Heimat" by special request of the visitors, and, if anything,
                        did better than on 'Xmas Eve.</p>
                    <p><persName>Mr. Sheldon Amos</persName> had a party of 10 for dinner,

                    <p>On Boxing Day the small dance at <placeName>Mena House</placeName> was well
                        attended, which was surpris- ing, considering that many similar functions

                        the home team equalised. When well into the first half, Smith scored the
                        home team’s second goal after a brilliant piece of individual play. Up to
                        the interval play was very fast and the game was fairly open. The second
                        half was a trifle tame, for both sets or for- wards lacked combination, and
                        the and came without any further scoring. The home de- fence had plenty of
                        work to do in the last part of the game, especially the custodian,
                            <persName>Mr. R. Appleby</persName>, who was in fine form between the

                    <p>Yesterday’s fighting here was most severe, and continues to-day. Strong rebel
                        forces are operating in different quarters, throwing up barricades, making
                        surprise attacks, and fight- ing from houses, which they seize indiscrimin-
                        ately, abandoning them as soon as they are bombarded. The artillery is
                        therefore contin- ually engaged. The women have shown conspicuous bravery
                        and ferocity. The Nicholas terminus is ablaze. It transpires that half the
                        garrison is confined to barracks for fear that they should join the
                        insurgents. Reinforce- ments have arrived. (Reuter)</p>

                    <head>THE JEWISH RACE IN EGYPT</head>
                    <p>A correspondent, <persName>Mr. T. D. Hall</persName>, writing to the
                        “Manchester Guardian" on the subject of the recent outrages on the Jews in
                            <placeName>Russia</placeName>, points out that while the feeling of
                        antagonism towards a race so unlike the rest of the world undoubtedly gained
                        intensity and bitterness from misdirected Christian sentiment and passion,
                        long before the Christian faith had gained ascendancy the streets of cities
                        inhabited by Jews bad been reddened with Jewish blood.
                            <placeName>Alexandria</placeName> under the Ptolemies was a second
                        Jewish capital—two of its five divisions being inhabited by Jews. The whole
                        population of Jews in <placeName>Egypt</placeName> at the commencement of
                        the Christian era is estimated at about a million; and they received high
                        marks of consideration first from the Greek sovereigns and afterwards from
                        Augustus. Yet, though Egypt was foe them a land of comparative privilege,
                        their position even here was far from being an enviable one.</p>
                    <p>The contempt with whioh they looked down upon the miserable superstitions of
                        Egypt," says <persName>Professor James Drummond</persName>, “and the
                        peculiar customs which served as a barrier between them and their
                        neighbours, excited the ani- mosity of the people among whom they lived; and
                        they were subject from time to time, as so often in later ages and in other
                        lands, to brutal outbursts of popular passion and vio- lence, and
                        occasionally to the more formal outrages of persecution directed by the
                        Govern- ment” (Hibbert Lectures, "Philo,” Intro.):</p>
                    <p>An outbreak which occurred in the reign of Claudius— under a Roman Governor
                        as brutally cruel and tyrannical as the one who shortly afterwards goaded
                        the Jews of <placeName>Palestine</placeName> into the despairing rebellion
                        which ended in the fall of Jerusalem (70 a.d.) recalls the worst features of
                        the Odessa massacres. "Whole families were burned, no pity being shown to
                        either age or sex, and many perished by tor- tures, if possible, still more
                        horrible” (iv. p. 9). Nor was this an isolated occurrence. There was a
                        renewal of all the horrors in the reign of the ferocious madman Caligula.
                        For no other face does the grave Tacitus show a tithe of the hatred and
                        contempt which he pours upon the unfortunate people in what professes to be
                        a purely historical narrative. Already in Egypt a race "abhorred of the
                        gods,” obeying, through the deliberate purpose of their legislator, laws
                        diametrically opposed to those of other na- tions, and cherishing an inborn
                        hatred to all other races, and tolerating every abomination among
                        themselves—such is the picture, barely relieved by the single virtue of
                        fidelity and compassion for each other, which he gives of a nation which he
                        utterly failed to compre- hend. If this was the temper of the educated
                        -restrained from violence by self-respect and philosophy,—what forbearance
                        was to be ex- expected from a brutal rabble, ever on the look out for
                        pillage?</p>
                    <p>Even the horrible cruelties of <persName>Nero</persName>, though directed
                        especially against the Christians, probably had their foundation in this
                        prevail- ling hatred and contempt. To <persName>Nero</persName> and his
                        Court Christianity would appear simply as a variety of Judaism, and the
                        early Christian Church, even in <placeName>Rome</placeName>, was no doubt
                        largely Jewish. Moreover, its author was a Jew, and a Jew who had been found
                        deserving of capital punishment by a Roman Governor.</p>

                    <p>The ordinary general meeting of the Egyptian Delta Light Railways, Limited,
                        was held on the 21st inst. at Winchester House, Old Broad Street, London,
                        E.C., <persName>Sir Auckland Colvin</persName> (the chairman of the company)
                        presiding.</p>
                    <p>The secretary (<persName>Mr. F. J. Horne</persName>) having read the notice
                        calling the meeting,</p>
                    <p>The chairman said: I think the circular you will have received with the
                        notice convening this meeting clearly explains the reasons for calling you
                        together to-day. We have seen for some time past that the interval between
                        Sep- tember 30th (which date has up to the present been the termination of
                        our financial year) and December 31st would be too short, as the size of our
                        undertakings increased, to prepare and have audited by the Government and
                        the company’s auditors the revenue accounts and balance-sheet in time to
                        present to the pro- prietors at the general meeting which, in order to
                        comply with the requirements of the Companies Acts, must be held in each
                        year— that is to say, under the existing arrangements, on or before December
                        31st. The purchase of the Helouan Railway has thrown upon our accounts and
                        audit departments a mass of additional work which has brought matters to a
                        climax, and we have been compelled to defer the publication of the report
                        and accounts for a month. This meeting will therefore be adjourn- ed to
                        January 30th next and the usual report and accounts will be poe-ed to the
                        shareholders early in that month. For the reasons I have given you, and also
                        because September 30th is a most inconvenient date for closing the accounts
                        of the company, as it is the busiest season of the year, we have decided to
                        alter the date of closing the accounts from Septem- ber 30th to March 31st,
                        which will allow us more time in future. A further general meeting will
                        therefore be convened in 1906, when a half yearly report and accounts will
                        he issued, after which they will be published annually as heretofore. I will
                        now therefore move that this meeting be adjourned until January 30th,
                        1906.</p>

                    <p>Le Caire, 27 decembre.</p>
                    <p>Apres le chomage de trois jours determine par les letes de Noel, notre marche
                        des valeurs a fait ce matin une recuverture assez ferme, sinon tres
                        animee.</p>
                    <p>La tendance est bonne sur presque toutes les valeurs, mais les transactions
                        sont relativement peu nombreuses.</p>
                    <p>La National Bank et l'Agricole sont sou- teunes a leurs cours precedents.
                        L’action Credit Foncier Hechit a 777-778, et la Behera a 35 1/2.</p>
                    <p>En bonne demande, l’action Ciments, dont nous parlous plus loin, gagne 6
                        francs a 73 et les dividendes 2 francs a 20.</p>
                    <p>L'action Bourse Khediviale du Cairo ouvre a £ 151 pour cloturer a 138
                        acheteurs.</p>
                    <p>Dans le groupe des hotels, de forts achats en Nungovich, antici qu’a
                        Alexandrie, poussent le cours a 11 1/16.</p>
                    <p>Rien de particulier a signaler sur les antres titres.</p>
                    <p>Parmi les petites valeurs, les New Egyptian sont demandes a 28 sh. et les
                        Cotton Mills a 5 sh. 9.</p>
                    <p>Nous avons deja donne d'interessants details concernant les Splendid Hotels,
                        dont on com- mence a s'occuper serieusement a la Bourse et qui meritent
                        mieux que le cours actuel.</p>
                    <p>Les travaux d'agrandissement du New Khedivial Hotel d’Alexandrie seront
                        termines dans lea premier jours de Janvier. A ce moment la direction
                        disposera de 150 chambres au lieu de 60, c'est-a-dire 90 chambres en
                        plus.</p>
                    <p>Ou sait qu’il a fallu fermer l'Hotel pendant tout le mois de novembre pour
                        mener a bien ces travaux. Malgre ce mois de chomage complet, les recettes au
                        20 decembre sont presque egales a celles de la meme periods de l’annee
                        passes. Pour les dix jours du 10 au 20 decembre, elles out depasse de 133
                        livres celles de la decade correspondante du mois de decembre 1904.</p>
                    <p>Il n’existe dans l’affaire ni parts de fonda- teur, ni obligations; tous les
                        benefices appar- tiennent aux actionnaires et la prime de 1/4 de livre,
                        payree a l’emission sur toutes les ac- tions, a ete passee a la reserve.</p>
                    <p>On ne saurait encore se prononcer sur le dividende qui sera distribue en fin
                        d’exercice, mais il sera vraisemblablement des plus satis- faisanrs.</p>
                    <p>On aunonce que la Societe des Ciments d’Egypte a obtenu une nouvelle commande
                        importante : une fourniture de 6,000 tonnes an minimum par au a une grande
                        entreprise locale.</p>
                    <p>Eu outre, la Societe est favorisee par une circonstance des plus heureuses :
                        les Com- pagnies de navigation ont denonce les contrats d’apres lesquels les
                        ciments importres de l’e- tranger beneficiaient jusqu’a present de frets
                        modiques qui leur permettaient de lutter aise- ment contre les ciments
                        egyptiens. Or, ces conditions favorables devant cesser des le ler janvier
                        prochain, l’ffet de cette difference dans les prix de transport ne tardera
                        pas a se faire sentir au profit de la Societe.</p>
                    <p>D’antre part, on fournit un renseignement tres important au sujet du plan
                        financier de la Societe. Celle ci est graves, on le sait, d’une charge de £
                        50,000 d’obligations, dont £ 20,000 ont ere emises a des conditions
                        relativement onereuses. Or, il est question de rembourser ces £ 20,000 au
                        moyen d’une emission d’actions d’egalimontant. Naturelle- ment, il faudra
                        attendre pour cela que le cours de l'action, cotee actuellement a 75 francs,
                        remonte an-dessus du pair, ce qui ne saurait tarder.</p>
                    <p>La nouvelle emission faite, la Societe devrs, en tout premier lieu, a'occuper
                        de payer aux porteurs d’actions ordinaires les dividendes arrieres auxquels
                        ils ont droit, c’est-a-dire 25% pour les cinq exercices passes, le dividende
                        du 5 % etant cumulatil. Les parts de fondateur pourront ensuite commencer a
                        toucher des be- nefices.</p>
                    <p>Aussi bien il y a lien de preferer les actions ordinaires aux parts de
                        fondateur, les premie- res devant certainement despasser le pair a bref
                        delai.</p>
                    <p>Hier, apres-midi, a en lieu, au siege social au Caire, la 6eme assemblee
                        generale ordinaire, de la Salt and Soda Co.</p>
                    <p>Ainsi que nous l’avions annonce, un divi- dende de 4 % sera distribue aux,
                        actions ordi- naires. Les profits des Huileries et Savonneries passent
                        entierement a la reserve, qui s'eleve a L.E. 60.000.</p>
                    <p>An sujet de la recente decision du gouverne- ment, le rapport du conseil
                        d’administration dit que l’experience montrera l’effet que la suppression du
                        monople du sel aura sur les be- nefices de la Societe.</p>

                        a 15 25/32.</p>

                    <head>﻿STEAM ENGINES IN EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>A high standard of efficiency has been main- tained in the Technical Service
                        of the Ministry of Public Works. The difference between the conditions
                        ruling at present—as regards steam engine licenses—and those of a few years
                        ago, is very striking. Inspections are now made by the Government Inspectors
                        with practically no trouble or obstruction on the part of engine
                        proprietors, and applications tor licenses come in regularly and
                        voluntarily. 890 applications were made for licenses last year. These, with
                        96 which had remained over for consideration at the end of 1903-together
                        with 18 received through the medium of the Moudiriehs—make a total of 604
                        (as against 358 in 1903. Of the above, 441 licenses were granted last
                        year—163 remaining over at the end of the year for fur- ther consideration.
                        360 licensed engines passed all the required test satisfactorily and were
                        pemitted to be worked. The remaining 81 were still going through the test at
                        the end of 1904. There were on the 1st of January, 1905, 1,609 engines
                        employed for industrial purposes in Egypt (exclusive of those employed for
                        irrigation), all of which are working in confor- mity with the Government
                        regulations. 51 cases of "contravention” were brought before the Courts in
                        1904—48 in the Native and 3 in the Mixed Courts. In these last, all the
                        engines were stopped from working. Of the cases before the Native Courts, 10
                        engines were stopped, and the remaining 38 are still awaiting trial.</p>
                    <p>The Native Courts are extremely slow in trying cases of this kind—in some
                        instances a year and more elapsing before judgment is delivered. As it not
                        infrequently happens that engines—pronounced to be in a dangerous state by
                        the Government Inspector — are permitted to continue working until the case
                        has been decided, such delays- are very prejudical to public security.</p>
                    <p>Only one boiler explosion took place last year. The cause was working it at a
                        higher pressure than that authorised by the license. One man was killed. All
                        Irrigation engine licenses are now granted by the Technical Service, and the
                        boilers of such engines are now subjected to the same tests and regula-
                        tions as the others.</p>
                    <p>The dangerous practice of overloading safety valves is still of frequent
                        occurrence, although the Technical Service is exerting all its energy to
                        stop it. It is such a favorite practice with most, if not all of the native
                        drivers that, until the majority of them are substituted by others better
                        instructed in their work, no feeling of security from this evil can be
                        attained.</p>

                        medical attendance or even sufficient food. In one well authenticated case
                        more than one-third of the men died of wounds and disease before the

                    <p>Here is a parrot story which is both new and true. A venerable and pious
                        lady, inspired to enthusiasm by a dealer’s emphatic decla- ration that a
                        parrot he had could "sing a hymn, ” paid what he demanded for tbe gifted
                        bird, and took it home in triomph. She invited a party of friends of a cast
                        of mind, as serious as her own to hear the parrot’s rendering of the hymn.
                        When all had assembled the covering was withdrawn from the cage, and Polly,
                        opening one eye, looked round drow- sily. “ What a — crew !" she murmured,
                        quietly, and went to sleep again.</p>

                    <head>TO-DAY ON THE NILE</head>
                    <p>This is an excellent companion to the guide- book for the tourist on the
                        Nile. The author <persName>Mr. H. W. Dunning</persName>, Ph.D., late
                        Instructor in Semitic languages in Yale University, announces in the preface
                        that he claims only to write as a traveller who has been and is interested
                        in Egypt. The book contains a good description of a trip up the river, and
                        there are also chapters devoted to the ancient and mo- dern history of
                            <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, its religion and gods, the
                            <placeName>Cairo Museum</placeName>, and the
                            <placeName>Sudan</placeName>. The book is written in a pleasant style
                        and is not over- hardened with learning. It will just suit the intelligent
                        tourist, who comes fresh to the country and wants to see the usual sights
                        and learn something about the land and its history without having to take
                        the trouble to wade through guide-books for his information. It is well
                        printed and admirably illustrated with photogravures. The information is
                        fully up to date, for the preface is dated on the 15th of last month. We
                        cordially recommend this work as a most useful and delightful handbook for
                        the visitor to <placeName>Egypt</placeName>.</p>

                    <head>MOST PROSPEROUS YEAR ON RECORD.</head>
                    <p>The year just ending has been the most profitable over experienced in the
                        history of the <placeName>Lancashire</placeName> cotton spinning industry. A
                        statement issued of the working of 90 limited liability companies whose
                        balance sheets have just been published reveals a remarkable degree of
                        prosperity. The combined paid-up share cap- ital of these concerns is rather
                        more than three and a half millions, and after charging the revenue with
                        interest on the borrowed capital of £1,794,000 and allowing for wear and
                        tear of plant, the total profit recorded for the year is £698,000, or equal
                        to 19% on the capital. Only nine companies failed to pay dividends. This
                        record profit has not only enabled the total adverse balances of £102,500
                        existing at the end of last year to be cleared off, but credit balances and
                        reserve funds have been created amounting to £400,000, after the large sum
                        of over £237,000 has been paid away in dividends and bonuses. The mean
                        average dividend paid is equal to 7 per cent. The healthy feeling that has
                        prevailed has resulted in the erec- tion of a large number of new mills,
                        which will be putting yarn on the market during the coming year. The
                        existing oompanies will, therefore, have more competition in the future,
                        and, with a threatened short crop of Ameri- can cotton in view, it is feared
                        that the outlook for the coming year is not quite so cheering to investors
                        in this class of securi- ties. Users of Egyptian cotton are in rather a
                        better position, and, on the whole, perhaps, the situation is not so
                        dispiriting to holders.</p>
                    <p>During the past twenty two years, sixteen have been profitable periods, the
                        aggregate profits amounting to £3,382,868, and loss for the six years being
                        £256,765 or a net profit earned of £3,116,102.</p>

                    <head>COTTON BROKERS AS PRINCIPALS OR AGENTS.</head>
                    <p>There was concluded in the Chancery Court of
                            <placeName>Lancashire</placeName>, sitting in <placeName>St.
                            George’s-hall, Liverpool</placeName>, on Saturday week, an action which
                        was brought by the Societe Cotonniere de St. Etienne du Rouvray against
                        Messrs. Shand, Higsorg snd Co., cotton brokers, of
                            <placeName>Liverpool</placeName>. The plaintiffs are a company
                        incorporated according to the laws of <placeName>France</placeName>,
                        carrying on business as cotton spinners and manufacturers at
                            <placeName>Rouen</placeName>. It appeared from the statement of claim
                        that transactions took place from April, 1902, to March, 1904, between the
                        plaintiffs and defendants on the <placeName>Liverpool</placeName> cotton
                        market, the total of the purchases and sales made by the defendants
                        amounting, it was stated, to about 11,800 bales, and the plaintiffs remitted
                        £6,775 as balances to the defen- dants. It was claimed on behalf of the
                        plaintiffs that the defendants acted in the transactions as the plaintiffs’
                        brokers or agents; that an account might be taken of all dealings and
                        transactions between the plaintiffs and the defendants in relation to the
                        purchase and sale of cotton during the years 1902-4 inclusive, and that the
                        defendants might be ordered to pay to the plaintiffs what might be found due
                        to them on making such account. Damages for breach of duty by the defendants
                        as brokers were also claimed. <persName>Mr. W. R. Shand</persName>, a member
                        of the defendant firm, said in evidenoe that they had always regarded
                        themselves as principals in the transactions. When his firm received an
                        order to buy for a firm like the plaintiffs,' they sold to them at the
                        market price ruling. His Honour said he was con- vinced that the defendants
                        had acted straight- forwardly and had done nothing which they were not
                        entitled to do under the contracts. He was not going to give a formal
                        judgment that day, bnt he was in the plaintiffs’ favor as to whether the
                        defendants were principals or agents—he was satisfied that they were agents.
                        He therefore directed that the plain- tiffs were entitled to an account In
                        taking that account the plaintiffs were entitled to repudiate the
                        transactions in "futures" in which the defendants had acted as principals to
                        sell or buy on behalf of the plaintiffs where they had dealt with their own
                        cotton. They might treat it that he had decided the case, but in a matter of
                        this interest and importance he preferred to give a formal judgment.
                            <persName>Mr. Horridge</persName> intimated that there would be an
                        appeal.</p>

                    <p><placeName>London</placeName>, December 22.</p>
                    <p>The features of the week have been the rise of money, caused by the Bank of
                        England withdrawing money from the market for the purposes of making, its
                        rate effective and con- solidating its position, and to-day’s news of the
                        Government adopting the somewhat un- constitutional course of prohibiting
                        further importations of Chinese coolies into <placeName>South
                            Africa</placeName>. As regards the former, the step taken by the Bank is
                        commended on all hands, and while it has opened a temporary scarcity in the
                        money market, it will certainly result in greater ease. The proportion of
                        reserve to liabilities has gone down to 36 1/4%, but with effective control
                        over the money market, this is considered quite satisfactory.</p>
                    <p>The nervous action of the Government in regard to Chinese labour on the
                            <placeName>Rand</placeName>, which they affect to consider a menace to
                            <placeName>South Africa</placeName>, might have been expected to cause a
                        big slump in South African shares, but the unexpected always happens." The
                        Exchange argues, no doubt correctly, that the number of Chinese already in
                        the mines are sufficient for the present, and that this Government, if it
                        receives a mandate from the people, is not likely to be long in power.
                        Already they have begun attacking important interests, which have surely
                        already suffered sufficiently from interfering legislation. The sympathy of
                        those connected with <placeName>South Africa</placeName> will now also be
                        alienated, and a very large number of the electors are watching
                        apprehensively the Home Rule tendencies of the Prime Minister. If
                            <placeName>Ireland</placeName> is to "manage its own affairs,” having
                        already municipal government, what can this mean but the granting of a
                        Parliament a Parliament on the lines of the present municipal councils,
                        which are certainly not satisfactory.</p>
                    <p>The members of the Stock Exchange—and they are pretty shrewd calculators—are,
                        there- fore, very probably correct in the view that the new Administration,
                        if elected, has not the elements of Stability, and on the return of a more
                        conservative rule six months or a year hence there will be ample time to
                        fill up with fresh importations the Chinese who would have been repatriated
                        in the meantime.</p>

                        <head>The Situation In <placeName>Russia</placeName>.</head>
                        <p>The general political situation is certainly not any worse. If the
                            Imperial party cannot rule Russia and the latest effort at coercion has
                            been an absolute failure — some popularly elected body must do so. It is
                            felt that the final step of the Tsar in refusing universal suffrage,
                            contrary even to the opinion of his own Cabi- net, is an act of suicide
                            so far as the Imperial regime is concerned. The last scene, which
                            everybody here is expecting, looks as if it would be a decisive one,
                            and, we hope, in view of the apparent unanimity of the work- ing classes
                            in the present strike, or rather revolution, it will not cause further
                            bloodshed.</p>

                            other banks entirely prevented any disastrous results. <persName>Mr.
                                Walsh</persName>’s speculations do not appear to have been of a wild
                            descrip- tion. At any rate, the investigation seems to have shown that
                            he is still possessed of a considerable fortune. The three banks, the
                            Chicago National Bank, the Home Savings Bank, and the Equitable Trust
                            Company, ap- pear to have been one and the same, i.e., under the control
                            of <persName>Mr. Walsh</persName>. It speaks well for the state of
                            finance in this large speculative centre that an affair of this kind can
                            happen without leaving any unpleasant after-effects. As a matter of fact
                            the American market generally is considered to be in a very sound and
                            satisfactory position. The country is making money rapidly, and gold is
                            returning to the money centres, as is usual at this time of the
                            year.</p>

                        <p>There has again been very little doing in the Egyptian market this week,
                            and with the approach of the holidays business is not likely to improve.
                            National Bank of Egypt have fallen to 24 7/8—5 1/8, and Agricultural
                            Banks to 9, with hardly any bargains to report. Daira Sanieh Ordinary
                            and Deferred shares have been flat, the Ordinary falling to 16 3/4, and
                            the Deferred to 160, with very few buyers, even at these reduced
                            figures. Egyptian Estates have been in good demand at 1 1/2. and the
                            Deferred shares have advanced to 6 buyers. This seems a good price far
                            1s. shares. Delta Preference Bearer are very firm at 11 3/4 buyers, and
                            these shares are full of dividend. Egyptian Markets are a little better
                            at 1 3/4-1/2, but Salt end Soda remain dull at 1 1/26 Union Fonciere are
                            5/8 premium, and Abyssinian Banks 3/8 discount. Khedivial Mail are still
                            buyers at 1 3/4, perhaps slightly more, and the Debentures are enquired
                            for at 100. Roumanian Banks are about 7 3/4-7/8, but the business has
                            again gone off in these. Delta Land at 2 1/8 and Daira Sugar at 4 1/4
                            are quite unchanged.</p>

                        <p>In view of this morning's news re the Go- vernment’s attitude, South
                            African mines are fairly steady, bnt there are no prominent features.
                            The money to be distributed in February in this market in dividends
                            alone is well over one-and-a-half millions, and it is felt that this is
                            the most solid argument for stability.</p>
                        <p>The Egyptian section has been flat for the greater part of the week, but
                            there was a slight revival yesterday, though the prices all-round are
                            under our last quotations. Nile Valleys are now 2/15, after being lower,
                            and Um Rus leave off at the same figure. Egyptian Mines Explo- ration
                            close at 9s. 0d., a tall since our last of about 1s.</p>

                        <p>The report of the Sulphide Corporation has attracted considerable notice,
                            and it would seem as if the prospects of this concern are very fine, and
                            we hear of influential buying. Not only have they in the past year, with
                            the price of lead at £12, made considerable profits, although acting on
                            conservative lines, they have not distributed them, and have before them
                            an increase in the price to £17, but they are also now working a new
                            process by which the cost of production will be very largely

                    <p>There has been a very moderate demand for Egyptians this week. Quotations are

                        fair business has been done, and the following are the latest values:—</p>

                    <p>American Futures The Market this week has been fairly active and there have
                        been plenty of fluctuations, but within narrower limits, at one moment
                        prices were 15 @ 17 points higher, but the advance has not been maintained,
                        and today's closing values are 1 @ 3 up to 1 @ 2 points decline from those
                        of last Thursday. The only feature has. been the National Ginners report the
                        Census Bureau report of the cotton ginned to the 13th instant; the first
                        estimate it at 8,975,000 and the official report at 9,282,000. The pro-
                        bability is that even this latter estimate is too low as there is no
                        compulsion to make returns neither, however, has had more than a passing
                        influence upon the market. The power of planters, aided by the extensive
                        "bull" operations in New York and New Orleans, to hold back their cotton, is
                        the most important factor in the situation and may enable them to maintain
                        present high values, even, possibly, to force them higher temporarily, but
                        if the crop proves to be 11 millions, as present indications point to, we
                        expect that later there will be heavy liquidation with a material decline.

                        l'emplacement à pro- poser à l’Eat pour l'hôpital des maladies in-
                        fectieuses. L'Administrateur répond que la Délégation a décidé dans sa
                        séance d'hier de recommander au choix du Gouvernement un terrain à Hadra,
                        précédemment afficté aux ecuries de la police.</p>

                    <p>L’ordre du jour appelle la discussion du pro- jet de budget de 1906.</p>
                    <p>Mention est faite à ce sujet de l’envoi aux membres du rapport de
                        l’Administrateur sur le dit budget, du procès-verbal de la Délégation y
                        relatif, ainsi que du rapport du Comité des Finances en posant ses
                        propositions et observa- tions au sujet du budget.</p>
                    <p>L'Administrateur dit que dans sa séance d'hier la Délégation a partagé sur la
                        plupart des points les conclusions du rapport du Comité des Finances,
                        conclusions qui ne comportent au point de vue des chiffres du budget qu’une
                        dif- férence de L.E. 100, montant de deux alloca- tions que la Délégation

                    <p>Cette question des allocations a donné lieu à une discussion de principe,
                        quelques membres ayant demandé de ne les inscrire au budget que pour un
                        chiffre global, sauf à faire une répartition ultérieure qui serait basée sur
                        une étude qu'un Comité spécial aurait à pour- suivre dans ce bus.</p>
                    <p>Après un échange d'idées,la Commission se rallie à une proposition du
                        Vice-Président tendant à l'adoption des allocations telles qu’elles sont
                        proposées par le Comité des Finances et amendées par la Délégation et à
                        nommer à la prochaine séance un Comité chargé de reviser les subventions
                        actuelles et de proposer leur répartition sur le mode qu’il croira le plus
                        équitable.</p>
                    <p>Le rapport de ce Comité devra être pre- senté avant le 15 novembre 1906.</p>

                        qu'ils sont proposés par le Comité des Finances d'accord avec la
                        Délégation.</p>
                    <p>Eu conséquence le budget est arrêté en recettes à LE 195,000 et en dépenses

                    <p>A l'occasion de la discussion du budget, M Escoffier propose que le budget

                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompany- ing description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care had been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In Choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To there are several things to be considered. To
                        begin with there is the difference in climate between Egypt and the various
                        points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>
                    <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for
                            <placeName>Cairo</placeName> in January may be a little warmer than the
                            <placeName>Riviera</placeName>, and possibly not so warm as
                            <placeName>Sicily</placeName>, but in March it will be warmer than
                            <placeName>Rome</placeName>, and more uni- formly warm than many other
                        places in Europe. Many people leave <placeName>Egypt</placeName> far too
                        early in the year; for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect.
                        The warmest place to go to on leaving Egypt is
                        <placeName>Sicily</placeName>.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                        sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time oc- cupied on each of
                        the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>
                    <p>They are as follows :-</p>
                    <p>The long sea routes-from <placeName>Port Said</placeName> or
                            <placeName>Alexandria</placeName> to <placeName>Plymouth</placeName>,
                            <placeName>Southampton</placeName>, <placeName>London</placeName> or
                            <placeName>Liverpool</placeName>-occupy about 14 days. The short ones
                        are as follows:-</p>
                    <p>Port Said or <placeName>Alexandria</placeName> to
                            <placeName>Brindisi</placeName> 3 days <placeName>Alexandria</placeName>
                        to <placeName>Messina</placeName>... ... ... 3 " <placeName>Port
                            Said</placeName> or <placeName>Alexandria</placeName> to
                            <placeName>Marseilles</placeName> 5 " <placeName>Alexandria</placeName>
                        to <placeName>Venice</placeName> and <placeName>Trieste</placeName> 4 "
                            <placeName>Alexandria</placeName> to <placeName>Naples</placeName>...

                        ... ... 5 " <placeName>Port Said</placeName> to
                            <placeName>Naples</placeName>... ... ... 4 "
                            <placeName>Alexandria</placeName> to
                            <placeName>Constantinople</placeName> ... 4 "
                            <placeName>Alexandria</placeName> to <placeName>Piraeus</placeName> ...
                        ... ... 2 " <placeName>Port Said</placeName> to
                            <placeName>Gibraltar</placeName>... ... ... 7 "</p>
                    <p>The steamers, of the P. &amp;0. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageries
                        Mari times are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines are
                        also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by travellers to
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from <placeName>Cairo</placeName>, the shortest
                        is that to <placeName>Alexandria</placeName>, without change (3 hours). That
                        to <placeName>Port Said</placeName>, can now be made without change in 4 1/2
                        hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from <placeName>Alexandria</placeName> to
                            <placeName>Liverpool</placeName>. The German Levant line has also good
                        steamers from <placeName>Alexandria</placeName> to
                            <placeName>Hamburg</placeName>.</p>
                    <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by P. &amp;O.
                        Brindisi express from <placeName>Port Said</placeName>, and the Austrian
                        Lloyd Trieste-Vienna express from <placeName>Alexandria</placeName>.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and

                    <p>The direct route to <placeName>Sicily</placeName> is by the Florio- Rubattino
                        Co.'s steamers which leave <placeName>Alex- andria</placeName> weekly for
                            <placeName>MESSINA</placeName>, where one takes train to
                            <placeName>TAORMINA</placeName>, one of the most charm- ing and popular
                        places on the island. <placeName>Giardini</placeName> is he station at which
                        to alight, and the drive up to <placeName>Taormina</placeName> is most
                        delightful, occupying about one hour. In and around the town is much to
                        interest the visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but restored under the
                        Romans. <placeName>CATANIA</placeName> is the starting place for the ascent
                        of <placeName>Etna</placeName> and here also is a fine Cathedral. The Greek,
                        Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all over the island, are an
                        endless sources of pleasure. <placeName>SYRACUSE</placeName> has an
                        interesting history, having been a Greek city, which was designed by
                        Demostheues in B.C. 413, and taken by the Romans in b.c. 212, when
                        Archimedes was slain in his tomb is to be seen. The cathedral was once an
                        ancient pagan temple. <placeName>PALERMO</placeName>, with about 300,000
                        inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a delightful climate.
                        Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The <placeName>Polazzo
                            Reale</placeName> is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S
                        Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. <placeName>The
                            Cathedral Museum</placeName>, <placeName>Botanic Gardens</placeName>,
                            <placeName>Villa Giulia</placeName> and <placeName>Royal
                            Park</placeName> are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>CENTRAL ITALY.</p>
                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave
                            <placeName>Alexandria</placeName> every Wednesday during the season for
                            <placeName>Naples</placeName>, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p><placeName>NAPLES</placeName> is also reached in 10 hours from
                            <placeName>Palermo</placeName> by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steam- ers,
                        which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without wishing to
                        explore some of its island, besides the lovely places on its Bay—
                            <placeName>Castellamare</placeName> and <placeName>Sorrento</placeName>.
                        The small steamer that takes you to <placeName>Sorrento</placeName> [you can
                        drive too] will take you on to <placeName>Capri</placeName>.</p>
                    <p>From <placeName>Naples</placeName> to <placeName>ROME</placeName> is a train
                        journey of but five hours. All who can will devote at least one week to
                        visiting the many historical and interesting portions of the Eternal City,
                        whose charms and beauties are too well-known to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to <placeName>FLORENCE</placeName>, where another week can well
                        be spent admiring the City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In
                            <placeName>Florence</placeName> itself the churches and galleries are of
                        absorbing inte- rest, whilst the local promenades and excur- sions should
                        not be omitted. <placeName>The Cascine</placeName> is the most attractive
                        and fashionable promenade in <placeName>Florence</placeName>, whilst the
                            <placeName>Viale dei Colli</placeName>, one of the finest walks in
                        Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the hills a distance of
                        four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                            <placeName>Florence</placeName> is that to <placeName>Vallom-
                            brosa</placeName>; with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea level.
                        This is made first by ordinary train from <placeName>Florence</placeName> to
                            <placeName>St. Ellero</placeName>, thence by cog- wheel railway to
                            <placeName>Saltino</placeName>. The ascent through groves of oaks takes
                        an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p><placeName>PISA</placeName> is easily reached from
                            <placeName>Florence</placeName> in about 2 hours ; here there is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made, in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the <placeName>Italian
                            Riviera</placeName> near <placeName>Pisa</placeName> and on the main
                        line from <placeName>Rome</placeName> to <placeName>Genoa</placeName>. It is
                        a very convenient half-way house between <placeName>Egypt</placeName> and
                            <placeName>England</placeName>, and where living is reasonable and the
                        air and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                    <p><placeName>GENOA</placeName> (La Superba).—The most picturesque and
                        interesting city in <placeName>Italy</placeName>, with the record of having
                        one of the lowest death averages of European cities and a phenomenally
                        equable temperature—warm in winter and deliciously cool breezes from the
                        surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy’s most an- cient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in
                            <placeName>Genoa</placeName>. Then there are the superbly decorated
                        medie- val churches containing exquisite marble columns and historical
                        paintings, and the in- comparable <placeName>Campo Santo</placeName> filled
                        with its won- derful tombs.</p>
                    <p>From <placeName>Genoa</placeName> to <placeName>Milan</placeName> is a matter
                        of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p><placeName>MILAN</placeName> is a good centre for Northern Italy before
                        making the tour of the Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction,
                        with its beautiful windows illustrating the History of the Bible. The public
                        gardens and the monu- mental cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>Between <placeName>Bologna</placeName> and <placeName>Milan</placeName> and
                        only an hour and-a-half from <placeName>Milan</placeName> is
                            <placeName>SALSOMAG- GIORE</placeName>, a renowned health resort on

                    <p>NORTHERN ITALY (continued) and The ITALIAN LAKES.</p>
                    <p><placeName>VENICE</placeName> is a 5 hours journey by rail from
                            <placeName>Milan</placeName>, and one of the most delightful places
                        imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of vehicular traffic
                        strikes one as very strange; no horse, cart, carriage or bicycle is to be
                        seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The approach to
                        Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea- port. The town
                        seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills behind, no
                        stretches of rock, but the first the tops of Cam- paniles appear above the
                        horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage out
                        of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from <placeName>Milan</placeName> you make the tour of the
                        beautiful Italian lakes.</p>
                    <p><placeName>COMO</placeName>, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached
                        in one-and-a-quarter hours by train by way of
                        <placeName>Monza</placeName>.</p>
                    <p>Boats leave <placeName>Como</placeName> frequently for the other towns on the
                        lake, which is very beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the
                        lake is most enchanting. <placeName>CERNOBBIO</placeName> is a charming
                        spot; then come <placeName>Tremezzo</placeName>,
                            <placeName>Cadenabbia</placeName>, and <placeName>Menaggio</placeName>
                        with the prettily-situated town of <placeName>Bellaggio</placeName>
                        opposite. The walk from <placeName>Tremezzo</placeName> along the shore of
                        the lake to <placeName>Managgio</placeName> is most enjoyable. A steam tram
                        runs from <placeName>Menaggio</placeName> to <placeName>Porlezza</placeName>
                        on <placeName>Lake Lugano</placeName> in three-quarters of an hour, then
                        steamer to <placeName>Lugano</placeName> in two-and- three-quarter
                        hours.</p>
