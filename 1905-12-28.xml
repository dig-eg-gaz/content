                                interest to all who believe in the future
                                of Egyptian mining, and bear ample testimony
                                to the readiness of the Government to support
                                all genuine attempts to develop the mineral
                                industry of the country. The great area of the
                                regions in which ancient workings have been
                                found, and the probability that modern ap-
                                liances will revive an industry practically
                                abandoned since the early middle ages, if not
                                earlier, have "induced the expenditure of
                                large sums of money within the next few
                                years for further exploration and develop-
                                ment work, most of which money will be deriv-
                                ed from sources outside the country and spent
                                in it." To this end a Department of Mines has
                                been formed. Mr. Wells, the Inspector General of
                                Mines, has an admirable record as a practical
                                mining engineer, and his knowledge of the
                                industry and his energy in scouring the
                                Arabian and Lybian desert have already borne
                                fruit, and we understand that during his last
                                leave be examined various methods of motor
                                transport with a view to improving communi-
                                cation between the mining areas and the Nile.
                                New tri-car motors have been adopted which
                                have stood their trials over very rough ground
                                with real success, and it is stated that should
                                the development of the mining industry
                                be such as to demand it, a regular system
                                of motor communication will be adopted.
                                To prevent individuals or parties going to or
                                returning from the mines being in any way
                                molested, either by Bedouins, who, to do them
                                justice, have hitherto been well behaved, or
                                by stray ruffians like the bandit who fell to a
                                coast guard patrol a few weeks ago, a special
                                force of desert police has been organised. The
                                measure is a timely one and will have the
                                development of mining may possibly result in
                                labour troubles. A strike or an affray at a
                                mining camp would lose half its danger if a
                                police force were held in readiness to start at
                                once from Edfon to the scene of disturbance and
                                patrols were known to be constantly moving in
                                the desert.</p>
                                <p>The development of motor transport and
                                  the possibility of adapting strong and fast
                                  motor cars to desert work opens up fascinating
                                  cistas of the future of the desert tracts of
                                  North Africa. Perhaps in the next generation
                                  we shall see motor excursions to Siwa posts,
                                  wells, and artificial cases created, thanks to
                                  the development of the machine, and the
                                  Arabian and Syrian deserts yielding up their
                                  mineral wealth while their cases are as prosper-

                                    <head>THE EGYPTIAN QUESTION</head>
                                    <p>In a leading article, our native contemporary
                                      "Al Zaher" remarks:-Many people think
                                      that the Egyptian question is closed forever,
                                      and that the Anglo-French Agreement of
                                      April, 1904, has put an end to Egyptian hopes,
                                      thus causing many to despair in regard to
                                      England's withdrawal from Egypt. Those
                                      people obtain confirmation intheir belief on
                                      seeing the silence of the native Press on the
                                      subject, but they are mistaken. The egyptian
                                      Question now is in the same position as it was
                                      in 1882. Statesmen are sparing no efforts to
                                      call the attention of Europe to the question,
                                      and the final decision is still to come.
                                      M. Freyeinet, the ex-Minister of the French
                                      Foreign Office, published a few months ago a
                                      book entitled "The Egyptian Question" in
                                      which he dealt with all the details of this
                                      subject. He declared that France had, for-
                                      tunately, done nothing to affirm the British
                                      authority in Egypt, and that the British Occu-
                                      pation has still the same features as befire,
                                      without any additional guarantees. Thus the
                                      Egyptian Question still exists and the eventual
                                      withdrawal of the Occupation must be look-

            <p>Burned to Death.
            A native girl of 6, diving in the Custom
            house quarter, was burned to death yesterday
            through her clothes catching fire from a
            candle which she was holding in her hand.</p>

            <p>Fire in Cairo.
            A fire brook out in a home above Messrs.
            Walker and Meimarachi’s establishment in
            the Esbekish quarter of Cairo yesterday, but
            was rapidly extinguished by the Fire Brigade.</p>

            <p>Mena House Case.

            <p>A Good Scheme.
            The Government proposes to supplement
            each year the Cassel charity by the establish-
            ment of one or more permanent ophthalmic
            hospitals, until every moudirieh shall have its
            own hospital. One will be built next year for
            a sum of L.E. 4,000. The annual charge will
            be about L.E. 5,000.</p>

            <p>Union Artistique Francaise.
            The above society will give a dramatic per-
            formance in their hall in Stamboul-street this
            evening, commencing at 9. The programme
            consists of three parts, i.e., La Femme
            a conference in one act, Monsieur Badin, a
            one-act comedy by Courteline, and Les Boulin
            grins, also a one-act comedy by Courteline.</p>

            <p>New British Club.
            Donations of £5 each in aid of the founding
            of the new British Club at Alexandria have
            been received from the London and Lancashire
            Life Assurance Co. and the General Fire and
            Accident Assurance Corporation. It is to be
            hoped that the other insurance companies will
            follow this excellent example.</p>

            <p>Appointment for Dr. Sandwith.
            Dr. Sandwith has been appointed Lecturer
            on Tropical Diseases in St. Thomas’s Medical
            School. Dr. Sandwith’s wide experience of the
            subject should be a sufficient guarantee, if it
            were necesary, for the distinct advantage
            which St. Thomas’s students in the future
            will derive by the addition to their teaching
            staff of so eminent an authority as Dr. Sand-
            with. Every London Medical School in the
            near future will be compelled to have a
            Lecturer on Tropical Diseases, and this is not
            surprising when we come to consider that
            each hospital sends a large number of its old
            students into the Services, and to practise
            abroad. It is, therefore, essential for these
            men to have at least some idea of the nature
            of the diseases which are commonly met with
            in the Tropics.</p></div>

            <head>PUBLIC BUILDINGS EXPENDITURE.</head>

            <p>In his Note on the 1905 Budget, the Financial
            Adviser says :—
            Roughly speaking, it may be said that Egypt
            is actually spending from L.E. 300,000 to
            L.E. 400,000 annually on public buildings ;
            not, I think, an extravagant sum, having re-
            gard to the revenue of the country and the
            fact that everything has to be provided ab
            initio, hospitals, post offices, prisons, asylums,
            schools, police stations, to say nothing of Gou-
            vernorats, and other Government buildings of
            practically every description.</p>

            <p>Of course in the above figures are not in-
            cluded great works of public utility of a
            remunerative nature, which are charged to
            Reserve Fund.</p></div>

            As to penny postage between Egypt and
            the United Kingdom, the Financial Adviser
            says :—"For years past the Egyptian Go-
            vernment has been urging the adoption of
            this reform, but had hitherto failed to shake
            the non possumus attitude of the British

              <head>THE COST OF THE ARMY.</head>

            <p>In remarking on the increase in the budget
            of the Ministry of War Sir Vincent Corbett
            says:—</p>

            <p>L.E 50,000 represents a portion of Army
            expenditure hitherto refunded by the Sudanese
            Government and which will for the future be
            borne by Egypt. Seeing that the Egyptian
            Army in the Sudan is employed to all intents
            and purposes in guarding the Egyptian frontier
            and that its movements are dictated by Egyp-
            tian interests, it seemed unfair any longer to
            burden the nascent revenue of the Sudan with
            so heavy a charge. The sum thus set free
            will be employed in the interior development
            of the country, thus hastening the day, not, I
            am confident, very far distant, when the re-
            venue of the Sudan will not only suffice for its
            wants, but enable it to make a return on the
            considerable sums invested by Egypt in that
            country.</p></div>

            2,500 in the following strong terms:—</p>

            <p>It is regrettable that the last named institu-
            tion should not have seen its way to effecting
            still larger economies, as its work is now
            practically limited to the "payment of the
            coupon out of sums automatically paid into
            its coffers by the State.</p></div>

              <head>MUNICIPAL COMMISSIONS.</head>

            Sir Vincent makes the following remarks on
            the provincial commissions : —
            The local Municipal Commissions, which
            constituted a sort of middle term between
            governmental and municipal control of local
            business, are working farly well, but owing to
            the regime of the Capitulations, which hampers
            local reform at every turn, they are unable
            to develop as satisfactorily as could be wished.
            The privileges of foreigners render local taxa-
            tion to any reasonable extent an impossibility,
            with the result that there is an ever-increasing
            demand under this head for aid from the funds
            of the central Government.</div>

            The "Kölnische Zeitung" publishes a com-
            munication which, although dated from Cairo,
            probably emanates from Berlin, regarding a
            readjustment of the postal tariff between Ger-
            many and Egypt. According to this communi-
            cation, the Egyptian Government has entered
            into communication with other countries for
            the purpose of bringing about a reduction of
            its postal tariff, similar to that recently arrang-
            ed with England in order to show that Egypt
            has not become a British colony. The German
            Government is now considering the matter.
            Probably penny postage will be introduced
            between Germany and Egypt.</div>

            <head>ANNUAL REPORT.</head>
            <head>THE PAST YEAR EVENTFUL.</head>

            <p>Mr. James Currie, Director of Education in
            the Sudan, and Principal of the Gordon
            Memorial College at Khartoum, reporting on
            the work of the institution for 1904, makes
            mention of the great loss the collnge has
            sustained by the death of Mr. Alfred Spalding
            Harvey, the hon. secretary, and of his own
            indebtedness to Mr. Harvey’s sagacity  and
            wide knowledge of men and things. The past
            year, he says, has been rather an eventful one,
            and several important decisions have been
            taken, though these perhaps may be said to
            represent the development of exiting agencies
            and do not constitute fresh departures. The
            college, apart from the laboratories, as has
            been explained in previous reports, has so far
            been divided into three sections: a Primary
            School, a Training College for Schoolmasters
            and Judges in the Mohamedan Courts, and the
            instructional workshops. The Primary School,
            attended by about 180 boys, has now assumed
            a final form. The curriculum, in the event of a
            a boy being unable to carry his education
            further, extends over four years, and is calculat-
            ed to fit him to fill some minor Government
            post, such as junior telegraphist, petty clerk,
            or land measurer. Apart from the normal
            increase of numbers the only point worthy of
            special notice is the prosperity of the boarding-
            house. This is now quite fall, some 25 boys be-
            ing in residence, of whom all but two are genuine
            inhabitants of the Sudan and many of them
            members of very well-known and influential
            families. The Military School, intended for
            Sudanese cadets, prospective officers in the
            black battalions, is now open and appears to
            have made a good beginning. It has been
            liberally treated in the natter of staff. The
            Training College has also prospered, and the
            progress reported in last year’s report has been
            well sustained. By the end of 1906 it will be
            possible to judge whether or not the ex-
            periment is going to be successful and whe-
            ther these young sheikhs have during their
            period of training acquired sufficient know-
            lege of Mohamedan law to administer it
            efficiently, and sufficient general culture to
            conduct that administration in accordance with
            the principles that must obtain in all countries
            where British influence is paramount. Every-
            thing possible is being done by the staff of
            lecturers to make the experiment a success,
            and one can only patiently watch results.
            The object of the workshops is to provide
            practical instruction in carpentering, fitting,
            smith’s work, moulder’s work, cotton ginning,
            and a primary stage of mechanical engineering,
            which includes the management and repair of
            oil and steam engines with electricity and
            water pressure as adjuncts, pumping machinery,
            and turning. Ultimately only boys who have
            passed through the Elementary Vernacular
            Schools will be admitted, but at present the
            supply of these is too small to fill the work-
            shops, and many boys have been allowed to
            enter whose general education does not come
            up to the standard required. In addition to
            their practical work all the boys spend six
            hours a week continuing their previous educa-
            tion. It is Mr. Currie’s opinion that consequent
            on the general policy of the Sudan and Egyp-
            tian Governments the economic development
            of the Sudan is likely to be more rapid than
            anyone four years ago could have considered
            possible.</p>

            <p>Sir Reginald Wingate, in forwarding lht|
            report to the Earl of Cromer, says that a very
            important step has been taken in initiating
            a system of secondary education and	starting a
            small engineering school for the training of over-
            seers of works and land surveyors. The college is
            fortunate in having the services of a very
            competent instructor in Mr. Rhodes. The in-
            vestigation work performed in the "Wellcome”
            Laboratories under the able direction of Dr.
            Andrew Balfour during the past year has been of
            increasing value and interest, more especially
            in regard to the causes of sleeping sickness,
            both in human beings and in animals. In
            this connection the recent journey of Dr.
            Sheffield Neave on the Upper Nile and in the
            Bahr el Ghazal should furnish further valuable
            information. The chemical analyses by Dr.
            Beam of the waters of the various rivers in
            the Sudan are also of considerable interest
            and importance.</p></div>

              <head>“ALI BABA" AT SUEZ.</head>

            <head>AMATEUR PANTOMIME.</head>

            <head>A SEASONABLE PERFORMANCE.</head>

            <p>It was a happy idea that led the members of
            the E. T. C. Mess at Suez to give so season-
            able and enjoyable an entertainment as a
            pantomime on Boxing Day. The subject chosen
            was Ali Baba, described as a pantomime pot
            pourri in 2 acts; but far from being the old
            story, it devolved itself into a topical and
            distinctly humorous legend from the pen of
            Mr. O. D. Harris. Music was introduced
            throughout, and the parodies on well-known
            songs were much appreciated.</p>

            <p>The story, which deserves mention if only
            for its originality, is briefly this: Ali Baba, the
            captain of the 40 thieves, comes down from the
            Attaca mountains, where he lives, in order to
            smuggle some hashish from a ship due that
            day. Unfortunately, on his way from the hills,
            his motor breaks down and he is forced to put
            up at the Suez Gulf Club, where he is made
            much of in the guise of a stranger, and getting
            into conversation with Aladdin, the coastguard
            chief, Ali Baba learns the password "Open
            Sesame," which will enable him to pass the
            sentinels along the docks road on his return
            from the 14th of July celebrations at Port
            Tewfik, the occasion he has chosen for smuggling
            the booty. The second act discovers Ali Baba
            at the dance, but in a sore plight, for he has
            forgotten the password, but he manages after
            much difficulty in his conversation with a
            French lady to induce her to take a small parcel
            he resourcefully names chocolates. Just aa Ali
            is kissing his hand in tender farewell to his
            innocent accomplice, his wife Morgiana turns
            up and charges her husband with infidelity.
            Ali’s explanations fail to convince the injured
            Morgiana, who straightway goes to the autho-
            rities for a divorce, when Ali’s calling as a
            desperado is soon revealed. Circumstantial
            evidence, however, foils to convict Ali Baba,
            and his fair accomplice has passed through the
            canal on her errand in a special tug. Pursuit
            is apparently useless, for we learn in the con-
            cluding lines that the famous waterway is closed
            owing to the explosion of the Chatham, and we
            hope for the sake of the story that the State
            railways did not exist in the days of Ali Baba
            and his forty thieves.</p>

            <p>As regards the individual artists, Mr. Dug-
            more, as Cinderella, repeated his former suc-
            cesses in the role of the "giddy young thing"
            of the fairer sex, whose game of bumple-puppy
            in the first act can only be described as "great."
            The lengthy role of Aladdin was made much
            of by Mr. G. A. Evans, who fully entered into
            the humorous side of the arduous duties of a
            conscientious coastguard official. Mr. Menzies,
            described on the programme as the wife of the
            deceased Blue Beard, was quite a fascinating
            if youthful creature, but we do not wish to
            enquire at what age this charming damsel
            became allied to her faithless husband. As
            Jack the Giant Killer, Mr. F. W. Hamilton
            showed much cleverness in dealing with the
            awkward situations brought about by his
            zealous compatriot, Aladdin. Mr. Counsell, as
            Morgiana, and Mr. Mansell, as Friday, under-
            took minor parts, but far from casting any
            reflection on their capabilities let it be said
            that they were quite up to the standard
            of Mr. Harris’s supporters. There only remains
            Mr. O.D. Harris in the title role. We cannot
            say too much of his rendering of Ali Baba
            and his two songs. " The captain of the 40
            thieves " and the " Local Limericks " intro-
            duced in the second act, created roars of
            laughter. We think it a pity that Mr.
            Harris does not find wider scope for his
            energies.</p>

            <p>The piece was well mounted and the effec-
            tive scenery was due to the clever brush of
            Mr. G. A. Evans. The costumes, especially
            those of the female characters, lacked nothing
            in style, and Mme Gasser is to be congra-
            tulated on her work. Other dresses and wigs
            were by W. Waller of London.</p></div>

            The weather at Suez is exceptionally cold
            this year. A few days ago snow was visible
            on the highest peaks of the Attaka mountains,
            about 20 miles south of Suez. This was re-
            ported by several homeward bound steamers,
            and the phenomenon was visible with a teles-
            cope from Suez.</div>

            <head>THE RACES. - FISH AND MUSIC.</head>

            (From our correspondent).

            Helouan, Wednesday.
            The prospects for the races are bright, and
            the arrangements are practically complete
            already. The course, which is very wide in
            extent, is in fine condition, and extensive im-
            provements have been carried out in the
            enclosure behind the hotel for the comfort of
            spectators and the convenience of all concerned
            in the races. The grand stands afford a splen-
            did view of the whole course, while the issue of
            each contest will be apparent to all without
            the slightest difficulty. I also understand that
            special train arrangements have been made
            for the day by the railway company.</div>

            <div type= "item">
              <head>SCARCITY OF HOUSES.</head>

            In spite of the fact that up to the present
            the season has not been up to the average, it
            is reported that visitors desirous of renting
            houses in Helouan are in several cases unable
            to find the necessary accommodation. Some
            residents prophesy that in future visitors to
            Helouan will be confined to those requiring
            the benefits of the sulphur baths, while others
            will go on to Luxor and Assouan. Whether
            that will be the case or not in the future,
            at present there is a demand for houses which
            the provision is not able to supply. New
            houses are being built in several parts of the
            town and others are being enlarged, so that
            soon there ought to be a supply equal to the
            demand. During the present week, American
            and other visitors have begun to arrive, and
            rooms have been engaged in advance by many
            who have already gone to Assouan.</div>

            <div type= "item">
              <head>“MA FISH."</head>

            Helouan offers opportunities for an enter-
            prising fishmonger able and willing reasonably
            to supply demands daily. We are not altoge-
            ther left without fish, of course, and the prin-
            cipal establishments can always obtain supplies
            from Cairo, but those who buy locally have
            sometimes to content themselves with very
            coarse fish or to go without any at all. Some
            of the gentlemen who tell fish stories in the
            hotels might turn the tables on those in-
            credulous persons who smile at them, by
            turning their attention to this matter now
            and then. People could not then say "ma
            fish," for the fish would be there!</div>

            <div type= "item">
              <head>CONCERNING TONES.</head>

            The band which plays selections of music
            in Helouan on Sundays undoubtedly breaks
            the monotony of life here, but until one
            becomes habituated to music so plentiful in
            what was formerly called discord, one some-
            how cannot help preferring the monotone to
            many tones.</div>

            <div type= "item">
              <head>'XMAS AT THE TEWFIK.</head>

            'Xmas was celebrated at the Tewfik Palace
            Hotel in the good old English fashion. The
            larger hall was decorated with flags and ever-
            greens and a motto, "Merry 'Xmas to All."
            An excellent dinner was served at 7.30, after
            which there was a Cindalerla dance, one or
            two veterans being well to the front. An
            Italian string band "played during and after
            dinner. Among the many guests we noticed
            that Dr. and Mrs. Bentley entertained a large
            party, Miss Smail a party of 4, Mr. Wyllie a
            party of 4, and Mr. Grant also entertained a
            few friends.</div>

            <div type= "item">
              <head>'XMAS AT MENA.</head>

            <p>’Xmas Day brought quite a crowd of Cairo
            people to Mena House Hotel for luncheon and
            tea, but the ’Xmas dinner was the crowning
            point of the day. The well-known dining-hall
            was tastefully decorated with evergreens,
            and almost gave one the impression of being
            in a palm garden. Little coloured lamps were
            studded all over the large and small galleries,
            and happy parties one after another entered
            the fairy scene with the sound of soft music
            greeting them. We will not dwell on the
            details of the excellent dinner that was served,
            but we must, at least, mention the fact that
            when the electric light was switched off and
            the ice brought in illuminated, the visitors
            and guests staying at the hotel, with one
            accord, broke into hearty applause. After the
            dessert the choir of the hotel staff gave '"Teure
            Heimat" by special request of the visitors,
            and, if anything, did better than on 'Xmas Eve.</p>

            <p>Mr. Sheldon Amos had a party of 10 for
            dinner, Mr. Royle a party of 6, Mr. John Ross
            one of 7, and Dr. Wakeling, the popular resi-
            dent physician of Mena House, a party of 24,
            besides many others.</p>

            <p>On Boxing Day the small dance at Mena
            House was well attended, which was surpris-
            ing, considering that many similar functions
            took place that night. We noticed among
            the visitors Lieut.-Col. and Mrs. Ludlow,
            Major And Mrs. Delavoy, Miss Curry, Mrs.
            John Diamaut, Mr. and Mrs. John Ross,
            Miss Berry, Miss Leigh, Mr. and Mrs. C. W.
            Johnstone, Miss Wetherhill, Mr. Larchester
            and his party, Miss Mulholland, Miss Tunley,
            Miss Thomson, Mrs. Miles and the Misses
            Miles, Miss Duncan, Miss Darby, Mr. Alain
            C. White and party, Mr. Ward Boys, Mrs.

            During 22 years of devoted work she had won

            The meeting of the Railway Institute and D
            Co. K. R. R. Corps, at Boulac, was witnessed
            by a good number of spectators. The visitors
            were the first to score, but a few minutes later
            the home team equalised. When well into the
            first half, Smith scored the home team’s second
            goal after a brilliant piece of individual
            play. Up to the interval play was very fast
            and the game was fairly open. The second
            half was a trifle tame, for both sets or for-
            wards lacked combination, and the and came
            without any further scoring. The home de-
            fence had plenty of work to do in the last
            part of the game, especially the custodian,
            Mr. R. Appleby, who was in fine form between

<p>ST. PETERSBURG, December 27.</p>
<p>All the members of the executive committee
of the armed revolutionary bands here, num-

of the 25th inst, including the engineer Sohul-
mann, their leader. Plans, documents, bombs,
and arms were also seized.</p>
<p>Part of the first corps returning from Man-

<p>Revolutionary fighting has taken place at
Kharkoff, causing over two hundred casualties.</p>
<p>Sixty or seventy of the most dangerous
members of the revolutionary party were
arrested here yesterday evening. This marks
their failure in effecting a rising similar to
that at Moscow.	(Reuter)</p>
<p>Moscow, December 27.</p>
<p>Yesterday’s fighting here was most severe,
and continues to-day. Strong rebel forces are
operating in different quarters, throwing up
barricades, making surprise attacks, and fight-
ing from houses, which they seize indiscrimin-
ately, abandoning them as soon as they are
bombarded. The artillery is therefore contin-
ually engaged. The women have shown
conspicuous bravery and ferocity. The Nicholas
terminus is ablaze. It transpires that half the
garrison is confined to barracks for fear that
they should join the insurgents. Reinforce-
ments have arrived.	(Reuter)</p>
<p>Moscow, December 27.</p>
<p>Reinforcements have arrived. It is hoped
that order will soon be restored. (Havas)</p></div>

even anxiety on the Continent. It is note-

much more formidable now than in 1870.</p>

  <head>THE JEWISH RACE IN EGYPT</head>
<p>A correspondent, Mr. T. D. Hall, writing to
the “Manchester Guardian" on the subject of
the recent outrages on the Jews in Russia,
points out that while the feeling of antagonism
towards a race so unlike the rest of the world
undoubtedly gained intensity and bitterness
from misdirected Christian sentiment and
passion, long before the Christian faith had
gained ascendancy the streets of cities inhabited
by Jews bad been reddened with Jewish blood.
Alexandria under the Ptolemies was a second
Jewish capital—two of its five divisions being
inhabited by Jews. The whole population of
Jews in Egypt at the commencement of the
Christian era is estimated at about a million;
and they received high marks of consideration
first from the Greek sovereigns and afterwards
from Augustus. Yet, though Egypt was foe
them a land of comparative privilege, their
position even here was far from being an
enviable one.</p>
<p>The contempt with whioh they looked down
upon the miserable superstitions of Egypt," says
Professor James Drummond, “and the peculiar
customs which served as a barrier between
them and their neighbours, excited the ani-
mosity of the people among whom they lived;
and they were subject from time to time, as so
often in later ages and in other lands, to
brutal outbursts of popular passion and vio-
lence, and occasionally to the more formal
outrages of persecution directed by the Govern-
ment” (Hibbert Lectures, "Philo,” Intro.):</p>
<p>An outbreak which occurred in the reign of
Claudius— under a Roman Governor as brutally
cruel and tyrannical as the one who shortly
afterwards goaded the Jews of Palestine into
the despairing rebellion which ended in the
fall of Jerusalem (70 a.d.) recalls the worst
features of the Odessa massacres. "Whole
families were burned, no pity being shown to
either age or sex, and many perished by tor-
tures, if possible, still more horrible” (iv. p. 9).
Nor was this an isolated occurrence. There was
a renewal of all the horrors in the reign of the
ferocious madman Caligula. For no other face
does the grave Tacitus show a tithe of the
hatred and contempt which he pours upon the
unfortunate people in what professes to be a
purely historical narrative. Already in Egypt
a race "abhorred of the gods,” obeying, through
the deliberate purpose of their legislator, laws
diametrically opposed to those of other na-
tions, and cherishing an inborn hatred to all
other races, and tolerating every abomination
among themselves—such is the picture, barely
relieved by the single virtue of fidelity and
compassion for each other, which he gives of
a nation whioh he utterly failed to compre-
hend. If this was the temper of the educated
-restrained from violence by self-respect and
philosophy,—what forbearance was to be ex-
expected from a brutal rabble, ever on the
look out for pillage?</p>
<p>Even the horrible cruelties of Nero, though
directed especially against the Christians,
probably had their foundation in this prevail-
ling hatred and contempt. To Nero and his
Court Christianity would appear simply as a
variety of Judaism, and the early Christian
Church, even in Rome, was no doubt largely
Jewish. Moreover, its author was a Jew, and
a Jew who had been found deserving of capital
punishment by a Roman Governor.</p></div>

  <head>EGYPTIAN DELTA LIGHT
RAILWAYS.</head>
<head>ANNUAL MEETING ADJOURNED.</head>
<p>The ordinary general meeting of the Egyptian
Delta Light Railways, Limited, was held on
the 21st inst. at Winchester House, Old
Broad Street, London, E.C., Sir Auckland Colvin
(the chairman of the company) presiding.</p>
<p>The secretary (Mr. F. J. Horne) having read
the notice calling the meeting,</p>
<p>The chairman said: I think the circular you
will have received with the notice convening
this meeting clearly explains the reasons for
calling you together to-day. We have seen for
some time past that the interval between Sep-
tember 30th (which date has up to the present
been the termination of our financial year) and
December 31st would be too short, as the size
of our undertakings increased, to prepare and
have audited by the Government and the
company’s auditors the revenue accounts and
balance-sheet in time to present to the pro-
prietors at the general meeting which, in order
to comply with the requirements of the
Companies Acts, must be held in each year—
that is to say, under the existing arrangements,
on or before Deoember 31st. The purchase of
the Helouan Railway has thrown upon our
accounts and audit departments a mass of
additional work which has brought matters to
a climax, and we have been compelled to defer
the publication of the report and accounts for a
month. This meeting will therefore be adjourn-
ed to January 30th next and the usual report
and accounts will be poe-ed to the shareholders
early in that month. For the reasons I have
given you, and also because September 30th
is a most inconvenient date for closing the
accounts of the company, as it is the busiest
season of the year, we have decided to alter
the date of closing the accounts from Septem-
ber 30th to March 31st, which will allow us
more time in future. A further general meeting
will therefore be convened in 1906, when a
half yearly report and accounts will he issued,
after which they will be published annually as
heretofore. I will now therefore move that this
meeting be adjourned until January 30th,
1906.</p>
<p>Sir Charles William Fremantle seconded the
resolution, and it was carried unanimously.</p></div>

  <head>Circulaire N. de Vries et Boutigny.</head>
<head>NOTES ET CRITIQUES</head>
<p>Le Caire, 27 decembre.</p>
<p>Apres le chomage de trois jours determine
par les letes de Noel, notre marche des valeurs
a fait ce matin une recuverture assez ferme,
sinon tres animee.</p>
<p>La tendance est bonne sur presque toutes les
valeurs, mais les transactions sont relativement
peu nombreuses.</p>
<p>La National Bank et l'Agricole sont sou-
teunes a leurs cours precedents. L’action Credit
Foncier Hechit a 777-778, et la Behera a 35 1/2.</p>
<p>En bonne demande, l’action Ciments, dont
nous parlous plus loin, gagne 6 francs a 73 et
les dividendes 2 francs a 20.</p>
<p>L'action Bourse Khediviale du Cairo ouvre
a £ 151 pour cloturer a 138 acheteurs.</p>
<p>Dans le groupe des hotels, de forts achats en
Nungovich, antici qu’a Alexandrie, poussent
le cours a 11 1/16.</p>
<p>Rien de particulier a signaler sur les antres
titres.</p>
<p>Parmi les petites valeurs, les New Egyptian
sont demandes a 28 sh. et les Cotton Mills
a 5 sh. 9.</p>

<p>Nous avons deja donne d'interessants details
concernant les Splendid Hotels, dont on com-
mence a s'occuper serieusement a la Bourse
et qui meritent mieux que le cours actuel.</p>
<p>Les travaux d'agrandissement du New
Khedivial Hotel d’Alexandrie seront termines
dans lea premier jours de Janvier. A ce
moment la direction disposera de 150 chambres
au lieu de 60, c'est-a-dire 90 chambres en plus.</p>
<p>Ou sait qu’il a fallu fermer l'Hotel pendant
tout le mois de novembre pour mener a bien
ces travaux. Malgre ce mois de chomage
complet, les recettes au 20 decembre sont
presque egales a celles de la meme periods de
l’annee passes. Pour les dix jours du 10 au 20
decembre, elles out depasse de 133 livres celles
de la decade correspondante du mois de
decembre 1904.</p>
<p>Il n’existe dans l’affaire ni parts de fonda-
teur, ni obligations; tous les benefices appar-
tiennent aux actionnaires et la prime de 1/4
de livre, payree a l’emission sur toutes les ac-
tions, a ete passee a la reserve.</p>
<p>On ne saurait encore se prononcer sur le
dividende qui sera distribue en fin d’exercice,
mais il sera vraisemblablement des plus satis-
faisanrs.</p>
<p>On aunonce que la Societe des Ciments
d’Egypte a obtenu une nouvelle commande
importante : une fourniture de 6,000 tonnes
an minimum par au a une grande entreprise
locale.</p>
<p>Eu outre, la Societe est favorisee par une
circonstance des plus heureuses : les Com-
pagnies de navigation ont denonce les contrats
d’apres lesquels les ciments importres de l’e-
tranger beneficiaient jusqu’a present de frets
modiques qui leur permettaient de lutter aise-
ment contre les ciments egyptiens. Or, ces
conditions favorables devant cesser des le
ler janvier prochain, l’ffet de cette difference
dans les prix de transport ne tardera pas a se
faire sentir au profit de la Societe.</p>
<p>D’antre part, on fournit un renseignement
tres important au sujet du plan financier
de la Societe. Celle ci est graves, on le sait,
d’une charge de £ 50,000 d’obligations, dont
£ 20,000 ont ere emises a des conditions
relativement onereuses. Or, il est question de
rembourser ces £ 20,000 au moyen d’une
emission d’actions d’egalimontant. Naturelle-
ment, il faudra attendre pour cela que le cours
de l'action, cotee actuellement a 75 francs,
remonte an-dessus du pair, ce qui ne saurait
tarder.</p>
<p>La nouvelle emission faite, la Societe devrs,
en tout premier lieu, a'occuper de payer aux
porteurs d’actions ordinaires les dividendes
arrieres auxquels ils ont droit, c’est-a-dire 25%
pour les cinq exercices passes, le dividende du
5 % etant cumulatil. Les parts de fondateur
pourront ensuite commencer a toucher des be-
nefices.</p>
<p>Aussi bien il y a lien de preferer les actions
ordinaires aux parts de fondateur, les premie-
res devant certainement despasser le pair a bref
delai.</p>
<p>Hier, apres-midi, a en lieu, au siege social
au Caire, la 6eme assemblee generale ordinaire,
de la Salt and Soda Co.</p>
<p>Ainsi que nous l’avions annonce, un divi-
dende de 4 % sera distribue aux, actions ordi-
naires. Les profits des Huileries et Savonneries

<head>﻿STEAM ENGINES IN EGYPT.</head>
<p>A high standard of efficiency has been main-
tained in the Technical Service of the Ministry
of Public Works. The difference between the
conditions ruling at present—as regards steam
engine licenses—and those of a few years ago,
is very striking. Inspections are now made by
the Government Inspectors with practically no
trouble or obstruction on the part of engine
proprietors, and applications tor licenses come
in regularly and voluntarily. 890 applications
were made for licenses last year. These, with 96
which had remained over for consideration at
the end of 1903-together with 18 received
through the medium of the Moudiriehs—make
a total of 604 (as against 358 in 1903. Of the
above, 441 licenses were granted last year—163
remaining over at the end of the year for fur-
ther consideration. 360 licensed engines passed
all the required test satisfactorily and were
pemitted to be worked. The remaining 81 were
still going through the test at the end of 1904.
There were on the 1st of January, 1905,
1,609 engines employed for industrial purposes
in Egypt (exclusive of those employed for
irrigation), all of which are working in confor-
mity with the Government regulations. 51
cases of "contravention” were brought before
the Courts in 1904—48 in the Native and 3
in the Mixed Courts. In these last, all the
engines were stopped from working. Of the
cases before the Native Courts, 10 engines
were stopped, and the remaining 38 are still
awaiting trial.</p>
<p>The Native Courts are extremely slow in
trying cases of this kind—in some instances
a year and more elapsing before judgment is
delivered. As it not infrequently happens that
engines—pronounced to be in a dangerous
state by the Government Inspector — are
permitted to continue working until the case
has been decided, such delays- are very
prejudical to public security.</p>
<p>Only one boiler explosion took place last
year. The cause was working it at a higher
pressure than that authorised by the license.
One man was killed. All Irrigation engine
licenses are now granted by the Technical
Service, and the boilers of such engines are
now subjected to the same tests and regula-
tions as the others.</p>
<p>The dangerous practice of overloading safety
valves is still of frequent occurrence, although
the Technical Service is exerting all its energy
to stop it. It is such a favorite practice with
most, if not all of the native drivers that, until
the majority of them are substituted by others
better instructed in their work, no feeling of
security from this evil can be attained.</p></div>

<head>SUFFERINGS OF TURKISH TROOPS</head>
<p>Terrible stories are told (says the "Time"

even sufficient food. In one well authenticated
case more than one-third of the men died of

<head>WHAT THE PARROT SAID.</head>
<p>Here is a parrot story which is both new and
true. A venerable and pious lady, inspired
to enthusiasm by a dealer’s emphatic decla-
ration that a parrot he had could "sing a
hymn, ” paid what he demanded for tbe gifted
bird, and took it home in triomph. She invited
a party of friends of a cast of mind, as serious
as her own to hear the parrot’s rendering of
the hymn. When all had assembled the
covering was withdrawn from the cage, and
Polly, opening one eye, looked round drow-
sily. “ What a — crew !" she murmured,
quietly, and went to sleep again.</p></div>

<head>TO-DAY ON THE NILE</head>
<p>This is an excellent companion to the guide-
book for the tourist on the Nile. The author
Mr. H. W. Dunning, Ph.D., late Instructor
in Semitic languages in Yale University,
announces in the preface that he claims only
to write as a traveller who has been and is
interested in Egypt. The book contains a good
description of a trip up the river, and there are
also chapters devoted to the ancient and mo-
dern history of Egypt, its religion and gods,
the Cairo Museum, and the Sudan. The book
is written in a pleasant style and is not over-
hardened with learning. It will just suit the
intelligent tourist, who comes fresh to the
country and wants to see the usual sights and
learn something about the land and its history
without having to take the trouble to wade
through guide-books for his information. It is
well printed and admirably illustrated with
photogravures. The information is fully up to
date, for the preface is dated on the 15th of
last month. We cordially recommend this work
as a most useful and delightful handbook for
the visitor to Egypt.</p>

  <head>COTTON TRADE IN 1905.</head>
<head>MOST PROSPEROUS YEAR ON RECORD.</head>
<p>The year just ending has been the most
profitable over experienced in the history of
the Lancashire cotton spinning industry. A
statement issued of the working of 90 limited
liability companies whose balance sheets have
just been published reveals a remarkable degree
of prosperity. The combined paid-up share cap-
ital of these concerns is rather more than
three and a half millions, and after charging the
revenue with interest on the borrowed capital
of £1,794,000 and allowing for wear and tear
of plant, the total profit recorded for the year
is £698,000, or equal to 19% on the capital.
Only nine companies failed to pay dividends.
This record profit has not only enabled the
total adverse balances of £102,500 existing at
the end of last year to be cleared off, but credit
balances and reserve funds have been created
amounting to £400,000, after the large sum of
over £237,000 has been paid away in dividends
and bonuses. The mean average dividend paid
is equal to 7 per cent. The healthy feeling
that has prevailed has resulted in the erec-
tion of a large number of new mills, which will
be putting yarn on the market during the
coming year. The existing oompanies will,
therefore, have more competition in the future,
and, with a threatened short crop of Ameri-
can cotton in view, it is feared that the
outlook for the coming year is not quite so
cheering to investors in this class of securi-
ties. Users of Egyptian cotton are in rather
a better position, and, on the whole, perhaps,
the situation is not so dispiriting to holders.</p>
<p>During the past twenty two years, sixteen
have been profitable periods, the aggregate
profits amounting to £3,382,868, and loss for
the six years being £256,765 or a net profit
earned of £3,116,102.</p></div>

<head>COTTON BROKERS AS PRINCIPALS
OR AGENTS.</head>
<p>There was concluded in the Chancery Court
of Lancashire, sitting in St. George’s-hall,
Liverpool, on Saturday week, an action which
was brought by the Societe Cotonniere de
St. Etienne du Rouvray against Messrs. Shand,
Higsorg snd Co., cotton brokers, of Liverpool.
The plaintiffs are a company incorporated
according to the laws of France, carrying on
business as cotton spinners and manufacturers
at Rouen. It appeared from the statement
of claim that transactions took place from
April, 1902, to March, 1904, between the
plaintiffs and defendants on the Liverpool
cotton market, the total of the purchases and
sales made by the defendants amounting, it was
stated, to about 11,800 bales, and the plaintiffs
remitted £6,775 as balances to the defen-
dants. It was claimed on behalf of the
plaintiffs that the defendants acted in the
transactions as the plaintiffs’ brokers or agents;
that an account might be taken of all dealings
and transactions between the plaintiffs and
the defendants in relation to the purchase
and sale of cotton during the years 1902-4
inclusive, and that the defendants might
be ordered to pay to the plaintiffs what
might be found due to them on making
such account. Damages for breach of duty
by the defendants as brokers were also
claimed. Mr. W. R. Shand, a member of
the defendant firm, said in evidenoe that
they had always regarded themselves as
principals in the transactions. When his firm
received an order to buy for a firm like the
plaintiffs,' they sold to them at the market
price ruling. His Honour said he was con-
vinced that the defendants had acted straight-
forwardly and had done nothing which they
were not entitled to do under the contracts.
He was not going to give a formal judgment
that day, bnt he was in the plaintiffs’ favor
as to whether the defendants were principals
or agents—he was satisfied that they were
agents. He therefore directed that the plain-
tiffs were entitled to an account In taking
that account the plaintiffs were entitled to
repudiate the transactions in "futures" in
which the defendants had acted as principals
to sell or buy on behalf of the plaintiffs where
they had dealt with their own cotton. They
might treat it that he had decided the case,
but in a matter of this interest and importance
he preferred to give a formal judgment. Mr.
Horridge intimated that there would be an
appeal.</p></div>

<head>EGYPTIAN SHARE MARKET.</head>
<head>(From our Financial Correspondent).</head>
<head>The Government and South Africa.</head>
<p>London, December 22.</p>
<p>The features of the week have been the
rise of money, caused by the Bank of England
withdrawing money from the market for the
purposes of making, its rate effective and con-
solidating its position, and to-day’s news of
the Government adopting the somewhat un-
constitutional course of prohibiting further
importations of Chinese coolies into South
Africa.  As regards the former, the step taken
by the Bank is commended on all hands, and
while it has opened a temporary scarcity in
the money market, it will certainly result in
greater ease. The proportion of reserve to
liabilities has gone down to 36 1/4%, but with
effective control over the money market, this
is considered quite satisfactory.</p>
<p>The nervous action of the Government in
regard to Chinese labour on the Rand, which
they affect to consider a menace to South
Africa, might have been expected to cause a
big slump in South African shares, but the
unexpected always happens." The Exchange
argues, no doubt correctly, that the number
of Chinese already in the mines are sufficient
for the present, and that this Government, if
it receives a mandate from the people, is not
likely to be long in power. Already they
have begun attacking important interests,
which have surely already suffered sufficiently
from interfering legislation. The sympathy
of those connected with South Africa will
now also be alienated, and a very large number
of the electors are watching apprehensively
the Home Rule tendencies of the Prime
Minister. If Ireland is to "manage its own
affairs,” having already municipal government,
what can this mean but the granting of a
Parliament a Parliament on the lines of the
present municipal councils, which are certainly
not satisfactory.</p>
<p>The members of the Stock Exchange—and
they are pretty shrewd calculators—are, there-
fore, very probably correct in the view that
the new Administration, if elected, has not
the elements of Stability, and on the return
of a more conservative rule six months or a
year hence there will be ample time to fill
up with fresh importations the Chinese who
would have been repatriated in the meantime.</p>
<head>The Situation In Russia.</head>
<p>The general political situation is certainly not
any worse. If the Imperial party cannot rule
Russia and the latest effort at coercion has
been an absolute failure — some popularly
elected body must do so. It is felt that the final
step of the Tsar in refusing universal suffrage,
contrary even to the opinion of his own Cabi-
net, is an act of suicide so far as the Imperial
regime is concerned. The last scene, which
everybody here is expecting, looks as if it
would be a decisive one, and, we hope, in
view of the apparent unanimity of the work-
ing classes in the present strike, or rather
revolution, it will not cause further bloodshed.</p>
<head>Consols.</head>

<p>There has been little movement in Consols,
which leave off at 89 5/14, a rise of 1/8 on last
week.</p>
<head>Foreign Bonds.</head>
<p>In the market for Foreign Government se-
curities Russians have further declined, and
are to-night quoted at 8 1/2, as compared with
80 3/4 a week ago. Japanese stooks are steady.
The new loan leaves off to-night at 5 3/5 premium.</p>
<head>Railways.</head>
<p>A steady tone has prevailed in the market
for home railways, assisted by the week's
returns, which were on the whole satisfactory.
The announcement by the managing committee
of the South Eastern and Chatham that a new
and more modern roof is to be built over
Charing Cross station, and that the station
will be re-opened in six weeks’ time, caused a
sharp advance in the company’s shares, which
is being maintained.</p>
<head>The American Market.</head>
<p>In the American railway market Union
Pacifics have settled down to 150 3/4, which
would appear to be a high enough price. As
regards the Chicago bank failure, the support
of the other banks entirely prevented any
disastrous results. Mr. Walsh’s speculations
do not appear to have been of a wild descrip-
tion. At any rate, the investigation seems to
have shown that he is still possessed of a
considerable fortune. The three banks, the
Chicago National Bank, the Home Savings
Bank, and the Equitable Trust Company, ap-
pear to have been one and the same, i.e., under
the control of Mr. Walsh. It speaks well for
the state of finance in this large speculative
centre that an affair of this kind can happen
without leaving any unpleasant after-effects.
As a matter of fact the American market
generally is considered to be in a very sound
and satisfactory position. The country is
making money rapidly, and gold is returning
to the money centres, as is usual at this time
of the year.</p>
<head>Egyptians.</head>
<p>There has again been very little doing in
the Egyptian market this week, and with the
approach of the holidays business is not likely
to improve. National Bank of Egypt have fallen
to 24 7/8—5 1/8, and Agricultural Banks to 9, with
hardly any bargains to report. Daira Sanieh
Ordinary and Deferred shares have been flat,
the Ordinary falling to 16 3/4, and the Deferred
to 160, with very few buyers, even at these
reduced figures. Egyptian Estates have been
in good demand at 1 1/2. and the Deferred shares
have advanced to 6 buyers. This seems a good
price far 1s. shares. Delta Preference Bearer
are very firm at 11 3/4 buyers, and these shares
are full of dividend. Egyptian Markets are a

dull at 1 1/26 Union Fonciere are 5/8 premium,
and Abyssinian Banks 3/8 discount. Khedivial
Mail are still buyers at 1 3/4, perhaps slightly
more, and the Debentures are enquired for at
100. Roumanian Banks are about 7 3/4-7/8, but
the business has again gone off in these. Delta

unchanged.</p>
<head>Mining</head>
<p>In view of this morning's news re the Go-
vernment’s attitude, South African mines are
fairly steady,	bnt	there	are	no	prominent
features. The	money	to be	distributed	in
February in this market in dividends alone is
well over one-and-a-half millions, and it is felt
that this is the most solid argument for
stability.</p>
<p>The Egyptian section has been flat for the
greater part of the week, but there was a slight
revival yesterday, though the prices all-round
are under our last quotations. Nile Valleys are
now 2/15, after being lower, and Um Rus leave
off at the same figure. Egyptian Mines Explo-
ration close at 9s. 0d., a tall since our last of
about 1s.</p>
<head>Sulphide Corporation's Report.</head>
<p>The report of the Sulphide Corporation has
attracted considerable notice, and it would
seem as if the prospects of this concern are
very fine, and we hear of influential buying.
Not only have they in the past year, with the
price of lead at £12, made considerable profits,
although acting on conservative lines, they
have not distributed them, and have before
them an increase in the price to £17, but they
are also now working a new process by which
the cost of production will be very largely
decreased.</p>
<p>The closing prices to-night are as follows:-</p></div>

<head>THE COTTON MARKET.</head>
<head>Kearsley and Cunningham's Weekly Report.</head>
<p>Liverpool, December 21.</p>
<p>There has been a very moderate demand for
Egyptians this week. Quotations are un-
changed except for Fine Brown, which is raised
1/8 per lb. In futures a fair business has been
done, and the following are the latest values:—</p>
<p>Dec.	8.7	 March	8.7	June	8.7
Jan.	8.7	April	8.7	July	8.7
Feb.	8.7	May  8.7	Aug. 	8.7</p>
<p>American Futures The Market this week
has been fairly active and there have been
plenty of fluctuations, but within narrower
limits, at one moment prices were 15 @ 17
points higher, but the advance has not been
maintained, and today's closing values are
1 @ 3 up to 1 @ 2 points decline from those
of last Thursday. The only feature has. been
the National Ginners report the Census
Bureau report of the cotton ginned to the 13th
instant; the first estimate it at 8,975,000
and the official report at 9,282,000. The pro-
bability is that even this latter estimate is too
low as there is no compulsion to make returns
neither, however, has had more than a passing
influence upon the market. The power of
planters, aided by the extensive "bull"
operations in New York and New Orleans, to
hold back their cotton, is the most important
factor in the situation and may enable them
to maintain present high values, even, possibly,
to force them higher temporarily, but if the
crop proves to be 11 millions, as present
indications point to, we expect that later
there will be heavy liquidation with a material
decline. The latest quotations are, delivery:—</p>

<head>COMMISSION MUNICIPALE</head>
<head> (Communication Officielle)</head>
<p>La Commission Municipale s’est réunie le 27
décembre 1905 sous la présidence de S.E. Mah-
mood Pacha Sidky.</p>
<p>La séance est ouverte à 4 h. p.m.</p>
<p>Présent : MM. Ambroise A. Ralli, vice-
président, Ahmed Bey Eyoub, Em. Benachi
Hussein Bey Riaz, A. Cumbo, L Escoffier, P
Fenderi, Mansour Bey Youssef, Baron de
Menasce, Mohamed Boy Mahfouz, O Rothaz-
ker, A. Padoa Bey. Dr J. Schiess Bey, Em
Stross, Soliman Bey Abani, Dr. G. Valensin, G.
Zervudachi, G. Zouro, membres, W. P. Chata-
way, administrateur, I. Sedky Bey, secrétaire.</p>
<p>En ouvrant la séance, le président exprime
les regrots de l’assemblée pour la perte qu’elle
vient de faire en la personne de Saleh Bey
Heddeni, membre désigné par le Gouverne-
ment au sein de la Commission Municipale.</p>
<p>Le Président propose d’envoyer à la famille
du défunt une lettre de condoléances.</p>
<p>La Commission se joint au Président dans
l’expression de ses sentiments et décide de
lever la séance en signe de deuil pendant cinq
minutes.</p>
<p>A la reprise de la séance, le Président est
heureux de pouvoir annoncer qu’à la suite des
démarches qu’il avait été chargé, dé faire au-
près de M. Suzzarini, celui-ci a bieu voulu ac-
cepter de retirer sa démission.</p>
<p>Au sujet de la communication des procèss
verbaux de la Délégation, M. Escoffier demande
ou en est la question de l'emplacement à pro-
poser à l’Eat pour l'hôpital des maladies in-
fectieuses. L'Administrateur répond que la
Délégation a décidé dans sa séance d'hier de
recommander au choix du Gouvernement un
terrain à Hadra, précédemment afficté aux
ecuries de la police.</p>
<p>Sur une observation de M.Escoffier, la Com-
mission renvoie à l'étude de l’Administration
le point de savoir si la Compagnie des Eaux
est fondée à réclamer le prix des bouches d'ar
rosage que la Municipalité demande à installer
dans les pares publics et dans les rues.</p>
<p>L’ordre du jour appelle la discussion du pro-
jet de budget de 1906.</p>
<p>Mention est faite à ce sujet de l’envoi aux
membres du rapport de l’Administrateur sur
le dit budget, du procès-verbal de la Délégation
y relatif, ainsi que du rapport du Comité des
Finances en posant ses propositions et observa-
tions au sujet du budget.</p>
<p>L'Administrateur dit que dans sa séance
d'hier la Délégation a partagé sur la plupart
des points les conclusions du rapport du Comité
des Finances, conclusions qui ne comportent au
point de vue des chiffres du budget qu’une dif-
férence de L.E. 100, montant de deux alloca-
tions que la Délégation propose de maintenir
d'après ses premières propositions.</p>
<p>Cette question des allocations a donné lieu à
une discussion de principe, quelques membres
ayant demandé de ne les inscrire au budget
que pour un chiffre global, sauf à faire une
répartition ultérieure qui serait basée sur
une étude qu'un Comité spécial aurait à pour-
suivre dans ce bus.</p>
<p>Après un échange d'idées,la Commission
se rallie à une proposition du Vice-Président
tendant à l'adoption des allocations telles
qu’elles sont proposées par le Comité des
Finances et amendées par la Délégation et
à nommer à la prochaine séance un Comité
chargé de reviser les subventions actuelles
et de proposer leur répartition sur le mode qu’il
croira le plus équitable.</p>
<p>Le rapport de ce Comité devra être pre-
senté avant le 15 novembre 1906.</p>
<p>Une augmentation de 50 L E. pour le Sport-
ing Club, et une nouvelle subvention de 50 L.E.
pour l’asile enfantin israclite sont votées.</p>
<p>Les autres chapitres du budget des-recettes
et dépeuses sont adoptés, tels qu'ils sont
proposés par le Comité des Finances d'accord
avec la Délégation.</p>
<p>Eu conséquence le budget est arrêté en
recettes à LE 195,000 et en dépenses an
même chiffre avec une réserve de LE 1884</p>
<p>A l'occasion de la discussion du budget, M
Escoffier propose que le budget d’assistance
publiqne de la ville soit alimenté par un impôt
à établir sur les cercles.</p>
<p>La Commission émet un avis favorable à cette
proposition qu’elle renvoie pour plus ample
étude au Comité des Finances et du Conten-
tieux.</p>
<p>Une proposition de M. Zouro tendant à por-
ter à L E 25 le minimum de loyer imposable
de la taxe du 2% et de réduce à un pour cent
la redevance sureles loyers annuele de 25 à 50
L.E. est renvoyée à l’étude du Comité des Fi-
nances.</p>
<p>Sur rapport du Comité des Plantations, et
à la suite des explications donnees par M. le
Dr. Schiess Bey, Président de ce Comité, la
Commission décide :</p>
<p>1. d’euvrir un crédit de LE 600 pour les
travaux de plantations à exécuter au grand
jardin Nouzha en attendant qu’on plan général
des améliorations et modifications à apporter
dans ledit jardin soit adopté et mis en œuvre.</p>
<p>2 de consacrer pour cette année une somme
de L E 5.000 pour la confection du nouveau
jardin à créer sur le terrain cédé par le Gou-
vernement près de l’hôpital indigène et pour
les travaux préliminaires de terrassement et
de mise eu profil que comporte le projet André
eu commençant par la partie des fortifica-
tions situés au nord de la Porte Rosette.</p>
<p>Les deux dépenses ci-dessus seront prélevées
sur le budget extraordinaire.</p>
<p>La surveillanoe et la direction de l’exécution
des parcs sera assumée par le service muni-
cipal des jardins et les travaux mis en adjuca-
tion.</p>
<p>L’ordre du jour appelle l’interpellation dé
M. Zouro concernant la suite donnée à diverses
décisions prises par la Commission sur ses pro-
positions.</p>
<p>M. Zouro commence le développement de
ses interpellations, mais vu l’heure tardive, et
désirant s’entourer au préalable de tons éclair-
cissements sur les questions se rapportant aux
dires interpellations, la Commission prie M.
Zouro de vouloir bien communiquer ses déve
loppements à l’Administration qui les distri
buera aux membres avec ses observations.</p>

<div><head>Vade Mecum for the Homeward Bound</head>

<head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>

<p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure
in presenting to its subscribers the accompany-
ing description of some of the many interesting
routes by which they may travel homewards.
Great care had been taken to arrange them as
accurately and concisely as possible, and it
will be found that none of them are fraught
with difficulty. In Choosing the route home
there are several things to be considered. To
there are several things to be considered. To
begin with there is the difference in climate
between Egypt and the various points at which
you may arrive in Europe.</p>

<p>This depends partly upon the month in
which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in January
may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and
possibly not so warm as Sicily, but in March
it will be warmer than Rome, and more uni-
formly warm than many other places in Europe.
Many people leave Egypt far too early in the
year; for as a rule the weather in April and
May is perfect. The warmest place to go to
on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>

<p>Some will want to take into consideration
the number of days to be spent at sea, and we
therefore subjoin a list showing the time oc-
cupied on each of the various routes between
Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>

<p>They are as follows :-</p>

<p>The long sea routes-from Port Said or
Alexandria to Plymouth, Southampton, London
or Liverpool-occupy about 14 days. The
short ones are as follows:-</p>

<p>Port Said or ALexandria to Brindisi   3 days
Alexandria to Messina... ... ...      3 "
Port Said or Alexandria to Marseilles 5 "
Alexandria to Venice and Trieste      4 "
Alexandria to Naples... ...           3 "
Port Said to Genoa  ... ... ...       5 "
Port Said to Naples... ... ...        4 "
Alexandria to Constantinople ...      4 "
Alexandria to Piraeus ... ... ...     2 "
Port Said to Gibraltar... ... ...     7 "</p>

<p>The steamers, of the P. & 0. North German
Lloyd, Orient and Messageries Mari times
are the largest. The Anchor, British India,
and Bibby Lines are also excellent, and their
steamers are largely patronised by travellers
to Egypt.</p>

<p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo,
the shortest is that to Alexandria, without
change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now
be made without change in 4 1/2 hours.</p>

<p>The least expensive way to England is by
the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and Westcott
lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool.
The German Levant line has also good steamers
from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>

<p>The most expensive but quickest through
Continental routes are by P. & O. Brindisi
express from Port Said, and the Austrian
Lloyd Trieste-Vienna express from Alexandria.</p>

<p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne
in mind that very little luggage is allowed
free on the railways of Europe, but there are
several good and responsible forwarding agents
in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>

<p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe
from Port Said is undoubtedly by the fast
Mail Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis" to Brindisi.
One of these leaves Port Said every week, as
soon as possible after receiving the Indian
mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>

<p>These small but comfortable ships have
enormously powerful engines, and attain a
very high rate of speed. They are called the
"ferry boats," having been specially built to
carry the British mail from Port Said to
Brindisi. If you are going straight through to
England you will find the train waiting at
Brindisi which will take you to Calais without
changing. It has complete arrangements for
sleeping and eating on board, and you should
arrive in London on the fifth day from leaving
Port Said.</p></div>

<div><head>SICILY.</head>

<p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-
Rubattino Co.'s steamers which leave Alex-
andria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes
train to TAORMINA, one of the most charm-
ing and popular places on the island. Giardini
is he station at which to alight, and the drive
up to Taormina is most delightful, occupying
about one hour. In and around the town is
much to interest the visitor. The theatre is of
Greek origin, but restored under the Romans.
CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent
of Etna and here also is a fine Cathedral. The
Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that
are found all over the island, are an endless
sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an
interesting history, having been a Greek
city, which was designed by Demostheues in
B.C. 413, and taken by the Romans in b.c. 212,
when Archimedes was slain in his tomb is to be
seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan
temple. PALERMO, with about 300,000
inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and
enjoys a delightful climate. Much of interest
is to be found in this fine city. The Polazzo
Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the
church of S Giovannia degli Eremiti with its
picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral Museum,
Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park
are also worth a visit.</p>

<head>CENTRAL ITALY.</head>

<p>The fine steamers of the North German
Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
during the season for Naples, the voyage
being only 3 days.</p>

<p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from
Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steam-
ers, which leave daily. One cannot approach
Naples or leave it without wishing to explore
some of its island, besides the lovely places
on its Bay— Castellamare and Sorrento. The
small steamer that takes you to Sorrento [you
can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>

<p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of
but five hours. All who can will devote at
least one week to visiting the many historical
and interesting portions of the Eternal City,
whose charms and beauties are too well-known
to need comment here.</p>

<p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret,
a railway journey of five hours brings you to
FLORENCE, where another week can well be
spent admiring the City of Flowers and its
surrounding country. In Florence itself the
churches and galleries are of absorbing inte-
rest, whilst the local promenades and excur-
sions should not be omitted. The Cascine is
the most attractive and fashionable promenade
in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of
the finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years
ago, goes winding up through the hills a
distance of four miles. The most delightful
excursion outside Florence is that to Vallom-
brosa; with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the
sea level. This is made first by ordinary train
from Florence to St. Ellero, thence by cog-
wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through
groves of oaks takes an hour, and most
striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>

<p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in
about 2 hours ; here there is a fine Cathedral
and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one
night should if possible be made, in order to
enjoy the view from the Campanile at sunset.</p>

<p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful
places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa and on
the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a
very convenient half-way house between Egypt
and England, and where living is reasonable
and the air and surroundings exceptionally
good.</p></div>

<div><head>NORTHERN ITALY</head>

<p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most
picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
the record of having one of the lowest
death averages of European cities and a
phenomenally equable temperature—warm in
winter and deliciously cool breezes from the
surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean
in summer.</p>

<p>The patriarchal home of Italy’s most an-
eient nobility, whose palaces, gardens, and
famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and
paintings, are a constant delight to thousands
of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
Then there are the superbly decorated medie-
val churches containing exquisite marble
columns and historical paintings, and the in-
comparable Campo Santo filled with its won-
derful tombs.</p>

<p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only
three hours by rail.</p>

<p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy
before making the tour of the Lakes. The
Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its
beautiful windows illustrating the History of
the Bible. The public gardens and the monu-
mental cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>

<p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an
hour and-a-half from Milan is SALSOMAG-
GIORE, a renowned health resort on account
of its thermal springs, change trains at Borgo
San Domingo and in half-an-hour you are at
Salsomaggiore.</p>



<head>NORTHERN ITALY (continued)
and
The ITALIAN LAKES.</head>

<p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from
Milan, and one of the most delightful places
imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total
absence of vehicular traffic strikes one as very
strange; no horse, cart, carriage or bicycle is
to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life
at every turn. The approach to Venice from
the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea-
port. The town seems to be gradually, like
Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills behind, no
stretches of rock, but the first the tops of Cam-
paniles appear above the horizon, then slowly
the whole glittering town rises like a fairy
mirage out of the calm lagoon.</p>

<p>Going northwards from Milan you make the
tour of the beautiful Italian lakes.</p>

<p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny,
is reached in one-and-a-quarter hours by train
by way of Monza.</p>

<p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other
towns on the lake, which is very beautiful, and
the scenery on either side going up the lake is
most enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming
spot; then come Tremezzo, Cadenabbia, and
Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of
Bellaggio opposite. The walk from Tremezzo
along the shore of the lake to Managgio is most
enjoyable. A steam tram runs from Menaggio
to Porlezza on Lake Lugano in three-quarters
of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in two-and-
three-quarter hours.</p></div>

<div><head>SWITZERLAND</head>

<p>Switzerland, the heart of Europe, has been
described as "A cluster of delights and
grandeurs."</p>

<p>LUGANO is some 20 miles from Como and
reached by train in one-and-a-half- hours. It has
a population of 10,000 people and is charm-
ingly situated on the Lake of Lugano, amidst
lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San
Salvatore, M. de Caprino and M. Generoso.</p>

<p>LOCARNO may be reached by rail from
Bellinzona in forty minutes. This pretty town,
situated at the top of Lake Maggiore, has a
mild climate, and is an excellent winter resort.
The church Madonna del Sasso, situated above
the town, is worth a visit, as it contains interest-
ing paintings, "Entombment," by Ciseri, and
"The Flight into Egypt" by Bramantion.</p>

<p>LUCERNE- A striking picture on the Lake
of Lucerne facing the Rigi and Pilatus and
the snow-clad Alps.</p>

<p>In and around the town the walks are
charming, and the excursions to be made from
Lucerne by boat, rail, etc., are very numerous.</p>

<p>The Lake of Lucerne abounds in delightful
excursions, those to the Rigi, Pilatus, Burgen-
stock and Sonnenberg needing a special visit
each. Other excursions on the lake can be
made by steamer, and the ever-changing
scenery on the trip from Lucerne to Fluelen is
a source of delight to the lover of nature.</p>

<p>BRUNNEN, charmingly situated on the
most beautiful part of the Lake of Lucerne,
commands magnificent views of lake and
mountain scenery. Along the Lake of Uri
from Brunnen to Fluelen runs the famous
Axentrasse.</p>

<p>A delightful excursion from Lucerne is
that to ENGELBERG. Take boat to Stansstad
and from Stansstad it is about 1 hour and
40 min. by Electric Railway, with delightful
scenery en route. The ascent of Titlis is
made from here, and the panoramic view of
the Alps is grand; extending from Monte
Rosa to the Black Forest, and from the
Santis to the Matterhous.</p>

<p>THE BERNESE OBERLAND-INTER-
LAKEN a favourite summer resort and the best
centre for making excursions in the Oberland,
abounding in fine walks and views. There is
a magnificent view of the Jungfrau from the
Hoheweg, a fine avenue of walnut trees the
chief resort of visitors. Interlaken is also not
far from the famous waterfalls, Giessbach,
Trummelbach, and Staubbach. Then also the
glaciers of Grindelwald and view from Murren
and the Schynige Platte are sights not to be
missed.</p>

<p>Chateau D'Oex. 3500 ft. above the sea
on the new Electric Railway between Montreaux
and Interlaken, surrounded by magnificent
scenery, with pure dry air. Much frequented
by English people in Summer and Winter.</p></div>

<div><head>GREEK AND IONIAN ISLES</head>
<p>Many people visit Greece after wintering
in Egypt, as it is so easily reached from Alex-
andria; the climate in April is charming. The
best steamers are those of the Khedivial Mail
Co. and the Russian Steam Navigation Co.</p>

<p>If possible tourists should arrange to be in
Athens for the Orthodox Easter in order to
witness the Good Friday and Easter Eve
ceremonies, and to be present at the dancing
on the Easter Tuesday festival held at Megara
for which a special train is run from Athens.</p>

<p>It is worth while to spend a few days in
CORPU on account of the beauty of the
scenery. There is also good snipe and quail
shooting to be had.</p></div>
