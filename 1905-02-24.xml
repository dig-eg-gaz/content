                    <head>THE NILE</head>
                    <p>We have already alluded to the recent observations of Sir William Preece
                        relative to the neglected condition of the Nile, but both by reason of the
                        importance of the topic discussed, no less than on account of the
                        professional position of the lecturer, it deserves fuller consideratino, as
                        it possesses for dwellers in Eygpt an absorbing interest. The Nile is the
                        most precious gift bestowed by a bounteous Providence upon this favored
                        land, and every means which practical science can suggest should be employed
                        to utilise to the fullest possible extent the purposes it is intended to
                        serve. The P.W.D. has, up to the present, been regarded by common consent as
                        comprising a body of highly trained and experienced experts of which any
                        country might be proud, and upon whose judgment the public has been in the
                        habit of placing absolute and unquestioning reliance. To the initiative and
                        capacity of this department we owe the conception and accomplishment of one
                        of the grandest engineering feats which the modern world has witnessed. But
                        it may reasonably be asked whether the preservation of the river's depth at
                        its normal and requisite level, the maintenance of its banks in an efficient
                        state of repair, and the counteracting of its dangerous and impeding
                        currents between Assouan and Alexandria, is not a duty which, though far
                        more modest and less imposing than the erection of dams and reservoirs, is
                        equally essential of fulfilment Can it be that we have been sleeping the
                        sleep of the seven sleepers all this while, only to be rudely awakened by
                        the clarion tones of Sir William's perturbing though timely warning? Has the
                        idol that we have so long venerated nothing but feet of clay, which his
                        well-directed blows have shattered to atoms? Englishmen, to whatever class
                        they belong, are, as a rule, slow to condemn. Their inborn and unquenchable
                        love of justice and fair-play operates as an effective curb upon their
                        impulses. Their strong sense of gratitude likewise makes them prone to look
                        with leniency upon the shortcomings of those who have rendered faithful
                        service to the public. It is, on the other hand, hard to believe that Sir
                        William Preece has been guilty of mere wanton fault finding, and it is still
                        harder to conceive that he should allow himself to give utterance to a hasty
                        censure. Regard for his own professional reputation would, presumably, have
                        restrained him from hazarding opinions formed without a due and accurate
                        knowledge of all the facts. Taking all these circumstances into account, it
                        is but natural that his strictures should hate evoked a feeling of anxiety.
                        Nothing will allay the uneasiness of the public but a clear and conclusive
                        refutation of his charges of neglect, pronounced by experts of equal
                        eminence and independence, and to this end a committee of investigation
                        should be forthwith appointed whose standing and impartiality could not
                        reasonably be challenged.</p>

                            ball-room improvised by the committee in the Esbekieh Gardens is a
                            triumph of skilful construction. Room has been found for 88 boxes in two
                            tiers, in the ball-room itself there are two kiosks for the band and the
                            orchestra, and the area of the floor, 35 metres by 15, should prevent
                            any overcrowding. The whole structure will be lit by electricity, and
                            the scene will be very brilliant</p>

                    <head>CAIRO LIBEL CASE</head>
                    <p>A criminal libel case of some local interest came before the Supreme Consular
                        Court, Cairo, this morning. Mr. J. W. Congdon, a well-known British resident
                        in the Capital, brought an action against Mr. Houghton for a 'false,
                        ma­licious, defamatory, and libellous article" writ­ten by him and published
                        in the "Egyptian Graphic" on the 15th. The plaintiff was represented by Mr.
                        D. G. Cuppa, barrister-at- law. Mr. William Houghton, who was described as a
                        journalist, was not represented by coun­sel. In the opinion of the judge,
                        however, the case did not call for criminal proceedings and be therefore
                        ruled the dismissal of criminal proceedings, leaving it to the prosecutor to
                        take civil proceedings if he cared to. The case was then dismissed. There is
                        an essential difference between civil and criminal libel. The former is
                        considered simply as an injury to the indivi­dual, the latter as an injury
                        to the State.</p>

                    <p>The ball held at the Ghezireh Casino yesterday evening was a most brilliant
                        success. In the decorations palms and flowers were extensively employed,
                        and, together with a profusion of uniforms and pretty toilettes, made a very
                        charming sight. A large number of the officers of the Army of Occupation
                        were present, with many well-know a visitors and residents, and we noticed a
                        very large foreign element. The floor was very good, and the music was in
                        excellent time. The last of the dancers did not leave until an early hour
                        this morning. We congratulate the authorities of Ghezireh Palace Hotel, who
                        were responsible lor the management of the ball, on the great success which
                        attended their efforts.</p>

                    <p>TERRAINS DÉS QUAIS</p>
                    <p>Projet de reglement pour la vente des terrains de la Municipalité
                        d'Alexandrie, arrete par les Co­mites des Finances et du Con­tentieux.</p>
                    <p>1er.— Les terrains de la Municipalité seront catalogués, et un prix
                        dévaluation sera fixé pour chaque lot, par la Commission Muni­cipale, sur la
                        proposition du Comité d'estimation.</p>
                    <p>Dans aucun cas, la vente de ces terrains ne pourra être faite à un prix
                        inférieur à celui fixé par l'évaluation.</p>
                    <p>Ces prix pourront être révisés dans le pre­mier trimestre de chaque
                        année.</p>
                    <p>Art. 2.— Les ventes s'effectueront par voie d'enchères ou de soumissions.</p>
                    <p>Toutefois, si, avant la mise en vente, le Gouvernement veut dans un but
                        d'utilité géné­rale, acquérir un ou plusieurs lots, ils lui seront cédés au
                        prix d'estimation du catalogue.</p>
                    <p>La cession pourra également se faire par voie d'échange.</p>
                    <p>Art. 3.— Les terrains seront vendus tels qu'ils se comportent, avec toutes
                        leurs servitu­des actives et passives, et sans qu'aucun re­cours puisse être
                        exercé, de ce chef, contre la Municipalité.</p>
                    <p>Art. 4.— Le prix d'achat sera payable : Vingt cinq pour cent, comptant et le
                        solde en dix années, par fractions égales, avec intérêts à quatre pour cent
                        par an, payables annuellement, à partir du 5e jour qui suivra
                        l'adjudi­cation.</p>
                    <p>Art. 5.— La mise en vente sera portée à la connaissance du public, au moyen
                        d'avis dans le Journal Officiel, et dans trois journaux d'Alexandrie, au
                        moins. Ces avis seront égale­ment affichés à la Municipalité, au Gouvernorat
                        et à la Bourse Khédiviale ; ils désigneront les lots mis en vente ; ils
                        indiqueront leur numéro au catalogue et leur contenance, ainsi que leur mise
                        à prix, forme de la mise en adjudication, et le jour et l'heure de la
                        séance.</p>
                    <p>Art. 6.— Aucune personne ne pourra vala­blement concourir aux enchères sans
                        avoir effectué au préalable, le versement d'un dépôt du 10 % de la mise à
                        prix.</p>
                    <p>Ce dépôt ne portera aucun intérêt. Il pourra être versé jusqu'au moment de
                        l'ouverture des enchères ou des soumissions.</p>
                    <p>Les enchérisseurs dont les offres n'auront pas été agréées, pourront retirer
                        leurs dépôts dès le lendemain.</p>
                    <p>Art 7. — Toute offre implique, de plein droit, déclaration de connaissance du
                        lot mis en vente, ainsi qu'adhésion au cahier des charges et aux
                        dispositions du présent règlement. Elle devra être pure et simple ; l'offre
                        qui exprime­rait une modalité serait considérée comme non avenue. Elle devra
                        contenir une élection de domicile à Alexandrie, si l'enchérisseur ou
                        sou­missionnaire n'y demeure pas. De même, l'en­chérisseur devenu
                        adjudicataire, devra, s'il cesse de demeurer à Alexandrie, faire et
                        com­muniquer une élection de domicile en la dite ville. Faute de ce faire et
                        dans ces deux hypo­thèses, toute notification sera, de pacte express,
                        valablement faite par la Municipalité, au greffe du tribunal mixte ou
                        indigène d'Alex­andrie, selon la nationalité.</p>
                    <p>Art. 8.— Les acheteurs en commun, quelle que soit la quote-part de chacun
                        d'eux, seront solidaires les uns des autres pour l'exécution de toutes les
                        conditions de l'adjudication, et considérés comme une seule partie
                        contrac­tante.</p>
                    <p>Art. 9.— Les séances d'enchères ou d'ou­verture des soumissions auront lieu à
                        la Muni­cipalité au plus tôt trente jours après la publication des avis.
                        Elles seront présidées par le Vice-Président de la Commission, eu par le
                        Conseiller qui le suppléera, assisté de l'Admi­nistrateur. L'adjudication
                        sera faite au profit du plus offrant ; au cas de plusieurs offres égales, il
                        sera tiré au sort, séance tenante.</p>
                    <p>Art. 10.— Dans les cinq jours qui suivront, l'adjudicataire devra payer lé
                        solde du premier terme, et consigner le montant des droits de
                        transcription.</p>
                    <p>Art. 11.-- Il devra être passé acte authentique des ventes, aux Irais de
                        l'acheteur, dans le mois qui suivra le paiement du solde du 1er terme.</p>
                    <p>Les actes de vente ne pourront être dressés qu'au nom de l'adjudicataire, à
                        moins que celui-ci n'ait déclaré, au moment de la vente, qu'il agissait en
                        qualité de mandataire et qu'il n'ait, en justifiant de cette qualité, fait
                        connaitre le nom de son mandant, dont mention sera faite au procès-verbal
                        d'adjudication.</p>
                    <p>Art. 12.—Les paiements doivent être faits à la Caisse Municipale où les fonds
                        sont porta­bles. Au cas de non paiement exact et intégral du premier terme,
                        dans le délai fixé à l'art 10, la Municipalité aura la faculté soit de
                        considérer la vente comme définitivement résolue de plein droit, sans besoin
                        de mise en demeure, et, en ce cas, le cautionnement deviendra la pro­priété
                        de la Commission, à titre d'indemnité de résiliation d'après la présente
                        clause pénale, soit de remettre le lot en vente, dans les mêmes formes, aux
                        frais et pour compte de l'adjudica­taire, qui sera tenu de la différence
                        d'avec le prix net d'adjudication et ses intérêts à quatre pour cent sur la
                        totalité de ce prix, soit enfin, de poursuivre par les voies ordinaires
                        l'exécu­tion des obligations de l'acheteur et, en ce der­nier cas, l'intérêt
                        de retard courra de plein droit à sa charge au taux de cinq pour cent.</p>
                    <p>Au cas de retard dans le paiement de l'un des dix termes subséquents, dont le
                        montant est également portable à la Caisse Municipale, l'intérêt de retard
                        courra également de plein droit à cinq pour cent, sans préjudice des droits
                        fixés par les art. 413 du Code Civil, et 334 du Code Civil Indigène.</p>
                    <p>Art. 13.— L'Administration consignera le terrain à l'adjudicataire dès le
                        paiement du solde du 1er terme. Les bornes seront aux frais des
                        acheteurs.</p>
                    <p>Les procès-verbaux de consignation seront faits en double, et seront signés
                        par les </p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>adjudicataires ou leurs représentants, ainsi que par les agents chargés de la
                        consignation. Au cas où l'adjudicataire ne se présenterait pas, quoi­que
                        invité, pour recevoir la consignation, le procès-verbal signé par les seuls
                        agents de l'Administration vaudra délivrance définitive et consignation.</p>
                    <p>Art. 14.— Si le mesurage fait lors de la con­signation fait ressortir une
                        différence de conte­nance, soit en plus, soit en moins, avec la con­tenance
                        indiquée sur l'avis de mise en vente, le prix de vente sera augmenté ou
                        diminué proportionnellement à la différence en plus ou en moins.</p>

                    <p>(Aujourd' hui à midi et demie)</p>
                    <p>Aujourd'hui les valeurs égyptiennes sont en baisse à Londres. La Banque
                        Nationale, entre autres, perd 1 livre en tombant d'un seul coup de 28 1/4 à
                        27 1/4. La raison de cette dégringolade provient d'importants ordres de
                        ventes transmis du Caire à Londres. On veut,parait-il, se défaire ici des
                        titres égyptiens pour em­ployer ses capitaux en fonds d'Ètat Étrangers qui
                        vont sûrement hausser en prévision de la paix.</p>
                    <p>Aussi toute la cote est-elle en baisse sur notre place. Pour ne citer que les
                        principales valeurs, la Banque Nationale tombe à 27 3/16, l'Agricole à 11
                        1/4, la Daïra à 25 1/16, la Delta Light à 14 3/8...</p>
                    <p>On croit que le marché reprendra bientôt.</p>
