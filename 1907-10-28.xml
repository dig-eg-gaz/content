                        (on Railway) to Troodos. At Famagusta may be seen the fine old Latin
                        Cathedral (now a mosque) begun in 1300 and finished in 1312, together with
                        other ancient ruins and the Venetian fortifications, the finest in the
                        world. Also the tower or palace, the scene of "Othello'' and of Ford's
                        "Lover's Melancholy.'' The climate of Cyprus in the winter months is
                        delightful and the Island will well repay a visit.</p>

                        Cook &amp; Son, Egypt, or from the General Manager Railways, Famagusta. G.

                    <p>'"The-contradictions in the news from India this week have been very
                        remarkable," said the "Manchester Guardian" on Oct. 5, "and it was eee more
                        important than now, when the English people have need to be forming some
                        views about our future policy 'there, that we should have news that will not
                        subside when we begin to build upon it. .</p>
                    <p>"What Mr. Keir Hardie really said we know from his own telegram to the "Daily
                        Mail," from &amp; telegram sent by the Calcutta corres- pondent of the
                        "Tribune," and. also from 'telegram published from Reateér's correspon- dent
                        to-day. He had drawn a parallel between the Bengal Government and that of
                        Russia only in so far as concerned the ubiquity of the</p>
                    <p>police and the suppression of public meetings ; the parallel' with Armenia
                        had to do solely</p>
                    <p>with the violation of Hindu women by Moham- medan rowdies ; and as for
                        colonial government, he had said that that was the ultimate goal, not an
                        immediate object. or right. These ex- . planations may not make Mr. Keir
                        Hardie's speech discreet, but they acquit him of using wild words and
                        rhetorical exaggeration. "Reuter's corréspondent eithet did not know the
                        context of Mr. Hardie's parallels or deli- berately suppressed it, in which
                        case'he was. inflaming English opinion ; and, what is moré, when Mr. Hardie
                        returned to Calcutta he was so careless.or 80 prejudiced that he again
                        'neglected to give the context, and represented Mr. Hardie's explanations as
                        an exultant justification. Nor is this the first time by any means that
                        Reuter's correspondent has been accused of political misrepresentation ; it
                        is not long since we published a letter from six Caloutta editors pom
                        phainitk ofthe prejudiced character of his news ; but this particular ins-
                        tance, being a personal and simple one, is particularly instructive. It
                        shows that Reuter's correspondent is aman who sees only two' colours, black
                        and white,and that his telegrams are, therefore, not to be trusted asa
                        founda- | tion for judgments in politics, whose colours, |i in India, as
                        here, are mostly greys and browns. - "This is a very serious matter indeed,
                        for Reuter's telegrams are the only materials for opinon on Indian affairs
                        that most people have, and they are thé telegrams mainly read, largely
                        because the Agency has the reputation | of being concerned with the
                        dissemination only of. news, and not of views. When an obijoully tendencious
                        telegram appears iti &amp; strong party organ the reader is on his gttard,
                        and has a | chance of correcting the perspective. The | announcement that a
                        telegram comes through | Reater's 4 Agency gives no such warning, but lulls
                        suspicion. ~ "The country is, in fact, in danger of having</p>
                    <p>F its opinions.on ute warped by a slow, steady drip of prejudiced news,,as it
                        was in Sonth</p>
                    <p>Africa, In South Africa the problem of news</p>
                    <p>collecting was excessively difficult, for the</p>
                    <p>whole business was in the hands of a wealthy body of men who were determided.
                        thet there | should be no reconciliation, and the home Government was more
                        or less in sympathy with them. The conditions are surely not so-bad in
                        India, 'nor is the India Office committed to a policy which would make
                        satisfaction of legiti- mate Indian demands impossible...... | "Reuters
                        Calcutta sBrfeatoodont to-day," 'continued the "Manchester Guardian," in its
                        | issue of Oct. 7, "sends an explanation of his ees messages on Mr. Keir
                        Hardie's . 8 peech last week. He says that thé statements were NA ieoaied
                        absolutely without qualification {in the "Statesman," and _"'Bengalee,"
                        andother papers. That, ifttue, might be held to justify | his first
                        telegram, which was given on the authority of the Bengali papers ; on the
                        other | side, it would have been only fair to Mr. Keir | Hardie to have
                        waited for confirmation of these reports before sending a telegram which he
                        | must have known would greatly agitate opinion tin England. . : . This
                        illustrates our point of ' Saturday that Reuter's cotrespondent showed '
                        himself a good advocate, but a bad reporter. ' He can please himself whether
                        he believe' Mr. | Hardie or not, but he must also have the good- ness to'let
                        other people' have a chance of pleas- 'ing themselves too ; and his business
                        was to report what Mr. Keir Hardie himself said he | said, especially as he
                        had got Mr. Hardie into trouble by reporting pret other people said he
                        said."</p>

                    <p>Our readers will; we.think, be better able to 'understand and appreciate this
                        great ce- remony if we give afew interesting particulars connected with its
                        history. To begin with, London's "Roll of Fame," as all know, dates back
                        from ancient times, but our purpose will be, served if we confine our
                        selection therefrom within the past century or so. The first name. that
                        comes to our notice is that,of his Royal Highness the Prince Regent,
                        afterwards George the Fourth, Then, later in 1840, the much lamented Prince
                        Consort became the recipient of the honour, and in course of time his Royal
                        Highness's four sons, the Prince.of Wales, now our Gracious King Edward the
                        Seventh, the Duke of Edinburgh, the Duke of Connaught, and the late Duke of
                        Albany took up their freedom by patrimony—that is, on attaining their
                        majority they exercised their right to be énrolled as-the sons of a Freeman;
                        their cousin, the Duke of Cambridgeraleo having done so in 1857. The names
                        which next come to our notice are those of great warriors, Lord Nelson,
                        Captain Thomas Hardy, Vice-Admiral Lord Collingwood, The Duke of Wellington,
                        Lord Napier of Magdala, Lord Wolseley, and Lord Kitchener. Of famous
                        statesmen we find the names of William Pitt, afterwards Earl of Chatbam, and
                        in 1784 that of his son the Rt. Hon, William Pitt, who at the age of 24 had
                        been installed as Premier and Chan- ceellor of the Exchequer, of England,

                    <p>An interesting episode is connected with the, conferment of the honour upon
                        Lord Nelsoti, After the victorious ending of the Battle of the Nile, Admiral
                        Nelson forwarded to the. Lord Mayor of London the sword surrendered by the
                        Commanding French Admiral Blanquet, with a letter in which he said that,
                        having the honour of being a Freeman of the City of Lon- don, he offered the
                        sword to the Lord Mayor, and requested that the City would honour him by
                        accepting it, "'as a remembrance that Bri- tannia still rules the waves",
                        adding "which thatshe. may ever do is the prayer of your lordship's most
                        obedientservant, Horatio Nel- son." The letter is addressed from "Vangoard",
                        Mouth of the Nile, August 8th, 1798.</p>
                    <p>There are four methods by which the Free- dom can be acquired (1) by
                        patrimony ; the sons of Freemen being entitled, on attaining their majority,
                        to be enrolled as a matter of right ; (2) by apprentieeship to a master who
                        is 'already a aan: (3) by purchase ; and (4) by gift conferrered by the
                        Corporation, hon- oris causa, This latter is only granted in recognition of
                        very distinguished ,public servi- ces. 'The bestowment of the Freedom is
                        still carried ont according to ancient ceremonial, although this is somewhat
                        modified in the case of ordinary admissions. Six citizens, usually selected
                        from the Chairmen of Com- mittees éf the Corporation, give -their testi-
                        mony to the fitness of the person about to be honoured with the Freedom,
                        stating that he is "a man of good name and fame; that he does not desire the
                        Freedom of this City whereby to defraud the,King or this City of their
                        rights, customs, or advantages, but that he will pay his scot and bear his.
                        lot; and so they all say."</p>
                    <p>A few facts concerning the Court of Com- mon Council, which has the exclusive
                        right of conferring the honorary' Freedom of the City may not be
                        inappropriate. The Coun- cil consists of 206 members, and shares with the
                        Court of Aldermen, which numbers 26 members, the responsibility, under the
                        Lord Mayor, of the government of the City of London.</p>
                    <p>The Court is entrusted with the manage- ment of the finances and estates of
                        the Cor- poration, .glects most of the officials, and controls the police.
                        The City also elects a Sheriff of Middlesex as well as of London, and the
                        Lord Mayor is elected by the Trade Guilds in Common Hall from among the
                        Aldermen who have served as Sheriffs.</p>
                    <p>The Court of Aldermen is of very ancient origin, the first mention of such a
                        Court being found in'an ancient chronicle, where the writer —himself an
                        Alderman—says; lp the year <cb n="3"/> 1200 were chosen fiye and twenty of
                        the more discreet men of the City, and sworn to take counsel on behalf of
                        the City, together with the Mayor."</p>
                    <p>The City appears to have been governed by the Court of Aldermen before the
                        Common Council was-in existance. The earliest known list of members of this
                        Council is found in the City Archives about the date 1285. </p>
                    <p>The Guildhall, where this very interesting ceremony takes place to-day, is

                        greater part of the old building which was damaged in the great fire of
                        London in 1666, and was rebuilt by Dance in 1798.</p>
                    <p>The resolution that the Freedom be conferred upon Lord Cromer was passed at a
                        meeting of the Cort of Common Council held on the 31st of May last, and was
                        in the following terins :—</p>
                    <p>"Resolved that the Freedom of the City in a snitable gold box be presented to

                        recognition of the long avd eminent public services he has rendered to bis

                        the represntative of the British Goveroment in the ancient and historic land
                        of Egypt". .</p>
                    <p>This was moved by Mr; J. W. Domoney, Chief Commoner, and Chairman of the City
                        Lands Committee, who paid a warm tribute to the work carried out by Lord
                        Cromer. He said that the services rendered by Lord Cromer during his
                        twenty-five years' labours in Egypt were 'quite outside ordinary
                        circumstances, and deserved the greatest recoguition that could be béstowed.
                        It was twenty-five years since Sir</p>
                    <p>Evelyn Baring went to Egypt. On his arrival</p>
                    <p>he found.the place in a great «state of chaos, when he left it its
                        administration and poliey—</p>
                    <p>owing to his wise' and admirable work—were secure and lasting. His
                        straightforward dealing and impartiality in. all his relations with the
                        natives accounted for his cnormovs influence</p>
                    <p>over them. Sir George Faudel-Phillips, in seconding the</p>
                    <p>resolution, said Lord Cromer would go down</p>
                    <p>to history as one of our great pro-consuls, ranking with such men as Lord
                        Clive. He was not born to greatness, but he was aman who, having great
                        opportunities, made great epochs in our national history. There was nothing
                        which could redound to the interest of. this great Empire and add more to
                        its reputation and glory than whathad been done in Egypt. Instead of that
                        country being, as it now is, amongst the most civilised parts of the- globe,
                        it was not too much to say that it would be in the hands of ignorant and
                        despotic rulers, with the result that the trouble to Europe would be
                        irreparable. Lord Cromer had won the con- fidence of men whose only
                        previous' expe-</p>
                    <p>'riences @f government were a tradition, and</p>
                    <p>knowledge of. cruelty and. oppression which terrified them—he had first won
                        their confi- denee and then their goodwill. They werd} voting that day to

                        wonder- fal'service—a service which had been recognis- ed not only by the
                        people of this country, but by the civilised nations of the world:</p>
                    <p>The notion was then put and carried una- nimously and with acclamation, and
                        it was referred to the City Lands Committee to make the necessary

                    <p>There is something superb in the spectacle</p>
                    <p>of a dying soldier who, while knowing that his:</p>

                    <p>ing such attacks as he is able, until at last the | fatal thrust reachés him,
                        and he falls a martyr to his country, leaving a name to be honoured</p>
                    <p>'even by the opposing. forces which took his] j</p>
                    <p>life. But let us imagine that daring the mom- ents of his last stand, he had
                        filled the with the sound of vain- -glorious. boasting, with a ceaseless
                        song of self praise "behold me I diea martyr to the country which 'I love so
                        well, through all the ages shall my name be] cherished as that of the
                        noblest martyr, the most wonderful patriot 'that the world has ever known":

                        unmixed with contempt. Let us sup that a man whom the world had long since
                        ceased to take seriously, whose power, iff he was really ever possessed with
                        any, had de</p>
                    <p>ed, let us picture him as striving for the adu ation of the people.He rises

                        supremely ridiculous.</p>
                    <p>- But this is all by the way. I had intended writing of the great speech,
                        made by our great " Director" on the twenty-second day. -of October, i in
                        the year of our Lord one thousand</p>
                    <p>nine hundred and seven. ""Qur Director" was great, there can be no</p>
                    <p>doubt as to that, and from the tangled mass of:</p>
                    <p>controversy which fell from. his august lips I gather the knowledge that;
                        half blinded by the spirit of true patriotism though he -may be, his vision
                        is still sufficiently clear to enable him to see and appreciate his own
                        greatness, equally with the lesser mortals who look up to him with
                        veneration from the street. Some have even gone as far as to suggest that he
                        is of more importance in his own eyes than he is in the eyes of others, but
                        this is no isolated instance of where the ignorance of the common</p>
                    <p>herd has robbed genius of immediate re-</p>
                    <p>cognition. The details of his speech are by this time</p>
                    <p>familiar to all. Every one who could read, rich and poor, lowly and great,
                        expended his half piastre and secured, through the medium of the press, the
                        priceless utterances of a great man. Indeed it is safe to assert that such
                        was thestir causedby the great event, that even Panch" in the brightest days
                        ofits zenith, was never read with more avidity than was the great organ of
                        'the National movement yesterday. "Garlands of flowers" we read, were
                        presented to the great man at the conclusion of his wonderful eff rt. Even
                        Gladstone in all his glory never a to this, but here is an orator who has
                        ascend with one bound to tho giddy heights of fam hitherto sacred to an Edna
                        May or Phyllis Dar</p>
                    <p>It is a pleasant suggestion truly that halfa life mis.spent entitles aman to
                        perfecthappiness for the remainder of his days, and this at least is the
                        inference I draw from the remarks anent 'the centuries which "our Director"
                        accuses the Egyptians of havingwasted. He asserts that by reason of these
                        mis-spent centuries Egypt is now entitled to immediate and prolonged
                        happiness. May the happiness be both im- mediate and prolonged, Director,
                        but forgive me if I cannot quite follow your argument.</p>
                    <p>It is certainly most annoying when one has spent both time and money (no
                        matter whose) in the making of a party which is destined' in</p>

                        considér them- selves oppressed ; it is more than annoying, it is
                        heart-rending, -to find the chosen legion of the oppressed refusing point,
                        blank to act in the roll allotted to them, and' accusing the month-piece of
                        uttering false echos ; therefore one is not surprised to find that the
                        "Director" should wax indignant, and reiterate his appeal that there should
                        be but one party—his own—</p>
                    <p>and but one leader —himself. And why should the fortune hunting English</p>

                    <p>No further light has been thrown upon the reasons which prompted two of the
                        students, who were sent to England by the Ministry of Public Instrnction, to
                        leave their college witbout warning, and to dispatch the cable to the
                        Ministry which has led to their immediate discharge. The first news which
                        the Ministry received of this foolish action, came from the youtks
                        themselves, in the form of a telegram, in which they stated that it was
                        impossible for them to remain longer at the college and had gone to
                        Nottingham, where they were awaiting orders to return to Egypt, or in the
                        event of such orders not being forthcoming they would consider themselves
                        discharged. </p>
                    <p>On receipt of this telegram the Ministry cabled to Eogland to the principal
                        of the col. lege which the boys had left, and were informed that they had
                        refused to give any reason for their conduct, only saying that it was
                        iínpossible for them to remain longer in the place. The Ministry, very
                        justly considering this action and the cable addressed to them. selves as
                        onwarrantable impertinence, cabled after due consideration, to the effect
                        that the boys were discharged, and they are now negotiating for the filling
                        of their places by two fresh students who, it is to be hoped, will be imbued
                        with a little more respect for the Ministry which has taken their welfare in

                    <p>A The sudden death of Dr. Garner, which we announced on Saturday, came as a

                        known that he was unwell, his illness only dating from Tuesday evening last.
                        Coming to Egypt in 1899, when he joined the Sanitary Department, Dr. Garner
                        was subsequently recommended by his Department to the British Government for

                        attacked by a severe form of scurvey, and it was mainly due to the plack,
                        skill, and endurance displayed by Dr. Garner that the expedition did not end </p>
                    <p>fatally. | Since his return to Egypt he has been </p>
                    <p>actively engaged in the usual work of his department in the provinces, and
                        was for the last two years specially engaged in fighting the plague in Upper
                        Egypt, and it was his indefatigable work in this direction that we I fear
                        led to the undermining of his constitution in the first place. </p>
                    <p>Much of Dr. Garner's work had centred ronnd Tantab and Zagazig. He was
                        well-known throughout Egypt, and it may be truly said that he did not
                        possess a single enemy in the country, while his death at the early age of
                        forty-one, will be lamented by all who came in contact with the charm of his
                        personality. </p>

                    <head> SAFT EL MELOUK ACCIDENT. EXPLANATIONS OF DELAY. </head>
                    <p>The official report on the acoident which ocourred on the Cairo-Alexandria
                        line on Friday last, and which occasioned such prolonged delay, are not yet
                        to be seen, and it is therefore difficult to ascertain if the delay of four
                        hours was justified by circumstances. It appears that there were two
                        accidents of a different nature at or near the same spot during the one day.
                        Our Cairo correspondent now writes that, as already reported, the first of
                        these was occasioned by the night mail from Cairo being derailed by a bale
                        of cotton which had fallen from an earlier train, and thereby blocked both
                        up and down lines. A reljet train was sent for, but it was not until 7.30
                        a.m., wher the lines were just cleared, that this train arrived, too late to
                        be of any assistance, and the ordinary train proceeded to Alexandria. </p>
                    <p>The accident occurred at 3.14 a.m. and at a point on the road which is
                        almost at the maximum distance from a breakdown station. It would therefore
                        scem that, provided that the necessary celerity was used in the despatching
                        of telegrams etc. for the relief and taking into consideration the
                        difficulties of time and place the delay was not inordinate. </p>
                    <p>The second accident, caused by six trucks of cotton becoming ignited on the
                        track, occurred at 12.85 p.m. and was responsible for the second delay in
                        the traffic, as it was not considered safe to run a train past the flaming
                        waggons, even though the track was clear. </p>

                    <p>The Sudan is certainly an unfavourable I place for would-be absconders. No

                    <p>A recent incident clearly illustrates this fact. Two persons, we are told,

                            Tuesday. Herr Harden's counsel contended that Count se compelled him to
                            take action. Herr Ha a speech denied that the articles in the 'Zukuft",
                            were aimed at Count Moltke, He said that Prince Enlenburg's retarn'to
                            Germany necessitated the resumptioh of the articles. A camarilla's
                            influence with the Emperor had led to the resignation of Bismarck and
                            Caprivi's fall was due to Prince Eulenburg. Prince Buelow was Prince
                            Eulenburg's creation but was now his bitterest enemy. The Morocco affair
                            was due to Prince Eulenburg's influence. ~ Leaving the court Herr Harden
                            was ovated : Count Moltke was protected by the police. (Reuter)</p>

                    <head>OF INTEREST TO WOMEN.</head>
                    <p>Many so called women's complaints can be traced to disorders -ot the liver,
                        stomach and bowels. A woman's work is more or léss sedentary ; she does not
                        get the fresh air, the exercise, or the regular hours of rest that a man
                        does, so that the liver becomes sluggish, the system does not get the rest
                        it needs, and there is nota regular motion of the bowels. Constipation is
                        one of the worst dangers a woman has to fear, and the longer it is neg-
                        lected, the moe deeply rooted. 3 it becomes. The bowels'are swollen arid
                        enlarged, thus displacing members of the female organism, and causing
                        ,stomach pains, difficulty in breathing, windy: spasins, headache, vomiting,
                        a feeling of fulness after meals, bloodlessness, etc. But men who are
                        constipated suffer from these same symptoms, so that it cannot be female
                        trouble. When the constipation is cured, the distressing complaints will
                        quickly disappear. Doan's Dinner Pills give tone and new vigour to the
                        muscular walls of the colon, and soften. the mass of waste matter, so that
                        the . bowels act naturally, and discharge the clogging impurities. A box of
                        Doan's Dinner Pills should always be kept in the house, and a dose taken
                        when the bowels have been inactive, or whenever food disagrees, or when
                        there is afeeling of heaviness'and discomfort in the region of the stomach.
                        This medicine is purely vegetable, and perfectly harmless for menor women,
                        young and old.</p>
                    <p>The sufferer from "habitual" constipation should take a regular walk

                        Doan's Dinner Pills are 'being used, but afterwards, then no return of the
                        disorder need be feared. : - Doan's, Dinner Pills are the best medicine for

                            ni le dégoût ni la fatigue, parce que, à l'opposé des autres purgatifs,
                            celui-ci n'opère bien que lorsqu'il est pris avec de bons aliments et
                            des boissons fortifiantes, telles que vin, café, thé. Chacun choisit,
                            pour se purger, l'heure et le repas qui lui conviennent le mieux, selon
                            ses occupations. La fatigue de la purgation étant annulée par l'effet de
                            la bonne alimentation, on se décide aisément à recommencer autant de
                            fois que cela est nécessaire.</p>
