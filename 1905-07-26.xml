                            the presence of a large gathering of parents and friends. Mr. Vice-
                            Consul Freeman occupied the chair. An Eng- lish cantata, "Festival of
                            the Flowers,” in which each pupil represented a different flower, was
                            much appreciated. The choral singing, duets, and solos were beautifully
                            rendered, and the various "flowers" acted their parts to perfection. The
                            French pieces, La Sonambula and Froufrou, were also of an excellent
                            order, and reflect the highest credit on M. Coupson, French master.
                            Other items on the programme were an Arabic recitation and an English
                            piece by the junior pupils. The duties of accompanist were excellently
                            performed by Miss M. Gatt. Towards the end of the programme the prizes
                            were presented to successful pupils by Mrs. Freeman, whose first public
                            appearance it was. Among the prize-winners we especially noticed Miss E.
                            Samama, who, besides several other prizes, gained a handsome medal for
                            Scripture, presented by Major Allan of Glasgow. Next in order of merit
                            came Misses Jacobson and Youameidis. Thereafter Mr. Freeman, in a few
                            well-chosen remarks, congratulated Miss Hannah, M.A., head mistress, her
                            efficient staff, and the pupils themselves, on the suc cessful work done
                            daring the session, and invited the audience to inspect the needlework,

                            exhibition also showed wonderful efficiency in these branches of school
                            work. At the conclusion of the entertainment Rev. H. P. Reid proposed a
                            hearty vote of thanks to Mr. and Mrs. Freeman for their presence on this
                            occasion, which was cordially responded to.</p>

                    <head>FIGHTING THE COTON WORM. SUCCESS OF MEASURES.</head>
                    <p>The energetic measures which have been taken by the Ministry of the Interior
                        to combat the cotton worm and to check as far as possible the damage which
                        it causes to the cotton crops, are proving very successful, as the
                        considerable decrease in the area attacked during last week amply
                        demonstrates. The first brood which appeared in June has been dealt with,
                        that of July is at present being actively dealt with and has to a large
                        extent been destroyed, and the workers are now busily seeking for the eggs
                        of the third or August brood, which in previous years has always proved to
                        be the largest and has caused most damage. We understand, however, that the
                        work of the last two months has been so effective that the third brood will,
                        in all probability, be very slight, and that there is very little fear of
                        the worms appearing in large numbers.</p>
                    <p>In connection with this work, we might mention that Mr. Machell has not yet
                        fixed the date when he will go on leave, but is waiting until be can be
                        certain that there will be no re-appearance of the worm this season, when
                        the work will be practically completed. Mr. Machell has shown himself
                        indefatig- able in the way he has organised and super- intended the work for
                        the destruction of the worm, and in his personal inspection of the work done
                        in those cultivations which have suffered more severely than others.</p>

                            representing the Mu- nicipality, Mr. Williams and Mr. Acres, repre-

                            have drawn up a report on the increase of the number of bridges on the
                            Mahmondieh Canal.</p>
                        <p>The committee consider it impossible to enlarge the existing bridges and
                            recommend the construction of a new bridge linking the Sharia Shoanah el
                            Tainat with the rue du Canal Mahmondieh, east of the Fire Station. They
                            have also decided to consider the con- struction of a new bridge nearly
                            opposite the rue Tewfikieh, and to replace the Ibrahim Bridge by a new
                            bridge of greater width, the details of which will be settled as soon as
                            the new bridge is completed. In view of the con- fusion prevalent with
                            regard to the name of the bridge below the Ibrahim Bridge it was de-
                            cided to rename it the Daira Sanieh Bridge. The new bridge will be
                            called the Abbas Bridge.</p>
                        <p>The Municipality has expressed its agree- ment in principle with the
                            conclusions of the committee and has decided to submit them to the
                            Government</p>

                        <head>EGYPTIAN MINING.</head>
                        <p>In its Mining article, the "Financier" of the 17th inst says Elsewhere,
                            however, more bullish views were held, significance being attached to
                            the strong buying of Egyp- tians which took place last week. It is
                            thought, in fact, that another effort is on the tapis for bringing
                            Egyptian mining enterprises into public favor. The last move in this
                            direc- tion, it may perhaps be remembered, was hopelessly baulked by the
                            turbulent condition of politics, and since then, in company with
                            Kaffirs, prices have gradually dwindled down to what can now only be
                            described as bed- rock level. Now, with the political outlook
                            comparatively dear, and the speculating public sorely in need of a new
                            area wherein, so to speak, they can have a good run for their money, it
                            is thought the attractions of Egyp- tians are bound to claim attention.
                            It is on this assumption, at any rate, that astute and influential
                            people have been quietly acquiring lines of the leading Egyptian
                            stocks—witness the sharp advance which occurred the other day in
                            Egyptian Mines—and equally good, too, was the buying of such shares as
                            Nile Valley, Um Rus, Central Egypts and Egyptian Options, as well as
                            several of the Trust com- panies. An indication of how mining develop-
                            ments are proceeding space is contained in the circular to hand from the
                            Mysore Reefs Company, which in the autumn is forming two exploratory
                            parties for the purpose of prospecting ancient mining sites in Egypt and
                            the Sudan. This company and the Egyptian Mines, it might be mentioned,
                            are big holders in the prosperous Um Rus. Generally speak- ing, the
                            outlook for Egyptians is regarded as distinctly favorable, and the
                            opinion is strongly held that the next wave of specula- tion in mines
                            will turn in this direction.</p>

                            reports an exceedingly heavy monsoon. To the north- ward of Socotra she

                        <p>The Eastern coasts trade seems to be on the increase of late. Counting
                            the two vessels which have arrived from Hamburg and Liver- pool
                            respectively to-day, one of the Admiral class of the Hamburg-Amerika
                            line and the Kohinur, of the Asiatic (Turner Morrison) Line, no less
                            than nine ships have passed through on their maiden voyages for the
                            coast trades of China and India this month. These vessels, — as does the
                            Qaeda, the leviathan 12,000-ton ship which I referred to last week, —
                            will most likely never return to the "land of their birth” but will
                            remain per- manently on the coasts for which they are destined. The
                            Hamburg-Amerika Line has a somewhat large fleet on the China coast
                            running in opposition to the China merchants and two large British-owned

                        <p>Monday's "Official Journal” contains a long list of the successful
                            candidates in the Primary Certificate examination. Out of 3,333 can-
                            didates 1,173 passed the examination with success.Of the total of the
                            successful candidates 1,111 had taken the English and 62 the French
                            course.</p>
                        <p>The successful candidates have been grouped in two divisions. The first
                            division includes all who obtained 75 % or more of the maximum number of
                            marks obtainable, who number 180. The first name on this list is that of
                            Nessim Abd-el Sayed, of the Bab el Charieh Sobool, who obtained 140 1/4
                            marks out of 160, his average being high all through. Hamid Ahmed, of
                            the El-Tahdirieh School, is second on the list with 136 3/4, and eleven
                            other candidates have obtained over 180 marks. We notice that the 12
                            candidates on the French side who obtained marks justifying their
                            inclusion in the first division show a higher average in their marks for
                            French than the pupils who took the English coarse obtained for English.
                            Twenty girls entered for the examination, of whom 10 passed. The
                            Government schools sent up 556 boys who took the English course and 9
                            girls, one only boy taking the French course. From the free schools 497
                            boys and 1 girl entered on the English side, and 53 boys on the French.
                            48 private pupils took up Eng- lish and 8 French—all boys.</p>
                        <p>We wonder would it be possible for the Ministry of Public Instruction to
                            publish, with the lists, the religion and origin of the pupils entering
                            for the examination. Statistics showing tbh proportion of Syrian, Copt,
                            and Israelite candidates would be of considerable interest to the
                            public.</p>

                        <p>The members of the British Railway Em- ployés’ Mess held a pigeon match
                            on the sea front at Quarantine Camp on Friday, the 14th inst. There was
                            a very strong wind blowing from the north, which rather upset some of
                            the guns, and got worse towards the close of the day. Mr. Claude S.
                            Archer made very good scoring, taking 10 birds out of a possible 11, and
                            thus securing the two most important events of the day. Mr. Archer was
                            hard pressed, however, by Mr. Gaiger, who was one bird only to the bad,
                            Lost by an unlucky bird falling a few feet outside the line. Mr. Hodges,
                            under very trying circumstances, won the 3rd event. There was a very
                            large attendance and a very enjoyable afternoon was spent.</p>

                            challenge cup was a most excellent contest, Mr. Logan, who was conceding
                            14 strokes, only being defeated on the last green.</p>
