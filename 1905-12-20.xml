                    <head>FEMALE PRIMARY EDUCATION IN EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>The growing demand for female education is one of the signs of the times in 
                        Egypt, and the references to this subject in the speech pronounced by Sheikh 
                        Che rif last Sunday on the occasion of the solemn distribution of the subventions 
                        granted to the fikie and Arifs of the Cairo kuttabs deserve the special attention 
                        of all who have the welfare of the younger generation at heart We have frequently 
                        referred to the educational movement that has become widespread during the past 
                        year in the country districts as well as the towns, and we are glad to see that 
                        for the first time sines the days of Amr and the early rulers of Egypt, the 
                        Moslems of this country are bestirring themselves with a view to obtaining 
                        education for their daughters. This year no less than 10,359 girls are receiving 
                        primary instruction in the kat-tabs and there is no reason whatever for 
                        apprehending any reaction. The facts point in the other direction. The growth 
                        of education among all classes of Moslems in Egypt must inevitably cause a 
                        demand for educated wives. Men who can read and write and nave acquired a fair 
                        primary education are unlikely to rest satisfied with the knowledge that their 
                        prospective wives are illiterate and ignorant, and the better-educated are 
                        certain to demand educational facilities for girls more and more eagerly. That 
                        there are difficulties in the way is obvious enough. A mixed education of boys 
                        and girls, except the very youngest, is perhaps unsuited to the country and is 
                        certain to make many parents shy of sending their girls to school, but the 
                        Ministry of Public Instruction is taking steps to meet this difficulty. It has 
                        already made a beginning by transform ing the three Cairo kuttabs of Sheikhoun 
                        el Kebir, Saidah Zeynab, and Eabbanieh into girls' schools. Mistresses have 
                        been obtained from the Saaieh Normal School and the result of the experiment 
                        has been that a number of parents have promptly sent their daughters to. these 
                        three kattabs, among them several persons of note who were formerly most bitter 
                        opponents of female education. These three girls' kuttabs, though opened only a 
                        few months ago, already contain no less than 357 papils,—figures which augur 
                        well for the future of female education in Egypt.</p>

                        of the cart, which was heavily laden with sand. The police

                    <p>Cairo Weather.</p>
                    <p>Oar Cairo Correspondent writes under data of yesterday — We are 
                        having the first spell of real winter weather. The day has been 
                        cold, dull and cloudy. There wag a little rain in the forenoon 
                        and also in the afternoon. The prospects of to-morrow's weather 
                        for the fir-t day of the first winter meeting of the K. S. C. 
                        are not promising.</p>
                    <p>Garrison Church.</p>
                    <p>On Friday evening next, at 6 o'clock, the new organ in H.B.M.'s 
                        Garrison Church of St. George, Mustapha Pasha, will be dedicated 
                        and opened. There will be a short service and an address by the 
                        Rev. Canon Ward, M.A., chaplain of St. Mark's. Mr. Heaton, organist 
                        of St. Mark's, has kindly promised to give a recital of sacred music. 
                        All are cordially invited. The service will last about 50 minutes.</p>
                    <p>Interesting Case of Pre-emption.</p>
                    <p>A very interesting case of pre emption will in all probability come 
                        before the Cairo Mixed Courts shortly. One of the best-known hotels 
                        in the neighbourhood of Cairo was recently sold to an hotel company 
                        for £100,000 and now a claim to pre-empt has been made. Negotiations 
                        have been opened with a view to get the would be pre-emptors to abandon 
                        their claim, but it is very doubtful if they will be successful.</p>
                    <p>Sale of Work.</p>
                    <p>We are requested to draw the attention of our readers again to the sale 
                        of work which will take place at the Sailors and Soldiers' Institute 
                        to-morrow (Thursday) at 3 p.m. The band of the Royal Dublin Fusiliers 
                        will, by the kind permission of the Colonel and officers, play daring 
                        the afternoon. Anyone wishing to enjoy a pleasant hour will be heartily 
                        we!-comed without of necessity making any purchase. A fine Christmas Tree 
                        has been provided, which will doubtless prove a great attraction. Visitors 
                        are requested to Dote that the entrance will be from the side door.</p>

                    <p>DEPARTMENT OF STATE'S ACTION.</p>
                    <p>LETTER FROM MR. COPE WHITEHOUSE.</p>
                    <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                    <p>Sir,—The Department of State has instructed  the Diplomatic Agent of 
                        the United States to ascertain what evidence exists in the Departments 
                        of the Egyptian Government that I took all necessary steps to secure a 
                        concession of the Wadi Mullah; as well as of my application for the W 'di 
                        Raiyan, at a time when the Public Works Ministry denied that any such 
                        depression existed.</p>
                    <p>In 1882, papers were published by me in Paris, in the ''Revue Archdolog'que"
                        ; in London, in the "Atbei eeum" ; and in New York, in the ''Proceedings" 
                        of the American Geographical Society, with an opinion by Chi Justice Daly. 
                        It was, however, in 1883, that the "Egyptian Gazette" published a 
                        communication by Dr. Schweinfurth, which was adopted as a bulletin by the 
                        Khedivial Geographical Society, and immediately commanded the assent of the 
                        entire scientific world, with the notable exception of M. Maspero. Prior to 
                        my researches, the existence of a great Lake Moeris was universally denied, 
                        chiefly on the authority of Dr. Lepsias and the German expeditions. Dr. 
                        Lepaius explicitly stated that the Fayoum was only about 90 feet below the 
                        Nile Valley, and that the rains at Dimeh were "near" the Birket el Qerun. 
                        and below the level of low Nile. As they were, also, in his opinion, older
                        than the Fifth Century B.C., he regarded this as conclusive that the Fayoum 
                        had never been submerged within the historic period. As a matter of fact, I 
                        found, in 1882, when I employed Tristram Ellis to accompany me and verify my 
                        observations, that these rains were higher than high Nile at Beni Scef. This 
                        was published many years before the Egyptian Government authorised Sir Hanbury 
                        Brown to ran a line of levels from the Lake, over Dimeh, to the anoient temple, 
                        whose existence I had slso indicated, plainly visible trom Dimeh. therefore any 
                        attempt to take from me the credit of reopening the question of Lake Moeris, and 
                        its identfication with a submerged Fayoum, is sufficiently refated by a reference 
                        to the columns of the "Egyptian Gazette," or any of the numerous papers, written 
                        by eminent Egyptologists, prior to 1884, of which a, list can be found in my 
                        Memoir, entitled - Moeris, the Wonder of the World." Copies of this pamphlet 
                        can be found in every public library of importance. Sir Hanbury Brown's volume, 
                        with its beautiful photographs, adds nothing to what I had previously printed, 
                        except a dissentient opinon about n y identification of the Liens Meridis of the 
                        later Ptolemaic period with the Wadi Raiyan I had spent many days with Sir Hanbury 
                        Brown, and given him my pamphlets and maps, before I learned, through the inadvertent 
                        admission of his brother, that he intended to write a book, which I regarded as 
                        premature. Dr. Flinders Petrie was my engineer in two expeditions, in 1882, 
                        employed by me to secure a witness to my observations, and had no right to communicate
                        the results without my permission, much less to put himself forward as having made 
                        any original investigations. His error's in regard to the Pyramids in Lake Moeris. 
                        and the height of the ridge between the Gharag and Raiyan Basins, are suffioient to 
                        show the sources of his knowledge and his misconception of my statements, in an 
                        attempt to import into them an originality of his own of which they were not susceptible.</p>
                    <p>In 1883, I indicated to Lord Dnfferin, Gen. Sir John Ardagh, Sir Colin Scott Moncrieff, 
                        and Mr. Moberly Bell, with many others, the probable value of the Wadi Raiyan, and Sir 
                        C. C. Scott Moncrieff mentions Lake Moeris in his preliminary report on the use of the 
                        million from the guaranteed loan. In September, 1885, ' Engineering" published an exhaustive 
                        article, written by Its editor, which is the Magna Charta of the Raiyan Projeot. It
                        misleading to say, as the Public Works Ministry has done, on repeated occasions, 
                        that the Raiyan depression was mentioned by Linant de Bellefonds on his hydrographic 
                        map, prepared for Mehemet Ali. The Ain Raiyan, and the Raiyan Oases, were known to 
                        every Arab frequenting the route to the Little Oasis, and are the first camping station 
                        to the South of Gharag, but Linant expressly stated, in 1873, as I showed in try testimony 
                        before M. Boule, Sir B. Baker, and Sig. Torri-oe'li, in 1894, that he supposed that these 
                        Oases were higher than tre cultivated land of Gharag. It seems to me unworthy of a Government 
                        to repeat, again and again, since 1889, a statement, which is technically accurate (because the 
                        Wadi Raiyan is a depression), with the obvious intention of implying that every 
                        one knew that it was available as a flood escape and reservoir, although the 
                        fire-most cartographer of Egypt, Dr. Schwein-fnrth, expressly disclaimed any 
                        such knowledge in 1888, and a special meeting of The Khedivial Geographical 
                        Society had been. held to examine the evidence on which it has been placed 
                        upon the maps. It escapes the observation of these writers that Lord Cromer 
                        informed the Marquis of Salisbury, in 1887, that I had discovered "a new and 
                        unknown depression," and Col. Western describes it "discovered by Mr. Cope 
                        Whitehouse," in his official report on the Raiyan Project.</p>
                    <p>The dossier of the Wadi Muellah was in a complete and perfect state, whan it
                        was approved by Blum Pasha,, and the Hodja was submitted to the President of 
                        the Council of Ministers. It was, subsequently, seen by me In the bands of 
                        the official charged with its</p>
                <cb n="3"/>
                    <p>custody ; and Sir Eldon Gorat wrote me a letter referring to it If, therefore, 
                        it is true that it "does not exist," it has been destroyed; and the object of 
                        the instructions sent to the Diplomatic Agent of the United States is to ascertain, 
                        when and by whose orders this destruction took place. It appears from the publication
                        this year of an official report on this valley, that a stone house was in course
                        of erection, but it is not stated whether this bad been done with the sanction 
                        of the Government.</p>
                    <p>The Raiyan project is as much mine as the picture of an artist, or the manuscript 
                        of a book. In view of the necessity of changing the maps of Egypt, so as to 
                        introduce upon them the depression, it might even be said that the artist had 
                        also woven his own oanvas, or the author manufactured the paper on which he 
                        had written.</p>
                    <p>The Wadi Muellah is mine. I offered to buy it, fearing lest use might be made 
                        of it to impose some improper terms on the inhabitants ot Egypt, when the Raiyan
                        project was carried into execution. There is hieroglyphic evidenoe of a canal 
                        named Tomi leaving the Bahr Jusnf near Behnesa. But Sir C. C. Scott Moncrieff 
                        insisted upon my taking it, without the trifling fee for registration, 
                        accompanied with an exemption from taxes for ten years. I have no doubt that 
                        he intended to act fairly ; but the result shows that it would have been much 
                        hotter for me, had he contented himself with permitting the transaction to pursue
                        the ordinary course.</p>
                    <p>The two Houses of Congress will meet on the first Monday in December, and a 
                        resolution will be introduced, asking the Department of State to send to the 
                        Committees on Foreign Relations and Affairs, all the correspondence relating 
                        to the Raiyan project. A summary of what had taken place prior to 1887 was
                        published by order of Congress in that year. The statement made, according 
                        to the former Diplomatic Agent, now Minister to Servia, by His Majesty's 
                        Diplomatic Agent and Consul-General that, if Mr. Cope White-house attempted 
                        to form a company, (in the United States) and proceeded to execute the projeot 
                        himself, he would be prevented by the authorities, seems to require explanation. 
                        At all events the Raiyan sluiceways would have been made at any time, since 1883, 
                        without any other cost to Egypt than the bare expenditure, to be repaid out of 
                        profits. It was declared feasible for £4.500,000 in the Parliamentary Report of 
                        1891 ; and the American group stood ready to undertake it a year ago, withoat 
                        any remuneration to my self beyond the satisfaction of knowing that, at last, 
                        it would be done.</p>

                    <p>WHY OTTOMANS SHUN EGYPT.</p>
                    <p>(From our own Correspondent).</p>
                    <p>Constantinople, Dec. 13.</p>
                    <p>It is amusing to note the way in which Egypt is placed on the Index 
                        Expnrgatorius of the Sublime Porte, save for its spies, of whom 
                        there must be a large number at Cairo. Egypt has always been a sore
                        point with the Saltan, especially when he hears its perfect 
                        administration compared with that of Turkey, its nominal Suzerain. 
                        Not an Ottoman dare visit Egypt without fear of the immediate 
                        confiscation of his property and a summons issued for his prompt 
                        return—that is, should he have gone without a passport, to obtain 
                        which is an impossibility as far as Misr is concerned. Thus the Turks 
                        who flee to Cairo do so as voluntary exiles—to return would mean 
                        imprisonment. A Turkish official of good standing told the writer the 
                        other day that although on his way to Kanavan (he is a Sanitary Inspector)
                        he passes Port Said, he would no more think of breaking the tedious journey - 
                        and it is tedious on board a Mahsnsseh steamer—by running up to Cairo than he
                        would of occupying the Throne of the Caliphate.</p>
                    <p>Young Turks.</p>
                    <p>Of course there is a great mass of the Turkish population which is totally 
                        indifferent and happy, which vegetates rather than lives ; hut there is also 
                        an intellectual party, wrongly styled the Young Turk Party, who, having a 
                        glimpse of European civilization as reflected by the foreign social life, 
                        positively loathe their present miserable existence, which debars them from 
                        the joys of intellectual refinement because their imperfect education unfits 
                        them for life abroad, should ever they get away. In Egypt, however, according
                        to all reports, these fugitives seem to get on better, as they have relatives
                        or friends to hack them np, and there are not a few, mostly Army men, who 
                        are doing f drly well in the Khediviate.</p>
                    <p>Egyptian Independence.</p>
                    <p>Although nominally under Turkish rule the Egyptian Princes, Princesses, 
                        Beys, and others who prefer the Bosphorus to the Nile as a summer or permanent
                        residence, enjoy all the political privileges of foreign colonists ; the Porte
                        takes care not to meddle with them, and recognises them as a nation apart, so 
                        much so that the mails of the Khedivah Mother arriving from Egypt are sent direct
                        to her place at Bebek instead of running the gauntlet of the Turkish Post Office.</p>

                    <p>Bebek, a picturesque and thoroughly Turkish village. on the European shore of the 
                        Bospborus, about half-way up the stream, has always been favorite resort for the 
                        Egyptian official world, ever since the days of the late Halim Pasha, whose enormous,
                        ramshackle wool-built yali is next to the Rhedivah's Palace. This Khedivah's 
                        Palace fronts the sea ; it is built entirely of cement, even to the piling 
                        which supports it on the water side. This firm of con struction was very 
                        tedious, as each piece had to be separately moulded. The Palace contains 75 rooms,
                        including an odg akuhan sati, or chapel, the Khedivah being very pious, as well 
                        as charitable. The Imam, a very fine-looking Egyptian, occupies a large and handsome
                        wooden residence in the grounds, which are separated from the Palace premises by 
                        the public road, the connection being made by two Covered in ways, that have all
                        the appearance of the famous Bridge of the Rialto. Behind the Imam's house is 
                        an electric installation, which, driven by an engine of 45 H. P., supplies the
                        four hundred and odd lamps of the Palace. The household includes a staff of 
                        fourteen Ethiopians ; besides there are quite a host of cooks and lackeys, 
                        who are under the charge of Ali Bey, the Kilardji Bashi. The female department
                        is ruled by a German lady, a very excellent person, who. however, has the 
                        greatest difficulty in keeping peace bet ween the domestics. I forgot to 
                        say that the rooms are tiled throughout and are absolutely impervious to 
                        damp. The hill rising somewhat abruptly above the Palace is densely wooded,
                        and the ascent is made by a well levelled path zigzagging to the top, where
                        there is a fairy-like kio quo shaded by a pine g ove. On such grand
                        occasions as the Sultan's Accession Day, the Palace and grounds are
                        resplendent with illuminations, the inscription "Padishahim Ichok
                        yaaha" (Long life to my Sultan),in bold letters, crowning the hill
                        just in front of the kiosqae. The Palace gardens are thrown open to
                        the public, and the visitors, be they Turk, Greek, or American, are
                        hospitably entertained.</p>
                    <p>The Khedivah is a warm-hearted Turcophile, and it may not be out of
                        place here to mention that the present excellent relations existing
                        between Turkey and Egypt are largely the outcome of the wise policy 
                        of the Khedive. Bebek is, praotioally speaking, a dependency of
                        the Khedive h's Palace; at least nearly all the workpeople and
                        trade-men are at the be à and calf of her Highness, who owns about
                        helf the village, where a number of her retainers are in permanent
                        residence. By the bye, I hear that she will come back to the Bosphorus
                        from Egypt much earlier than usual this coming spring, Besides this
                        Palace at Bebek, the Khedivial family has a residence at Tohihakii,
                        on the Asiatic coast higher up, and the son of the Ute Halim Pasha
                        lives at Yentkim. They have also a Tekke at Yeni Djami Stamboul, 
                        molding other properties, rot the least historical of which is
                        Bulwer's Isle, with its sham castle and library. This building,
                        converted into a farm house by a pair of bronze-faced Kelats
                        was badly damaged the earthquake of 1894. It was sold by
                        Henry Bulwer to the Khedive Ismail for  L.T. 30,000,</p>

                    <p>ADVERSE COMMENT OF NATIVE PRESS</p>
                    <p>"Al Moayad" has some comments on the addresses of the sheikhs
                        of Alexandria, which were delivered in the mosque on Friday
                        last in the interests of public tranquillity. Our
                        vernacular contemporary remarks :—</p>
                    <p>"Considerable responsibility rests with some one for calling
                        upon the religions sheikhs to preach in the mosques advising
                        people to avoid disturbances, and the Governor of Alexandria
                        would not have undertaken this serious step had he not been 
                        authorised by the Government to do so. But requiring the 
                        sheikhs to exercise their religious influence in such a 
                        matter is tantamount to an acknowledgment on the part of the
                        Government that religious fanaticism does exist among the 
                        Moslems and that it takes every precaution to suppress 
                        such fanaticism."</p>
                    <p>Among the precautionary measures in case of any disturbance
                        at Alexandria at the end of last week, we may mention that
                        a number of the Mounted Military Police, under the command
                        of Captain Protheroe Smith, were held in readiness to leave
                        Cairo at a moment's notice for Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>The precautions that were taken by Lewa Mansfield Pasha, the
                        Commandant of the Cairo City Police, were excellent, and the
                        Commandant deserves to be congratulated on the fact that his
                        efforts have been in every respect successful. The Sheiks el 
                        Hara were ordered to prevent any gathering of persons in the 
                        streets and their orders were rigorously carried out It is 
                        considered in Cairo that a similar system should have been 
                        organised in Alexandria by the police, thereby preventing 
                        the sadden gathering of a huge mass of people in Mohamed 
                        Aly Square on Sunday week.</p>

                    <head>ZIZINIA THEATRE</head>
                    <p>Signs. Bellincioni scored another big success in her last 
                        night's performance of Traviata, and played to a large and 
                        very enthusiastic audience, on whom none of her points of 
                        excellence were lost. Albeit we have witnessed the diva's 
                        far-reaching powers in Toeca and Fedora and upon other 
                        occasions, we confess we were astonished at the utter change 
                        of dramatic colouration with which she can infuse her style.
                        The plaintive sadness which she presented last night seemed 
                        to us all the more remarkable when contrasted with Tosoa's 
                        wild raving or the more determinate passion ot Fedora. It 
                        was perhaps her admirable rendering of the noble aria and 
                        brilliant allegro in Act I. which stirred her audience 
                        most. Acts II. and III. abound in exquisite duets with 
                        Alfredo and with his father, and, needless to say, 
                        full justice was done to them, while her death scene in 
                        the last act was in every way a masterpiece. The part of 
                        Alfredo was taken by Sig. Angiolo Bendinelli, whom we heard 
                        last night fer the first time, and whose voice is soft and 
                        expressive, with adequate, though not very powerful range. 
                        His handling of the part showed taste and sensibility and 
                        did much to deserve the applause which was liberally 
                        bestowed on him. Sig. Giovanni Polese gave a good account
                        of the role of Germont pere, which he interpreted with 
                        discretion and refinement. The minor parts were all capably 
                        filled. The facile old-world music of Traviata did not 
                        impose very heavy duties on Sig. Zuccani and his orchestra, 
                        though he made excellent use of every opportunity, and 
                        in particular gave an essentially artistic rendering 
                        of the gentle overture to Act III. The chorus, especially 
                        the women's, again fell rather short Of the mark': 
                        when it was not hurried and unbalanced, it was mechanical and heavy.</p>

                    <dateline>London, December 19.</dateline>
                    <p>Speaking at Leeds, Mr. Balfour said that the fiscal differences 
                        between Unionists have been greatly exaggerated, and that whether
                        protec tion was right or wrong, his polioy of retaliation was without
                        prejudice to it. His view was that protection is alien to the Im perial
                        idea. In reference to preference, it was impossible to jadge the
                        harden might impose till the whole scheme shall be developed and
                        discussed at a Colonial confer* once. He therefore appealed for a
                        suspension of judgment on this question. In any case Liberal
                        projects were already authoritatively announced, especially Homs 
                        Kile. This should be quite sufficient to cause the Unionist ranks
                        to rally.</p>

                    <p>AS A PUBLIC PARK.</p>
                    <p>Some divergence of views exists in the Public Works Ministry on 
                        the subject of fete in the Esbekieh Gardens. Mr. Perry, in his 
                        recently-issued report on these gardens, says:</p>
                    <p>"It is quite impossible to keep this garden in a proper state 
                        unless Government ceases to permit public fetes to be held here.</p>
                    <p>"I would strongly urge that all fetes be held in the Finance garden 
                        at Ghezireh, which does not, like the Esbekieh garden, contain rare 
                        botanical specimens, and constitutes the single lung of a large city."</p>
                    <p>Sir William Garstin comments on these opinions as follows : "I 
                        differ from Mr. Perry in one respect. He wishes to keep these
                        gardens closed, and not permit them to be used for fetes, etc. 
                        Upon the latter point he maybe right, bat I wish to see these 
                        gardens thrown open to the public free of charge, and made into
                        a public park."</p>

                    <head>THE NILE SUPPLY.</head>
                    <p>As a result of the recent expeditions to the Great lakes it has 
                        been discovered that it is upon the level of the Albert lake, 
                        that the supply of the Nile depends, and that this sheet of water 
                        is the real reservoir, and, to certain extent, the regulator of the 
                        Upper Nile. Lake Victoria dischargee a large and varying volume of 
                        water into the river channel, below the Ripon Falls, it is true, 
                        but, owing to the existence of the chain of swampy lakes —known 
                        as Choga—through which it passes for some fifty miles after 
                        leaving the upper plateau, the discharge of the river is so 
                        regulated, that the volume—due to Lake Viotoria—arriving at Foweira
                        and from there passing on to Lake Albert, is practically constant 
                        throughout the year. Any increase below the Murchison Falls is most
                        probably due to rainfall in the catchment area of the lower portion
                        of the Victoria Nile itself, and not to the level of the Victoria Nyanza.</p>

                        Grueber, has sent the following letter to the "Times":—</p>
                    <p>"The Egypt Exploration Fund, which was founded in 1883, has every 
                        year since that time sent out at least one expedition for arphseo-logical
                        research in Egypt, and has issued to his subscribers an annual 
                        memoir giving the results of the work done. During the last two 
                        years it sent two such expeditions, under Professor Petrie and M. 
                        Naville, whereby the ordinary resources of the fund have been 
                        overstrained. In consequence, the committee has resolved that only 
                        one expedition can be undertaken in the present season, and 
                        circumstances compel that this expedition must be to continue 
                        the exploration of the Temple of the XIth Dynasty at Deir el 
                        Bahari, which, after two years' work, is left still unfinished. 
                        Meanwhile, the agreement with Professor Petrie, which has lasted 
                        for nine fruitful years, is suspended by mutual consent; and he 
                        is undertaking an independent exploration in the eastern delta of 
                        the Nile." After describing the clearing of the Temple of Queen 
                        Hathsepshu, at Deir el Bahari by M. Naville, and his discovery with 
                        Mr. H.R. Hall, of the British Museum, of the finerary chapel of 
                        Mentuhetep III., Mr. Grueber says "During the past two seasons about 
                        two-thirds. of the Temple of Mentuhetep have been cleared, but the 
                        western end still regains to be excavated. The committee of the fund
                        feel that it is impossible to leave the work in this unfinished 
                        state, even for a single winter. They have therefore already 
                        sent out Mr. Hall, with other assistants, to continue and (it 
                        is hoped) complete operations ; and he will be joined shortly
                        by M. Naville. In view, however, of their depleted finances, 
                        they are compelled to make special appeal to their subscribers, 
                        and to the general public, in order to enable them to bring to 
                        a satisfactory ending an enterprise which has already occupied 
                        so-many years, and which has been attended with such valuable 
                        results." Contributions may be sent to Mr. Graeber as honorary 
                        treasurer.</p>

                    <p>Some time ago the Holy Synod of Athens, as a disciplinary measure
                        , forbade the Archimandrites of Comis and Monte Santo to 
                        celebrate religious services in the Greek church in Venice, 
                        whither a new Archimandrite was sent, the two others being 
                        ordered to return to Greece. The latter, however, refused to 
                        leave the houses they occupy in Venice, which belong to the 
                        church. Before leaving Venice, Queen Olga, with her suite, 
                        attended service in the Greek church, and while entering the 
                        sacred building, her Majesty was addressed by the Archimandrite 
                        of Comis, who protested against his punishment. The scene was 
                        repeated by the Archimandrite of Monte Santo as the Queen was 
                        leaving. Her Majesty was astonished by the audacity of the 
                        rebellious prelates, who followed her, continuing their 
                        protests. They still flatly refuse to leave Venice.</p>

                        already in your hands, which deal fully with the situation, but 
                        concerning  which, in the course of my remarks, I propose to offer 
                        some explanation. The report and accounts, I presume, you will accept
                        as read. It is my duty in the first instance to remind you that we aid
                        not consider it necessary to issue a prospectus, seeing that the object
                        and scope of our operations were set forth in the concessions from the
                        Egyptian Government, particulars of which were circulated amongst you ;
                        and further, in oar opinion, there was no necessity for such prospectus
                        in view of the fact that, looking to the confidence existing amongst 
                        those who launched this enterprise, the capital was at once forthcoming,
                        and, in fact, was very heavily over subscribed. There was accordingly no
                        necessity to make any appeal whatsoever to the public for support. I shall
                        endeavour to show that the continence of the directors, who amongst them 
                        hold over 30,000 shares, has been more than justified. I may, however, 
                        incidentally mention that it is a matter of gratification to us to have 
                        as shareholders influential people, both in this country and in Egypt.</p>
                    <p>Let me now briefly pass to the consideration of the balance sheet, 
                        which, I think, is sufficiently seif explanatory, but concerning 
                        which I shall be happy to reply to any questions on the conclusion 
                        of my remarks. As regards capital, you will observe that no less 
                        than two-thirds of the total capital of the corporation is secured 
                        as working capital, in accordance with the arrangement made with the
                        Egyptian Government. You will also observe that, having sufficient 
                        capital in hand for present par poses, the final call of 5s per share
                        has been postponed. We have large cash balances, ana so carefully 
                        have we invested your funds that the first-claw securities in which
                        they are placed show to-day a greatly enhanced value. With reference
                        to plant, machinery, etc., I should remark that the preliminary
                        pioneering expe ditions therein referred to extended over a senes
                        of many years, and have alone made possible the incorporation of our
                        company. With regard to the item £27,248 5s 11d, included in which is
                        the L.E. 4,000 deposited with the Egyptian Government, we anticipate
                        that a portion of the latter figure will be repayable to us when the
                        account is in due course tendered by the Public Works Department Finally,
                        let me observe while on the subject of accounts that in the first year
                        during which we carried on business we have almost paid our way, being
                        that there is only a debit balance of £1,276 10s 3d standing between us
                        and a diVideud. How, first and foremost among our dividend earning 
                        resources stands the land. We are essentially a commercial land company.
                        We have grants of land in Khargeh, Dakhia, Farafra, and Baharia Oases,
                        in Western Egypt. We have grants of land of over 622,000 acres to be
                        taken up pro rata for 30 years over which we have the absolute right 
                        of bale. This is one of the most valuable land concessions yet granted
                        by the Egyptian Government, and its careful and economic development 
                        should not only provide an outlet for British oapital returning large
                        dividends, but should add a vast revenue producing province to the
                        dominions of the Khedive.</p>
                    <p>I am happy to state that our relations with the Government are most
                        amicable. Let me impress upon you that we are in no sense a chartered
                        company. The responsibility of policing and public order rests
                        entirely with the Government, with whom we are anxious to work in
                        closest co-operation and to whose opinion we are ready to defer in
                        all administrative matters. We have taken every precaution in oar
                        power to attach to our service officials of the highest calibre,
                        while no less care has been exercised in the Selection of our 
                        subordinate officials. Our general manager, Mr. Beckett, came to
                        us bearing most admirable testimonials from influential quarters in
                        India. Mr. Beadnell, who as nine years' representative of the 
                        Egyptian Government in the Oases has an unexampled experience of
                        that vast area, has surrendered his position under the Government
                        in order to join our service. He was a member of the Egyptian 
                        Survey Department, and is the author of certain official standard 
                        publications on Egypt. His geological opinion to the effect that 
                        the underground artesian supply in the Oases is practically 
                        inexhaustible, and that the output at the surface may be almost
                        indefinitely augmented, together with our own experience during the
                        period under review, shows that Lord Rosebery's saying that "Egypt 
                        is the Nile and the Nile is Egypt'' no longer completely holds good,
                        for Mr. Beadneli points oat, with the authority of an expert who 
                        has studied local conditions, that "the Oases lands have one great
                        advantage over those of the Nile Valley in that they are not
                        dependent on the time,</p>
                <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>volume and duration of the Nile flood." Our several experiments 
                        in irrigation have amply demonstrated the fertility of the western
                        country under favorable conditions, and as the report in your 
                        hand makes dear, the initial success we have obtained is all' 
                        that can be desired. As a consequence we are now receiving numerous
                        applications for land, and as soon as certain formalities are
                        complied with we shall be in a position to proceed with land
                        sales. Meantime we are pushing on survey work in connection with
                        our first application with all possible speed. There is every
                        indica tion that there will be an exceedingly ready sale.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the value of land, yon will find in Lord Cromer's
                        last report an extract from the report of my colleague Crookshank
                        Pasha relative to the extraordinary value of the Daira Sanieh,
                        which has resulted from his able administration. "Crookshank Pasha,"
                        says Lord Cromer, 'writes : "With the conversion of the basin
                        irrigation in Middle Egypt into perennial irrigation, and a 
                        constant supply of good water assured by the Assouan dam and 
                        Assiout barrage, I am confident that we have not yet reached 
                        the highest prices that the land is worth'." And Lord Cromer 
                        adds : "This view is shared by many other eminent authorities."
                        The figure for the Nile lands, according to Crookshank Pasha, 
                        works out at about £60 per acre. But let us, for the purpose of 
                        arriving at some commercial  basis for our early land sales in 
                        the Oases, assume that £12 10s only per acre will be realised 
                        immediately. This calculation would signify no less a sum than 
                        £250,000, or the whole of our subscribed capital, from one 
                        year's operations. Permit me to remind yon that the Egyptians
                        of all classes have supreme confidence in the commercial value
                        of the land. I may say as one who has had the opportunity, 
                        through the kindiy assistance of friends possessing large 
                        Egyptian experience, of studying land conditions in Egypt on 
                        the spot, that it is very apparent, looking to the marvellous
                        fertility of the soil and to the fact that the Egyptians 
                        themselves are continually re investing their profits in it, 
                        that the value of land is not a speculative and fluctuating 
                        one, but is one which in the future indicates every prospect 
                        of showing stable and enhanced prices. Amongst the 
                        considerations which weighed with me in accepting the 
                        offered position as chairman of this corporation was my 
                        profound confidence in the material prosperity and progress 
                        of Egypt, and my belief that a land company controlled and
                        managed on sound business lines would be certain to succeed.</p>
                    <p>The Egyptian is a thrifty and good husbandman, and it will be 
                        part of the policy of your directors at a later date to make 
                        advances is done by agricultural banks lor the better 
                        development of your land in the irrigated districts of your 
                        concessions. The company has also in view the taking up and 
                        working of land on its own account, and has appointed an 
                        agricultural chemist if the highest attainments, who is now 
                        engaged in a careful study of local conditions, and in 
                        carrying out experiments in the planting of sugar-cane, 
                        sisal, ootton and vegetables with complete success. As you
                        know, Lord Cromer speaks in his report of the lack of 
                        vegetables in the markets of Cairo, which as you are aware
                        is one of the moat popular of the greatly frequented resorts
                        in the world. We are also giving close attention to the date
                        trade, which has proved so remunerative in Algiers and Tunis,
                        where I understand similar oonditions prevail As regards 
                        quality, our land in the Oases is of loamy clay, yielding 
                        even in the untutored hands of the local inhabitants rich 
                        crops of cereals and knits of many varieties. In regard to 
                        labour, I have no fear as to the supply. The surplus population
                        of the Oases, owing to the present lack of adequate employment,
                        trickles to Alexandria, Fort Said, Is-maineh and Cairo. 
                        Constant employment should in future retain it at home ; 
                        apart from this, there is, however, ample population to 
                        draw upon in Egypt proper, parti cularly in the vicinity ol
                        Keneh and Karnao, for whom our railway, when completed, will
                        provide ready transport I may incidentally remind you that 
                        the starting point of our line from the State Railway is but 
                        a night's journey from Cairo, and that therefore we cannot 
                        experience the same difficulties in regard to labour supply 
                        as are to be met with at Khartoum, some 1,600 miles from 
                        Cairo, and in he Sudan, where the fellaheen are reluctant 
                        to emigrate. So cordial are our relations with the Egyptian 
                        Government, who, I believe, are fully alive to the earnestness
                        and straightforwardness of our purpose, that there is being
                        prepared at the present time what is practically a free 
                        permit to bore wells, though there are, of course, necessary
                        conditions attaching to it Permission has also been granted
                        to us to bore wells for the local inhabitants, and satisfactory
                        terms have already been arranged, which will result in additional
                        revenue to the corporation. I should mention for your information
                        that, for the present, we do not intend to sell any land near 
                        actual or possible townships, or in the vicinity of the railway.
                        It may be of interest to those of our shareholders who lean 
                        towards antiquarian research to know that signs are not wanting
                        that the present inhabitants are bat a small remnant of a much 
                        larger population in ancient times. The Oasis of Khargeh is 
                        dotted over with ancient buildings. The ruins of the great 
                        temple of Hibis and the remains of many other smaller temples 
                        attest the sites of ancient towns under the Egyptian dynasties. 
                        Numerous ruined forts and castles of the Roman period bear 
                        witness to the size of the garrison and to the importance of 
                        the settlements during Imperial times. We have discovered, for
                        example, and opened up a long subterranean watercourse, with
                        vent-holes a intervals. The underground water-channel is doubtless
                        of the same type to be met with in Persia and Balochistan for 
                        irrigating purposes. In each the manholes opened up the water</p>
                <cb n="3"/>
                    <p>rose too high for the men to continue work with the 
                        appliances at their immediate compand.</p>
                    <p>Respecting subsidiary interests I say very little, as 
                        the report deals folly with these subjects. I will only 
                        remark that the Dakhia Oasis was known to abound in earthy 
                        minerals —phosphates, ochres, etc.; our last year's work 
                        shows that the Khargeh Oasis contains important earthy minerals 
                        also, chiefly aluminous. In regard to phosphates, Mr. Beadneli, 
                        in a report dated October 80th, says: "With regard to the Dakhia 
                        deposits, yon will observe from my report that they are 
                        practically inexhaustible, and so situated as to be worked
                        with very great facility. ... I have a very high opinion of
                        the Dakhia phosphates ; they are the very best in Egypt, 
                        and compare favorably with the best-known foreign deposits."
                        A publication .of the Survey Department,Egyptian Government,
                        on "The Phosphate Deposits of Egypt," says the total area of
                        the phosphate outcrop in Dakhia Oasis is "something like 200
                        or 250 square kilometres," and further states : "The analyses
                        show that the riohest bands are almost equal to the best 
                        Carolina phosphates, and do not compare unfavorably even 
                        with the finest Florida deposits." Mr. Bertram Blonnt,
                        F.I.C., the Consulting Chemist to the Crown Agents for the 
                        Colonies, to whom we submitted various samples of earthy
                        minerals from the oases, states ' "I have no hesitation 
                        in stating that the potential value of these minerals,
                        commercially, is very great." Finally, let me say a word
                        concerning our rail-way.You will doubtless concur with 
                        your board that the future of the corporation is mainly
                        wrapped up in the provision of railway facilities between
                        the oases and the Nile. We have, as you are aware, a railway
                        concession for 70 years. We are pushing the line forward with
                        all possible despatch,and are acting under Government 
                        supervision, seeing that we are to enjoy a Government guarantee 
                        on our capital expenditure. We are constructing the line 
                        our-selves, in order that we may save to you the contractors' 
                        profits. We have appointed as our supervising engineers the 
                        well-known firm of Kincaid, Waller, Manville aud Dawson. Plans
                        of upwards of 30 miles of route have already been approved by 
                        the Government, and the permanent way material for that section
                        and the rolling stock for the whole line have already been 
                        ordered, and partly shipped. A complete telephone equipment, 
                        has also been provided. I must not omit to mention that the 
                        survey at the Oasis end of the line is proceeding, aud that the
                        gradients that were at first thought would be somewhat steep
                        will now be considerably lessened. Our general manager, Mr. Beckett,
                        has had as chief engineer of the Bengal-Nagpur Railway, and as
                        its acting general manager, railway experience which will prove 
                        of considerable advantage to the corporation in its railway 
                        construction. Our railway, when completed, will provide access to 
                        markets for agricultural produce ; moreover, it should in view of 
                        the great rise in the value of land in the Nile Valley tempt the 
                        fellaheen to rent or purchase holdings in the Oases, and thus be 
                        instrumental in transforming these once thickly-populated tracts 
                        into a busy province again, a province which would participate in 
                        the general conditions of prosperity which Anglo-Egyptian beneficent
                        rule has so abundantly brought to Egypt at large. I cannot 
                        conclude these remarks without bearing testimony to the unceasing
                        assistance and work which I have received from the officials
                        connected with the company in a consultative capacity and also
                        from the staff both in the London office in Cairo. With these
                        few observations I beg with confidence to submit this report
                        and the accounts for your acceptance and adoption. (Applause).</p>
                    <p>Mr. C. E. H. Hothouse, M. P., seconded the motion, remarking 
                        that he had entire confidence and belief in the undertaking.</p>
                    <p>The motion was then put and carried unanimously.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Anderton proposed the re-election of the auditors, Messrs.
                        W. B. Peat and Co., and in doing so stated that the accounts
                        were so clearly set out that there was not the least 
                        difficulty in understanding them.</p>
                    <p>Mr. I. Manville seconded the motion, which was 
                        unanimously agreed to.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Humphrey Ward, in moving a cordial vote of thanks
                        to the chairman and his coleagues, said that as far as
                        his means allowed he had taken a large interest in the
                        oompany. He and his family were the holders of nearly 
                        4,000 shares, and he was sure those present would agree
                        with him that they were all more than satisfied with what
                        had been done. They had been engaged up to the present in
                        more or less pioneer work, but he did not think, that any
                        company of this character had ever at its first meeting 
                        been able to give a" more satisfactory account of its 
                        operations. ( Hear, hear. ) The accounts were clearly 
                        stated ; the working both in England and in this country 
                        was carried on in the most businesslike manner; they were
                        on good terms with the Egyptian Government which was, of
                        course, a matter of extreme importance, and they had already
                        ample evi-dence that the goodwill of the large adjoining
                        population of natives was entirely on their side. He wished 
                        to express a hope that a year hence, when the shareholders 
                        reassembled, the land sales would have yielded satisfactory 
                        results, and that, above all, the railway would be, if not in
                        actual working order, at least very nearly so. It was by his 
                        railway that Lord Kitchener conquered the Sadan, and it would 
                        be by the railway of this company they would conquer the
                        oases. (Applause).</p>
                    <p>Mr. Anderson seconded the motion, which was unanimously adopted.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman, on behalf of his colleagues and himself, 
                        thanked the shareholders for their very kind Words of 
                        encouragement to the board, and assured them that no
                        efforts would be spared on their side to promote and 
                        advance the interests of the shareholders to the best
                        of their ability. (Applause).</p>
                    <p>The proceedings then terminated.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Otto A. Fleissner, American Epicurean, late Chef to Col. W. J. Coady,
                    (Buffalo Bill), now chef at the Rainer Grand Hotel Seattle, Wash., writes:</p>
                    <p>"I suffered with kidney and bladder trouble until life did not seem worth living.
                    I had tried man medicines, but did not get any relief until I took Peruna. It was 
                    really wonderful how much better I was after I had used this medicine only a week. 
                    I did not expect that it would help me permanently, but as long as it was doing 
                    me good I continued to use it. At the end of six months, I found to my relief that it
                    had rid my system of all poisons, and that I was cured to stay cured. You certainly
                    have a splended medicine and I gladly endorse it. -Otto A. Fleissner.</p>
                    <p>Catarrh of the Kidneys a Common Desease-Kidney Trouble Often Falls to Be
                    Regarded as Catarrh by Physicians.</p>
                    <p>Catarrh of the kidneys is very common indeed. It is a pity that this fact 
                    is not better known to the physicians as as well as to the people.</p>
                    <p>People have kidney desease. They take some diuretic, hoping to get better. 
                    They never once think of catarrh. Kidney desease and catarrh are seldom associated 
                    in the minds of the people, and, alas, they are not very often associated in the mind
                    of physicians. Too few physicians recognise catarrh of the kidneys. They doctor 
                    for something else. They try this remedy and that remedy. The trouble may be catarrh all 
                    the time. A few battles of Peruna would cure them.</p>
                    <p>PE-RU-NA CURES CATARRH OF THE KIDNEYS.</p>
                    <p>Pe-ru-na Removes the Cause of the Kidney Trouble.</p>
                    <p>Peruna strikes at the very centre of the difficulty by eradicating that catarrh from
                    the kidneys. Catarrh is the cause of kidney difficulty. Remove the cause and you 
                    remove the effect. With unerring accuracy. Peruna goes right to the spot. The kidneys 
                    are soon doing their work with perfect regularity.</p>
                    <p>Thousands of Testimonials.</p>
                    <p>Thousands of testimonials from people who have has kidney disease which had gone 
                    beyond the control of the physician are received by Dr. Hartman every year, giving 
                    Peruna the whole praise for marvelous cures.</p>

                    <p>COUR D'APPEL MIXTE.</p>
                    <p>Barthélémy Carbonel contre Ernest Mebcinier et Léon Stienon</p>
                    <p>M. Carbonel, ayant servi d'intermédiaire entre Me Meroinier et le Sr. Goneim an 
                        sujet d'on procès qne celui-ci avait intenté à Haridi en revendication d'une 
                        propriété deoentfeddans, prétend qu'aux termes d'an accord avec Me Meroinier 
                        il devait toucher la moitié dos honoraires promis, an oas où son olient aurait
                        gain de cause. Le Sr. Goneim gagna effectivement son procès, et récompensa 
                        royalement son avocat, mais oelni-oi se défendit d'avoir rien à partager aveo 
                        Carbonel</p>
                    <p>De là le procès actuel Le tribunal de première instance a donné raison à Me 
                        Meroinier, mais Carbonel a fait appel de ce premier jugement.</p>
                    <p>La Cour vient de se ranger a la décision des premiers juges et de condamner 
                        l'appelant aux dépens.</p>
                    <p>Voici les principaux motifs invoqués dans l'arrêt :</p>
                    <p>L'appelant ne fournit pas aux débats la preuve du prétendu dol qui l'aurait 
                        empêché de se procurer une oontre-lettre, et auoun des faits par lai 
                        articulés dans son exploit da 18 novembre 1905 ne tendent à le démontrer. 
                        L'assertion d'après laquelle les mots "que M. Stienon a payé avant ces 
                        présentes, eto." auraient été frauduleusement mis par l'offioier publio 
                        quiareça l'acte da 31 mai 1899 à l'insu de l'appelant est manifestement 
                        invraisemblable. En tous cas, la preuve d'un fait de cette nature infirmant 
                        la sincérité de l'officier publié et impliquant sa participation au dol doit
                        être îourni non par une simple enquête mais à la suite et sous la garantie de
                        l'insoription en faux.</p>
                    <p>Qaant à la nullité tirée de l'art. 324 du Code Civil, il est acquis aux débats 
                        qu'au moment où intervenait l'aote précité da 31 mai, le procès entre Goneim 
                        et Haridi était complètement terminé au profit du premier. 11 ne s'agissait 
                        dono point d'une vente portantsnr droits litigieux mais simplement de la 
                        rémunération par un olient reconnaissant de services prêtés aveo le plus 
                        grand succès par son avocat</p>
                    <p>De plus Carbonel n'apparaissant à l'aote que comme prête-nom, on ne saurait 
                        prononcer la nullité en l'absence da véritable intéressé ou de ses héritiers.</p>
                    <p>Il est vrai que la dite nullité pourrait aux termes de l'art 324 être prononcée
                        d'office, mais cela ne veut pas dire qu'elle doive être prononcée en dehors 
                        de la partie intéressée et même incidemment.</p>

                    <head>TRIBUNAL MIXTE DU CAIRE</head>
                    <p>Une Affaire de Préemption</p>
                    <p>Le Tribunal mixte de Ire instance du Caire (2me Chambre civile) a rendu hier son 
                        jugement dans une intéressante affaire de préemption. Cette affaire a été 
                        plaidée la semaine dernière. Voici les faits de la oause, tels d'ailleurs que 
                        nous les avons déjà exposés :</p>
                    <p>Mme Chérifa Hanem, épouse Aly pacha Yaghen, avait un terrain à Bab el-Louk ; 
                        elle en vendit la moitié en décembre 1904 à Mme Mounira Hanem Kbairy et en
                        février 1905 l'autre moitié à la Delta Land. Mme Mounira Hanem apprit la vente
                        faite à la Delta Land ; elle s'empressa d'exercer une action eu préemption ; 
                        mais la Delta Land y répond en demandant à exeroer l'action en préemption à 
                        l'encontre de Mme Mounira Hanem.</p>
                    <p>La Delta fait observer que son acte d'achat à elle est transcrit, tandis que 
                        celai de son adversaire ne l'est pas. Mais cette dernière fait remarquer que
                        la priorité de son acquisition est incontestable, de l'aveu même de la Delta 
                        Land, et par le fait qne dans l'acte de vente de œlle-oi, elle, Mounira Hanem 
                        est indiquée oomme propriétaire limitrophe. Elle ajoute que la transcription 
                        ne saurait avoir auonn effet quant à l'existence du droit de préemption, 
                        création du droit musulman et basée uniquement sur la priorité de 
                        l'acquisition, ce qui est une simple question de fait.</p>
                    <p>La Delta Land a répondu en soutenant qne la transcription était indispensable

                    <byline>(From our Correspondent.)</byline>
                    <p>Paris, December 13</p>
                    <p>Paris is at present enjoying a spell of first-rate weather. The temperature is low in 
                        comparison with the abnormally warm weather of last week, when a butterfly, which 
                        must have lost its way, was seen fluttering round the Madeleine, but the bright 
                        sunshine which prevailed during the greater part of yesterday and to-day was a welcome 
                        compensation, on Sunday we had a lovely full moon, and, unlike Londoners, Parisians 
                        were able to see it. We have had no fog at all for some weeks, and in the early morning 
                        and late at night real winter conditions prevail; hard frost and clear, bright air. Let 
                        ns hope that this sort of thing will continue until after the New Year, for if it does
                        not, the shopkeepers will lose a lot of money. People here begin making their Christmas
                        and New Year purchases immediately after December sets in, and if we are not blessed 
                        with a fair amount of good weather during the last month of the year, there is much 
                        less done in the way of shopping than would otherwise be the case.</p>
                    <p>As usual, a good many people are preparirg to spend the end of the year where the son 
                        shine?, and departures for the Riviera are becoming every day more numerous. While, 
                        of course, to those of a domestic turn of mil d there is nothing like a Christmas 
                        among the old folks and one's own family, it seems to me that when one has really 
                        enjoyed the delights of a winter in the South of France, when one has left London 
                        enveloped in fog and smoke and cold and in less than twenty-four hours has woke up 
                        in a Valmy atmosphere, a blue sky above, sunshine streaming through the carriage 
                        windows, and the azure Mediter ranean at one's feet, it is difficult to forget the 
                        sensation, and not easy to get over the longing to enjoy it all over again. It does
                        not much matter at what part of the coast you decide to bask in the sunshine, you
                        will find the sons of Britain comfortably installed at all the best stopping places,
                        from Hyeres to Mentone.</p>
                    <p>The political situation is by no means dear. Speech is added to speech across the 
                        Rhine, and the effect of so much oratory is to increase the apprehensions of those
                        who believe that there is some ulterior motives in all these appeals to the 
                        Chauvinism of the Reichstag. If ary confirmation were needed of the pessimistic 
                        view, it is to be found in the comments of the German Press, which become 
                        increasingly provocative. Amongst serious-minded persons the gloomiest opinions 
                        prevail as to the tendencies of the hour. It is believed that no stone will be 
                        left unturned to embarrass England and France at Algeciras, even to the point, 
                        if need be, of organising a native "coup" in Morocco during the time the 
                        Conference sits. Nor are the veiled threats of Germany lost upon the most pacific
                        of public writers. France, also, is keeping its sword sharpened and its powder
                        dry. Since the "fronsse" every eff rt has been made to bring the defence forces
                        of the Eastern frontier into a state of the utmost preparation. Before the end
                        of the year is out the last (cartridge will have been delivered and the last 
                        button adjusted on the military gaiter.</p>
                    <p>That strange and cynical deity, which is Chance, has played directly into the 
                        hands of a watchful enemy. The election in England will be succeeded by the
                        elections in France. Whilst Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman and his colleagues 
                        are probably as Francophil as their predecessors,observers are not slow to note
                        that they are more Teutophil at the same t me. Those who foresee the possibility
                        of a conflict are not assured by the thought that a Liberal Government will be
                        in office in England, whose pacific sentiments, excellent as they may be, are 
                        apt to be expressed in lowered credits for the Navy. Meanwhile, the German 
                        shipyards are chock-a-block with new work. Nor is it possible to deny the
                        blackness of the French internal situation. The Rouvier Ministry, under an 
                        appearance of solidarity, is trembling to its fall. The great season for
                        homogeneity the separation of Church and State—has departed with the passage 
                        of the hill through the two Chambers. When, on previous occasions, the 
                        Socialists threatened to desert, M. Rouvier had merely to murmur 
                        "Separation Bill" to bring them to an obedient state of mind. But 
                        to use an Americanism, the Extreme left "has no further use for" M. Rouvier.</p>
                    <p>The question of the successor of M. Loubet is beginning to occupy everyone
                        in Paris to the exclusion of all other subjects. There is no doubt that 
                        many quiet citizens would he glad if the President would consent to serve
                        for another term, but this M. Loubet has declined to do, and the
                        uncertainty as to the future has caused a curious agitation The Socialists 
                        and some others dread the election</p>
                <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>of M. Doumer, the returned proconsul, and in the hope of seeing him beaten,
                        they have started a theory that the President of the Republic ought to be
                        elected by open vote, and not by the ballot. But whether M. Doumer will
                        gain by the ballot or not, there is no doubt that the voting for the 
                        Presidency has always been, and was meant to be, secret. It is true that
                        the Constitutional Law of 187 5 is not clear, for the paragraph referring 
                        to the President says, "The President of the Re-public  shall be elected 
                        by a majority of voters in the National Assembly." But in the commentary 
                        of M. Pierre, it is stated that the President is to be elected in the 
                        manner and according to the roles appointed for the emotion of the Bureaux 
                        of the Chamber of Deputies, and this election has always been by ballot. 
                        Moreover, during the Second Republic, in 1852, it was laid down that the 
                        vote was to be secret, so that it is evident that vote by ballot has always 
                        been regarded as a necessity in a Presidential election. If the Socialist 
                        proposal were ratified by Parliament, it would be nothing less than a 
                        revolution, and it is difficult to see what would be the advantage of such a 
                        reversal of all precedent, more especially as it is, to say the least of it, 
                        doubtful whether M. Doumer's chances would be in the slightest degree 
                        injured by recourse to an open vote.</p>
                    <p>With regard to this years's automobile show, which was opened on Friday by 
                        President Lou bet, accompanied by more than half-a-dozen members of the 
                        Cabinet, experts tell us that there is no striking novelty, but that the 
                        general standard of efficiency and excellence is considerably higher than
                        twelve months ago. Cars are gradually falling into line with modern 
                        civilised requirements. They do not smell To badly as they did at t he
                        beginning, they are less noisy, and it is now possible to take a trip 
                        in them without being obliged to strap yourself to the seat. They also 
                        coat less money,and that is perhaps where there was the greatest room 
                        for modification. At one time it was no use looking for a decent car 
                        without a thousand-pound note to spend. To-day enthusiasts are speaking 
                        of the poor man's car, which shall be sold for a hundred pounds. The
                        wonderful progress made by Franoe in the motor-car industry is 
                        illustrated by the following figures :— In 1898, the first year of 
                        the annual exhibition, the number of visitors to the show was 82,000, in 
                        1904 the attendances had risen to 360,000. and this year it is expected
                        that before the Salon Automobile closes its doors on Christmas Eve, it
                        will have been visited by at least 500,000 people. In 1903 France 
                        exported motor-cars to the value of £2,033,080; in 1904 the exports had
                        attained to £2,852,080;; and the figures for the first ten months of 
                        this year are £3,848,888.</p>
                    <p>The amber roof of the Grand Palais in the Champs Elysees shines like a
                        beacon for miles. The exhibition is a wonderful demonstration of art 
                        and industry. It is certainly the most handsome Salon that has ever been.
                        Each exhibitor has his own electric installation, often of a very 
                        elaborate kind, in addition to the great Sun and attendant stars that 
                        shine down upon him from the roof. One manufacturer has spent the bagatelle
                        of £1,400 upon his iHuminatiocs. The Salon d'Automobile has become one 
                        of the great social fetes of Paris. It is as important as the official
                        picture exhibition in the spring, as the horse show which succeeds it, or
                        the Grand Prix. Women order their frocks for the motor exhibition, just as
                        they do for those other great events. The "Anto" rope keeps the Rae de la
                        Paix as busy as if it were making for the Grande Semaine. The Avenne Nicholas,
                        which stretch* es before the doors of the Grand Palais, is filled the 
                        day through with the sights and sounds of automobile life. There is the
                        loud trump of horns, the throbbing of a thousand engines, and the "va et 
                        vient" incidental to a flying column of horseless carriages.</p>
                    <p>The Freuoh Maritime League has taken the lead in commemorating the centenary
                        of the launching of the first steamboat by Fulton in 1807. While, 
                        however, according to America the honors in the matter of navigation,
                        France claims to have been the first nation to adopt steamships in 
                        the merchant service, and Paris proposes to honor both these events by
                        an international exhibition to he held in the city in 1907. A monument
                        is to he erected to Fulton and another to Jonflroy d'Abbaue, who, 
                        according to French claims, first applied steam to naval service.</p>
                    <p>It is a long time since the sale of any one single collection of paintings,
                        sculpture, porce lain, and general art objects has produced results 
                        anything approaching those yielded by the Cronier collection this week.
                        It may be doubted, indeed if they have been equalled anywhere within
                        the past two years. After the paintings the keenest competition seems 
                        to have been for the antique furniture with Beauvais and Anbusson 
                        upholsterings, and for the Beauvais, Aubusson, and Gobelins tapestries.
                        Altogether the sale has yielded</p>
                <cb n="3"/>
                    <p>£208,000. Its highest figure given for a piece of Beauvais tapestry 
                        was £12,000 for Bouche's 'Sisters of Psyche." The top figure in 
                        Gobelins was £8,000 for a "History of Don Qaixote."</p>
                    <p>Motor cabs are forging steadily ahead in Paris. A good many are already 
                        on the streets, and within two or three weeks they will be followed by 
                        250 more. Like the horsed vehicles hey will be fitted with taximeters, 
                        on a scale which may not be without its interest for British proprietors 
                        and drivers. The tariff is as follows : Sevenpence-halfpenny for the
                        first 930 yards, and one penny for each 809 yards afterwards, which 
                        brings the rate, roughly, to about tenpence halfpenny per mile.</p>
                    <p>A strange case of violation of old tombs has recently taken place in Paris,
                        not in an open cemetery, but within the precincts of Mont Valerien, 
                        perhaps the most powerful of the doomed forts girdling the city. The 
                        tomb is that of the Duo de Fleury, who was buried in the fortress in
                        1815. A committee periodically examines this and a few other tombs 
                        in the enceinte, and at their last inspection found that the Duke's
                        tomb had been broken into, a lead coffin forced, and various objects 
                        of value inside abstracted. Careful inquiry led to the arrest of a 
                        sapper of the garrison, whose term of service would have expired next
                        September. On interrogation he admitted that two ex-soldiers of the
                        garrison, now discharged, had plotted the robbery, and that he had 
                        abetted them. He has not divulged the names of his accomplices.</p>
                    <p>Paris has just been celebrating the centenary of Robert Houdin, the 
                        father of modern magic, who was horn, the son of a watchmaker, at 
                        Blois in 1805. All the conjurors of modern times acknowledge their 
                        indebtedness to Hon-din, who, while working in his father's shop, 
                        determined to become a professor of magic, and began to construct 
                        those ingenious mechanical tricks by which he later on astonished 
                        the world. Before his time conjurors always appeared in the fantastic 
                        costume of a "wizard," with a pointed cap and a flowing robe, and their 
                        mechanical devices were limited to the box with a double bottom. But
                        on July 3rd, 1845, Robert Houdin appeared in evening dress at the 
                        Palais Royal, and performed a number of absolutely new tricks, all 
                        of which were mechanical and extremely ingenious. Within a week he
                        was famous, and for seven years he travelled all over Europe, and 
                        even in North Africa, his most remarkable achievements being bis 
                        performance before the Pope and his defeat of the Arab sorcerers. 
                        Houdin was a handsome, distinguished, and witty man, and the comments
                        with which he accompanied his tricks, now familiarly known as "patter,"
                        added greatly to his success. In the franco-Prussian war he had the
                        misfortune to lose his second son, a young officer of promise, and 
                        in 1872, he died, having elevated conjuring from an object of derision 
                        to a source of wonder and astonishment.</p>

                    <p>One of the curious historical phenomena in relation to ancient industries 
                        is the existence of these beautiful curiosities, which have been dug up 
                        in West Africa, and which would seem to be of ancient Phoenician manufacture.
                        These beads are made of solid enamel of the purest kind. They form the 
                        most prized earthly possession of the old native families of the Gold 
                        Coast, who cannot be induced to part with them. Those that are met with 
                        elsewhere may he generally pronounced to he imitations. So much prized are
                        the real beads that it is difficult to get the possessors even to show 
                        them ; only the direst want will make them yield possession. The fact that 
                        these heads are fonnd buried in the earth in ancient villages gives colour
                        to the idea that they were used as a barter in dealings by the ancient
                        Phoenician traders, who exchanged their wares fo- the gold which was 
                        undoubtedly worked in this part of Africa at a very early date. The reason 
                        for this early working of these particular deposits is that the gold is
                        universally disseminated over the whole country, and panning, the most
                        ancient form of mining, can be adopted at any river or at any of the
                        large alluvial deposits in West Africa. It would be very interesting 
                        to know whether in the workings of the Egyptian and Sudan mines, now 
                        so actively taking place, any traces of similar enamels have been 
                        found. No doubt the form and the substance more or less of this merchandise 
                        or medium of exchange differed considerably according to the tastes of the
                        various communities. But any trace of such heads, made of the solid enamel
                        of any shape or colour, would be an interesting discovery.</p>
                    <p>In order that excavators may recognise these beads we would say that they
                        are generally extraordinarily light in weight, although solid enamel. 
                        The imitations are always heavier than the enguine beads.</p>

                    <p>The annual meeting of this company was he'd last week at their offices in 
                        Leadenhall-street. Sir Thos. Sutherland presided and moved the adoption 
                        of the report, which proposed a return for the year equal to nine per cent,
                        on the paid-up capital of £2,320.000. He thought the meeting would be 
                        satisfied with it. They paid the usual dividend and bonus to which the 
                        shareholders had been accustomed for some years on the moderate capital 
                        of the company. Their total sinking fund for the year was £536,000 ; this 
                        was the very backbone of their business; it was the means by which they
                        had continued the improvement and expansion of their fleet. Their total 
                        revenue was upwards of three millions sterling. Perhaps the most interesting 
                        item was that of passage money £981.695, an increase over the previous year 
                        of £26,000; this increase followed upon a similar increase in the previous 
                        year, and it showed that the general tendency of trade was towards 
                        improvement. In the case of the Australian colonies the advance was far less 
                        than had been expected. They had hoped with the return of better times to
                        find a larger increment in their passenger business; but all their advices 
                        tended to show that whatever increase they obtained in the past year was 
                        merely to he considered as an angary of better things in the immediate 
                        future. As to the passenger fares, he found that on their line to Bombay,
                        which was their most expensive line, the return obtained by the company was 
                        at the rate of 1 1/4d. per mile; on their China line to Japan and Australia 
                        the figures amounted to within a fraction of 1d. per mile ; whereas on the 
                        Calcutta line, which was no longer a main line, and which employed fewer 
                        vessels, the actual return was considerably below 1d. per mile. In goods 
                        freights there was a decrease of £37,230. While their basic ess with Australia
                        was a matter of considerable disappointment, they had had a most excellent 
                        trade in connection with China and Japan; but he was not sanguine as to 
                        shipping prospects for next year. From the 1st of January next the Suez 
                        Canal Company had reduced their imposts to an extent that wonld save the 
                        company in twelve months £30,000 or upwards. He gave an account of the 
                        progress of the oompany daring the 25 years he had been chairman, stating 
                        that while they got less for mails and did much more work for it, passenger 
                        fares had been rednoed 30 per cent; their oarryirg tonnage had been 
                        increased 250,000 tons in capacity, they had paid £5,000.000 in dividends, 
                        and had laid aside out of earnings no less than nine millions sterling. —
                        The report was adopted without discussion.</p>

                    <p>When husband and wife disagree, as a rule, neither is to blame. Perhaps the 
                        husband, overworked at business, is depressed, nervous and irritable; the
                        wife, on her side, excitable and bodily weak. This weakness proceeds either 
                        from a disordered digestion or a general state of low health resulting from 
                        the numerous ailments of the weaker sex.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Williams' Pink Pills restore harmony in the house, for they give tone
                        to the overwrought nerves, impart an appetite and power to digest food, 
                        and enrich and purify the blood, while in women they give regular health and
                        the strength that is necessary for everyday worries in the home. There is new
                        blood for men and women in every dose of Dr. Williams' Pink Pills—blood which
                        produces strength and banishes disease.</p>
                    <p>Read the interesting statement of Mrs. Constance Beacham, the wife .of a 
                        well-known man in insurance circles and living at 167, Balsall Heath-road, 
                        Birmingham. She states : "For years I helped my husband with his work, but 
                        at last I became too ill to do so My symptoms were faintness, flutterings 
                        of the heart, and excruciating pains in the head. My appetite left me, and 
                        even the lightest food would lie heavy on my chest, until life seemed a 
                        perfect misery. A doctor stated I was suffering from gastric catarrh, and
                        about this time my nervons system was so run down that my sight was affected.</p>
                    <p>"Nothing seemed to remove the feeling of depression and weakness that had come 
                        over me. So I grew weaker and more nervous ; I was really terrified at the 
                        thought of being left alone.</p>
                    <p>"One day. however, my husband bought me a box of Dr. Williams' Pink Pills 
                        for Pale People. I began to feel better after the first few pills and you 
                        can imagine my husband's joy. With one box my appetite improved greatly and 
                        the pains in the head vanished. After three boxes of the pills I felt as 
                        well and as strong as ever I did in my life. It is wonderful to think that
                        Dr. Williams' Pink Pills effected what no other medicine could do."</p>
