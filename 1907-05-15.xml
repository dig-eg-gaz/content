                    <head>A FREE SUEZ CANAL</head>
                    <p>In their wildest dreams, shipowners have never looked forward to a toll-free
                        Suez Canal They have at various intervals pressed for and obtained
                        reductions of the transit dues but it has been reserved for Mr. Asquith, in
                        his speech to the Colonial Premiers to promise co-operation with any
                        practical proposals for "removing or reducing" the Canal Company's charges.
                        That the Imperial Government should even so much as hint at the possibility
                        of abolition is one of the ironies of the situation. Only lost March there
                        was published a correspondence between it and the Governor-General uf
                        Australia (Lord Northcote), in which Colonial request for assistance in
                        securing a further reduction'of the Canal dues was oold shouldered, with the
                        joint approbation of the Colonial Office, the Foreign Office, and the
                        Treasury.</p>
                    <p>Lord Elgin was sympathetic - on paper— but thought "nothing would be gained
                        by an attempt to pursue the object without due regard to the interests of
                        those who have a purely financial concern in the undertaking." The sentence
                        gives the key to the position The Suez Canal is the property of a company,
                        in which French shareholders predominate Great Britain must therefore act
                        circumspectly, notwithstanding the unique influence she possesses* as a
                        result of Lord Beaconsfield's master-stroke in purchasing the Khedive's
                        shares in 1875. Great Britain is represented on the administration of the
                        Suez Canal by three Government directors - Sir Henry Austin Lee, Sir John
                        Ardagh, and Mr. H. T. Anstru- ther. They advised the present Government,
                        after Lord Northcote's letter had been referred to them for consideration,.
                        that although the Suez Canal does pay a dividend of 28 per cent, the profits
                        are not exhorbitant, in view of the history and circumstances of the
                        company, and the fact that the shareholders are called upon to make
                        considerable sacrifices for the widening and deepening of the Canal, which
                        they could not be expected to continue if the does were further cut down To
                        put the matter briefly, the British Government could not, if it would,
                        coerce the Suez Canal administration into a disregard of the fair claims of
                        its shareholders. Any attempt to do so would evoke the open hostility of
                        France, which, it may be assumed, has not acquiesced in our present
                        supremacy in Egyp- without some guarantee for the due protection of the
                        great waterway, which the world owes t&lt;- the "Grand Fraiirais," and in
                        which French investors are so deeply concerned. Therefore, the "removal'' of
                        the Suez Canal dues as a whole is out of the question, for a Chancellor of
                        the Exchequer who wants to lay the foundations ol old-age pensions is not
                        going to embark on so colossal and impossible an enter prise as the buying
                        out of French interests What, then, as to the reduction of the Canal dues I
                        The simple fact is that these have, since Jan. 1, 1906, stood at the lowest
                        point on record—namely, 7f 85c per tou. They liave dropped to this point
                        from the 9f 50c charge 1 in 1892, and from the 12f or 13f levied in the
                        earlier years of the concession. It is true that British shipowners claim
                        that the reduction should have proceeded even more rapidly, under an
                        agreement or understanding with M. le Lesseps, but they have hitherto been
                        unable to induce any British Government to acquiesce in that contention and
                        press it home.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, the outstanding fact in the history of the Suez Canal is
                        that, if French capital built it, it is British shipping which has made it a
                        financial success. Here are figures showing the net tonnage of British and
                        foreign shipping passing through the waterway in the year 1905, ami the
                        percentage to the total -</p>
                    <p>Suez Casal Traffic, 1905.</p>
                    <p>Net Tons. Percentage</p>

                    <p>Total............ 13,134,405</p>
                    <p>The figures are by no means those of an exceptional year. As a matter of
                        fact, they do</p>
                    <p>not quite fairly represent the commercial position, because if warships,
                        transports, and Government chartered vessels are left out of account, and
                        consideration is given to merchant vessels and vessels in ballast alone, the
                        British flag stands for nearly 76 per cent of the total tonnage of that
                        class. There is striking proof here, not only of the commanding positiou of
                        our mercantile marine, tut of the fact that the Suez Canal is the great
                        highway to and from our vast possessions in the East and in Australasia.
                        This artificial waterway of ninety- nine miles in length through tho sands
                        of the desert is the connecting link of the British Empire, and for that
                        reason it is a legitimate aspiration to desire that it should be as free as
                        the Atlantic to the Empire's shipping. Then arises the question whether Mr.
                        Asquith, as Chancellor of the Exchequer, is ready and willing to assign
                        towards the realisation of this object the revenue which the country derives
                        from its Suez Canal shares. A further question is as to how far that revenue
                        would go in the desired direction. Here we come to figures which show the
                        shrewdness of Lord Beaconsfield's investment. It is estimated that the whole
                        cost to this country of its Suez Canal shares, with interest at 3$ percent,
                        per annum, had been repaid by the dividends reoeived before the end of 1899.
                        Since that date the country has received in further dividendaa sum of
                        between £6,000,000 and £7,000,000, and may expect to go on drawing
                        considerably over £1,000,000 a year for something which now stands in the
                        nation's books as having cost it nothing. It is fair to suppose that Lord
                        Beaconsfield's object was less to make a good business bargain for the
                        country than to secure a share in the oontrol of the Suez Canal. Shipowners,
                        at all events, argue that it is not right for the country to go on pocketing
                        profits at this rate, and to do nothing for British shipping, when
                        two-thirds of those profits arise from dues paid by British ship-owners.
                        There is something in that contention—more, possibly, than in the Argument
                        that steamers in the Australian trade which now go by way of the Cape would
                        all use the Suez route if the dues were lower. Notwithstanding, there can be
                        no qoarrel with the principle of the Colonial demand that, in the interests
                        of inter-imperial trade and immigration, the shortest route to and from
                        Australia should be as far as possible cheapened. If the propriety of
                        stimulating inter-imperial trade by removing or reducing the canal dues at
                        length appeals to the Government, how is Mr. Asquith placed ? He has a
                        million and rather more of Suez Canal income, bnt, on the assumption that
                        British shipping contributed in proportion to its tonnage to the £4.500,000
                        which roughly represented the transit receipts of the Canal Company in 1905,
                        he would need * a total ot close on £3,000,000 a year in order to free
                        British shipping. In other words, he- would have to find nearly £2,000,000
                        from other sources than Suez Canal profits. This, however, would be on the
                        assumption that every ship with a British register was entitled to a rehate
                        representing the amount paid for canal dues, whether she was trading between
                        British ports or not But as the object aimed at is the encouragement of
                        inter-imperial trade, it would probably be essential to discriminate, and to
                        say that if a British ship is bound, say, from London to Japan, she shall
                        not be reimbursed her canal dues, but that if she is bound from London to
                        Melbourne, Calcutta, or Singapoie she shall get her canal dues refunded.
                        Possibly by some such prooess of discrimination the British Government's
                        share of Suez Canal revenue could be so eked out as to accomplish a great
                        deal, but the thing would be fraught with the gravest difficulty and
                        complexity. A British steamer, for instance, loads cargo for a British
                        possession in th9 East, partly at home and partly at a Continental port. She
                        would presumably be denied the right to a rebate representing her canal
                        lues, because she is not wholly engaged in inter-imperial trading. Equally,
                        if she shipped a cargo in Australia, and discharged some of it at
                        Mediterranean ports and the bulk in London, she might be disqualified. What
                        with the trouble of proving to official satisfaction that the ship's voyage
                        was wholly inter-imperial and the formality of recovering from the
                        Government in London the rebate equiv- ilent to free passage through the
                        canal, the scheme seems cumbersome to a degree. By omparison, indeed, the
                        Colonial proposal to ^ive a preference to British goods actually landed in
                        the Colonial port seems simplicity itself. It was easy for Russia to pay the
                        Suez Canal lues for the ships of her volunteer fleet, which were neither
                        merchantmen nor men-of-war. i'heir tonnage was, however, relatively so small
                        that the experiment can hardly be said to count. But Mr. Asquith, apparently
                        without lue consideration, has given his approval to a programme which is
                        positively staggering It is doubtful whether he can have reflected that
                        directly he took steps to make the Suez Canal toll-free for oar shipping, or
                        a section of it, our maritime competitors would at once do the same. In
                        their case the task would be relatively easy. German shipping comes next to
                        our own among the users of this international waterway, but it equals only a
                        quarter of the British total, and could thus be freed altogether for a
                        trifle of £750,000 a year provided by the German Government. Whetlier, when
                        Mr. Asquith spoke of co-operation in a practical proposal for "removing or
                        reducing" Suez Canal dues, he had doubts whether such a thing would ever be
                        forth-coming, it is useless to discuss. But the irresistible conclusion is
                        that the freeing of the canal is out. of the question till the concession
                        expires many years lienee, and that the further reduction of dues is mainly,
                        if not solely, possible by those methods which in the past have certainly
                        not been wholly wanting in success.As an alternative to Colonial prefer- ,
                        ence, at all events, Mr. Asquith's scheme ia worthless. ("Daily Telegraph ")

                    <p>The Greek Chamber of Commerce, Alexandria, has just published its report for
                        the pas't year. Imports from Greece last year amounted to L.E. 321,793 as
                        compared with L.E. 121,467 in 1900, and L.E. 85,858 in 1896. Tobacco chiefly
                        accounts for these large and steady rises, the increase in the past six
                        years in that import being from L.E. 71,716 to L.E. 214,968. The import of
                        Greek wines has similarly increased from L.E. 5,502 in 1900 to L.E 22,867 in
                        19&lt;i6; oils from L.E. 2,226 to L.E. 10,247 : brandy from L E. 3,233 to
                        L.E. 1.1,347 ; fruits from L E. 5,581 to L.E. 10,509; soap from L.E. 3,863
                        to L E. 6,946. During the lust ten years the number of Greek steamers
                        trading in Egyptian ports has increased from 22, with a total tonnage of
                        22,119, to 253, with a total tonnage of 194,293.</p>

                    <p>In Monday's issue we reproduced a letter from the "Times," written by Mr. Fox
                        Bourne, the Secretary of the Aborigines Society, who stated "that the main
                        body of Egyptian reformers, whose principal organs are "El Moayad" and "El
                        Minbar," are nut in harmony with the reckless policy of Mustaplia Kamel
                        Pasha and his followers, whose organs are "El Lewa" and its English and
                        French reproductions, the "Egyptian Standard" and the "Etendard Egyptien
                        "</p>
                    <p>This assertion has deeply pained the organs of Mustaplia Pasha Kamel.</p>
                    <p>The "Egyptian Standard" remarks :—</p>
                    <p>"Frankly we did not expect such a peculiar attack from the quarter which it
                        comes from Mr. Fox-Bourne isthe author of "Lord Cromer's Supremacy" and
                        other similar pamphlets in tending to show by the simple force of reading
                        data in Parliament and in printed books that Lord Cromer had introduced an
                        autocratic form of government not in agreement with either English or
                        Egyptian interests. Mr. I'ox- Bourne spoke from dry paper lore He had no
                        experience in Egyptian matters and this unconscious want was felt in every
                        one of his pamphlets. The same inexperience is visible in his letter to the
                        "Times." It can hardly be an exaggeration for us to state that, beyond the
                        names of the two Arabic papers he cites, Mr Fox Bourne knows next to nothing
                        connected with them.</p>
                    <p>"This, in itself would be excusable, as is all ignorance. But what we have to
                        refute with all our energies, is that thereis a "split" among the Egyptian
                        Nationals, or that there are Nationals parties. Such discussions do not,
                        exist How is it possible 1 Can one nation prodace two nationalities? Can one
                        oppressed nation produce two or three National parties, each struggling for
                        a liberty which is not the same liberty ?</p>
                    <p>"Mr. Fox Bourne ought to recognize the truth of the above statement. Perhaps
                        he does, hut it is not his wish to reveal it.</p>

                    <head>EGYPT'S WATCH AND CLOCK MARKET.</head>
                    <p>The following particulars of the Egyptian trade in watches and clocks are
                        taken from the "Bulletin" of the French Chamber of Commerce at Alexandria
                        :—Exporters to Egypt should hear in mind that .there are three distinct
                        classes of clients to be dealt with in that country—the European colony, the
                        Arabs with a veneer of European habits, and tastes, and the vast mass of the
                        natives untouched by Occidental influences, anil numbering ten times as many
                        as the first two classes combined. Each of these categories must be served
                        according to its tastes. The natives it. general, and more especially the
                        lower orders, have quite a mania for watches, take a delight in studying
                        their mechanism and in many cases buy a fresh one nearly every year. Under
                        these circumstances it is only natural that Egypt should be considered a
                        good market by makers of various nationalities, and that numerous kinds of
                        watches should be on sale. In large towns such as Alexandria and Cairo
                        several well-equipped jewellers' and wutchmakers' shops are established,
                        some being branch houses of European firms ; these are visited yearly by
                        large numbers of commercial travellers, who are prepared to make all
                        possible concessions and stretch the limits of credit to the utmost degree
                        with a view to securing orders. In addition to these large establishments a
                        considerable number of native watchmakers, trading on a small scale, arc to
                        be found in all Egyptian towns, in many villages, and even in the remote
                        districts of the Sudan. These are largely supplied by commission agents,
                        although a certain number ileal direct with wholesale houses. Men's watches
                        arc considerably more in demand than those for ladies, gold and silver
                        watches being in demand for both categories, while in the former, -nickel
                        and gun-metal watches are even more largely sold. As regards clocks, wooden
                        regulators of all sizes and round nickel alarms find the largest sale ;
                        ornamental mantelpiece clocks are practically unknown. Switzerland has by
                        far the greatest share of the trade in cheap watches, and, moreover, sends a
                        certain number of better-class go-xls of special makes. Germany predominates
                        in the clock trade, furnishing an enormous number of regulator and alarm
                        clocks at exceedingly low prices.</p>

                    <p>Borton Bey was bom in 1870. He was educated at Bedford School, and then
                        entered Sandhurst. He obtained u commission in the Welsh Regiment in 1890
                        and entered the Egyptian Army in 1897. He served in the Nile Expedition and
                        after the fall of Omdnr- man was specially promoted to the Royal
                        Warwickshire Regiment and specially mentioned in despatches. He was then
                        sent by Lord Kitchener to Dongola as one of the first Anglo-Sitdane.se civil
                        officials in that part of the Sudan. He was in charge of the Dongola
                        province for some time and then went to Khartoum in order to form a Prisons
                        Administration for the Sudan. After that he was appointed Governor of Suakin
                        in succession to Miralai Playfair Bey.</p>
                    <p>He was .subsequently appointed commandant of the Upi>er Nile district. From
                        that post he was nominated director of the Custom Administration in the
                        Sudan In 1904 he came to Alexandria in order to study the customs system of
                        Egypt. His Sudan official career was, however, interrupted by his being
                        offered the post of Assistant Postmaster General, which he accepted. Borton
                        Bey has resided at Alexandria since that date. His appointment as successor
                        to Saba Pasha will be very generally appreciated as he has made himself very
                        popular since his residence ut Alexandria.</p>

                        <p>Sir,—We have the honour, sir, to beg you to publish the following few
                            lines in your valuable paper :— On reading the examination of
                            mathematics that was set to the subordinate certificate students we have
                            seen in too difficult, especially in algebra and geometry. Article No 8
                            in the ''Official Journal" states that taking cipher in a subject or in
                            a branch of it will lie a cause to his failure in all the rest of the
                            examinations. We were present, on that day when all the pupils went out
                            of the examination. We have seen that at least 80% of the pupils did not
                            solve exercises of geometry and algebra thoroughly well. We think, sir
                            that no one of all the students had solved the three, or two exercises
                            of geometry.</p>

                    <head>MR. HOHLER'S REPORT-</head>
                    <p>Port Sudan is the new name given to an inlet on the west coast of the Red
                        Sea, formerly known as Sheikh Bargout, 700 miles south of Suez and 35 miles
                        north of Suakin. There is a break in the dangerous coral reefs which fringe
                        this coast, and a straight channel with deep water gives an easy access to
                        the mouth of the harbour. The mouth lies at a slight angle to the general
                        trend of the coast, so that the reefs outside form a shelter from the heavy
                        seas brought in by southerly and easterly winds. The entry is about 500
                        yards wide, and this breadth continues for nearly a mile. Then the inlet
                        expands into a basin on the south side, which is some 900 yards long by 500
                        yards broad, having a minimum depth of 6 fathoms Beyond this, the channel
                        runs up into the land for a distance of about 2 miles. There is another
                        basin on the north side about 1 $ miles up, and a third at the end of the
                        inlet. For 1 mile after leaving the first basin the water has a -minimum
                        depth of 9 fathoms with an average width of 200 yards. The minimum depth the
                        whole way up is 2j fathoms. ..The narrowest part of the iidet is aliout 70
                        yards. The shores rise to a height of from G to 14 feet abo>e sea level, and
                        are composed of coral. The hot flat plain around is devoid of vegetation
                        except for stunted mimosa thorns. A line of hills rises 10 miles to the
                        west, running parallel to the coast</p>
                    <p>These are the natural features of the Sudan in which it was decided three
                        years ago to construct the terminus of the Sudan railways Work was begun
                        less than two years ago, and the transformation which has been effected in
                        this dreary wilderness iB extraordinary.</p>
                    <p>The Sanguineb lighthouse, 16 miles out to sea, marks the passage through the
                        outer reefs, while the nearer approach is shown by pointers (1 HO feet high)
                        and beacons. The railway terminus and custom-house have been placed on the
                        northern side of the inlet, and quays are in process of construction along
                        this side. It is expected that berths for two ships will be ready by the
                        autumn of 1907. When completed the quay will he over lj miles long with
                        accommodation for 12 or 14 ships. Electric travelling cranes and coal-hoists
                        are being constructed. Pour fine customs sheds are already in use. The
                        railway at present has to make a long detour to go round the head of the
                        inlet, but a bridge is being built which will be available for every kind of
                        traffic and thus unite the two parts of the port. It will open so as to
                        afford nccess to the upper waters of the inlet, where a dock with the
                        necessary shops have already l)een commenced.</p>
                    <p>The present terminus of the railway, conjoined as it is with the custom-house
                        ard the quays, will jeinain the goods station. The passenger station will he
                        placed, as soon as the bridge is finished, on the south side of the water,
                        that is to say to the west of the town.</p>
                    <p>On the south side of the inj^t coining from the sea an infectious diseases
                        hospital and a quarantine station have been constructed. The basin mentioned
                        above cuts these off most effectually from the town which lies between this
                        basin and the spot selected for the station, having a wn£er frontage of
                        almost a mile. In this space broad streets have been laid out at right
                        angles. Some of the Government buildings are already nearly completed. For
                        the rest, pending an arrangement of the land question, to which I shall
                        refer later on, the town is at present composed of temporary wooden
                        buildings, occupied by a population of about 5,000. Water is laid on from
                        wells to houses belonging to Government and also to a series of hydrants in
                        case a fire should break out, a grave danger, increased by every factor: a
                        hot climate, wooden houses, inflammable goods, prevalent wind and
                        indifferent oil lamps.</p>
                    <p>A scheme is ih hand for bringing water from a reservoir which is to be
                        constructed in the hills, some 25 miles away. At present the inhabitants
                        fetch their water from the wells by donkeys Good drinking water has to be
                        brought from a distance of about 7 miles.</p>
                    <p>A branch of the Gordon College has leen built, and u civil hospital is in
                        course of construction.</p>

                    <head>CLIMATE.</head>
                    <p>The climate is essentially bad and unsuited to Europeans. The malarial
                        mosquito has not yet made its apj>oarance, but there are fears lest it
                        should he conveyed from the Nile valle) by the railway. Simple fever is
                        common -. it generally assumes a violent form and leaves the patient
                        extremely depressed and enfeebled. Cases of sunstroke are particularly
                        frequent The inconveniences of extreme heat such ns might be expected in the
                        Red Sea, are enhanced by extreme damp. During the summer months, especially
                        July, August and September, even night brings no relief, the temperature
                        remaining practically unchanged, so that sleep is almost impossible. The
                        "cold weather" in this region is merely a relative term. No European should
                        stay there without a good yearly leave, and it appears undesirable that he
                        should remain during two consecutive summers.</p>

                    <head>A SANATORIUM.</head>
                    <p>It is possible, however, that in time a sanatorium will be formed in the
                        hills behind Suakin. There the conditions are totally different A reasonable
                        temperature is ensured by the altitude, and a dry bracing desert air
                        replaces the depressing, relaxing damp of the coast. It is probable that in
                        no part of the Sudan, and in a few parts even of Egypt, is the climate
                        better and more agreeable than in the Hadendowa Hills.</p>
                    <p>It is impossible to write of Fort Sudan without making constant references
                        to, and comparisons with, Suakin. The main reasons for which the railway
                        terminus was transformed to the former poyt is She vastly greater safety of
                        its sea approach, and the superiority of its harbour accomodation.</p>

                <div type="item">
                    <head>COMPETITION WITH SUAKIN.</head>
                    <p>The future of Fort Sudan depends entirely on its importance as a port of
                        entry and a forwarding station. For these purposes it has already superseded
                        Suakin, hut the old town will die linrJ, if it die at all. The pilgrim
                        traffic to Jeddah will always pass through it—this year the number of
                        pilgrims expected is about 8,000, and as a native centre it is likely to
                        muintaiu its position. The lower classes come over to Fort Sudan to work,
                        but they return to Suakin to spend their earnings. There area number of
                        families—merchants, sheikhs, who have lived for generations in Suakin, and
                        there they will remain. The merchants are sending their Rons, however, to
                        Port Sudan, to start a branch of their business there. Next, the quantity of
                        cotton which is grown at Tokar is considerable, and is increasing. Last year
                        60,000 can tars or unginned cotton were produced, and this year over 80,000
                        cantars are expected. This cotton is sent down toTrinkitat, whence it is
                        carried by boat to Suakin. The cotton which is grown at Kassala is also, at
                        present, sent down to Suakiu by caravan. A ginning factory was recently
                        established, but proved a failure. The cotton ib exported from Suakin to
                        Egypt and is mixed with the Egyptian produce.</p>
                    <p>It is, however, not impossible that with the future development of the
                        country, Suakin may become a cotton centre of some importance. It is also,
                        at present, the seat of a trade in cattle with Erithrea, Abyssinia and the
                        adjacent districts, though this traffic has been subject to great hindrance
                        lately owing to the prevalence of cattle plague.</p>
                    <p>Senna also reaches Suakin by caravan.</p>

                    <head>SHAREHOLDERS AGREE TO INCREASE THE CAPITAL.</head>
                    <p>An extraordinary general meeting of the Nile Valley (New) Company, Limited,
                        was hold on the 6th inst. at Winchester House, Old Broad Street, E.C., to
                        consider resolutions for increasing the capital to £262,500 by the creation
                        of 250,000 additional shares of Is each Mr. R J. Price, M.P., (chairman of
                        the company), presided. Tho Secretary (Mr. C. F. Palmer) read the notice
                        convening the meeting. The Chairman, in moving the resolutions, explained
                        that the meeting hail been convened to raise further funds for carrying out
                        the purposes of the company. Tho report, which had been circulated amongst
                        the shareholders, was short and, he thought, perfectly clear, and put them
                        in possession of the facts, which were simply these: Owing to extremely bad
                        luck last year they had three separate outbreaks of enteric fever at tho
                        mine, with the result that they had four managers in the course of the
                        twelve months. In addition to that, they had groat difficulty in getting a
                        proper quantum of hammer-boys, so that the progress made at the mine was
                        distinctly disappointing. Taking all these things into consideration,
                        perhaps it was not remarkable that they found themselves with a very small
                        margin of funds at the presont time. When the last reconstruction took place
                        his presont colleague, Mr. Do Lisso, who wan then on tho other sido of the
                        tabic, suggested that thoy ought to have a 5s. instead of a 4H
                        reconstruction. It bad turned out that be was perfectly right. If they had
                        had a 5a reconstruction he believed that the shareholders would have come in
                        very much as they did, and the directors would not have had to convene the
                        present meeting. However, it was thought at the time that thoy had allowed a
                        sufficient margin, and but for their misfortunes their calculations would
                        have been sufficient. As tho circular stated, they had a balance loft of
                        somo £2,000 or £3,000 — in other words, nbout ono month's expenses —an 1
                        that would disappear very rapidly if they wero to have a comparatively small
                        breakdown at the mine. Early in February a small accident diil occur, which
                        might have easily delayed them for a considerable time. The armatures of two
                        of their threo electric motors gavo out at tho samo time, and they found
                        themselves running the entire crushing apparatus with only ono motor, and if
                        nn accident had happened to that they would have been delayed for at least a
                        month. That accident showed them vory plainly that it would never do to run
                        along on tho comparatively small margin which they had. When ho ex plained
                        the position when they originally reconstructed ho pointed out that the
                        directors did not anticipate getting out of the ordinary crushings of the
                        ore at tho mine more than enough to p*ay tho whole of tho expenses, and, as
                        tho result of three months' experience, they know that their calculation in
                        that regard was fairly correct. The total running expenses at homo and
                        abroad amounted to somo £2,200 or £2,300. Those expenses hod been now
                        reduced, and would perhaps in the future not exceed £2,000 a month. They
                        wore likely to got from their crushing operations just about that- sum of
                        money, and then thoy Bid to look for any profits from specimen ore that
                        might ho-found. That was a point which was impressed upon their minds when
                        they reconstructed. As to whether thoy wero going to find specimen ore, no
                        one could tell. In the month of March they found in a comparatively deep
                        working a nice little bit of specimon stone, hut nothing like tho £70,000
                        which was found in the original rich chute It was not worth much more than
                        £100, but it demonstrated the fact that thoy could get spjcimen oro at
                        greater depth, and so far that was encouraging. Until they went even deeper
                        it was impossible to say that they had anything like exhausted the
                        possibilities of the mine, and the view of the directors, which was strongly
                        backed up by the consulting engineers, was that it would be a great mistake
                        to allow the thing to die out without subjecting tho mine to a veiy thorough
                        teat. Having arrived at that conclusion, the next thing the directors hail
                        to consider was as to how best to set about it. Obviously anoth or
                        reconstruction would have been very hard upon the shareholders,as some of
                        them perhaps would not have been able to follow their money, and would
                        therefore be frozen out. </p>

                    <p>Monsieur Albert Fouguee-Duparc, first Secretary to the Embassy and French
                        Consul- General in Beyrout, returned hore, after a three months' leave, on
                        Friday by the S.S. Yang Tse of the Messageries Maritimes. The French

                        representatives of the Vilayet and the M uteeearifyat of Lebanon, and' a
                        number of distinguished friends welcomed him on board. The packet-yacht Isle

                        here yesterday, after a cruise in Spain, trance, and the Levapt. The Isle de

                        Land. ' In view of the services rendered by Mr. Gaudin, Director General of
                        the Hamidieh Hejaaz Railway, the Sultan lias been pleased to confer on him
                        the title of Pasha with a corresponding high grade. Tho representatives of
                        the German and French element on the Grand tine are now put on a footing of
                        equality. Mrs. Lawrence Oliphant, tho talented writer and wifo of tho
                        well-known novelist and philosopher of Caiffa fame, left for England by the
                        the Scottish Princo on tho 30th ultimo. Mrs. Oliphant will bo shortly
                        publishing nn amplification of her original, and already known work,
                        treating on religion ns viewed with the eyes of science, and which has beep
                        thought out and written during a long sojourn of soveral years in a calm
                        retreat on Mount Carmel. Mrs. Oliphant has in her possession, as a relic
                        from her second artist-husband, a painting having all tho characteristics of
                        the well-known French master Corot. As ap American lady artist originally
                        put it, in Corot's pictures there is, as it were, n background of ivory
                        relieved by a fleecy cotton wool veil. In the smnll painting in tho
                        possession of Mrs. Oliphant there is that vory curious mixture of solid
                        ivory tint with the soft floecy effect blended together, and there is
                        moreover the usual tiiemo of a cow, a tree and a woman. Students of tho
                        great French master wj|l, await with interest the pronouncement of French
                        oxpoi ts in Paris, to whom Mrs. Oliphant means to submit the picture. If it
                        turns out to be u genuine Corot it may be vnlued at not less than £1500.

                    <p>A most successful gymkhana was held at the Polo Club ground, Nicosia, on the
                        6th instant, that being tho Greek Easter Monday. The day was regurded as a
                        holiday by the Greek community, and the Government offices, which are mainly
                        staffed by Greeks, were virtually closed after 11 a.m. It was therefore
                        jiossiblo to mako tho gymkhana a whole day fixture. Tho programme consisted
                        of fourteen events, and the attendance was large. The entries did not soem
                        to _bo quite so numerous as usual, but this may bo accounted for by the
                        increased expense of keeping ponies. The usual events such as tent pegging,
                        and tilting at the ring were included in the programme and both ladies and
                        gentlemen appeared to show better form in the last named competition than on
                        former occasions, other features of the programme were : polo on donkeys,
                        Indies' hoop race, trotting races, scurries, whisling coon race, tug of wnr
                        on donkeys, ladies bangle race, poet laureate race, potato race for men,
                        needle threading race, anil relay race. Tho High Commissioner and the
                        Government House party were present throughout the day and Alias Biddulph

                    <p>The annual report of the Chief Medical Officer in the year 1900 is officially
                        published with a few exceptions tho general health of lie I-land is reported
                        to have been, on tho while, good. Malarial fevers were remarkable for there
                        decrease. Tho number of patients Ireutedqfor it in tho various hospitals and
                        dispensaries throughout the Island being only 5,761, while in the previous
                        year there were 16,l0l. This decrease is attributed principally to climatic
                        conditions, although the better precaution taken by the people to avoid
                        infec- nml the free issue of quinine from all the district and rural
                        dispensaries must have reduced the mediums of infection. We read there is no
                        doubt that pulmonary tuberculosis won the increase, principally in the
                        towns.</p>

                        was uuable to work. "Two years ago I began using l'eruns and It bnllt up my

                        some Peruna, which makes me well again. "I also advised it for my daughter

                        making. "A bottle of Pernna made such a change In her that she has been able
                        to follow her trade ever since. "J also Induced a young lady, who was all
                        rundown and confined to tho bouse, to tako Pornua, and after taking Peruna

                    <head>ACCIDENTS 10 LABOURERS.</head>
                    <p>ACCIDENTS 10 LABOURERS. A correspondent writes :—Several of this class of
                        accident have been reported lately, and, as a matter of fact, there is a
                        very regular harvest of such accidents. The responsibility for them is,
                        however, quite another question and is a question of very considerable
                        importance. Naturally tho first point is to lessen their frequency, and this
                        can only be done by survoillance. As to by whom this should be done there
                        seems some doubt. The contractor is usually held responsible by his contract
                        with tho person for whom he builds or excavates. The accidonta I refer to,
                        however, are happily comparatively rare in connection with contracting firms
                        of any importance and they mainly occur in jerry building works, and the
                        demolition, by irresponsible persons, of very ancient buildings. Wo should
                        think, however, that something could bo done to lessen the heavy death roll
                        ; where human life is at stake surely some means could be devised for the
                        protection of the practically defenceless'labourer, who has no Board of
                        Trade to care for his safety, or a workmen's compensation act in the event
                        of his being injured or killeJ by the fault of the party from whom he
                        receives his wages. It is to be hoped that these remarks will lie taken in
                        the spirit in which they are offered : a strong hand brought to Itear on
                        employers found guilty of carelessness of tho safety of their workmen will
                        lie found very salutary, although at the same time the employer must use
                        every care to prevent the foolish fatalism of the native labourer from
                        bringing him within the reach of tho law by neglecting the most elementary
                        precautions. </p>

                        causes (for they are almost numberless), its symptoms are much the same; the
                        more prominent being sleeplessness, sense of prostration or weariness,
                        depression of spirits and want of energy for all the ordinary affairs of
                        life. Now, what alone is absolutely essential in all such cases is increased
