A faulty Publiontion
                        In a recent issue we commented upon the new, edition of the Koran which has been published by the Ministry of Public Instruc taon, as containing ten thousand errors "when issued by the National Press." We now find that the latter part of this information is incorrect, inasmuch as the edition in question was printed in Vienna, and has now been forwarded to the National Press to be destroy ed, and a new edition is to printed by them. We regret that the capabilities of the National Press should have been questioned, and trust that this paragraph may meet the eyes of all who read the former one. L'illustration

                        INTERNATIONAL CONVENTIONS.
                        ADVANTAGES OF IRRIGATION.
                        We append berewith the full text of Lord Cromer's speech at the Guildhall on the occasion of the presentation of the freedom of the City of London. We give also, extracts i from the comments of the leading organs of the London Press as illustrative of the approval with which a discourse of the greatest ProConsul of the era has been received.
                        Sir Joseph Dimsdale in the eloquent address which you have just heard has been kind enongh to allude in terms which I cannot but think are too flattering ("No") to my public services. Whatever services it has been my good fortune to render to my Sovereign and to my country have been amply perhaps some would think too amply-rewarded. But certainly no distinction which I have received bas afforded me greater pleasure than that which you have now conferred upon me. I thank you most sincerely for considering me worthy to be inscribed on the rolls containing many illustrious names of those who have received the freedom of this great and ancient City. It is one of the highest bonours to which a British subject could aspire. I should have done little in Egypt but for the occurrence of adventitious circumstances over which I could exercise but little or no control. In the first place, foreign | affairs, to the great advantage of the public and to the credit of the statesmen belonging to both the great political divisions of this country, have of late years been lifted to a great extent out of the somewhat heated atmosphere of party strife. This fortunate circumstance certainly facilitated the conclusion by Lord Lansdowne, or perhaps I should more correctly say the conclusion by that very I eminent diplomatist his Majesty the King cloud cheers) and Lord Lansdowne, of the Anglo-French Convention, which has been received with such universal approval in this country, and to which Sir Joseph Dimsdale has alluded. This approval bas recently received striking confirmation in the very cordial reception given to the distinguished Frenchmen who recently paid a visit to this City and were the guests of the Lord Mayor. (Cheers.)
                        THE ANGLO-RUSSIAN CONVENTION.
                        This Convention, you are aware, has been followed, as was hoped and anticipated three years ago, by the statesmanlike arrangement recently concluded with the Russian Government under the auspices of Sir Edward Grey (eheers), under whom it bas been my privilege to serve recently and for whose loyal and consistent support under circumstances of no common difficulty I wish to take this opportunity of proffering my most grateful thanks. "The Russian Convention has, I am aware, been criticised by some of our countrymen, constituting I believe a small minority, on the somewhat strange ground that they are not satisfied with the internal policy of the Russian Government. They consider that until that polioy is arranged according to their satisfaction no diplomatie arrangement with Russia is justifiLable. In speaking to an audience largely com posed of business men, I think the only answer I need make to that criticism is to remind you that one of the surest methods of achieving success in almost every walk of life is to pay attention exclusively to one's own business. (Laugbter and cheers.) I have derived the
                        utmost benefit from a strict adherence to this - homely maxim throughout my long career,
                        and I even venture to commend it to others, more especially because those who have lived | abroad so much as myself are aware that we are rather prone, as a nation, to incur the impntation of being somewhat free in offering advice to others about matters which either do not concern us, or which, at all events, concern us only remotely. Foreigners are apt to think that there are a good many affairs nearer home which might profitably occupy our attention. The internal affairs of Russia are inderd a matter of more than academic interest to the rest of the world, but I cannot help thinking that the Russiaus must be left to work out their own political salvation, and that they are not likely to derive any very great practical benefit from the advice of others necessarily only halt inforued of the facts as to the best line of conduct to be parsued by the Dumas and other indigenous institutions. In any case, although I do not know whether international boycotting is to form part of what I understand is called the new diplomacy, I am, for my own part, sufficiently old-fashioned to prefer the more conventional method of allowing British interests to form the basis of diplomatic action abroad, to the exclusion as far as possible of all extraneous and more or less irrelevant matter. And from this point of view, althongh, of course, some concessions have had to be made in order to secure an agreement, I venture to think that the AngloRussian Convention is capable of the most ample justification. (Cheers.)
                        | DIPLOMACY AND PARTY POLITICS.
                        To return one moment to the question of party strife. I certainly regard this matter t mainly from the point of view of a permanent
                        official who during a long period of years has bad to carry ont the instructions of whatever Ministers were in power, and from this point of view I have no hesitation in saying that the tendency of recent years to remove foreign affairs from the acute stage of party discussion
                        has been of immense benefit to British red presentatives abroad. It has enabled some Jleontinuity of polioy to be possible. Possibly</p>
                    <p>few of those who are not behind the scenes of Government recognise fully the extremely embarrassing position created for an unfortunatelt diplomatist abroad if he is suddenly called upon to sbont from the down to the up line. The operation is always one of some difficulty, and unless the pointsman be very skilful may even be attended with some danger. (Hear, hear.) Few, also, perbaps recognize how diffioult it is, when an acute party discussion begins, to prevent being associated, or at all! events to prevent having the appearance of being associated, with one or other side. This is in itself an evil; for the duty of permanent officials is not to belong to a party, except perhaps the party of common sense, whose views are perhaps somewhat undaly ignored(the concluding words of the sentence were drowned by the laughter and cheers of the andience). Then I have been aided by another adventitious circumstance. I have been fortunate enough to secure the co-operation of many admirable coadjutors, one of the most able of whom, Sir Eldon Gorst (eheers), has recently taken my place. I wish him every success, and I am sure he will achieve it, more especially if he does not allow himself to be burried by what I must call the faddists in this country, and the numerous tribe who sym. pathize with them in Egypt, and who look to London as a sort of political Mecca. (Cheers.)
                        THE DRAIN OF GOLD. I turn to another point. As I am speaking in the largest commercial centre in the world, perbaps it may not be out of place that I should say something in connexion with trade matters, but I wish at once to remove any misapprehension from your minds--I have not the smallest intention of alluding to those stormdriven subjects, tariff reform or free trade. (Laughter.) I wish to say something about the drain of gold to Egypt, wbich I am aware has attracted and great deal of attention, and perhaps excited some uneasiness in this City, I need hardly say it is due to the necessity of financing the cotton crop. It is likely, as far As can be at present judged, to be of annual occurrence, the reason being that the cotton crop is assured. This was not always so. In ancient times when the Nilometer, which has existed froin time immemorial in Cairo, recorded low figures, these were terned by the inha bitants "the angels of death." Nor was this a misnomer. A low Nile meant misery, distress, and even famine. I remember 30 years ago, when I first went to Egypt in 1877 there was a very low Nile, and the people in many of the provincial towns were, so I was informed, living on the refuse and garbage they picked up in the streets. Thousands died from starvation of the diseases incident to bad and unwholesome living. This has now all been changed under the auspices of Sir Colin Moncrieff, Sir William Garstin, and other eminent hydraulic engineers, who have been recently in the employment of the Egyptian Government, and who may be fitly called the makers of modern Egypt. (Cheers ) The country has now been well-nigh secured against the vieirsitudes of the season. I hear that this year the Nile is the lowest on record, and although the last accounts of the cotton crop are not so favour able as those received a month ago, at the same time it is probable that the crop will be extremely favourable. The result of this is that every year some 25 to 30 millions will have to be found to finance this erop, the whole of which will be exported. A most remark: able feature of this commercial transaction is that a great deal of the money that goes to Egypt never comes back again. During the last four years the imports of gold into Egypt have amounted to 13 millions more than the exports. What becomes of this vast quantity of coin ? It is almost impossible to give an answer to this question based on any accurate figures or statisties. It is, however, certain that, besides the small quantity which foyda its way into the interior of Africa, a great deal is converted into jewelry. I was informed on very high authority that no less than one and a half to two millions were thus disposed of
                        la-t year. Hoarding is carried on to an extent - which appears almost incredible to Europeans.
                        I will give a few instances. A little wbile ago | I heard of an Egyptian gentleman who died - leaving a fortune of £80,000, the whole of
                        which was in gold coin in his cellars. (Laughter.)
                        Then, again, I heard of a sub-tantial yeoman 1-a village sheikh as he is called in Egypta class enormously increa-ed in wealth and prosperity in recent years, who bought a property for £25,000. Half an hour alter the contract was signed he appeared with a train
                        of donkeys bearing on their backs the money, - which had been buried in bis garden. I hear El that on the occasion of a fire in a provincial
                        town no less than £5,000 was found hidden in earthen pots. I could multiply instances of this sort. There can be no doubt that the practice
                        of hoarding is carried on to an excessive |degree. The creation of savings banks, the increased circulation of paper money, and addi
                        tional banking facilities will, it is hoped, I gradually wean the natives of Egypt from this uneconomical habit, perbaps, but it will be a
                        slow process, as, indeed, all educational pro- cesses are slow.
                        THE RECENT "SLUMP" IN EGYPTIAN UNDER TAKINGS: To turn to another point of some financial importance, there bas been recently what is called a slump in some Egyptian undertakings.
                        I do not doubt that some individuals who detserve every sympathy have suffered, but I
                        cannot think that from and more general point of view repent occurrences are to be regretted. It may be hoped they will do something to stop the over-speculation which has been such la very marked, and also such and very mischievous, feature in the Egyptian markets of recent years, that over-speculation has taken place more especially in town lands - and here, again, I will give you an illustration of</p>
                    <p>what has taken place. Some 16 years ago the British Government bought a plot of land for their official representative. They paid between £3,000 and £4,000. At the prices which were obtaining only a very short time ago the value of that land is at least a quarter of a million fo And this is no extreme instance. There are a to great many others of even a more striking it description. It was quite manifest that this b period of inflation could not last, and what has now occurred has been foreseen all along by those who kept their heads. The prosperity of the country is in no way suffering. The wealth of Egypt is essentially agricultural. 1. know of but two risks to which it is exposed. I have already stated that the supply of cotton is assured If the demand for Egyptian cotton were to fall off undoubtedly great emharrassment would be caused; but I know of no reason for supposing that any such contint geney will arise. Indeed, the world's demand for cotton is steadily increasing. PROSPERITY LARGELY DEPENDENT
                        ON POLICY. The other risk is of a totally different des cription. The financial prosperity of Egypt undoubtedly dewapds to a great extent on the policy adopted in that country. I take this opportunity of saying that I think it would be a mistake to take too seriously the proceedings of what are called the Egyptian Nationalists, or of their friends in this country. Some of the | latter, inasmuch as they appear to me to mislead the Egyptians as to the true trend of publie opinion in this country and to encour age them in the hope that political develop ments will be much more rapid than can be at all possible, I am wont to regard as the worst enemies to Egyptian progress. (Cheers ) When 1 say Egyptian Nationalists I do not wish to be misunderstood. I am not allading to those who are in favour of a moderate and reasonable and gradual extension of self-governing institations. These have my entire sympathy, and throughout my career in Egypt I have done my best | to encourage them. I allade to the extremists, who exist in Cairo, as also in Caleatta and in Dublin. (Laughter. With these gentlemen I do not think it is possible to deal. They willnot be conciliated save on terms which in India and Ireland spell political scieide, and in Egypt would involve a relapse into all the misgovernment and disorder of the past (Cheers.) It is to be remembered that the East, though very assimilative, does not always assimilate those portions of whatever European civilization it is brought in contact with. Just at present some of the youth of India and Egypt appearto be basing their political conduct on the proceedingsofagitators in this country and I notice indeed that, with what I certainly consider almost culpable folly, an itinerant member of Parliament--Mr Keir Hardie-appears to have accepted the ill-regulated enthusiasm of a portion, and that certainly by no means the wisest portion, of the community in Bengal. The agitators in India will, I do not doubt, should the pasion arise, be kept well in hand by the firmness and sagacity of the Viceroy, and of the eminent statesman who now presides at the India Office. (Loud cheers.) For my owo part I say I see but one method of dealing with this unrest and disturbance in Egypt and in India. It is to continue steadily to do our duty towards the people of those two countries, to come down with a heavy hand upon extremists should they overstap the limits of the law, but not to be deterred by their presence</p>
                    <p>or by their proceedings from adopting soch reforms as are calculated to satisfy the aspir-12 ation of all moderate and reasonable men. (Cheers.) I fear I have already detained yon too long. I will say no more, but thank you for the attention with which you have listened to me. Again I proffer to you my very sincere thanks for the high honour which you bave been good enough to confer upon me. (Loud cheers.)
                        HOME PRESS OPINIONS, "The Times."
                        Lord Cromer yesterday added his name to the long list of illustrious names that grace the burgess-roll of the City of London. The freedom of the City bestowed upon a publie servant is, as Lord Cromer observed, one of the highest honours to which a British subject can aspire. Lord Cromer notes that foreign affairs have of late years been lifted to a great extent out of the beated atmosphere of party strife. Fortunately that is so, yet it was not so to an equal degree when Lord Croner began his work. If Egypt was gradually excluded from the political arens, it was largely due to the personal qualities of an administrator wbo compelled the confidence of men of all parties. It in other countries than our own the same mollifying process went on, it was again be canse Lord Cromer, in spite of all antecedent prejudice, won the respect, and finally the con fidence, of foreign statesmen and foreign financiers." Morning Post
                        Lord Cromer was not content with the formal reply of the courtier, but spoke his mind plainly to bis countrymen Keep your toreign policy outside of and above your domestic party disputes ; let its cue be England's minding her own business ; attach yourselves to the party of commonsense, which is that of England, and is a greater party than that of either Conservatives or Liberals, and make it your role in all your governing to pnt first your duty to those governed, regardless of extreme men whether in Cairo, in Calcutta, or in Dublin, or even, he might have added lif he had not credited his hearers with shrewdness enough to extend the application, in Westminster itself. Lord Cromer Jis not the only statesman who could at this
                        moment have given that advice to bis country. men, but he is perhaps the only one from whom men of all parties will accept it without demur. The "Telegraph."
                        Lord Cromer, by universal consent, is admitted to be one of the greatest of living Englishmen . Practically every bonour in the power of his Sovereign and Lifellowcountrymen to bestow has been showered upon him, and it will be hard for posterity to rate his work more highly than his contemporaries have done..... Lord Cromer spoke most hopefully of the future of Egypt, in a strain that will be quite familiar to those who have been accustomed to read bis masterly annual reports on the state of Egypt and the Soudan. He has always endeavoured to pot a check on the spirit of over-speculation, which seeks to exploit the development of a country and make it run before it can hardly stand steady on its feet. The material prosperity of Egypt depends upon the cotton crop, and the cotton crop depends opon the Nile.
                        Lord Cromer's speech deserves to be read</p>
                    <p>side by side with the recent utterance of Mr John Morley; and when two such different master minds come to the same conclusion, the ordinary Englishman Deed have no anxiety about either the practical wisdom of the essential justice of a policy wbich is only questioned by vapouring theorists, who ignore or misread history or who are influenced by purely selfith interesta. The "standerd."
                        It was in no formal or colourless terms that Jord Cromer acknowledged the honour of being admitted to the freedom of the City of London He spoke out from his heart, and without stint drew upon the stored experience of a life dedicated to the service of the Empere.
                        Lord Cromer dealt too lightly, we think, with itinerant agitators, like Mr. Keir Hardie, who set themselves to spread troable amongst peoples neither trained nor fit for the mixed blessings of democratie government. He dismissed it as "almost calpable folly," and thought it, apparently, not more serious than the daily scurrilousness of the paid seribes whom he has not thought it worth while te suppress at Cairo and Alexandria. With a touch of good-humoured disdain, he advised his friends in the City of London not to take too seriously the utterances of the extreme Nationalists in any part of the world (Ireland not excepted) The "Tribune."
                        The problems of India and Egypt, as British problems, are fundamentally similar, in spite of obvious differences. If in Egypt the native population is not so terribly complex as in India, there is a far more complicated welter of alien interests; and the "Egyptian nation ality" to which Lord Cromer has looked forward is one which will inelade "all the dwellers in Egypt, irrespective of race, religion, or extraction. Thanks to the continuous foreign policy of recent years ---by which we do not mean merely that Sir Edward Grey has not reversed the policy of Lord Lansdowne, but that Lord Salisbury eventually came round to the Liberal policy of ruling out the Turk - Lord Cromer found himself freed, as he frankly admits, from the danger of serions interference with his work from outside. The "Dally Chronicle."
                        "The duty of the permanent official," said Lord Cromer at the Guilhall, is not to belong to any party, except perhaps the party of common-senise." To that party there is no firmer adherent than the distinguished public ser vant whom the City wisely delighted to ho npur yesterday. Common sense, said Goethe, is the genius of humanity. It is certainly the genius of Lord Cromer, and one of the chief secrets of his success. Lord Cromer's speech is a justification of some words once used by one of the many Foreign Secretaries under whom he has served. "If there is one thing in my | life," said Lord Rosebery. "which I should like to live after me, it is that when I first went to the Foreign Office I argued for and maintained the principle of continuity in foreign policy. My view was this, that whatever our domestie, differences may be at home, we should preserve a united front abroad, and that foreign statesmen and foreign Courts should feel that they are dealing, not with a Ministry possibly fleeting and possibly transient, but with a great powerful, and united nation."</p>

                        The members of the Court of Common Council of the City of London had a pleasant surprise at their meeting last Thursday, when the Earl of Cromer came in with the City Chamberlain, Sir Joseph Dimsdale, and took a vacant seat on the left of the Lord Mayor. Hearty cheers greeted the appearance of the distinguished visitor, and the Lord Mayor said they were very pleased to see Lord Cromer look in on them in that informal way. In welcoming him, he would like to say that if Lord Cromer cared to address a few words to them they would be very pleased to hear him. Lord Cromer: I thank you very much gentlemen, but I siraply called to see the Chamberlain, and I trust you will excuse my making a speech. Shortly afterwards Lord Cromer left.

                        THE GERMAN SCANDALS.
                        BERLIN, November 6. Herr Brand has been sentenced to 18 months imprisonment. Prince von Buelow declared that the charges were insensate: He regarded the tendencies ascribed to him as abhorrent and incomprehensible. The unexpected appearence of Prince Philip Evlenberg who came from a sick-bed and was unable to stand caused a sensation in the court. He testified that be knew his friend Prince von Buelow from his youth and that he never heard abnormal inclinations attributed to him. He emphatically denied such inclinations himself and earnestly emphasised that he never intrigued against Prince von Baelow.

                        MONEY AND SHARE MARKET.
                        (FROM OUR FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT),
                        London, November 1. The Money Market. | It would not be correct to say as yet that | the calm has followed the storm in the United
                        States, but the position has certainly shown | considerable improvement during the past few days. There have been further suspensions of banks, but none of these have been of importance, and have been mostly in the smaller provincial towns.
                        The great need of the moment is gold, and the forecasts we gave last week that early demands might be made on the Bank of England has been quite justified by events. Already something like three and half millions have been withdrawn for America, and there is that prospect that more will be required before the stringency is relieved. The constant rans on the New York and other banks has, of course, taken a enormous quantity of money out of cirenlation, from £12,000,000 to £15,000,000 and until the confidence of the public has been restored, it is probable that much of this cash will remain out of circulation.
                        It is reported to-day that a bankers' syndicate, headed by Messrs. J. P. Morgan and Co. has arranged to purchase at par six per cent. New York City Revenue bonds to the amount of 30,000,000 dollars, with the option of acquiring a further 20,000,000 dollars in bonds on the same terms. It is stated that a large portion of this issue will be marketed abroad, in which case further gold will be taken from London for America.
                        Orders have been received at the Mint at Philadelphia for the immediate coinage of 15,000,000 dollars in double eagles (gold 20dollar pieces) in order to relieve the stringency.
                        The heavy exports of gola to America have left the directors of the Bank of England no option but to increase their official minimum to 59 per cent. It is believed that this will have the effect of attracting gold from the Continent, and of checking the demands from the States.
                        The reserve this week shows a reduction of no less than £3,185,000. The exports of gold amounted to £2,761,000 (i.e. up till Wednesday) of which £465,000 went to Egypt, and the stock of coin and bullion is down £3,044,000, while the Active Note Circulation has risen £140 000.
                        The total reserve now stands at £20,834,000, as compared with £18,157,000 a year ago, and the proportion to liabilities, is 39.91 per cent. as against 365 per cent. last year. An interesting feature of the return is the advance of £5,066.000 in "Other" Securities in con sequence of the heavy discounting and loan business done by the Bank during the past week.
                        After the announcement of the rise in the Bank rate, the joint stock banks increased their rates for deposits to 4 per cent and the discount houses are now allowing 4 and 47 per cent. for call and notice respectively. Three months' paper was quoted at the close 54-58 per cent.</p>

                        The silver market has relapsed somewhat after last week's recovery, bat the tone was rather better yesterday, and the price for immediate delivery, after being 27, tod., closed better at 27, to The Stook Markots.
                        The advance in money rates, and the prospect of even firmer conditions in the money market have operated against stocks and shares on the Stoek Exchange during the past week. The fortnightly settlement was awaited with no little anxiety, as it was known that in some quarters there were considerable differences to be met. It is therefore very satisfactory to know that only two failures, and these not of importance, have been announToed. This favourable result of the settlement has naturally done much to relieve the feeling of depression which was general, and the tone during the whole of yesterday was quite cheerful. The advance in the Bank rate had | been anticipated, and the effect upon markets was good rather than otherwise, as it was felt that this would effectively reduce the exports to America.
                        Now that the excitement in the American section has simmered down somewhat, far. seeing investors are picking up some of the better class shares at the present low prices,
                        and this has given strength to the market, - but the more conservative feel that such a
                        severe panie is not to be got over in a few days, or weeks for that matter, and there is much wreckage yet to be dealt with. To day's telegrams on the general trade conditions ruling in the United States are far from re assoring, and all this will tend to keep people anxious as to the outcome for some time yet. To-day being the 1st of November, the Stock Exchange is closed in accordance with custom. Consola.
                        The market for gilt edged securities is now much firmer. Consols, which at one time had fallen to 814 for the account, yesterday rallied to 827. aud closed firm at this price. Foreign Bonds.
                        The selling of Japanese bonds on American account continued for the greater part of the week, and the list throughout showed daily declines. Yesterday, however, the tone was better, and quotations rallied all-round. The second series of 45 per cents. left off with an advance of at 89, and gains of tot were marked in the other stocks,
                        Russians have been quiet, and at the close last night quotations were unchanged on the week. Home Rails.
                        The most significant feature of yesterday's rally on the Stock Exchange was the spurt in home railway shares. This market, atter being in the depths of depression for weeks, suddenly developed quite a buoyant tone, and prices advanced all-round. London and North Western closed no less than 3 points higher at 135, while there were was a gain of 2in the case of Great Norther. Midland Deferred and Brighton "A" were up 2, Great Western 17. Chatham. and Dover 41% 2nd, Preserence and North Western Consols 15, South Western Deferred 17, and Great Eastern 1.
                        This firmness of home railway shares is doubtless attributable to the brighter outlook for an amicable settlement of the dispute be tween the companies and the Amalgamated Society, as the result of the efforts of Mr. Lloyd-George. The President of the Board of Trade had a further conference with the railway directors yesterday morning, which was adjourned till later in the day, and it was afterwards reported that a conciliation board might be formed. The result of the men's ballot will be declared on Sunday at a mass meeting to be held at the Albert Hall, and until then nothing can be known as to this. The general opinion is, however, that the probabilities of a strike are now remote. Americans.
                        In the early part of the week the American section was affected by the disturbed condition of Wall Street, but yesterday the advices from the other side were more favourable, and the tone was much firmer for the greater part of the day. To an extent this advance was due to bear closing, but the most helpful feature was the receipt of a substantial quantity of good investmentorders from New York. The lead was taken by Union Pacific, there being considerable dealings in these shares. The price opened about 114, and before the close had advanced to 117, a gain of eight dollars on balance. Southern Pacific advanced 44 to 71, Aitchison and Milwaukee 34 to 797 and 1073, Great Northern 3 to 116, and Baltimore and Ohio 27, to 839. Egyptians.
                        During the past week prices in the Egyptian market have fallen away somewhat, this being entirely accounted for by the trouble in America and the dearer money conditions now prevailing. The undertone is good, and it is generally recognised that everything points to the future prosperity of Egypt. Business has been on a small scale throughout the week. National Bank closed practically at the lowest last night, being offered at 21, and Agricultural Bank closed weak at 88. The Preference keep steady at 91, and the 31% Debentures at 82-4, but buyers of this latter stock are very shy at present. Delta Preference Bearer have fallen to 10 t, after being as low as 10, but Delta Lands and Investment Advanced from 14 to 18 bid.

                        The mining market shared in the general recovery, after being dull and neglected. In the leading Kaffir descriptions there were gains up to Rand Mines recovering the 8/32 lost the previous day. Diamonds opened firm, but gave way somewhat later in the day. Premier Deferred, however, advanced 1 to 99. Several of the Rhodesian shares registered small advances. Tanganyika were very firm and left off 2s.6d higher at 27.
                        Mach interest is being taken in the Egyptian mining section in the reconstruction scheme of the Egyptian Mines Exploration Company. It is proposed that a new company be formed to be called the Egyptian Mines Development Company, Ltd, with a capital of £60,000 divided into 240,000 shares of 67-. each.
                        Of these, 215,000 shares will be issued to present shareholders share for share, credited with 1/-s. per share paid, and a bability of 4's. per sbare. The directors add that of all the shares are taken up a sum of £48,000 will be raised, which, with strict economy, should bring the mines into a developed state, and it should then be more easy to provide the necessary funds for the larger, and, doubtless. more economical method of working."
                        The announcement of the reconstruction has had no effect upon the shares of the company, which are unchanged, in common with the rest of the market.

                        Both oured by DR. WILLIAMS' PINK PILLS.
                        The sunshine of the home fades when mother, wife, or daughter falls ill. Yet women's ailments are invariably traceable to poverty of blood and nervous disturbances. Therein lier the special value to women of Dr. Williams Pink Pills for Pale People ; they cleanse and enrich bad blood, steady the nerves and keep women strong and always well. Two cures in one home by Dr. Williams' Pink Pills are recorded by Mrs. Hutchinson and Miss L Hutchinson, of 7, John-street, Newcastle-on Tyne.
                        THE MOTHER'S STATEMENT. "Three years ago I felt run-down," said Mrs. Hutchinson, "my limbs grew very weak, and splitting headaches seized me. Pains in my back and shoulders rendered me helpless. 1 would often stagger as I walked across the room. My sight became blurred and my tongue coated. My liver grew disordered, and all food became distasteful.
                        "I could not sleep at night for palpitations of the heart seized me, and all day I felt tired, languid, and listless. I made the mistake of taking common medicines, instead of realising that the only cure possible was to enrich my blood.
                        "A friend who had derived great benefit from Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People, persuaded me to begin a course of that medi cine. I did, and after taking only a few boxes I was a changed woman. My blood became rich, my sallow appearance gave way to a healty colour, I enjoyed my food and refreshing sleep and was completely restored to health when I had used six boxes of Dr. Williams' Pink Pills."
                        HER DAUGHTER Also. Just when my daughter Lizzie reached the anxious age of young womanhood she became anæmie. Her face grew pale and she was no longer bright and cheerful, but became listless and languid. She cansed me no little anxiety until I administered Dr. Williams' Pink Pills. In three weeks a remarkable change for the better came over her. She had complained of indigestion also, but all traces of this and anæmia left her, and her veins were filled with rich, red blood by Dr. Williams' Pink Pills.".
                        By making Good, Rich, Red Blood--that is how Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People have cured Aneemia, General Weakness. De. eline, Backaches Headaches, Indigestion, Eczema, Rheumatism, Sciatica, Neuralgia, and Paralysis ; also women's ailments,
