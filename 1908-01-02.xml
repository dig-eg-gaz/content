                    <head>GREAT BIBLICAL DISCOVERY IN EGYPT</head>

                    <p>One discovery follows fast on another in Egypt. Now, on the very heels of the
                        dis covery of Menander, we have what looks much like the recovery of lost
                        chapter from the Book of Nehemiah, at Assouan, for some extraordinary papyri
                        has been found by excavators in Egypt which showed that the Jews had a
                        temple there as well as in Jerusalem. </p>
                    <p>Previously some Jewish business fragments had been found which showed that
                        the Jews in Egypt in Jeremiah's time worshipped Jehovah under the name of
                        Yahu. But M. Clermont-Ganneau has given "Le Teumps" an account of this new
                        discovery, and the translation made by the German scholar, Dr. Sachan. The
                        document is a copy of a petition sent by the Jews of Elephantine, an island
                        at Assouan to the Persian Governor Bagohi (Bagoas of Josephus), in the
                        seventeenth year of Darius telling how, when Egypt was conquered by
                        Cambyses, their Jewish temple was spared, while the Egyptian temples were
                        destroyed. But during the absence of the Satrap of Egypt the worshippers of
                        the god Khnum had persuaded the local Governor to give orders to have their
                        temple destroyed, and during the three years since they had been in deep
                        mourning. </p>
                    <p>"They had appealed in vain for help to the Jewish high priest Jehohanan, and
                        had written to the acts of Sanballat at Samaris, and now they begged Bagohi
                        to allow them to rebuild their temple, in which case they would be able to
                        burn incense there, and would pray for him and send him a thousand talents
                        of silver. This petition was granted. The special interest of this doeument
                        lies in the fact that it shows that in Egypt, as well as in Jerusalem, the
                        Jews had their temple and performed ritual services. Also Sanballat and
                        Jehohanan are both Bible characters. Sanballat was the enemy of the Jews
                        under Nehemiah, and Jehonahan is mentioned in Ezra x. 6 and Neh. xii. 23;
                        while this seems to be the same Jebohanan who, accord King to Josephus,
                        murdered his brother Joshua. </p>
                    <p>We are able to give our readers an English translation of part of this
                        remarkable letter for which we are indebted to professor Driver, in the
                        London "Guardian". Thus we have it a accredited by three of the very best
                        Oriental scholars of Germany, France, and England - Professor Sachau, M.
                        Clermont-Gauneau and Professor Driver. It i s follows: </p>
                    <p>"To our lord Bagohi, Governor of Judah, thy servants, Yedoniah and his
                        companions, the priests, in the fortress Yeb (Blephantine) </p>
                    <p>"From the Tammuz day of the 14th year of King Darias to this day we have put
                        on sack cloth and fasted; our wives are become like widows; we have not
                        anointed ourselves with oil or drunk wine ; neither from that day to this
                        day of the 17th year of King Darius (40 B.C.) have meal offerings
                        frankincense, or burnt-offerings been offered in this Temple. Now,
                        therefore, thy servante, Yedoniah and his companions, and the Jews, all the
                        citzens of Yeb, may thus: If it seem good to our lord, think upon this
                        Temple that it may be built, because we are not permitted to build it, look
                        spon the recipients of thy goodness and of thy mercy who are here in Egypt </p>
                    <p>"May a letter be sent from thee to them concerning the Temple of the God Yahu
                        that it may built in the fortress Yeb, as it was built in former times. And
                        we will offer meal offering and frankincense and burnt offerings upon the
                        altar of the God Yahu in thy name. And we will pray for thee at all times,
                        we and our wives and our children, and all the Jews who are here, if thou
                        doest thus, until the Tenuple is built. And thou shalt have a portion before
                        Yahu, the God of Heaven, from every one who offers to him burnt-offering and
                        sacrifices, in value equivalent to... And no concerning the gold, concerning
                        that we have sent we made known. We huve also sent the matters in letter in
                        oor name to Delaiah and Shelemiah, the sons of Sarballat, the Governor of
                        Samarin.</p>
                    <p>Ansam also has no knowledge of all this that has been done to as. </p>
                    <p>"The 20th of Marcheshvan (November), in the 17th year of King Darius.' </p>
                    <p>What is of very great interest is this almost biblical record in the fact
                        that a splendid temple of Jehovah was in existence in Upper Egypt shortly
                        after the time of Jeremiah; that sacrifices were offered there as at
                        Jerusalem, notwithstanding the prohibition, and that the name of Jehovah was
                        in free use under the pronunciation Yahu </p>
                    <p>There is now no reason why we may not hope to find in Egypt copies of the old
                        Hebrew Seriptures antedating the revision of the text which took place in
                        the first century of our era. That would be a discovery indeed. </p>

                    <p>INTERESTING INTERVIEW.</p>
                    <p>(Gazette's special service.)</p>
                    <p>London, Thursday. </p>
                    <p>The Cairo correspondent of the "Daily Telegraph" has sent a long and
                        interesting account of an interview with the Khedive. His Highness said that
                        he was thoroughly satisfied and gratified with the progress that Egypt was
                        making and that he was convinced that he and his advisers were treading in
                        the right path. The Khedive, however, added that much remained still to be
                        done. His people were dependent on their agricultural labour and as long as
                        the chief produce of the country was cotton and the present prices were
                        maintained, the prosperity of the country most inevitably go on increasing,
                        as the area under cultivation was over widening.</p>
                    <p>The Khedive expressed his delight at the return of Sir Eldon Gorst to Egypt
                        and remarked on the sympathetic and enlightened interest which he took in
                        the country. In referring to education he said that he was proud of the
                        progress the Egyptians were making in this direction. The Khedive remarked
                        that be deeply deplored the tendency of a few young Egyptians to seek self
                        advertisement rather than the improvement of their country by legitimate
                        means. He was delighted, however, that all agitation was dying out and he
                        emphasised the entire absence of fanaticism. Referring to the Sudan his
                        Highness declared that he had every confidence in the Sirdar and his staff
                        and was gratified at the very material progress made during the last few
                        years. In concluding the interview the Khedive declared that he would be
                        delighted if Lord Cromer were to revisit Egypt.</p>

                    <p>PIGS IN EGYPT Last week a large consignment of pigs ar rived at Alexandria
                        from Servis, Bulgaria, Crete and Cyprus. On previous Occasions the pigs have
                        solely arrived here from Rhodes and Cyprus. The Bulgarian pigs have been
                        admitted to free pratique here by the Que rantine suthorities. But the
                        Servian pigs, which are of very distinguished appearance, reminding one of
                        our best home, breeds, have been kept in quarantine and will be killed in
                        the course of the next few days at the slaughterhouses at Alexandria. The
                        Cretan piga are fairly good. The total arrivals of pige last week at
                        Alexandris were over six hundred. It is not, however, to be expected that
                        pork will be any the cheaper, for butchers' prices in this country always go
                        up, just as do the rents, despite the crisis Up to date over 250,000 abeep

                        year, which is largely over the imports for any previous year, and yet the

                    <p>CHRISTMAS AT PORT SUDAN.</p>
                    <p>(FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT).</p>
                    <p>Port Sudan, December 26. </p>
                    <p>A smoking concert was held on Christinas Eve in the band room of the new
                        barracks, which was splendidly decorated for the occasion with flags and
                        bunting and made an excellent room for the concert. The chair was taken by
                        Kaimakam W. B Drury Bey. Needless to say the concert was a decided success,
                        and among the many who volunteered to perform was Mr. Buxton, who related a
                        few of his experiences and many witty tales, while Mr. Hamer sang and Mr.
                        Koop played the violin. Mr. Pool's songs were appreciated by all present,
                        and many encores were called for. Although it rained very hard just before
                        the start most of the English population decided to brave the elements and
                        turned up. The concert finished up at 2.30 a.m. with the Khedivial Anthem,
                        and "God save the King," after which three cheers were given for the
                        obairman.</p>
                    <p>On Christmas Day, service was held in the church, which had been splendidly
                        decorated. The Rev. Thom officiated and many people were present. On this
                        day most of the houses and the ships in harbour were decked out with
                        bunting, the S.S. "Prince Abbas" making an especially fine display.</p>
                    <p>FREGOLI </p>
                    <p>Fregoli !- The very name carries with it an air of wonderment and mystery,
                        and ever since Alexandrians awoke one fine morning to find the weird name on
                        every other paving stone, Fregoli has haunted them. It is now hardly
                        necessary to describe who or what Fregoli is, but sufficient to voice the
                        opinion of all who have witnessed his performance at the Alhambra Theatre,
                        as marvellous. His versatility is illimitable, his portrayal of various
                        characters never ending, and the perfection of his lightning changes
                        combined with accurate attention to every detail, even to deflexions of
                        voice, of every character he represents, stamp him as an artist of the first
                        water. </p>
                    <p>With a continual change of programme he does not tire his audiences with
                        repetitions, and although one may have seen a previous performance, a second
                        visit is not only advisable, but almost a necessity to realise his
                        capabilities. One may see him as a conductor impersonating past and present
                        lights of the musical world, and yet have no idea what he can do as a
                        magician à là Maskelyne and Devant, or sit and revel in his Louie Fuller
                        serpentine dance, and then not realise the perfection of his
                        one-man-six-character representation of "Faustino." It is almost impossible
                        to detail even one of his performances, we would rather criticise a whole
                        opera company, than attempt it, but one thing we must individualise; the
                        continual strain, and it must be excessive, of running a one-man
                        entertainment is having its effect upon Fregoli's voice, as at our last
                        visit a distinct and painful hoarseness was noticeable at every breath. We
                        however, trust this is only a temporary indisposition, and that he will
                        continue to delight crowded houses during the remainder of his stay at the
                        Alhambra.</p>

                    <p>A SERIOUS SITUATION.</p>
                    <p>(FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT)</p>
                    <p>Port Said, Tuesday. </p>
                    <p>The first batch of 200 blacklegs arrived here last night from Cairo and up
                        country. It was rumoured that these men were due to arrive on Sunday
                        afternoon and that several hundred strikers armed with sticks awaited their
                        arrival, intending to give them a warm welcome. On their arrival yesterday,
                        however, everything was quiet; they were met and escorted, to the harbour by
                        the mounted police from Cairo. Special accommodation has had to be built on
                        the east side of the canal, while some firms have built covers to lighters
                        and have housed them there.</p>
                    <p>Referring to my notes of Sunday, my statement that the Arabs are not
                        underpaid is fully confirmed by the fact that Europeans are offering
                        themselves for the same work and pay.</p>
                    <p>There have been several disturbances in the Arab village more or less serious
                        and last night I understand a store house was broken into and ransacked. It
                        is difficult to obtain official information as no one, European or Native,
                        is allowed in or out of the Arab village without a special permit, while the
                        Port Said police have handed over the patrolling of the village to the Cairo
                        drafts.</p>

                    <p>SOCIETE DES CONCERTS. </p>
                    <p>Last Sunday's programme was perfect, almost too perfect. It was one unbroken
                        succession of all that appealed to emotion, intellect, and mood; first came
                        the Glück, Iphigenia, solemn vivid clear cut and graceful as a Greek statue,
                        then the Handel concerto, archaic, rather, architectural, replete with the
                        symbolism of a Gothic cathedral; who can forget the grave sorrow of those
                        minor notes closing a passage, or the high dignity of the ending,
                        determinate and faultless, the delicacy and strength of the movement, of
                        every note. And then the death of Isolde, the crowning wonder of all that
                        love had know, hoped, regretted, remembered, as the long years crystallised
                        golden moments, lingering until those great mists of passion annihilated all
                        things</p>
                    <p>The fitting contrast, ronction-and how one crarea for a reaétion after
                        Tristan and Isolda!</p>
                    <p>- the Peer Gynt, that weird travelled phantasy, from Morocco to the mountains
                        of the North, dawn, the hero's death, the eastern dance, and the revel of
                        the gromes about the spiers of the mountains : - after this the Tchaikowsky
                        march, showing Napoleon in retreat, Rasin triomphant, barbarig, outrageous
                        children at fair, and, through it all, the wind shrieking to the blank snow
                        onder dark stripped trees.</p>
                    <p>The performance was, all through, distinctly adequate. The orchestra is
                        really excellent : soch slight hesitations s e rred were unmistakenly due to
                        the insufficiency of the rehemals, inevitable when we think what a quantity
                        of work the opera orchestra has the whole week through. One had to take
                        exception to the conduoting in parts: that, I think, is chiefly due to
                        temperament: for example, in the Tristan and Inolda, M. Baron hardly
                        realised the full atmosphere, the resonant magie of the music in the Gring,
                        he was inclined to monotony, he could not attain the almost elfish and
                        rhythm of the far North</p>
                    <p>The Marche did well-Tehaikowsky site him, do Glock and Handel One did wish
                        for the old open keyless trumpets, the viol de Gambe, all those instruments
                        for which Glick wrote, and which would have brought out the clear purity of
                        the musie: modern instru ments seem to stifle it. M. Vallette wag SaintSains

                    <p>THE HAPPY COUNTRY"</p>
                    <p>LONDON, December 31.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Edward Dicey publishes in the "Empire Review” an interview with the
                        Emperor Wilham. His Majesty said that, as the eldest grandson of Queen
                        Victoria, to whom he was deeply attached, he felt most keenly that he had
                        been regarded in England as hostile to Great Britain. His reception in
                        England was accordingly most welcome. Hitherto be had known only the Court
                        life in England, but now he had learnt to know the country and the people.
                        He was impressed with the wealth, dignity and life of the country gentlemen,
                        the independence and kindliness of the peasants. England was best
                        describable as the happy country. His Majesty hoped that Germany would soon
                        take more interest in sports, of which perhaps the English were az little
                        too fond. Regarding trade the Emperor William was all in favour of the open
                        door policy although it was impossible at present to introdace it into
                        Germany. (Reuter) </p>

                    <head>MONEY AND SHARE MARKET.</head>
                    <p>(From Our FINANCIAL CORRESPONDENT.)</p>
                    <p>London, December. </p>
                    <p>The Money Market.</p>
                    <p>The monetary stringency (which generally makes itselt felt at this period of
                        the year) has hegon to assert itself, and there is an eager demand for
                        accomodation to carry over to the end of the year. During the earlier part
                        of the week the rate for day to day money was as high as 6.5 per cent, and a
                        large sum was secured from the Bank in loans and discounts at 7.5 and 7 per
                        cert respectively.</p>
                    <p>Berlin was a large buyer of the open market, in fact, it is rumoured that the
                        entire amount has gone to Germany, in which case it should arrive there in
                        time to relieve the pressure which was otherwise expected at the end of the
                        year.</p>
                    <p>A further amount of £1,800,000 of Treasury Bills has been tendered for, for
                        which there was keen competition, the applications reaching a total of
                        £3,585,000. </p>
                    <p>Silver</p>
                    <p>Some buying for India has caused a sharp rally in the price of silver, which
                        advanced to 24.5d per ounce for immediate, and 24 13/16d. for forward
                        delivery. Towards the close the tone was a little dull, owing to the fact
                        that buying orders sagged off, and that the Eastern markets will of course
                        be closed for the Christmas holidays </p>
                    <p>The Stock Markets.</p>
                    <p>The firm tone with which the week has commenced has caused some surprise,
                        prices have not advanced to any extent, but there is a steady and growing
                        demand for investment stocks. Consols have been a firm market, but have shed
                        a 1/18 on account of the demand for gold for Germany. </p>
                    <p>Home Rails</p>
                    <p>The feature of the week has undoubtedly been Home Rails. The ratification of
                        the working agreement between the Great Northern and Grent Central Railways
                        at the shareholders meeting last Friday has had a beneficial effect on the
                        stock of these two concerns, and Great Northern Deferred rose at one time to
                        49 1/2, but closed at 49 1/4. The "A" stock improved to 47 1/2, which
                        represents a gain of a point. The decrease of £6,400 in the traffic return
                        of the Brighton Line caused the "A" Stock to drop to 77 3/4, after it had
                        touched 78 3/4. This decrease is a somewhat serious item. At the end of
                        November the aggregate decrease for the half year looked like approaching
                        £50,000; this however has now been exceeded, the shrinkage now being
                        £50,273. Large economies are expected in the working of the company, and it
                        is thought that when the figures come to be finally adjusted, these will
                        effect the decrease in the traffic returns. </p>
                    <p>Americans</p>
                    <p>The feeling in Lombard street is that credits outstanding in America against
                        commercial enterprises are great, and that it will take some time to bring
                        the condition of things to a normal level. This feeling had an adverse
                        effect on American rails, although they opened firm, and (in some of the
                        leading issues) prices rose above parity, suffered a relapse. The offers of
                        stock from New York did not tend to improve the situation, but added still
                        further to the depression.</p>
                    <p>Foreign Bonds.</p>
                    <p>The prospect of a new issue of Peruvian Stock, was not very cheerfully
                        received by the market and a large quantity of selling orders brought the
                        price down. The Debentures dropped 2 ½ to 95 ½, the Preference 2 ¾ to 30 ¼
                        and the Ordinary ¾, to 7 ¼. International stocks were steady, but Paris
                        selling caused Russian Bonds to relapse slightly. </p>
                    <p>The Mining Markets.</p>
                    <p>The Mining carry over, coming immediately after the Christmas holidays as it
                        does, has been the means of reducing the amount of business in this
                        department, although there has not been the stagnation that many members
                        looked for. Some interest was infused into the Kaffir Circus by Paris buying
                        Rand Mines, and the slight improvement in the leading speculative issues was
                        partly due to dealings in connection with end of the year options which
                        matured on Monday. The following particulars of dividends declared by forty
                        six Rand Companies to date, this year, may be of interest. The total amount
                        aggregates £6,962,500 an increase of £1,396,500 compared with 1906, when
                        there were 39 companies declaring dividends. The outside district gold mine
                        yielded £169,162, so that the grand aggregate is £7,131,600. Rand dividends
                        represent 26 percent of the output and 5s 3d per sovereignn yielded. </p>
                    <p>Copper Shares.</p>
                    <p>Business was not brisk in the Copper Group, but an improvement was noted;
                        this was undoubtedly due to the rise in the price of the metal which later
                        put on £1 to £60 15 0 per ton on account of some "bear" covering. </p>
                    <p>Egyptians</p>
                    <p>There has been little business in Egyptians during the current week and price
                        with one or to exceptions are as quoted last week. Daira Sanieh have
                        advanced to 1/8 to 12 7/8 - 13 1/8. Delta Lands have shed to a 1/16 to 1
                        3/16. Land Bank of Egypt have sagged a little to 7 1/8 - 3/8. The contract
                        which has been given to the Cleveland Bridge and Engineering Company Limited
                        for a combined road and Railway bridge to be built across the Blue Nile at
                        Khartoum, has created a rather favourable impression here. The length of the
                        waterway to be crossed is not less that 1,700 ft, and the work is destined
                        to play an important part in the development of the Lower Sudan, inasmuch

                        Witu, 1890, on which occasion he was engineer lieutenant of the cruiser
                        "Boadicea," and was in mechanical charge of the boats which proceeded to
                        destroy the village of Mkonumbi (medal with Wita clasp) and he was engineer
                        of the gunboat Sparrow at the bombardment of the palace of the Seltan of
                        Zanzibar, 1896, by Sir Harry Rawson's Squadron,</p>
                    <p>The old sloop "Algerine," which has been swinging for a long time at her
                        moorings in Hongkong harbour, is to be commissioned with a crew of 106 of
                        all ranks for services on the West Coast of America. It is just ten years
                        ago since she passed through the Mediterranean and the Suez Canal to her
                        present station. The "Phoenix," her sister sloop, which accompanied her on
                        that occasion, was completely wrecked and driven ashore in the typhoon at
                        Hongkong on the 16th October, 1906.</p>
                    <p>The command of the 3rd Battalion King's Royal Rifles Corps, Aldershot, and
                        orders for Crete falls vacant a little earlier than it would have by the
                        selection of Colonel C.R.R. McGrigor, C.B., for staff service. In the
                        ordinary course he would have completed four years in command on the 24th
                        prox. The step should go to Major R.S. Oxley, second in command of the 1st
                        Battalion at Cairo.</p>
                    <p>As has been already intimated in these note the Army Council have decided to
                        adopt a longer bayonet than the regulation one in use, and to that end a
                        modification of the Japanese bayonet, which did good work in the Far Eastern
                        struggle is to be manufactured for use with the short magazine rifle. The
                        new weapon is much longer that the existing one as long as the old Martini
                        Henry rifle bayonet, triangular in formation, and tapered to a keen point in
                        order to obviate top-heaviness. It will be cased in a leather scabbard, with
                        black steel tip, and the fixing on will be done as in the present bayonet.
                        The long bayonet will give the soldier a better reach in close fighting and
                        in irregular fighting such often occurs on the frontier of the Empire.</p>

                    <p>KHEDIVIAL SPORTING CLUB.</p>
                    <p>FIRST WINTER MEETING</p>
                    <p>FIRST DAY. The New Year opened well from the racing point of view: let us
                        hope that everything else will start as satisfactorily. The day was warm and
                        genial, the unpleasant winds of the last few days having kindly left us in
                        peace. There was quite a large gathering of spectators to witness the
                        afternoon's sport. The finishes were not quite so close, with the exception
                        of two races, as those of the last meeting, but we saw better horses this
                        meeting. The first race Suleik only just won by a short head, Jenkins just
                        managing in the last stride to get him home. It looked at one time, as if
                        Roland must win, and was the closest finish we have seen for many a day. In
                        the Delta stakes Aurelius won easily, bat Jap who was second ran well and
                        has a great stride. Carlton's performance was disappointing. Jenkins again
                        was the winning jockey. We heartily congratulate Mr. Eyre on winning the
                        steeple chase on his own horse Hector, who had been previously beaten by
                        most of the other horses in hurdle races and this time was evidently ridden
                        with great judgment. Challoner had a spill Mercury coming down at the water
                        jump, and Bonser's horse pecked badly at the next jump, putting him down. In
                        the Cairo Derby Jenkins role a great race on Mulberry, his third win in the
                        day. --Iron Sand made a great effort to win, Jenkins only just managing to
                        keep in front for the Breeders Stakes. Eua won comfortably, Jean d'Arc
                        second and Firefly pulling up lame third. In the last race Mleyhan won
                        easily, it is a pity he had not something better to run against -- he was
                        handly expected to win. He gallops in excellent style and we wish his
                        sporting owners luck with him. Bonser, the jockey, has unfortunately broken
                        his collar bone, and Thompson was a good deal knocked about when Shendi came
                        down. We regret to say Shendi was so much injured that he had to be shot. We
                        must not forget to congratulate the handicappers, Bakri Bey and Mr. Friend
                        on their excellent handicapping. Also we include Mr. Schreiber in our
                        congratulations on his winning the big race, the Cairo Derby.</p>
                    <p>(FROM OUR LADY CORRESPONDENT), </p>
                    <p>Perfect weather, glorious sunshine and no wind, graced the New Year and
                        attracted most people to Ghezireh, the only drawback to a most successful
                        meeting being the accident to Thompson in the Cairo Derby. The bulk of
                        spectators never realized at the first that anything untoward had happened,
                        for the accident occured far away from the stand, and it was not until
                        anxious towards, police and others began hurrying down the course that one
                        realized that anything was wrong. Eventually the injured man was carried off
                        the ground on a stretcher. Such things always cast gloom over an afternoon,
                        but on this occasion luckily the injuries were said not to be really
                        serious, and the events of the programme were resumed soon afterwards. The
                        attendance was excellent. Lady Gorst was there in a pretty gown of biscuit
                        coloured cloth with a quantity of silk braid lace about the shoulder. Lady
                        Valda Machel was also present and the Count von Bernsdorn and his daughter,
                        the Hon. Mr. and Mrs. Iddings with Miss Iddings in a smart grey tailor
                        frock, her hair no longer down her back. General and Mrs. Bullock attended
                        the meeting; it is ber first appearance since her illness, and it was also
                        the first appearance of Mrs. Dunbar, whom we all remember as Miss Hurley.
                        Her marriage to Capt. Dunbar who was A.D.C. to General Bullock last season,
                        only took place in Paris a week or so ago: and they are spending the next
                        few week with Mrs. Dauhar's sister. Mrs. Schreiber, whose wedding took place
                        just about year ago</p>
                    <p>It is not often that Maitre Carton de Wiart is seen in the enclosure, but on
                        this ocasion he was noticed with his small son and rephew, who are spending
                        their holiday in Cairo. It was the first visit to Ghezireh of Mrs. Irene
                        Hervey who had journeyed up from Helouan with Mr. R. Sharard to see how we
                        managed such things in Egypt. She is a great horsewoman herself and has
                        ridden in almost every country in the world and upon every type of animal.
                        Sir John and Lady Rogers were present, the latter wearing a very pretty
                        frock of blue and white striped muslin with lace sleeves. Mrs. Morgan's
                        velvet coat with ermine collar etc. was charming in conjunction with the
                        trim white skirt. Mrs. Appleton's frock of a pale blue cloth was as becoming
                        as it could be. Princess Irene Duleep Singh were in the stand with Mrs. and
                        Miss de B. Carey and their friends, Mrs. and Miss Shakoor was also noticed
                        not far off. Among others distinguished in the crowd were Mr. and Mrs. Scott
                        Dalgleish, the Misses Coles, Dr. Tribe, Mrs. and Miss Schreiber, Mrs. and
                        Mr. Raffety, Mrs. and Miss Devonshire, Judge and Miss Tuck, Mr. S. de

                    <p>DEAR MR> SPICER.-The work of which you send me photos is certainly of very

                        finish. Only an Artist could bestow the amount of care and modelling which
                        appear in the faces of Deer, and in your works you are so highly successful
                        there is little left to be desired.</p>

                    <p>A BUSINESS WOMAN TELLS HOW HER TIME OF SUFFERING WAS ENDED BY DR. WILLIAMS'
                        PINK PILLS.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Roberts, who has a retaurant at 64, St. Domingo Road, Everton, feels
                        that at middle age she has taken a new lease of life, and tells with
                        enthusiasm how she has been restored to splendid health by Dr. Williams'
                        Pink Pills for Pale People.</p>
                    <p>"If you wish me to make an affidavit as to the great benefits I have derived
                        from Dr. Williams' Pink Pills, I will most willingly do so," she remarked to
                        a reporter recently. "I know that in the ordinary course of nature women
                        have to undergo an anxious experience at my time of life, and it is only in
                        the interest of my sex that I make this statement, so that others can
                        benefit as I have done.'</p>
                    <p>THE MOST MARVELOUS MEDICINE. </p>
                    <p>"My restoration to health," she resumed, "is solely due to what I consider
                        the most marvellous medicine of the age, Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale
                        People.</p>
                    <p>"You see I am fifty three years of age, and, having this business to
                        superintend, I am a very busy woman, so my change of health was a very
                        serious matter. I felt terrible pains all over my body, and sometimes my
                        limbs felt so numbed and stiffened that I feared the approach of paralysis;
                        and every time I moved I had an inclination to fall. My legs became swollen
                        and inflamed, and seemed to be full of water. They became an abnormal size.
                        My feet ached. I was never free from splitting headaches, constantly I had
                        cold persperations, my faoe became deathly white, and my eyes were dark and
                        sunken.</p>
                    <p>SEIZURES OF PAIN. </p>
                    <p>"My appetite entirely failed, and after a few morsels of food I felt a
                        tearing pain in my chest, accompanied by seizures of pain in the back that
                        almost prostrated me. The least exercise produced spasms, and as I went
                        upstairs I would sometimes fall gasping on the staircase.</p>
                    <p>"The nights only meant increased weariness for me. In the morning when I had
                        to go to the market I could hardly drag one leg after the other. My sight
                        became dim, and my hearing failed me. I had a hacking cough. My trials
                        became more severe through an attack of influenza. I lost the power of my
                        voice and could only whisper; and a shooting, heavy pain under the heart
                        gave me great anxiety.</p>
                    <p>A WONDERFUL CURE. </p>
                    <p>"I took many medicines, but derived no benefit from them. Then I was
                        recommended to take Dr. Williams' Pink Pills. Before I took them I was a
                        wasted, almost useless body, but after a few boxes of these wonderful pills
                        I felt quite revived, and today I feel like a new woman. Through taking Dr.
                        Williams' Pink Pills my body was nourished by new, warm blood, my limbs grow
                        strong, my appetite became good, and I could digest my food properly. I
                        became quite strong again. Handreds of customers come into my shop, and I
                        never fail to tell them of the benefits I have derived from Dr. Williams'
                        Pink Pills.</p>
                    <p>AT THE ANXIOUS TIME. </p>
                    <p>"All women understand how anxious a time is middle-age the years from forty
                        to fifty. To many it is a time of great danger. During that trying
                        experience the recovery of health and the protection of life depends mainly
                        upon one thing - the supply to the system of plenty of new rich blood. This
                        is obtained by taking Dr. Williams' Pink Pills. They have cured Women's
                        Ailments, Anemia, General Weakness, Debility, Decline, Indigestion,
                        Rheumatism, Neuralgia, and all Nervous Disorders. Only the genuine pills
                        cure (substitutes are worse than useless); and these bear the full name on
                        each package -- Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People.</p>

                    concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them are fraught with
                    difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several things to be
                    considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate between Egypt and
                    the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>

                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMENA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. <hi rend="italic"
                            >Giardini</hi> is the station at which to alight, and the drive up to
                        Taormina is most delightful, occupying about one hour. In and around the
                        town is much to interest the visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but
                        restored under the Romans. CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of
                        Etna, and here also is a fine Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic
                        remains that are found all over the island, are an endless sources of
                        pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting history, having been a Greek city,
                        which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C. 413, and taken by the Romans in
                        B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb is to be seen. The cathedral
                        was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with about 300,000 inhabitants,
                        is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a delightful climate. Much of
                        interest is to be found in this fine city. <hi rend="italic">The Palazzo
                            Reale</hi> is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of <hi
                            rend="italic">S. Giovannia degli Eremiti</hi> with its picturesque
                        cloisters. The Cathedral, Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal
                        Park are also worth a visit.</p>

                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                            bay—<hi rend="italic">Castellamare</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                            >Sorrento</hi>. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento [you can
                        drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                            <hi rend="italic">City of Flowers</hi> and its surrounding country. In
                        Florence itself the churches and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst
                        the local promenades and excursions should not be omitted. <hi rend="italic"
                            >The Cascine</hi> is the most attractive and fashionable promenade in
                        Florence, whilst the <hi rend="italic">Viale dei Colli</hi>, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to <hi rend="italic">Vallombrosa</hi>, with its <hi
                            rend="italic">Monastery</hi> 3,300 feet above the sea level. This is
                        made first by ordinary train from Florence to <hi rend="italic">St.
                            Ellero</hi>, thence by cog-wheel railway to <hi rend="italic"
                            >Saltino</hi>. The ascent through groves of oaks takes an hour, and most
                        striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; here there is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                        and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                        house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                        and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                    <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                        the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and deliciously cool
                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,

                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>

                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>

                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea port.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea. No hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from <hi rend="italic">Milan</hi> you make the tour of the
                        beautiful Italian lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza.</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come <hi rend="italic"
                            >Tremezzo</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Cadenabbia</hi>, and <hi rend="italic"

                        by Ciseri, and 'Tho Flight into Egypt,” by Bramantion.</p>

                        view, and if possible tourists should average to be in Athens for the
                        Orthodox Easter in order to witness the Good Friday and Easter Eve
                        ceremonies, and to be present at the dancing on the Easter Tuesday festival
                        held at Megara, for which a special train is run from Athens.</p>
                    <p>It is worth while to spend a few days in CORFU on account of the beauty of
                        the scenery. There is also good snipe and quail shooting to be had.</p>

                        If you are going straight through to England you will find the train waiting
                        at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete
