                    Five fires occurred in Alexandria last night, and the Fire Brigade, under Yonsba-hi Waller, was busily engaged in coping with its many calls. The conflagrations took place at Bah Sidra, where a stable caught fire ; at Gheit el-Enab, on the south bank of the cana’, where a large straw store was burnt out ; in Rre Hamamil, where a beer shop was burnt; in Rue Abon Siri, where a Cafe caught fire; and lastly in a shop in Sisters-street. The most serious of these conflagrations was that on the canal. The fire broke out in a very large store of straw and it was only got under with great difficulty, the hose having to be laid across the canal under the water. The Fire Brigade was hard at work there for two hours, from 11.50, p.m. to 2 a.m.

                    ENGINEERING COMPANIES-
                    Among the masses of banking, financial. transport, industrial, technical and commercial companies, which are shortly to bo floated in Egypt, there are some interesting engineering oompanie0, details of which are given below.
                    
                    WATSON AND COMPANY.
                    
                    We hear on good authority that the well-know engineering firm of Messrs. William Watson and Co. of Alexandria is shortly to be turned into a limited liability company, under Egyptian law. Sir John R. Ellerman, Bart, of London (of ’he Ellerman Line of Steamers,) and Messrs. James Moss and Co., of Liverpool, (managers of the Moss S.S. Co., Limited) will be interested in the new company. Messrs R. J. Moss and Co., of Alexandria and Cairo, have been instrumental in bringing the negotiations to a conclusion with Mr. William Watson, of Banff, N.B., and with Mr. James Watson, of Alexandria. The business will be carried on as heretofore and considerable extensions are contemplated in the near future.
                    
                    UNITED DELTA ENGINEERS. LIMITED.
                    
                    Another important engineering company will shortly be floated in Egypt. 1t embraces the business of Messrs. Dowie and Company. of Port Said, Messrs.

                    ANGLO EGYPTIAN COMMERCIAL CO. ]
                    
                    The board of directors of this company is , composed as follows : S:r West Ridgeway, late Governor of Ceylon; dir E. Constantine Phipps, the earl of Fingall, Mr. Jacob Hessler, Mr. , Panos Alexakis, and Mr. Aristide Giro, of Alexandria.
                    
                    COMPANY ACTIVITY.
                    
                    The crowds of new flotations, which are to be placed before the Egyptian public in the near future, are giving a great deal of work to our local lawyer, and there is considerable activity being displayed in drawing up ’he numerous new prospectuses. Io London the printing firms have bad a great deal of extra work thrown on their hands by the phenomenal number of new Egyptian flotations and many firms are busily engaged in making plates for thousands of bearer warrants and founders’ shares, which are eventually to find their way into the possession of the Egyptian public. The shortest period in which a plate can he execu-. ted is a month and the average cost of a p'ate for a company is £5. These plates are engraved and the great London printers have artists specially for the work of sketching for the pistes. Many of the forthcoming flotations for the Egyptian market are very tasteful productions, with charming views of Egyptian mine, Pyramids, Sphinxes, Nile landscapes, and such like local scenes. Some of ’he new founders’ shares are sure to tempt the Egyptian investor j as they will be beautiful samples of the highest type of English artistic printing and the designs alone ought to send the shares up to a premium. The engraving departments of the London firm, who devote themselves to this class of work, have been extraordinarily busy for the last three months on Egyptian com panies", and Messrs Waterlow Bros, and Layton inform us that they have during the present season turned out some hundreds of thousands of bearer warrants fur Egypt.
                    THE CENSUS OF EGYPT.
                    
                    The time for the Census is drawing near. Many persons have already been appointed census enumerators ; others will be appointed shortly. Here and there there seems to be an impression that census work is very onerous and unpleasant, and is likely to interfere with the enumerators' regular duties. This im-pression is entirely erroneous. It is hoped that the following considerations will show that Government intend in every way to study the convenience of enumerators and make their work as public servants as easy as possible. 
                    
                    It is being arranged that, so far as practic- able, each person chosen to be an enumerator shall enumerate a block of houses near his home, that is to say, in a neighbourhood where he is likely to be more or less known as a friend and a neighbour.
                    
                    Except for a few hours on a single night (that of the 29 h April, 1907) the enumeration can be done at leisure The preliminary work of writing up the schedules can be spread over six week, or more, and can be done by the enumerator a few minutes at a time when he is not otherwise engaged. It need not in any way interfere with his ordinary avocations,
                    
                    , Printed instructions as to how to fill up the census schedule book, which is supplied to J each enumerator, are bound up in the book itself, but enumerators desirous of further it formation or advice will he able to obtain it from the Census Maawin-of the Kism in which they reside, or at the Central Census Office, Old Menshieh Tribunal, Alexandria.
                    
                    Enumerators and employers of enumerators alike are asked to hear the above foots in mind, and to remember that this public duty has been laid upon the better educated section of the community only because there are not enough people able to read and write in Egypt for it to he possible to carry out the census in ‘ the same way that it is carried out in European
                    
                    WELL KNOWN MINISTER DROWNED
                    There are many in Alexandria who will learn with pain of the tragedy which occurred on board the Papayanni S.S. Ararat on her way from Liverpool to Alexandria. One of the passengers of the vessel, which arrived here yesterday, was the Rev. M T.S. Taylor, B.D., well known and respected at Alexandria, who was on his way out to join the Scottish Mission here. On enquiring for him on board yesterday a party of friends, who had gone down to the docks to meet him, were horrified to learn that the reverend gentleman had disappeared overboard during a storm io the Bay of Biscay.
                    
                    Three days previous to this occurrence the ship's carpenter was swept overboard by a heavy sea and was likewise drowned.
                    THE KHEDIVE.
                    The Khedive, who spent yesterday at Koubbeh Palace, came this morning to Abdeen, where he presided over the Council of Ministers and officially received the new Belgian Diplomatic Agent, who presented his credentials to his Highness.
                    
                    The Khedivial Ball which was to have been held on the 28th inst, and was postponed in consequence of the death of Prince Ahmed Kamei Pasha, will now (says “Al Ahram”) be held at Abdeen Palace shortly after the expiration of the period of mourning, when the Maieh will issue fresh invitations for the ball.
                    LORD CROMER’S RETURN.
                    
                    Lord and Lady Cromer returned from Upper Egypt shortly before 12 a.m. on Sunday. Both are in excellent health.
                    
                    Oar Minieh Correspondent writes :—Lord Cromer arrived here yesterday (Friday) evening from his trip to Upper Egypt. accompanied by the Moudir and Mr. Hopkins, the inspector of the Interior, his lordship visited the children’s hospital, the animal infirmary, the house of Mr. Ryke, agent of the National Bank, etc. His lordship left to day (Saturday) for Cairo. 	
                    
                    THE SPREAD OF EDUCATION.
                    
                    The movement in favour of the extension of education gains ground daily. On Thursday afternoon a meeting was held at the Moudirieh of Dakahlieh and the Moudir addressed a meeting of local notables with great eloquenoe, urging them to subscribe for the foundation of a school at Mansourah, where teachers for the kuttaba, a class for which there is a very great demand, could be trained.

                    Mr. Edward Dioey, in ‘‘The Egypt of the Future,” severely oritioises Lord Cromer’s proposals in regard to the Capitulations. In an interesting passage be remarks :—
                    
                    "The decision of the Algeoiras Conference, confirming as it does the non-validity of the free hand aooorded to Franoe in' Moroooo by the Anglo-Freimh Agreement, app'iea logically to the tree baud in Egypt aooorded to England by France.	,
                    
                    ‘According to the precedent established at Algeciras, any European Power which has political or commercial interests or rights in Egypt would be entitled to refuse her consent to any substantial changes which England might propose to introduce into the relations between Egypt and other Continental powers, till these changes have been approved by an International Conference. There can be no reasonable doubt that it such a Conference were to meet, its first step would be to demand an explicit explanation from England as to whether she intends her military occupation to be permanent or temporary ; and, on the latter hypothesis, when the occupation was to end, or, on the former hypothesis, what guarantees were to be given for the preservation of ’he rights now possessed in Egypt by the subjects of other nations than the two parties to the free-hand agreement. If this is so, I think all British statesmen—to whatever party they may belong, or whatever their views may be as to the internal administration of Egypt—will agree with me in holding that the present moment is singularly infelicitous for proposing the formal recognition of a British Protectorate over Egypt, or for suggesting the expediency of cancelling the Capitulations and abolishing the International Tribunals.”
                    ALEXANDRIA’S ROADS.
                    
                    A motorist writes : The state of the roads in Alexandria is disgraceful. There has been a hole you could lose a horse in in the asphalte nearly outside the “Egyptian Gazette" offices since November. The asphalte of Rue Tons-soon Pasha and that by the French Consulate is as bad, while no macadamising has been done anywhere for nearly a year. Motor-owners need never. Expect sympathy, but here we get a whacking great tax for owning them, and the people who tax us leave the roads in such a state that our cars get rained in a few months.	•

                    SATURDAY'S INAUGURATION.
                    
                    The formal inauguration of the latest addition  to the hotels of Alexandria, the new Savoy Palace Hotel in Rosetta-avenue, took place on Saturday last and proved a most successful 'Social function. Invitations to an ‘nt home” in the afternoon had been issued b;r the management in a liberal manner and these were so largely responded to that a continual stream of visitors, representing the rank and fashion of Alexandria, poured into the hotel from 4 to 7 p.m., the number of guests present being estimated at over 2 000.
                    
                    We have, already given our readers a de tailed description of the Savoy Palace, so that it is needless to recapitulate here. Everyone, however, who visited the salons and rooms of the hotel, most of which were thrown open to the guests, were loud in their praises of the magnificent furnishings and equipment of the house, which, as we have already said, is equal to any first-class hostelry in Cairo or out of it The delightful winter garden came in for special admiration, and hire it was that the numerous guests ware regaled at a sumptuous buffet, which, notwithstanding the enormous demands on it, never seemed to feel the strain. While the guests indulged in refreshments the band of the Royal Dublin Fusiliers, under Band-master Fawcett, kindly lent for the occasion, discoursed a choice selection of music, of which ’he programme follows:—
                    
                    Khedivial Hymn.

                    It was not till close on eight o’olook before the last of the guests bidden to the inauguration had left the hotel, all enchanted with what they had seen, and preparations were then made for the dinner given by the hotel directors to a number of their friends and representatives of the Press. This took place at nine o’olook, over 150 covers being laid in the beautiful dining room, which was almost dazzling with its myriads of electric lights and bright decoratlon. To say that the mann of the dinner was excellent would be according but faint praise. The Savoy Palace has manifestly acquired the services of a master of the culinary a?t, and he was evidently bent on making a success of the inaugural dinner. That he achieved this success was the unanimous verdict of all the guests. The menu is worthy of reproduction, and we give it below:—

                    Great credit is due to Mr. Radolf 8pringer, of Al Hayat fame,” who is general manager, and Mr. A. Auber. the manager of the hotel, for the great success of Saturday’s arrangements, which were carried out without the slightest hitch.
