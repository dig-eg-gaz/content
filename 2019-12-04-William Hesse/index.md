On November 4th, 1907, Monday’s issue of the Egyptian Gazette was released. In this issue of the newspaper, on the third page, under the column labeled “Football,” there was an article referring to a recent soccer game that had occurred with the teams Victoria College F.C. v. St. Andrew F.C. . The article was published in the newspaper below the Horticulture in Egypt. The article summarized the game between the two teams. Both teams did not have their full lineups, and had to play their bench players for the game. However, these subs played to the best of their abilities. The match was back and forth the whole game until the last minute when College was able to out smart Andrew’s defenders and put in a last minute goal. We can see that this match really was an important one in history since it really sped up the game and intensity especially since the starters we’re fighting for the starting job in this important match. All the goals scored were by the centre forwards and the way that College pulled out and won was because they beat the defenders to the net and put one last blow to the opposing team.
