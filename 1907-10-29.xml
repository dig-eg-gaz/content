                        down old tradition especially those relating to the worship of Amon a
                        deified mortal with many mortal limitations. Akhanatoas fint act was to
                        proclaim Aton the only true God and himself his high priest. Then, as the
                        worship of Amon and a hundred other deities confront- ed him everywhere, he
                        abaodooed Thebes, and built a new capital elsewhere about 160 miles above
                        Cairo. Though only fourteen, he vowed to shut himself up here with his god,
                        devot- ing his life to his religion ; and this vow he kept throughout his
                        brief life. His was Without doubt "the most enlightened religion which the
                        world at that time had ever known, by no means pure and simple Run-worship

                    <p>Akhnaton's god was the intangible and yet ever present Father of mankind,
                        nuuie mani tent in sunshine. The youthful High Priest called upop his
                        followers to search for their god not in the confusion of battle or behind
                        the smoke of human ncrifioe^ but amidst the rtowers and treen, amiUt the

                        <p>We understand that it is the intention of the Sudan Government to
                            institute a toll on foot ami vehicular traffic over the new bridge
                            between Khartoum and Khartoum North when it is completed, it being hoped

                            the money borrowed to build bridge, would lie accumulated The idea is an
                            excellent one. There is of course a settled charge for each person who
                            crosses the river by the existing ferry, and when one considers the
                            enormous loss of time that will be saved by the use of the bridge, it is
                            evident that to remove all tax would be absurd when the maintenance of a
                            small charge would make the thing a paying concern while still greatly

                        <p>In the course of its historic past the Guild- hall of the City of Ixmdon
                            has been the venue of many brilliant functions, and among these the
                            great ceremony which has taken place there today of the conferment of
                            the Freedom of the City upon Egypt's saviour, the Earl of Cromer, will
                            rank as one of the most striking and interesting.</p>
                        <p>Lord Cromer's services to Egypt and the Empire have from time to time
                            received an knowledgement from the King, these honours including the
                            conferment of the Order of Merit, one of the most exclusive Orders in
                            the gift of his Majesty, and earlier this year Parliament showed their
                            appreciation by voting his lordship the sum of £50,000, the occasion
                            being marked by a chorus of praise from both mem liers of the Government
                            and thie Opposition.</p>
                        <p>All these manifestations, of the gratitude of King and nation must have
                            deeply touched Lord Cromer, and done much to compensate him for the long
                            years of haril and, at times, heart breaking work in Egypt, but today's
                            presentation has been the crowning triumph of his life's-labours.
                            London, the hub of the universe, has added his name to the
                            dis-tinguished Roll of the noble and the brave whose deeds of glory and
                            renown are writ large in the ages of history.</p>
                        <p>The scene in the great hall of the Guildhall to day was indeed grand and
                            one to be long remembered. A large dias had been erected at the east

                            his high office, with the Ahlermen, in their scarlet robes, about him.

                        <p>An Impressive Ceremony.</p>
                        <p>The ceremony itself was carried out with all the ancient and impressive
                            ceremony, and little time was wasted in preliminaries. It should be
                            explaiimd that the gathering was in essence a sitting of the Court of
                            Common Council, so that when the Lord Mayor's procession haul passed to
                            the dais, and the Lord Mayor had taken his sent, with the Earl of Cromer
                            on his left in the place of honour, the Court was opened by the Town
                            Clerk, Mr. J. Bell reading the items on the agenda. Of course, the only
                            business to lie transacted was the ceremony which everyone was
                            anticipating with pleasurable excitement. The Chief Clerk of the
                            Chamberlain's Court, Mr. G. A. Pickering, read the quaint formula, by
                            which the compurgators testified to the fitness of Lord Cromer to
                            receive the Freedom of the City.</p>
                        <p>Afterwards the Master and Wardens of the Skinners Company formally
                            presented Lord Cromer for the Freedom.</p>
                        <p>City Chamberlain's Oration.</p>
                        <p>The oration of the City Chamberlain, Sir Joseph Dimsdale, which followed,
                            was an eloquent recital of the magnificent services which Lord Cromer
                            has rendered to his country, and was punctuated throughout with
                            enthusiastic applause.</p>
                        <p>The Chamberlain, the Rt. Hon. Sir Joseph Cockfield Dimedale, Bt, K C.V.O
                            , has a long and distinguished record of services io the City to his
                            credit. From 1891 to 1901 he held the position of Aiderman, and was a
                            Sherifl in 1894. He represented the City on the L.C.C. for five years,
                            1895 1900, and satin Parliament as one of the City's representatives
                            from 1900 to 1906. He was paid the signal compliment of being elected
                            Lord Mayor during the</p>
                        <cb n="3"/>
                        <p>memorable year 1902, and carried the Crystal Sceptre in front of his
                            Majesty at his Coronation. He was created a Knight in 1894, and Baronet
                            in 1902, and in the latter year also he was elected a member of the
                            Privy Council, and was made a Knight Commander of the Victorian Order.
                            He has held the position of City Chamberlain since 1902. He is a Past
                            Master of the Grocers Company ; Past Grand Warden and Past Grand
                            Treasurer of Freemasons of England.</p>
                        <p>Sir Joseph, in the course of his speech said : Among the many privileges
                            enjoyed by citizens of London, none are more highly trea surod than the
                            presentation of honorary freedom. We are thereby enabled to set the
                            impress of the imperial city and the Empire upon the actions and lofty
                            aims of those who have signalised themselves by their devotion to the
                            welfare of their country. We meet today to acclaim one of the greatest
                            living personalities of our time and it is with peculiar pleasure that
                            we greet Lords Cromer within the walls of the ancient Guildhall. The
                            last years of his life bo ungrudgingly placed at the disposal of his
                            country and his Sovereign in evory capacity. He has left his mark and a
                            lasting, solid gold behind him.</p>
                        <p>Lord Cromer's Services.</p>
                        <p>Sir Joseph Dimsdale then reviewed Lord Cromer's 25 years' magnificent
                            services in Egypt He hatl produced, out of chaos, prosperity, hope,
                            peace, and good government, and all this whs owing, under the divine
                            blessing, to the courage and determination of one man. While these great
                            events have been (tassing in Egypt there have been different Governments
                            at Home and different Premiers at Downing Street. Such was Lord Cromer's
                            personality and so patently just and sincere his policy, tliat Mr
                            Gladstone, Lord Salisbury, Lord Roseberry, Mr. Balfour, and Sir Henry
                            Campbell Bannerman, one and all, had accorded him their co operation and
                            support in his great and noble work.</p>
                        <p>Sir Joseph Dimsdale then quoted Sir Edward Grey's speech in the House of
                            Commons on the occasion of Lord Cromer's retirement.and in conclusion
                            lie said that whatever should the thp future history of Egypt Lord
                            Cromer's name would lie indelibly engraved upon her annals as her
                            regenerator, financier, statesman, administrator—the great Pharaoh of
                            Modern Egypt.</p>
                        <p>At the close of his speech the Chamberlain ofiereil the right hand of
                            Fellowship to Lord Cromer, welcoming him as a Freeman of the City, and
                            presented to him the gold casket containing the Franchise Ticket in the
                            name of the Lord Mayor and the Corporation</p>
                        <p>Lord Cromor's Speech.</p>
                        <p>On rising to respond, the Earl of Cromer fiad a great ovation, and was
                            visibly affected by the warmness of the greeting.</p>
                        <p>Lord Cromer, in an excellent speech which i lasted half an hour, thanked
                            the City moat cordially for considering him worthy to he inscribed on
                            the roll containing so many illustrious names. He could have done little
                            in Egypt but tor the occurrence of adventitious circumstances, the chief
                            of which wax the fact that of late years foreign affairs had been
                            elevated to a great extent out of the somewhat heated atmosphere of pat
                            ty strife. He thanked Sir Edward Grey for his support in circumstances
                            of no common difficulty.</p>
                        <p>Having paid warm tribute to his coadjutors, one of the most able of whom
                            was Sir Eldon Gorst who had succeeded him, Lord Cremer said that Sir
                            Eldon Gorst would 2 achieve success, particularly if be did not allow
                            himself to be hurried by faddists in England and the numerous scribes
                            who looked upon London as a sort of political Mecca. </p>
                        <p>Enemies to Progress.</p>
                        <p>Referring to Nationalism, Lord Cromer said that it would be a mistake to
                            take too seriously the Nationalists or their friends in England. Some of
                            the latter misled the Egyptians as to the true trend of public opinion
                            at home and encouraged the hope that political development in Egypt
                            could be much more rapid than was possible. These he regarded as the
                            worst enemies to Egyptian progress. Extremists in caim would not be
                            conciliated save on terms which would involve a relapse to all the
                            misgovernment and disorder of the past. He saw but one method of dealing
                            with the unrest in Egypt and India It was to continue stead fastly to
                            do-our duty towards the people of those countries, and to come down with
                            a heavy hand upon the extremists who overstepped the limits of the law,
                            but at the same time not to be deterred from adopting such reforms as
                            would satisfy the aspirations of all moderate and reasonable men.</p>
                        <p>The Country's Prosperity.</p>
                        <p>Alluding to the financial crisis he said that the prosperity of the
                            country 1n no way suffered and he hoped it would do something to stop
                            the over-speculation which had been such a mischievous feature of the
                            Egyptian markets in Ute years. Future prosperity was assured owing to
                            the work of the hydraulic engineers, thevtrue makers of Modern Egypt,
                            who had</p>
                        <cb n="4"/>
                        <p>secured the country from drought and assured the cotton crop. Lord Cromer
                            then explained the habit and custom of hoarding gold and said that he
                            hoped the creation of saving banks and the increased circulation of
                            paper money and increasing banking facilities might improve matters, but
                            it would be a slow process.</p>
                        <p>At the conclusion of Lord Cromer's reply, the Lord Mayor introduced to
                            him the mover and seconder of the resolution conferring the Freedom upon
                            his lonlship, Mr. J. W. Domo-ney, and Sir George Fandell Philips,
                            G.C.I.E. Bt., and the Sherifls, Aiderman Burnett, and Mr. C. C.
                            Wakefield.</p>
                        <p>After the ceremony at the Guildball the Lord Mayor entertained the Earl
                            of Cromer lo luncheon at the Mansion House, at which a distinguished
                            gathering was present.</p>
                        <p>The Golden Casket.</p>
                        <p>The casket in which the Freedom of the City was presented to Lord Cromer
                            is of 18ct. gold, and is specially designed with a harmonious blending
                            of English and Egyptian ornament as being eminently appropriate to the
                            recipient's great work in Egypt; the upper and lower mouldings are
                            embossed with a lotus ornament, and the box is divided into panels by
                            pilasters of Egyptian design</p>
                        <p>The central position is occupied by the full anus of Lord Cromer, in
                            heraldic blazon, ami on either side are janels with Egyptian soldiers,
                            against a hackgrotind of blue enamel. Further panels contain coloured
                            enamel views, one being of modern Cairo am! the other of the Pyramids.
                            There are similar panels on the reverse bearing views of London, the

                        <p>The lid of the box is exceptionally distinctive. The bold dome, which is
                            chased with lotus ornament, is surmounted by a finely modelled figure of
                            Britannia, significant of British influence in Egypt under Lord Cromer's
                            wise and beneficent guidaime. At each angle of the lid are
                            representations of the minarets of the Cairo MtKsque, and under a
                            cornice of harmonious style appears the recipient's initial surmounted
                            by a coronet.</p>
                        <p>A silver gilt base, with four fine models of the Sphinx, and at each end
                            an Egyptian obelisk with hieroglyphicx, supports the box. The curve of
                            the base is utilized to display Lord Cromer's onlers and decorations,
                            the remainder being ornamented with suitable emblems. The full blazon of
                            the City Arms appears in the centre of the obverse, and the whole casket

                    <p>HOW MANY PARTIES ARE THERE?</p>
                    <p>The native mind appears to lie grievously troubled owing to the
                        multiplication of political parties in Egypt and the favourite occupation of
                        the melbbers of the various groups now consists in sending lengthy
                        contributions to their favourite newspapers to prove that their party is the
                        only genuine representative of public opinion and that all other
                        Nationalist, who refuse to join their clique, are unprincipled, self seeking
                        humbugs, who are not inspired by any genuine feelings of patriotism, but on
                        the contrary by the most sordid sentiments.</p>
                    <p>The "Manchester Guardian," which has been the journal favoured by Mr. Wilfrid
                        Blunt for his letters on Egyptian affairs, has been considered by Egyptians
                        to have rather favoured the cause of Nationalism owing to its strong Radical
                        proclivities. But recently the "Manchester Guardian" announced that theie
                        were three parties in Egypt and this announcement has caused great vexation
                        to Kamel's followers, who consider that the Moderate Nationalists,

                        was proved by the meeting at the Zizinia Theatre. He states that the "Party

                    <p>MR. BLUNT'S CHARACTER.</p>
                    <p>"Once a twenty years resident in Egypt" sends the following letter to "The
                        Times".</p>
                    <p>Twenty-five years ago I was your Correspondent in Egypt. In that capacity I
                        frequently disagreed with the policy pursued by Sir Edward Malet, and my
                        criticisms of that policy in your columns and elsewhere caused an
                        interruption in our friendly relations, though not, I am glad to believe, in
                        our mutual esteem. I merely recall this fact to show that I am not a
                        prejudiced supporter of Sir Edward, whom I have hardly seen since he left
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>One of the chief subjects of my disagreement with him was that be persisted
                        in tak ing Mr. Wilfrid Blunt too seriously, thereby apparently inducing Mr.
                        Gladstone to treat him as an authority, until at last Mr. Gladstone and Mr.
                        Blunt between them made the British occupation inevitable.</p>
                    <p>To me, and to most people resident in Egypt at the time, Mr. Blant was a
                        specimen of that type of British tourist who, with no evil intentions, but
                        suffering from acute me. galomania, thinks that he can acquire the
                        reputation of an authority by spending a few weeks in a country, by meddling
                        in its politics-of which he has not a rudimentary knowledge - and by writing
                        letters thereon to newspapers.</p>
                    <p>A year or two before Mr. Blunt came to Egypt I had met a young man who, after
                        six weeks in the country, announced to me his intention of writing an Arabic
                        grammar because he found the language so simple. Mr. Blunt confined himself
                        to no such harmless experiment, but devoted himself to what he called the
                        study of the people. He was known in Cairo as "the mad Englishman" who would
                        greedily swallow anything, and it was for a time &amp; favourite amusement
                        with certain people to induce an intelligent donkey boy to pose as a leading
                        native and to pour horrible legends into his sympathetic ears. For a time I
                        believe that even Sabunji himself favoured this deception, for his own
                        powers of imagination, though great, were exhausted. It was, however,
                        playing with edged tools ; for, though Arabi, who was a muddle headed but
                        honest fellah, took no advantage of his ignorance, there were others of the
                        party, more intelligent and less scrupulous, who were willing to use him as
                        their tool and to laugh at him behind his back : while our own and other
                        Consulates never much in touch with the native element were easily imposed
                        upon.</p>
                    <p>The origin of Mr. Blunt's megalomania and self imposed mission was always
                        popularly ascribed to the fact that he had married a connexion of Lord
                        Byron. Byron was a poet--Mr. Blunt wrote poetry. Byron espoused the cause of
                        Greek liberty, and Mr. Blunt espoused the cause of what be called Egyptian
                        liberty. The parallel was incompleto, for Byron died at Missolonghi and Mr.
                        Blunt lives at Crabbet Park.</p>
                    <p>But his attempts in prose and in verse to represent himself as the angel who
                        rode in the whirlwind and directed the storm are farcical in the eyes of any
                        one who knows anything of the circumstances. In one sense only is it true.
                        Mr. Blunt was, with Mr. Gladstone, the chief provocative cause of the
                        British occupation of Egypt, as was George III. of the independence of the
                        United States -- they raised the whirlwind and were shattered by it.</p>
                    <p>As for Sir Edward Malet, I have said that I disagreed with his policy. I have
                        written severe things about it, nor do I know that with regard to that
                        policy itself I have any. thing to retract ; but, looking back over a
                        quarter of a century, I think I did not perhaps make sufficient allowance
                        for the difficulties of any man serving under the Government of that period.
                        I was younger ; I had not then thoroughly realized with what little
                        intelligence the world is governed, and, believing that Cabinets were always
                        ruled by intelligence, I perhaps attributed to him the follies of those
                        whose instructions he was bound to obey.</p>
                    <p>But in my greenest youth I should never have been guilty of classing together
                        Sir Ed. ward Malet and the man who openly avows that he sent to "The Times"
                        a statement for which of course we had not a shadow of authority to go upon"
                        (p. 433).</p>

                    <head>SIR WILLIAM GARSTIN.</head>
                    <p>The Cairo correspondent of the "Times," in announcing Sir William Garstin's
                        new appointment, remarks that it is regarded as of great importance, as he
                        is the first British representative on the board who has combined the
                        highest technical experience and knowledge with great administrative
                        ability, It may be confidently predicted that his influence will be exerted,
                        whenever possible, on behalf of British shipping interests and those of the
                        Egyptian Government, into whose hands the canal will eventually pass.</p>
                    <p>It is hoped that it may be possible for him to remain in the service of the
                        Government till April, and that he may thus be enabled to pay a final visit
                        to the White Nile and completo certain important works connected with
                        Egyptian irrigation. It is hoped also that in the exercise of his new duties
                        he will frequently visit Egypt, where the greatest value is attached to his
                        advice.</p>
                    <p>Sir William Garstin's successor will in all probability be Mr. Webb, an
                        administrator of proved ability and fearlessness, who commands the
                        confidence and respect of the Government, the people, and the present

                    <head>ARMY OF OCCUPATION.</head>
                    <p>Within the last three days we have received two letters containing
                        reflections on the behaviour of officers of the Army of Occupation at
                        Alexandria. Both these letters are anonymous and cannot therefore be
                        published. Even if the signatures of the writers had been appended, they
                        would not have been published, not because, as one of these correspondents
                        insinuates, we are an English newspaper, but because we have good reason to
                        believe that in the two cases of misconduct, which form the subject of these
                        complaints the offenders were civilians. It appears to be an amiable
                        delusion among some of the foreign inhabitants of this city that every
                        Englishman, who dons a dress suit in the evening, is prima facie a member of
                        the Army of Occupation.</p>

                    <head>CAIRO'S OPERA HOUSE.</head>
                    <p>It is said that the question of a new opera house for Cairo has been settled
                        at last, but that the new building - will not be commenced until the year
                        after next. The original plans offered by Mr. More, have, we are informed,
                        been rejected, though why, we are at present at a loss to understand. He
                        offered to build a new opera house on a site to be chosen by the Government,
                        for the sum of LE. 200,000, provided that he should be given the right to
                        build houses or stores on the site of the existing opera house, each
                        buildings to revert after a lapse of years to the Government.</p>
                    <p>The scheme which it is reported has been adopted is that of Mr. Sachs, a
                        London theatre builder, who is to build an exact model of the Covent Garden
                        theatre in the Esbekieh Gardens for the sum of L.E. 300,000 to be paid by
                        the Government, and it is also said that the street opposite the Grand
                        Continental Hotel, and the Splendid Bar (Sharia Kamel) is to be increased in
                        width by encroaching upon the gardens to some extent.</p>
                    <p>We have received no official confirmation of the above statements, and at
                        first sight it would appear to be almost incredible that the Government
                        should refuse such an advantageous offer as that of Mr. More appears to be,
                        and close with one which entails an extra expenditure of L.E. 100,000.</p>
                    <p>Cairo needs a new opera house, and needs it badly, but over a quarter of a
                        million is a lot of money and we doubt if the expenditure of so large a sum
                        can be entirely justified when one considers how very short is the opera
                        season in Cairo. However criticism on this point must wait until official
                        details of the proceedings are given to the public.</p>

                        perdant graduellement l'énorme avance qu'ils avaient récemment gagnée,
                        clôturent à 17, en nouvelle baisse de 1/4 de livre. Pour la Land Bank les
                        acheteurs ont également disparu : le cours retombe de 7 3/16 à 7 1/16. Le
                        Crédit Franco-Egyptien recule aussi de 4 3/16 à 4 1 8.</p>
                    <p>Dans la catégorie des titres secondaires, nous voyons la Salt &amp; Soda
                        reculer pareillement de 17/9 à 17/3, l'ordinary Khedivial Mail de 22/9 à
                        22/6, la Building Lands de 2 à 1 15/16 et la fondateur United de 1 à 7/8;
                        l'action United est, au contraire, soutenue à 9/32 acheteurs. La fondateur

                        l'attention de notre marché la semaine dernière, retombe dans le marasme
                        juste à la veille de l'assemblée générale qui doit avoir lieu le 31 de ce
                        mois. Le prix fléchit encore de 2 29 32 l'ancienne et 2 31/32 la nouvelle à
                        2 27/32 et 2 29/32 respectivement. La part de foudateur réactionne également
                        de 2 1/16 &amp; 2. De rares échanges ont eu lien ; dans le nombre il faut
                        compter 25 actions anciennes vendues aux enchères publiques au cours de 2

                    <p>Jusqu'ici la corbeille comptait une bonne partie d'optimistes. Mais
                        aujourd'hui l'inaction et la baisse ont refroidi beaucoup d'enthousiasmes.
                        On est en tous cas unanime à reconnaitre que les affaires ne vont pas. Quant
                        aux motifs, ont met surtout en avant la crise américaine ; nous avons déjà
                        dit hier ce qu'il fallait en penser.</p>
                    <p>Nous n'avons pas besoin d'ajouter que la tendance est mauvaise, ce qui ne
                        veut pas dire que demain il y aura encore baisse mais simplement que pour le
                        moment l'ensemble du marché tend vers une nouvelle dépression.</p>
                    <p>D'autres plus judicieux nous annoncent chaque jour que notre cote va
                        reprendre le lendemain ! On voit la confiance qu'il faut mettre dans les
                        paragraphes frémissants de ces haussiers à outrance (lisez vendeurs).</p>

                    <p>Le Caire, Lundi 28 Octobre. </p>
                    <p>Le taux de l'escompte libre à Londres est renseigné en hausse de 1/8 à 4 7/8
                        pour cent.</p>
                    <p>Au Stock Exchange, le Consolidé anglais a baissé hier de 1/4 à 82 3/4.
                        L'Unifiée est restée invariée à 102 1/2. La National Bank a haussé de 1/8 à
                        21 7/8. La Daïra a été ferme à 133/4, de même que l'Agricole et la Delta
                        bright à 8 14 et 10 1/4 respectivement. I</p>
                    <p>A Paris, le Crédit Foncier Egyptien qui vendredi avait gagné 3 francs, a
                        perdu samedi 5 francs à 690. La Banque d'Athènes a été soutenue à 110 et les
                        Lots Turcs à 167.</p>
                    <p>Ici, les causes de la récente dépression n'ayant pas encore cessé et les
                        banques continuant à mettre leurs clients en demeure d'avoir à liquider
                        leurs dossiers, les offres sur le marché sont toujours très abondantes. Bien
                        qu'il se fasse des achats très suivis sur certaines valeurs les cours
                        rétrogradent avec une ténacité que des liquidations continues peuvent seules
                        expliquer.</p>
                    <p>De fait, la panique de New-York a peut être pu décourager quelques acheteurs,
                        mais n'a certainement pas engagé de spéculateurs à vendre, notre marché
                        n'ayant rien de commun avec l'Amérique et ne pouvant être touché par ce qui
                        se passe là-bas que très indirectement, soit par le hausse du taux de
                        l'escompte résultant de la solidarité financière de tous les pays.</p>
                    <p>Les causes de la baisse sont donc unique inent égyptiennes et par cela même
                        ne sauraient durer, car, somme toute, le travail de déblaiement qui se fait
                        actuellement ne peut qu'être très salutaire, assainissant la situation de la
                        place et éloignant le cauchemar de nouvelles liquidations lorsque la saison
                        des affaires battra son plein. C'est pourquoi le pessimisme actuel est
                        exagéré ; nous reverrons la hausse comme nous verrons aussi des réactions :
                        C'est dans l'ordre des choses et la reprise n'en sera que plus rapide.</p>

                    <p>Nous recevons d'un de nos lecteurs les réflexions ci-après que nous
                        reproduisons comme typiques en l'état actuel des affaires.</p>
                    <p>"On s'étonne parmi les non initiés de la baisse persistante qui affecte
                        justement les seules valenrs favorisées du public et qui aient, par l'état
                        prospère de leurs affaires, un marché suivi. On me dit, et je n'ose en
                        douter vu l'honorabilité indiscutable de mon informateur, qu'il y aurait là
                        le résultat de la façon d'agir de certains établissements de crédit. Un
                        d'eux même aurait obligé, on ne sait pour quelle cause, an de ses clients à
                        se défaire, quoiqu'il en et d'autres, de titres susceptibles de revenir très
                        prochainement à des cours plus élevés, alors que l'infortuné aurait de
                        beaucoup préféré se débarrasser de papiers cotés nomidalement à des cours
                        visiblement supérieurs à ce qu'on en pourrait tirer.</p>
                    <p>"Il faut espérer que ces établissements reviendront à une appréciation plus
                        exacte de la réalité et, bien que je n'aie pas la sottise de vouloir
                        apprendre à nager à des poissons, me fiant au bon sens de leur directeur,
                        j'aime à croire qu'ils comprendront comme ce mode de faire est contraire à
                        leurs propres intérêts et bon tout au plus à nnire an relèvement du marché

                        <p>Herr Harden alleged that the camarilla induced the Emperor to believe

                            at the diplomatic rebuff precipitated the Morocco crisis, and when the
                            exposure came the Emperor was the first to step in and break up the

                        <p>Lord Cromer has been presented with the freedom of the city at the
                            Guidhall. His Lordship was heartily cheered. Returning thanks Lord
                            Cromer emphasized that during recent years foreign affairs had happily
                            been removed from the atmosphere of party politics. He was sure that Sir
                            Eldon Gorst would achieve success if he did not allow himself to be
                            hurried by Eng. lish faddists and the numerous scribes in Egypt who
                            regarded London as a political Mecca. He warmly acknowledged Sir E.
                            Grey's loyal support and referred to the Anglo-Russian agreement, which
                            he considered was perfectly justifiable in spite of certain concessions.
                            It was a mistake to treat the Egyptian Nationalists and their friends
                            too seriously. He was not alluding to those who desired a reasonable
                            extension of self-governing institutions, but the extremists who existed
                            in Cairo, Calcutta, and Dublin. He saw only one method of dealing with
                            the Indian and Egypt unrest and that was to continue steadily doing our
                            duty, to descend with a heavy hand on the agitators who over stepped the
                            law, and to adopt gradually the reforms required by moderate men.

                        <p>Port Said, Saturday. </p>
                        <p>"The Port Said incident," which is generally accepted as descriptive of
                            the misfortunes which befel a certain lady passenger to this port at the
                            hands of a dragoman, bas, owing to the prominence afforded it in your
                            columns, become almost the sole topic of conversation here. Happily the
                            affair, though sufficiently serious, has been proved to have been
                            considerably exaggerated. My report of the case was based upon the
                            report of one who proved to be an unreliable on-looker, but equally
                            exaggerated reports have also been published in our two local papers.
                            This evening, however, I have been granted an interview with a police
                            official, who gave me the following details :-</p>
                        <p>An Australian lady passenger from the S.S. "Oroya" on coming ashore was
                            accosted by a crowd of guides One of these was engaged by the lady to
                            show her the interesting places of our town. During the afternoon the
                            guide took the lady into a shop for refreshments, which, it is supposed,
                            contained some sort of drug. The reason for supposing the drink
                            contained drugs is that the lady was in a dazed condition when
                            interviewed by the police. In the same shop the lady was also shown some
                            indecent post-cards. The lady, being disgusted at what she had seen,
                            requested the guide to take her to the ship immediately. After leaving
                            the shop, and when nearing the Savoy Hotel, a police officer who was
                            passing overheard the lady say she wished to be taken on board, and the
                            guide trying to persuade her to accompany him to his house first. Here
                            the police officer interfered, and, from a statement made by the
                            passenger, the guide was arrested and taken to the Caracol, where it
                            appears he threatened to strike the officer in charge. The passenger was
                            taken on board and again repeated her statement, bat in a very dazed
                            manner.</p>
                        <p>This morning the guide appeared at the Native Court to answer the charges
                            (1) Of proposing to a lady passenger to accompany him to his house
                            (presumably for indecent purposes) (2) Of threatening to strike a police
                            officer. The court acquitted the prisoner on both charges, and allowed
                            him to continue his profession. The Commandant of Police gave notice of
                            appeal against the decision re the second charge. The first charge will
                            have to be dropped, as the case is none too clear, according to the laws
                            of the Native Court.</p>
                        <p>The case, however, though evidently exaggerated, is a sufficient
                            illustration of the low character of our "official dragomans," who are a
                            disgrace to the town and never ought to be allowed to trade with
                            respectable persons. It is more than remarkable that our Commandant of
                            Police has no voice in the selection of these "official dragomans," it
                            seems to me that he is the one and only official of the Government to
                            whom should be given the right of awarding and cancelling dragomans'
                            certificates.</p>

                        <p>The trouble in the Turkish district Humdan is practically at an end, now
                            that Ramadan has commenced. Many villages in Hamdan, have been destroyed
                            by the Turks. The inhabitants of Humdan are in league with the Imam, and
                            have recently given much trouble to the Turks. Negotiations are now
                            being made by the Turks with the chiefs of Humdan for the recovery of
                            the Turkish arms recently captured by the people. </p>

                    <div type="item">
                        <head>German Enterprise.</head>
                        <p>Reports received from the Red Sea go to show that Germany is directing
                            her attention afresh to Farsan, the most important island in the Red
                            Sea. According to these reports a German ship recently called there and
                            landed several men, dressed in Turkish costume, on Sayir, the headland
                            of Farsan, in order to again explore the island. The Germans who arrived
                            on board the ship made purchases of some provisions at very high prices
                            and distributed some presents among the people of the island. It is said
                            that the latter have been attracted by their gold and courteous conduct,
                            and that they have given them a paper signifying their willingness to
                            live under German rule, if the Sultan cedes the island to them.</p>
                        <p>If these reports are correct, the interest betrayed by Germany, in farsan
                            is very peculiar, when considered with the latter's previous attempt to
                            force a coal depot there. It may be remembered that Germany, some years
                            ago, landed coal at Parsan without the permission of the Sultan and
                            despite the protests of the local Turkish authorities, and made an
                            exploration of the Island, in consequence of which friction arose
                            between Germany and the Sultan, the latter strongly resenting the German
                            intrusion. The dispute was, at length, settled, and in view of Germany's
                            declaration, that she only wanted a coal depot in the Red Sea "during
                            the Chinese crisis," the Sultan agreed to allow Germany to store coal in
                            an island in the Red Sea of his own selection, subject to the
                            stipulation that the coal store should be "international," and retaining
                            his rights of sovereignty over the island. Koomeh, a small islet a few
                            miles from Farsan, was then selected by the Sultan as the site of the
                            coal store, and some buildings were constructed by the Turkish
                            authorities there, but, apparently, Germany was not satisfied with
                            Koomeh, and hence har constant interest in Farsan.</p>
                        <p>It is difficult to advance any good reason for the German anxiety to
                            establish themselves in the Red Sea. The Chinese crisis no longer exists
                            and the necessity for a coal depot has disappeared. Parsan is the
                            biggest and most important island in the Red Sea. It has salt and
                            petroleum mines, and it is said that it also possesses a coal mine.
                            Besides these mineral deposits, Farsan has a pearl-fishery in its
                            waters, which is the most important pearlfishery in the Red Sea.
                            Formerly it was garri. soned by a very small number of Turkish troops
                            but since the Germans landed the coal, it has been garrisoned by a force
                            of troops. Koomeh is a small islet and comparatively of little valge,
                            and its capabilities as a naval base offer very little attraction. </p>

                    <head>THE CAIRO CONGRESS.</head>
                    <p>REFORM OF ISLAM</p>
                    <p>A few days ago we published a telegram announcing that the celebrated
                        Oriental traveller Professor Vambery of Buda Pesth University, had suggested
                        the holding of an Islamic Congress at Cairo. The following are his
                        suggestions :-</p>
                    <p>In my correspondence with the civilized Mahomedans it has frequently struck
                        me that the ideas, not only of social and cultural, but also of religious
                        reform is steadily gaining</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>ground. In former times any approach to similar questions was reckoned
                        amongst the post hazardous, nay, sacrilegious problems, and even the most
                        courageous reformer would have shrunk from mentioning the words religions
                        reform, by which he might have been accused of heresy and despised by his
                        fellow-believers. Quite recently, however, a change is noticeable in this
                        direction. Religious topics, thought to be the sacrosanct of Islam, are
                        unsparingly discussed, and I have before me a Tartar paper called Terdjuman
                        (i e., the "Interpreter"), and published in Bagchesarai in the Crimes, in
                        which the proposition is made to discuss in a congress questions of general
                        importance for Islam, with the exclusion of all political tendencies and
                        bearings. The appeal is signed by its editor, Ismael Bey Gasprinski, and
                        published in No. 60 of the said paper. It runs as follows :-</p>
                    <p>In paying due attention to the relations of the Mahomedan world, we shall be
                        grieved to notice that, wherever and under whatever rule they be, they
                        always remain behind their neighbours. In Algiers the Mabomedans are
                        superseded by the Jews, in Crete by the Greeks, in Bulgaria by the
                        Bulgarians, and in Russia by everybody. It is patent that, groaning under
                        despotism and unable to profit by liberty and Constitution, they pass their
                        time in patience and submission. We ought to investigate into the causes of
                        this deplorable state, for admitting, for example, that the Algerian Jews
                        surpass the Algerian Arab, it is astonishing and quite inexplicable that the
                        poor and devont Buddhist should get ahead of the once energetic Moslem.</p>
                    <p>This is the much more to be wondered at when we see that in recent times
                        important thoughts and questions have arisen in the Islam world, and that,
                        amongst others, the situation of our women has been ander discussion in
                        Egypt, Russia, and India. There have been besides many other topics touched
                        relating to the mutual condition of the Eastern and Western civilization ;
                        questions which ought to be handled with ripe consideration and solved in
                        accordance with the special wants of the different countries. Bat since
                        these questions are of extraordinary interest for the cultural revival of
                        Islam, it is preferable to discuss these matters in a common general way,
                        instead of the hitherto used single and separate form. The first congress of
                        the Rossian Mohamedans in 1905 has greatly contributed towards the rousing
                        and development of these thoughts, and now a much greater ne cessity has
                        arisen for the convening of a general congress, the activity of which may be
                        useful to Islam. The congress, embodying our learned clergy and literary
                        celebrities, must not be frightened by the European clamour of Pan-Islamism,
                        for our representatives, gathering from all parts of the world, and striving
                        to solve many social and cultural questions, will open more than one
                        hitherto barred way and door. We shall thus be able to sanction the
                        unavoidably necessary reforms and innovations in Islam. After obtaining by
                        deliberation the unity of thought, and by striving to propagate these ideas
                        in the whole Islam world, we shall have created a sound understanding and a
                        general awakening of the hitherto sleeping Mahomedans. At the time of pnblic
                        association Islam was a rul. ing power, now three-fourths of it are ruled by
                        others. The world is constantly changing and progressing, and we are left
                        behind for many many miles. As this congress, owing to certain reasons,
                        cannot meet in Constanti. nople, we trust to be able to unite in Cairo,
                        which is looked upon as the second centre of Islam. We are anxious to have
                        the opinion of the Mahomedan Press concerning the programme and the
                        discussable points, and there is much hope that we shall meet in September
                        next year in Cairo.-- ISMAEL.</p>
                    <p>I dare say nobody will undervalue the importance of this appeal. There are
                        three points which deserve our particular attention. (1) Mahomedan reformers
                        do not choose for their gathering the seat of the spiritual chief of Islam,
                        bat a town, which they call the second centre of Islam-pamely, Cairo—where,
                        sheltered by the British, they find full guarantee for free speech and an
                        unrestrained discussion. This public acknowledgment of the toleration of
                        British rule will afford a good leason to the clamouring Nationalists on the
                        Nile, whether they take it to heart or not. (2) The appeal furnishes an open
                        disavowal of any Pan-Islam tendency, which never could enter the mind of any
                        sober-thinking Mahomodan under the present circumstances and which every
                        Christian knowing the East must declare to be a bogey (3) It will ovidently
                        striko one that, amongst all Mahomedans, it is just the Tartans who coine
                        forward with the important proposal, which, owing to the immovability of the
                        tenets of Islam, the moven of the congress will bave to treat with great
                        caution and moderation Their object in view being decidedly the re formation
                        of Islam, they are just now engaged in the preparatory labour, a fact which
                        is fully deserving our attention.</p>
