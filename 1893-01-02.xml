                            the effect that the Belgian expedition under Captain Kerkhoven lately

                            Uganda may arise from this and begs the Government to take, without

                            caused the gravest anxiety and towards midnight the alarming symptoms
                            increased. About four o'clock yesterday morning the patient began to
                            perspire and later on a more favourable view of the case was entertained
                            than the grave syaiptoms of the preceding forty eight hours had

                        <p>The bulletin issued in the early morning was as follows. General state
                            has not become worse during the night. His Excellency has slept and
                            partaken of nourishment. This morning he began to perspire and appeared
                            a little more restful.</p>
                        <p>The patient continued much the same all day but the temperature, which
                            had fallen in the morning, rose again in the evening to 104 Fahr.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday evening another consultation was held by the doctors and a
                            bulletin issued to the effect that the condition was the same except
                            that the temperatore had risen on account of the perspiration. His
                            Excellency has all through been conscious and yesterday morning declared

                        <p>Mustapha Pasha Fehmy passed a good night. The fever has diminished. The
                            breathing and pulse are better. The general condition, although still

                            of the land itself or by reason of other accidental circumstances by

                            Cairo, who telegraphed to him a few days ago requesting his presence in
                            order to try to bring about a reconciliation between the Patriarch and
                            the Coptic Council.</p>
                        <p>The Metropolitan Bishop does not wish to interfere in the matter and is
                            probably of the opinion that little good could be done by him on behalf

                            influence of the Council and the party of reform.</p>
                        <p>An attempt was made last week by four of the Bishops to obtain a further
                            audience of His Highness the Khedive, but we understand that they have
                            been requested to put into writing any application which they may have
                            to make on the subject for submission to His Highness.</p>

                        <p>The decision recently taken by the Quarantine Board to confine all sheep
                            imported from Syria at the port of entry until they are slaughtered
                            seems to have been fully justified by the circumstances attending the
                            importation of sheep during last month. In the two pens at Chatby and
                            Port Vieux, in which sheep from Syria landed at Alexandria are confined,
                            about one hundred have died from anthrax during the month of December.
                            In the face of this mortality from that disease, Syria is officially
                            declared to be free from anthrax. There is evidently something wrong
                            somewhere and the facts would appear to call for an enquiry into the
                            matter. It is strange that the imported animals leave Syria in a sound
                            condition, the Vessels carrying them arrive with a clean bill of health,
                            and yet, shortly after their arrival in this country, we find that
                            numbers of them die from one particular form of disease. Is it beside
                            the point to demand whether the regulations as to the bills of health
                            and manifests at the Syrian ports of embarkation are carried out with
                            sufficient strictness, or if the regulations themselves are sufficiently
                            stringent to ensure that no animal can die en route without the fact
                            being recorded on the papers of the ship?</p>

                            Departments of Public Security and Justice.</p>
                        <p>It appears that certain cases were not reported in due course to the

                            him. The Substitut replied that he knew nothing of them. Last week,
                            while engaged upon some other cases, the Substitut discovered among some
                            papers presented to him by the Sub Commandant of Police documents
                            relating to the cases first mentioned. Questions were naturally put by
                            him on the subject to the police officer, who asked for the return of
                            the papers. The Substitut du Parquet refused to give them back and
                            telegrams were immediately sent by them to their respective chiefs. His
                            Excellency Lewa Settle Pasha went down to Mansoorah on Thursday to make
                            enquiries and the case is still under investigation.</p>

                            satisfactory results. Although in November there was an actual money
                            loss of about L.E. 4,000, yet in that month there was an increase in the
                            number of travellers of nearly 119,000 or about 20 per cent. in
                            comparison with the figures of November 1891. The first three weeks of
                            December last show an increase of nearly L.E. 6,000 in the receipts over

                            been greater than the figures published by Al Ahram would lead the

                    <head>A COMING SENSATION.</head>
                    <p>of pebe famous habic. This</p>
                    <p>Mr. Stuart Cumberland, the famous thought reader, and Miss Phyllis Bentley,
                        whose remarkable experiments have been the wonder of the various Europoan
                        Courts and the sensation of the last London Season, are expected shortly in
                        Egypt. They, in all probability, will give some public representations which
                        will cause without doubt similar wonder to that created in Europe. Mr.
                        Stuart Cumberland is well known in Egypt and his extraordinary experiments
                        with the late Khedive are remembered to this day by all classes. In one of
                        his experiments with the late Khedive Mr. Cumberland asked His Highness to
                        think of a word in Arabic. This His Highness did, and the famous thought
                        reader wrote on a piece of paper in Arabic characters the word Abbas. It was
                        perfectly correct, but Mr. Cumberland, not knowing Arabic, could not read
                        the word he had written and he asked His Highness what it signified !</p>
                    <p>"It is the name of my son, who nsturally has first place in my thoughts,"
                        replied the Khedive.</p>
                    <p>Miss Phyllis Bentley is a near relative of Mr. Stuart Cumborland's and her
                        experiments are quite different from his. His experiments deal with the
                        mental aspects of human nature; hers with the physical. She, a very
                        charming, delicately bred young lady with nothing above the ordinary
                        strength possessed by young ladies of her birth and breeding, does the most
                        remarkable things by way of diverting physical force without employing a
                        counter physical force.</p>
                    <p>Her 'tour de force' is, of course, her recent experiments with the Tsar--the
                        Giant Tsar, as he is called in Russia. The Tsar, in spite of his enormous
                        strength, entirely failed to lift this delicate young girl yet she readily
                        lifted the Tsar, the Crown Prince of Denmark, the Crown Prince of Greece and
                        the Duke of Cumberland together when seated on a chair. Her experiments
                        everywhere cause a sensation; they are purely scientific, and yet
                        astounding. Well, we shall soon have an opportunity of seeing what most of
                        the crowned heads of Europe are still puzzling themselves over.</p>

                    <head>OUR PARIS LETTER.</head>
                    <byline>(FROM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENT)</byline>
                    <dateline>PARIS, 24th December.</dateline>
                    <p>It is uncertain who may be the coming man for the situation to-morrow in
                        France but beyond question M. Tiburee Franqueville is the man of the moment.
                        It is in his hands that all the compromising papers, seized by the police,
                        connected with the Panama fraude and the corruption of legislators and
                        functionaries, are concentrated. Each batch of documents discovered by the
                        police during their domiciliary visits, whether in Paris or the provinces,
                        are immediately sealed up and handed to M. Franqueville, who peruses and
                        classifies those connected with the Panama high crimes and misdemeanours or
                        with any other matter affecting the interests or safety of the State ; and
                        it is whispered that very awkward and strange finds have been made. He
                        possesses most summary powers. If he discovers proofs against an individual,
                        he merely signs a warrant to arrest so and so with its concomitant of
                        seizing all papers. And whoever aids or abets in the concealment of
                        documents so as to frustrate the ends of justice can be imprisoned for five
                        years with loss of civic and political rights.</p>
                    <p>M. Franqueville is the ablest police magistrate in France. It is before him
                        that the arrested are first brought ; he examines them directly in his own
                        office, exhaustively, and only then they are allowed to communicate with
                        their legal advisers. He is 40 years of age, a native of Douai, a profound
                        authority on criminal law, a ripe Latin scholar, well read in literature,
                        and a great admirer of Zola's vigorous style, but not of all of his matter.
                        At the Bar his reputation is synonymous with rectitude, unshaken firmness,
                        and even handed justice. His eloquence is warm and captivating ; his
                        reasoning limpidity itself ; he has incomparable power of discernment and is
                        unequalled in the unravelling of subtleties and complications. His manners
                        are affable, courteous and attractive. He is an indefatigable worker, a
                        stranger to political passions ; possesses a fund of tact, and is ironclad
                        in his resolutions. No power in France at present can stop his work of
                        purification and of rascal pilloryings because any opposition to this would
                        cause the nation to rise in revolution.</p>
                    <p>The high personages in or ont of Parliament up to the present indicted
                        strangely coincide with long existing public suspicion. The question was,
                        who would bell the cat ? The French now know why no prosecution was
                        instituted earlier, say, four years ago; why every obstacle that ingenuity
                        could imagine was adopted to quash inquiry. Cabinet Ministers had been
                        corrupted and legislators bribed. Only a few days ago M. Ribot, the Premier,
                        escaped from defeat by a majority of but six votes. The fact has since been
                        revealed that among that lilliputian majority are four of the deputies
                        charged with taking bribes from the Panama coffers, the latter apparently
                        emptied as soon as filled! It was no secret that the Canal Coy. was the
                        "milch cow"– excuse the "bull" – for all notorieties in diffculties, or
                        bubble companies in the agonies of death; just as Napoleon III was the
                        providence man, one of the best traits in his character, to aid his friends
                        when in the pecuniary shallows, and his adversaries too, as Guizot's son
                        illustrates.</p>
                    <p>It is the end of the Opportunists, and the occasion has been imposed by the
                        Boulangist phalanx to feed fat its revenge. It does so without mercy ;
                        having received no quarter it gives none. It is scalp against scalp. The
                        Boulangists and their blanchissage helpers possess beyond doubt sufficient
                        proofs to send all their enemies to be morally guillotined, for every</p>

                    <p>public man with a single spatter of Panamaism on his character "falls like
                        Lucifer never to hope again." The scarifying of M. Clemenceau excited pity.
                        Contempt and a shrug constitute the feeling towards ex-Finance Minister
                        Rouvier. In the latter, Russia loses her best financial friend. Two
                        Deputies, not Panamists by all accounts, paid an electric visit to their
                        constituencies to feel the pulse of their electors in connection with the
                        existing disarray. They were received with hisses and groans and were only
                        too glad to double back. It will never do to call forth the tiger side of
                        the French character nor to shake red rags at it. At Sannois the municipal
                        council unanimously ruled out a candidate for a vacant deputyship solely
                        because he was a "professional financier.” One councillor made the sign of
                        the cross on hearing the candidate’s profession. Coming events cast their
                        shadows before them; money bags will have no influence at the next general
                        election; still less moneyless patriots. Now that the people's eyes are
                        being turned inwards to examine the social situation they stand amazed at
                        the thousands who a dozen years ago had nothing and are to-day rolling in
                        wealth merely from having secured political status. It is as
                        incomprehensible as the Trinity, or the fly in amber.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Clemenceau, for whose position there is really sympathy, has the
                        reputation of being a good pistol shot; he is not now an expert swordsman,
                        because the victim of an old wound. As to being a noted duellist of the
                        "fighting Fitzgerald" experience, there is a good deal of legend in the
                        matter. Rochefort heads the list in this respect; he has three bullets in
                        his body, so it is a common saying he is never without his "cartouche box."
                        As for sword thrusts, those must have gridironed his frame. The Biological
                        Society ought to elect Rochefort an honorary member and so have a claim in
                        due course on this curious "body," and it could be shown to private viewers
                        similarly as is Gambetta's bottled brain. Like little Bo Peep, I've lost my
                        sheep; M. Clemenceau has fought five duels in his day; but in Paul Déroulede
                        he had his match as a target and a sharp shooter, and who has also fought
                        five duels. The story of Mr. Clemenceau bringing his two daughters, and son
                        aged 18, to the office of his newspaper to bid them adieu in presence of the
                        staff, is a lugubrious pleasantry; he has only one daughter, who is married
                        to a barrister, and his son, too, is a barrister. Men intending to fight
                        duel make no such parado of sentiment. Saint-Beuve, the critic, did "disturb
                        the house" on the morning of his duel, because he could not find his
                        "umbrella," and it was raining heavily, but he was practical on the ground
                        not the less, and obstinately refused to close his umbrella “My antagonist

                    <p>Mr. Chryssafides claims the prize for his remedy to stay the depopulation of
                        France. His eureka is to turn the stream of Levantine emigration, 200 to 400
                        individuals every fortnight, into France. At present the emigrants disembark
                        at Marseilles to be re-shipped for the United States ; they are Syrians,
                        Chaldeans, Maronites--not "Marionnettes" as a journal not up in the "light
                        of Asia" misprints them--and other dwellers beyond Mesopotamia; they are
                        Catholics, and have been trained by the French missions. They are good
                        workers, ignorant of socialism, and "proverbial for their fecundity." They
                        could fitly replace the 600,000 Belgians and Italians who now supply the
                        labour France needs.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Exshaw, the Bordeaux wine merchant's son, has been, on appeal, ruled to
                        be a Frenchman. His father was English and his mother French, so henceforth
                        international Romeos and Juliets should note the circumstances under which
                        their olive branches may become food for powder. Exshaw has had to join an
                        artillery regiment, and the chapter of accidents might one day see him
                        bombarding a “Bagshaw."</p>

                        <p>Samedi soir, l'état de S.E. Mustapha pacha Fehmy causait la plus vive
                            inquiétude et vers minuit les symptomes alarmants ont augmenté. Hier,
                            vers quatre heures du matin, le malade commença à transpirer et plus
                            tard son état était meilleur que les graves symptomes des précédentes
                            quarante-huit heures ne permettaient de l'espérer. Le bulletin publié
                            dans la matinée portait : "L'état général ne s'est pas aggravé pendant
                            la nuit. Son Excellence a dormi et bien pris sa nourriture. Ce matin il
                            a commencé à transpirer et parait un peu plus reposé."</p>
                        <p>Le malade est resté à peu près dans le même état toute la journée, mais
                            la température, qui s'était abaissée dans la matinée, s'est élevée dans
                            la soirée à 40 degrés centigrades..</p>
                        <p>Hier soir une autre consultation des médecins a eu lieu et un bulletin a

                            s'était elevée à cause de la transpiration. Son Excellence a toujours
                            conservé sa connaissance et a déclaré hier matin qu'il se sentait

                            journaux locaux. Comme nous ne nous occupons pas des affaires de nos

                            l'Egyptian Gazette nous pouvons parler avec autorité.</p>
                        <p>Al Ahram indique la circulation de la Gazette comme étant de 438 par
                            jour. Nous déclarons formellement, et le propriétaire de la Gazette en

                            considérablement supérieure au chiffre absurde indiqué, et qu'en outre,
                            dès le premier numéro, publié le 26 janvier, 1880, la circulation de
                            l'Egyptian Gazette a toujours été plus importante que les chiffres

                            déjà commencé à donner des resultats très satisfaisants. Quoique en

                            des voyageurs a cependant augmenté ce mois-là de presque 119,000, soit
                            d'environ 20 pour cent en comparaison des chiffres de novembre 1891. Les

                            les circonstances qui ont accompagné l'importation des moutons en

                            port vieux où les moutons provenant de Syrie et débarqués à Alexandrie
                            sont parqués, cent animaux environ ont péri du charbon pendant le mois
                            de décembre. Et en face de cette mortalité la Syrie est officiellement
                            déclarée non contaminée. Il y a évidemment un rouage qui ne fonctionne
                            pas quelque part et les faits paraissent exiger une enquête. Il est
                            étrange que les animaux importés de Syrie en partent en bonne santé, que
                            les navires qui les transportent arrivent avec une patente nette et que,
                            peu après leur arrivée dans le pays nous en voyions un grand nombre
                            périr du charbon. Est-ce trop de demander si les règlements relatifs aux
                            patentes et aux manifestes aux ports syriens sont assez strictement
                            appliqués, ou si ces règlements eux mêmes sont suffisamment rigoureux
                            pour faire qu'aucun animal ne puisse mourir en route sans que la chose
                            soit enregistrée dans les papiers du bord.</p>

                            ciel sans atténuer le rayons argentés de la lune qui enveloppe d'une
                            douce clarté les coupoles blanches et les hauts minarets. Cette
                            gracieuse composition qui trahit chez son auteur un goût exquis et une
                            delicatesse d'exécution qu'on ne saurait trop louer, est d'un très

                            l'artiste, sont fort gentiment dessinés. Une ronde d'amours annonçant
                            l'année nouvelle, un paysage et une porte de cabaret rustique
                            complètent, avec une carte miniature de la Haute et de la Basse-Egypte,
                            le travail de M. Ravon bey qui, d'année en année, dispense avec largessé
                            les fruits d'un talent vraiment inépuisable.</p>

                        des jeunes femmes de sa naissance et de son éducation; elle accomplit les

                        réussir à soulever cette délicate jeune fille; celle-ci, en revanche,
                        souleva facilement le Czar, le Prince Héritier de Danemark, le Frince

                    <p>GUILLAUMERI CONSTRUCTEUR DE NAVIRES</p>
                    <p>Oo annonce de Berlin que, dans le courant de l'été dernier, l'empereur
                        Guillaume II s'est occopé à dessiner le plan d'un navire de guerre dont la
                        construction différera, en quelques points essentiels, de celle des
                        batiments en usage dans la marine allemande. La principale des innovations
                        imaginées par le souverain consiste à transférer sor le pont toutes les
                        cabines servant au repas et au couchage des officiers et des équipages.
                        L'empereur a pensé que cette innovation offrirait des avantages
                        considérables au point de vue sanitaire. Des mesores sont prévues pour que
                        l'on puisse de. monter rapidement ces cabines dans le cas où une rencontre
                        avec l'ennemi deviendrait probable. Et aiosi le pavire n'offrirait pas plas
                        de prise aux projectiles de l'adversaire que les batiments construits
                        d'après le type ordinaire. Le navire sera prochainement mis sor
                        chantier.</p>
