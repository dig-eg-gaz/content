                    <p>Made in 70 Colors</p>
                    <p>An artistic wall covering.</p>
                    <p>This celebrated water paint is made in two qualities for Inside and Outside
                        work</p>
                    <p>HALL’S SANITARY WASHABLE DISTEMPER is rapidly superseding wall papers in all
                        tastefully furnished homes. It is made in 70 artistic tints, and only
                        requires the addition of water to make it ready for use. It is quickly and
                        easily applied with a whitewash brush, with half the labour and at one third
                        the cost of paint. HALL’S DISTEMPER ensures cleanliness, and is pleasing to
                        the eye. It appeals alike to artistic and practical house decoration. HALL’S
                        DISTEMPER is of special value in hot climates. Owing to its cool, pleasing
                        colours, great weather-resisting and germ-destroying properties, it lends
                        itself to every kind of wall, wood, brick or stone coating, possessing all
                        the advantages of paint, colour- wash, and disinfectant at one third the
                        cost of oil paint. It never blisters in the hottest sun, and the fact that
                        it can be washed adds greatly to its sanitary advantages.</p>

                    <head>SPAIN AND FRANCE</head>
                    <p>The safe arrival of M. Loubet at Madrid and his enthusiastic reception by the
                        Madri- lenos, will be delight those many Frenchmen and Spaniards to whom a
                        Latin League, or, at all events, a close reapprochment between the Latin
                        nations, is a polticial ideal. THe rela- tions between France and Spain are
                        now thoroughly friendly, and French capital, al- ready interested more than
                        that of any other nation in the development of the Iberian Kingdom, is more
                        and more inclined to aid the development of Spanish industry. Since the
                        Spanish-Smerican war, which proved nothing short of a blessing to Spanish
                        Finance, the various political parties of Spain have all been inclined to
                        adopt a policy of economy and retrenchment, and no Spanish Minister who
                        proposed, say, a forward policy in Morocco or an ambitious programme of new
                        naval construction, would have much chance of support. Spain requires years
                        of recuperation before she can again play a great part in the councils of
                        the Powers. The question of land tenure and the tension be- tween the
                        Clerical and the Liberal elements have to be settled. Spanish Agriculure,
                        which may have a great future, requires the inagura- tion of an extensive
                        programme of irrigation works; the great mineral resources of the country
                        are only half developed, and new industries must be built up to replace
                        those ruined by the loss of the Phillippines, Cuba, and Porto Rico. For
                        these objects, internal and external peace and the assitance of foreign
                        capital and required, and Spain has no ambi- tion to make history for a
                        generation to come.</p>
                    <p>The geographical situation of Spain-indeed of the whole Iberian Peninsula- is
                        such that a friendly understanding with the kingdoms of Spain and Portugal
                        is of vital importance both to France and to England. A hostile Spain would
                        to some extent neutralise Gibraltar, since vessels lying in the docks could
                        be easily reached by the long-range howitzers and siege guns from Algesiras.
                        A hostile cruiser or two using the Spanish ports of Ferrol and Vigo or the
                        Canaries as its base might do an infinity of damage to the merchant
                        shipping, and if Spain's friendship is valuable to England it is precious to
                        France, which has a southern land frontier to defend and would suffer fro
                        the use of Port Mahon as a hostile base. Though navally impotent for the
                        present, Spain, by the mere fact of her position, might conceivably turn the
                        scale in a naval war, and the fact that both France and England realise the
                        importance of doing their utmost to arrive at a friendly understanding with
                        the monarchy of King Alfonso XIII., is of good augury for the world's peace.
                        England has by her support to Spain's Moroccean aspirations, which, though
                        not exten- sive, are still important, done something to atine for her
                        unnecessarily anti-Spanish atti- tude in the Spanish-American conflict; a
                        determination to keep the ring clear was natural enough, but our sympathy
                        need not have taken a form that wounded Spanish pride.</p>

                    <head>THE WAKES ADMINISTRATION. THE RECENT REFORMS.</head>
                    <p>Certain notes on the Wakfs Administration which appeared in a supplement to
                        yesterday's "Official Journal" are of considerable interest, and contain a
                        most interesting summary of the reforms recently introduced in an admini-
                        stration which required considerable remo- delling. The Wakfs laboured under
                        the disadvantages that beset all administrations of a quasi-religious and
                        qoasi-finanoial nature. Religious conservatism opposed the least reform and,
                        in this particular esse, the fact that British influence is predominant in
                        Egypt oompels the reformer to advanoe cautiously, for fear of ezoiting
                        religious controversy. In 1897 a new system of aocounts was introduced.
                        Previously a separate account had been made up for each wakf, so that the
                        administration had as many aooounta to draw up as it had wakfis to
                        administer. This curious and burdensome system was based on the supposed
                        impossibility of cover- ing the deficits of poor by the surpluses of rich
                        wakfs, Moslem law forbidding the dis- posal of the revenues of one wakfs to
                        the profit of another. To be consistent the admi- nistration should have
                        limited the expenses of eaofe wakf to an amount which oonld be balanoed by
                        its revenues. On the other hand, if for some aooidental or permanent cause
                        the revenues of any wakf diminished or disappear-1 el, the reduction of its
                        expenses or its total. suppression would have often involved the suppression
                        of servioes and ceremonies of a religious arl charitable rature, and would
                        have ruined a number of indigent or religious persons whose salaries or
                        whose sustenance were alike drawn from this source. Accordingly an attempt
                        was made to unify the accounts of all the wakfs of Egypt. j This was opposed
                        by the Wakts Adminis- .* tration on the ground that the proposal was not in
                        oonformity with the sacred law. A compromise was finally adopted under which
                        the wakfs were grouped under various headings and the accounts of each group
                        : combined, the resulting surplus forming a reserve fund to be employed
                        according to the decision of the Khedive at the request of the
                        director-general of the Administra- tion and in accordance with the advice
                        of the Council of Administration or the Superior Council'of the Wakfs.</p>
                    <p>Now that this side of the administration has been put in order the question
                        of the personnel has next to be settled, and a commission oomposed of the
                        heads of the various sections of the administration presided over by ths
                        sabdirector general and aided by the presence of a delegate from tie
                        Ministry of Finance. Other 'seotions of the report deal with techniosl
                        servioes, the exchange of“hikrs,”and with kuttabs, charitable institutions,
                        aid mosques. With the latter seotions, which are of some public interest, ws
                        propose to deal separately ; the rest are ot somewhat too j technical a
                        nature for treatment, but we may give the conclusions of Harari Pasha, the
                        author of the report: The Wakfs Administration should follow the following
                        programme : 1. The completion of its system of accounts by the creation of a
                        ‘capital’ aooount for both its urban and its rural properties. 2. The
                        organisation of the personnel of its bureau. 3. The creation of a service of
                        inspection. 4. Exchange of hikrs, the individual parts, in the properties
                        posses red in common with individuals, and also the small scattered plots of
                        cultivated land. 5. Exchange of buildings that have fallen in ruin, and the
                        reconstruction of which would be too costly to pay. 6. The substitution of
                        large cultivated | estates which can be easily guarded and administered. 7.
                        To supp ly these estates with the most perfect system of irrigation and
                        .drainage possible and to build agricultural lines on them and workmen’s
                        houses, and buildings to let, furnished with the best modern hy- gienic
                        appliances. 8. To take every measure ensuring that religious services be
                        held under the most suitable conditions. 9. To see the prompt distribution
                        of the surplus of private wakfs among the benefi ciaries immediately after
                        the closure of the yearly aocounts. Finally, to be imbued with a sense of
                        its philanthropic duties and do all that is in its power to aid the poor by
                        the creation of dispensaries and by the development of elementary
                        instruction among the poorer classes.</p>

                        SIR CHARLES PALMER’S VIEWS.</head>
                    <p><persName>Sir Charles Mark Palmer</persName>, M. P., addressing the members
                        of the Newcastle and Gateshead Chamber of Commerce, on the 13th inst, made
                        an interesting statement with reference to the future of the <placeName>Suez
                            Canal</placeName>.</p>
                    <p>Many of them, he said, were not, perhaps, felly acquainted with the fact that
                        that Chamber km tho means of instituting reforms in the administration of
                        the Suez Canal. It com- pelled the Canal controllers to take upon their
                        board more directors representing the United Kingdom. It brought to the
                        country a commit- tee to hear British grievances, previously to- tally
                        ignored. He himself ventured to join the directorate, at the special
                        invitation of M. Charles de Lesseps and Count de Lease pa. He spent a good
                        many years on that body, and be was bound to say that the directors
                        generally were inspired by the desire to make the Canal quite up to the
                        requirements of the trade, and to do what was right to all nations. When
                        they looked at the great volume of trade, however, and considered that even
                        the sinking of a small merchant ship in the Canal would disturb traffic for
                        a considerable period, they must Be led to c insider whether the Canal is
                        likely to be in the future sufficient for til this extension of business.
                        The new Treaty with <placeName>Japan</placeName> protected os from war in
                        the But, and developed the great countries hitherto almost unknown. It
                        opened new port*, new markets, new life of the highest importance, which
                        must tend to the prosperity of the world. He there- fore thought that we
                        would not entirely depend upon the Suez Canal in its present condition, and
                        more especially did he feel that we would not continue to consider the dues
                        exacted by the Canal other than onerous. He thought it possible that the
                        Canal might be made an in Iternational Canal, free to all nations. In view
                        of the great increase in the size and speed of ships, it seemed to him that,
                        unless the dues were reduced and the Canal gave greater facilities for those
                        vessels, undoubtedly the most economical course would be to go round the
                        Cape. He thought that representations should be made with a view to securing
                        a very large work of extension of the Canal.</p>

                        Kaimakams Mid- winter Bey and Longfield Bey, both Assistant Directors of
                        Railways at each end, Bimbashis Sower by and Lord, and the Hon. Pelham,
                        engineer from the Haifa side. They leave to-day on their return to Atbars. I

                    <p>News has reached here from Port Sudan to the effect that the Italian
                        contractors for the Government buildings there have struck work and refuse
                        to go on with their jobs.<persName> M. Guido Corbetta</persName>, one of the
                        contractors, has left Port <placeName>Sudan</placeName> altogether and gone
                        to <placeName>Cairo</placeName> to take proceedings there. The remaining
                        contractors are all Greeks, and are all doing well Work on the quarantine
                        building is at a standstill. All the workman at both Railheads - who have
                        used the pick and shovel for tie months and over, have received a gratuity
                        of one month's salary from the Sudan Government Railways. The question as to
                        whether the other employes and officials who have worked on the
                        Suakin-Atbaras line will receive a gratuity is still pending.</p>

                    <head>THE ROYAL BERKS.</head>
                    <p>Now that the Royal Berks Regiment is leaving is for
                            <placeName>Khartoum</placeName>, to give place to the Royal Dublin
                        Fusiliers, a few words regarding the most glorious achievement of the
                        regiment will not be amiss, and we cannot do better than quote an extract
                        from an official despatch of Lt.-<persName>Gen. J. W. Primrose</persName>,
                        C.S.L, who was in command of the Kandahar Field Force. He says :— "In
                        forwarding the enclosed document, 1 would most respectfully wish to bring to
                        his Excellancy, the Commander-in-Chiefs notice, the gallant and determined
                        stand made by the officers and men of the 66th Regiment at Maiwand. I have
                        it on the authority of a colonel of artillery of Ayoub Khan's army, who tree
                        present at the time, that a party of the 66th Regiment, which he estimated
                        at one hundred officers and men, made a most determined stand in the garden.
                        They were surrounded by the whole Afghan army, and fought on until only
                        eleven men were left, inflicting enormous loss on the enemy. These eleven
                        men charged out of the garden, and died with their faces to the foe,
                        fighting to the death. Such was the nature of their charge and the grandeur
                        of their bravery, that although the whole of the Ghazis were assembled
                        around . them, not one dared to approach to out them down. Thus, standing
                        back to back, firing steadily and truly, every shot telling, surround- ed by
                        thousands, these eleven officers and men died, and it was not until the last
                        man had been shot- down that the Ghazis dare advance upon them. He farther
                        adds that the conduct of these men were the . admiration of . all who
                        witnessed it From an examination of the ground and from the position in
                        which the bodies were found, I have not the least hesita- tion in stating
                        that the account is true, and I think his Excellency will agree with me when
                        I say that history does not afford any grander or finer instance of
                        gallantry and devotion to Queen and country than that displayed by the 66th
                        Regiment on the 87th July, 1880.”</p>
                    <p>“Maiwand Day” is kept annually by the regiment in a worthy manner, and
                        residents of Alexandria will long have pleasant recol- lections of the
                        hospitality which has been ex- tended to them on these occasions, daring the
                        2nd Battalion's stay here.</p>
                    <p>Sports form an outstanding feature of the celebration of Maiwand Day, and in
                        this respect the R. Berks have a great deal to be proud of. The battalion
                        gained an unusual number of sporting victories during the 1904-5 season. In
                        the competition for toe Football League, the battalion won the shield open
                        to the Army of Occupation. They also won the gold medals, for the Seaside
                        competition, offer- ed by the Boulac Sporting Club, opes to all Egypt. In
                        the Royal Military Tournament,held at Cairo, they won the Bayonet Fight i-g
                        shield against all comers, achieving a gnat victory. At the Army of
                        Occupation Rifle Meeting, the battalion met with great success In 1904 the
                        G.O.C’s prize was won by the sergeants’ team, while in 1905 the Championship
                        of Egypt was won by <persName>Sergt Wiggi</persName>’s of the 2nd Battalion.
                        The Inter-company Challenge Shield for shoot- ing for the Army (abroad) was
                        won by “D" Company of the 2nd Battalion. Finally, we may mention that the
                        "Liebig" 50 guineas Cup offered for the beat shot throughout the mounted
                        branches in <placeName>South Africa</placeName> during the war (1902) was
                        won by <persName>Pte. Hancock</persName> of the 2nd Battalion (attached to
                        the 10th Battalion Mounted Infantry).</p>
                    <p>These great achievements are due in a large measure to the vigorous manner in
                        which the Sergeant Major of the battalion pushes sport of every description
                        to the front The greatest support is offered by their popular command- ing
                        officer, who mo it generously supplies the - funds to enable the men to
                        indulge in cricket football hockey, bayonet fighting, shooting matches,
                        boxing tournaments, open-air concerts, We wish the battalion a pleasant stay
                        at <placeName>Khartoum</placeName></p>

                    <p>Nous avons reçu d’antres lettres à propos de la Commission des Locataires,
                        mais il nous est impossible de continuer à insérer cette correspondance, là,
                        polémique étant sortie du domaine public pour entrer dans le domaine privé.
                        Nous regrettons que M. Mignot ait le premier employé des termes d’une
                        violence exagérée' contre M. A. G. et que celui-oi se soit à son tour laissé
                        entraîner contre M. Mignot à des insinuations qne nons considérons comme

                    <p>La question de l’intérêt de l’argent est à l’ordre dn jonr aussi bien en
                        Egypte qn’cn Europe. Les journaux européens arrivés par le tout dernier
                        oonrrier réflètent la préoccnpation qne leur donne cette question et
                        expriment des craintes pour l’avenir.</p>
                    <p>Le marohé de Paris n’a pas en une meilleure allure la semaine passée qne la
                        précédente. Ce n’est pas qne la cote ait été faible, mais il semble qne les
                        dispositions si franchement con- fiantes dé naguère se soient qnelqne pen
                        mo- difiées. Les r^KÜsations se sont poursnivies et ont presque '
                        constamment pesé snr les cours. An premier rang des préoccupations delà
                        Bourse, se trouve la question de l’intérêt de l’argent On s’attendait,
                        pendant les premières séances, à voir la Banque d’Angleterre procéder à une
                        nouvelle augmentation du taux de l’escompte.</p>
                    <p>Ces craintes ne se Bont pas réalisées. Le taux de l’escompte n’a pas été
                        augmenté à Londres la semaine passée, mais il pourra l’être la semaine
                        prochaine, et cette appréhension para- ‘ lyse toute action nouvelle.</p>
                    <p>L’argent sera-t-il pins cher à la fin qu’su commencement du mois 1 On parait

                        positions jusqu’ici reportées pourraient donner lieu à des ventes assez
                        suivies. Enfin, les questions ré- trospectives de politique extérieure,
                        discutées dans la presse européenne, ont oréé un malaise contre lequel là
                        Bourse n’a pas facilement réagi. Ou rie pense pas cependant qu’aucnn .
                        incident sérieux puisse sortir de cette discus- sion tumultueuse.</p>
                    <p>Notons par oontre qne le comptant ne s’est guère laissé émouvoir par ces
                        incidents : il a été sans doute moins actif qne précédemment, gardant ses
                        disponibilités en vue des diffé rentes émissions annoncées, mais il ne s’est
                        pa3 montré disposé à vendre les titres qu’il a jusqu’ici àbrerbés</p>

                    <head>MRS. MALAPROP</head>
                    <p>The dramatists who have created characters whose utterances are as familiar
                        as household words, and whose names have added to the resources of the
                        English vocabulary, are few indeed. If Shakespeare be omitted as ' hors
                        concours,” Sheridan has few to compete with him as the creator of characters
                        who are familiarly known to, and constantly quoted by, the world at large,
                        though the quotation, as in all such cases, is frequently unconscious. Mrs.
                        Malaprop, whose name has given that useful term “malapropism" to the
                        language, is known of all men for her unequalled ability in pro- ducing a
                        ‘‘nice derangement of epitaphs.” But Sheridan reaped, to some extent, where
                        others had His mother, Mrs. Frances Sheridan, wrote play palled "A Journey
                        to Bath," which has been supposed to be, in some sort, a foreshadowing of
                        her son’s ‘ The Rivals but at least it contained a character named M s. Try
                        foot, of a type on which Sheridan improved in Mrs. Malaprop.</p>
                    <p>But, of course, the real inspiration for the creation of this amusing
                        blunderer is to be found, like so much else, in the pages of Shakespeare.
                        Mrs. Malaprop is simply the lineal descendant of the immortal Dogberry.
                        Dogberry, in “Much Ado About Nothing," does not occupy the stage so
                        frequently as Mistress Malaprop in “The Rivals,” and, therefore, does not
                        give utterance to such a wonderful variety of felicitous verbal blunders as
                        bis descendant, but he is her undoubted original. And in the Shakespearean
                        plays Dogberry does not stand alone It has been made a reproach to
                        Shakespeare, indeed, that he is too fond of putting these misuses of words
                        into his characters' mouths. The most devout Shakespearean is bound to admit
                        that the poet paid tribute to no small extent to the prevailing taste tor
                        absurd plays on words. Puns of a pitiful badness, ridiculous word- twisting,
                        and absurd ‘conceits,"' as they were called, are to be found in some of his
                        plays in irritating abundance. Although “not of her age, but for the time,”
                        he was still the child of his age, and in his earlier plays especially, he
                        tickled the ears of the groundlings like others of his craft. Apart from
                        puns—of which a patient investigator has found more than a thousand in the
                        plays—and the like verbal quips, malapropisms, or Dogberryisms," as they
                        should here more properly be called, are to be found in plays which preceded
                        “Much Ado.” For instance, in the ‘Merry Wives" Master Slender, when asked if
                        he will marry fair Anne Page, rays: “If there be no great love in the
                        beginning, yet Heaven may de- crease it upon better acquaintance, when we
                        are married... but if you ray 'marry her,’ will marry her : that l am freely
                        dissolved, and dissolutely.” And them three Dogberryisms can be paralleled
                        elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>Still, these instances are only occasional, and Dogberry stands out as tbs
                        undoubted father of malapropisms. Out of the abundance of modern examples
                        there are few which cannot call Dogberry father, though the maternal re-
                        lationship pf Mrs. Malaprop may be admitted. The choir who,on being
                        questioned as to the preaching of a new curate, replied—“He robs his hands
                        together all the time, for all the world as if be was performing his
                        pollutions," was an unconscious Dogberry. The bereaved niece who said that
                        if her old aunt had lived only two or three years more, she would have been
                        a “centurion"; the old woman who re- marked that “ever” since I ate my front
                        teeth by accident, I can’t rightly domesticate my food” ; and her Scotch
                        companion who “likit Gound’s March of Marie Antoinette,” and who
                        characterised a broad jest as 'a dooble St Andrew,” were all sealed of the
                        tribe of Mrs. Malaprop.</p>
                    <p>All verbal confusions are not malapropisms. The man who had lost bis way in a
                        great museum and asked to he shown the entrance ont; the civic dignitary who
                        proposed the toast of “The Prince and Princess of Wales and the remains of
                        the Royal Family"; and the judge who told the prisoner that be deserved
                        condign punishment, suffered from verbal confusion of different kinds,bat
                        were not true malapropism. The best malapropkuns are those which have a '
                        happy touch of truth about them. An excellent example is the remark of the
                        servant girl who told an evening smaller that her mistress had gone to a
                        “conversation only"—an ingenious and not untrue perversion of conversazione.
                        Of the same kind was the confession of political faith odo6 made to the
                        writer by an old man, jobbing gardener, that he was ' an old servatory.”</p>
                    <p>The original Mrs. Malaprop, who convulsed her audience at Covent Garden when
                        “The Rivals" was produced in 1775, was Mrs. Green (Jane Hippisley). the
                        daughter of John Hippisley, an actor well known in his day. Dibdin praises
                        her droll humonr, and GeNest, who calLS her an excellent actress, says
                        “correctness end vivacity -distinguished her performance." Mrs. Green made
                        her mark as the original, representative, not only of Mrs. Malaprop, but of
                        Mrs. Hardeastle in Gold- smith’s “She Stoops to Conquer,” and of the title
                        character in Sheridan's "The Duenna.” Since her day many have been the
                        actresses who have delighted audiences with Mrs. MalapropV ingenious
                        perversions. Few, however, can have had such an absurd adventure as once
                        befell Mrs, Poynter, a member of Buckstone’s once famous Hay market company,
                        who on one occasion played Mrs. Malaprop in a performance of “The Rivals,
                        given at Windsor before Queen Vic- toria in the, early year of Her late
                        Majesty’s reign. Mrs. Poynter was one of the last ladies to wear the old
                        fashioned, eighteenth century hoop, and she wore it on this occa- sion,
                        appropriately enough, on the stage. Un- luckily in the course of tho evening
                        the wide- spreading,-Unyielding wooden shoop stuckfast in the narrow wing,
                        and the stage was kept waiting for some minutes while Mrs. Malaprop was
                        being extricated from her ridiculous posi tion.</p>
                    <p>Descendants of Mrs. Malaprop in mordern fiction and humorous writing nave
                        been fairly numerous—Mrs. Brown, Mrs. Slipshod, Mrs Ramsbottom, and the
                        rest—though there is not one of them who equals her ancestor. The latest of
                        the family is a Mrs. Pettifer in Miss E. G. Hayden’s clever Berkshire novel,
                        “Rose of Lone Farm.” which was published a few months ago. Mrs. Pettifer is
                        a decided success.</p>

                    <p>BY <persName>JOSEPH KNIGHT</persName>.</p>
                    <p>A few days ago <placeName>England</placeName> could boast the possession of
                        the greatest actor of the present or many previous generations. There is not
                        the slightest exaggeration in this statement. We have to go beyond the time
                        of Kean, Talma, and the Kembles, to that of <persName>David
                            Garrick</persName>, to fend a man intellectually his equal. In quarters
                        in which old traditions survive, this statement will be received with
                        hesitation and demur, if it is received at all. It is none the less inde-
                        feasible, and demonstrably true. We will go farther, indeed, and maintain
                        that in days, science apart, of mediocrities and “non- valeurs,” one of the
                        few truly great man we could boast has disappeared.</p>
                    <p>In expository ability Irving has known and leaves behind him compeers and
                        rivals. His elocution, unless, as in Becket and one or two ether recent
                        performances, he kept a guard upon himself, was faulty, and not even too
                        articulate. His method was uncertain, and he was too often insensible of the
                        value of repose. When endeavouring, as in Lear, Othello, and the great
                        tragic characters, to display the tragic frenzy, his voice was sometimes
                        raucous and scarcely human. These things signified 1 little, and in the
                        splendoar of his accomplish- ment will soon be forgotten. They were but
                        spots on the disc of a sun.</p>
                    <p>Almost the greatest gift of the actor was his imagination, perception,
                        illuminatory power. Of his art it might be said, as Portia said of Mercy,
                        “'Tis mightiest in the mightiest." He might spare to othlfta, the faultless
                        limpid ' speech, the heroic gesture, the splendour of bearing. He bad,
                        indeed, "that within which passeth show." He could fill a character and ,
                        inspire it. with a mighty and puissant con- ception. The idea, as in
                        Shylock, might con- ceivably be wrong. Accepting it, however, as the might
                        of the actor not seldom compelled, it was magnificently realised, and among
                        the figures that crowd open the memory, that of the tall bowed figure, the
                        eye hateful and gleaming with scorn, and the incarnation of powerless
                        malignity, pathetic, and almost dignified in its impotence, stands one of
                        the foremost.</p>
                    <p>Irvings’s greatest triumph was his Hamlet What, indeed, have we to oppose
                        against it ? It lacked youth, and was meditative and infirm rather than
                        gusty and passion-swayed. When we compare it with all others, however, it
                        stands pre-eminent,' unassailable. In the scene after the hurried flight of
                        the guil y King, when Hamlet throws himself on the vacant throne he is never
                        again to occupy, it was absolute electricity. Those with capacit to judge,
                        and experience wherewith to compare, ' are forced to go back to Fechter in
                        order to find anything to- set against it, and the com- parison is then
                        between the brilliant and the august. Failing recollections of Fechter wo
                        torn to modern actors, in whom personal advantage and technique supply the
                        place of inspiration. His Louis XI. remains the most sinister and fateful of
                        his chara tera. His con- ception was wholly different from, and not quieter,
                        than that of Charles Kean ; and was more varied, more estate, more
                        malignant, but not more deadly. Mathias, the character in which he first
                        showed the world on what it bad to count, and with what it had to deal, is,
                        of course, an unsurpassable psychological study, the memory of which will
                        never pass away. The keenest German students were stagger- ed by his
                        Mephistopheles, which, indeed, outran accepted tradition. -It was
                        nevertheless a profoundly stimulating if not altogether satisfactory
                        interpretation, We have to recall also ‘‘Richard the Third," in which all
                        that was most grimly sardonic and acrid in his honor showed itself. In more
                        than one respect this performance stood fore- most "<persName>Robert
                            Macaire</persName>," again, with its mingled gifts, and “Becket,” with
                        its exquisite modulation, rise in the memory to show us what a loss w. have
                        sustained, and how wide was the actor’s range, covering everything be- tween
                        beauty and terror.</p>
                    <p>The charm of his manner, affectionate and occasionally playful and a trifle
                        derisive among I his intimates, will not be forgotten by those who had the
                        covetable honor of, his friendship. Staunch and loyal to those he loved,
                        generous and ever magnificent of parse, using the word in its fall sense, in
                        hospitality, he stood alone and apart, a man whose place in affection,
                        admiration, and love is never to be filled.</p>

                        preparing to make up for this evening’s performance of the ever-fresh
                        “Cyrano” hardly an hour and a half after washing off the paint of the

                        together in print. There was some discussion between us in the early

                        How many long and valuable talks we have had, talks from which, each of us

                        learnt more and more every time to admire and love Irving’a charac- ter. He
                        was a delightful, a noble, an exquisite man. His charm was not mere courtesy
                        ; it was true, genuine nobleness of character. He felt rather sadly the end
                        of the Lyceum. Very deeply, in fact But he bore what was a poignant grief to
                        him with admirable, with noble philosophy. His melancholy, when he was
                        melancholy, was generous and large-hearted, for he knew not what bitterness
                        was. But these last few months he was gayer and happier again. The great
                        success of his Drury Lane season was a great joy to him. I was deeply glad
                        of his success for his sake—and for the credit of the public.</p>
                    <p>“Yes, my old friend was a great heart, one of the chosen, I will say, an ame
                        d’elite, a genuine Ame d’artiste, that is all that is no- blest. I feel his
                        loss terribly. His friendship towards me never failed. On every single
                        occasion when I went over to set in London I invariably found in my
                        dressing-room on my first night a telegram of heartfelt good wishes. He was
                        good and kind and generous unfailingly. Only last Friday I had the visit of
                        two charm- ing English girls,daughters of a friend of Irving ' au'l of
                        myself, and we talked for a long time , together about our friend. That was
                        the very day of his death. Of course, I saw him in all hia parta—Hamlet,
                        Macbeth, Charles I., Becket, and a boo re more. About ‘The Bells’ we
                        disagreed to a certain extent. But in Irving’s acting one could criticise
                        but a detail here and there. The ensemble was always great, always intensely
                        interesting and valu- able. Criticisms were swamped when one looked at the
                        creation as a whole.</p>
                    <p>“And what immense benefits the English ! stage owes him in every way I What
                        wide and profound intelligence he had, with im- mense artistic and literary
                        knowledge, and, of course, the instinct of his art. Above all, be was a
                        great heart, and his friends will never see his like again. When is the
                        funeral ? If only I could find the time to go over ! I would leave
                        everything bat my duty here to go. I might try—yet, no. I cannot do it I am
                        not only a soldier on duty here, I am, as it were, in the thick of the
                        battle, and I cannot desert ' even fo- him. But again, I can’t tell yon how
                        deeply I feel his loss." The dresser uttered a warning word. It was time for
                        M. Coquelin to put on his war paint, and Cyrano’s grey felt, with the strag-
                        gling feather, which lay on a chair by his side.</p>

                    <p><placeName>Turkey </placeName>still refuses to have anything to do with the
                        new international scheme for the financial control of
                            <placeName>Macedonia</placeName>. The patience of the Powers is nearly
                        as inexhaustible as the obstruction of the <placeName>Porte</placeName>, but
                        by this time, if they are really in earnest, its limits most almost hare
                        been reached. The collective Vote of the six Embassies, to which the Porte
                        was just replied with a refusal, represents positively the fourth effort on
                        the part of the Powers to secure the adhesion of the
                            <placeName>Sultan.</placeName> The first demand was made in May. In
                        their fourth and last communication, on September 25, the Ambassadors
                        pointed out that the foreign delegates appointed as controllers would arrive
                        at <placeName>Salonika</placeName> on October 1, and asked that the
                        necessary instructions to the provincial authorities should be given without
                        delay. The delegates are now arriving at <placeName>Salonika</placeName>,
                        where they will meet the Russian and Austro-Hungarian civil agents and
                        confer with them on the programme of their labours. The Powers have
                        disregarded the Porte’s con- tinued protests. They are probably wise in so
                        doing. The presence of the international delegates in
                            <placeName>Macedonia</placeName> may do not a little to convince the
                        Turks that business is seriously intended, and that Europe means to have its
                        way. If they continue their obstruction, they cannot do to any longer
                        without challenging an open conflict with the Powers, and this would be
                        neither prudent nor characteristic. Turkey prefers obstruction in the shade,
                        and she has played her part so far with all her unfailing instinct for pure
                        comedy. She has represented herself to the Powers, according to custom, as
                        one who was only too ready to oblige, and who has, in fact, already given
                        the last proofs of an obliging disposition in yield- ing to repeated and
                        exorbitant demands from the Powers. All that she reserved for herself under
                        the Murzsteg scheme was the sovereign rights of the Sultan, and now, she
                        contends, the Powers are intruding upon these. The question really to be
                        decided is whether this recalcitrance of <placeName>Turkey</placeName> means
                        anything more than it has meant on previous occasion. Every time a reform
                        has been broached the Porte has come forward with the same old story, and
                        every time it has yielded in the end. S0, we imagine, it will eventually
                        yield on this financial question, provided that the Powers show unmistakably
                        that they mean to carry it through. Reports from Constantinople are not,
                        however, although encouraging, and unless there is real unanimity of action
                        as well as of language the Sultan will hold out. There is nothing over which
                            <persName>Abdul Hamid</persName> keeps more jealous guard than the
                        finances of his Empire. He may therefore be expected to resent the financial
                        control of <placeName>Macedonia</placeName> by the Powers hardly less than
                        he would resent its political dismemberment.</p>
                    <p>It is a strangely short-sighted policy on the part of
                            <placeName>Turkey</placeName> not to accept and co-ope- rate in the
                        programme of the Powers. In the last year or two Macedonia must have proved
                        a most mostly possession to the Sultan. He has bad to spend large sums on
                        mobilis- ing troops and patting down disorder the country has been
                        absolutely impoverished ; and there has been the farther menace of a
                        possible Bulgarian war. All his measures have been quite incapable of
                        remedying the situation, and if he is left to himself the results will
                        always be the same. It is the inherent weakness of the Turkish adminis-
                        tration which is responsible for all the trouble in Macedonia. Being unable
                        to govern the country in any other way, the Sultan pursues his plan of
                        playing off one race and one Church against another ; and in the levying and
                        assessment of taxes bis agents resort to extortionate abuse which
                        permanently retards the development of the country. The amount of wastage
                        which goes on must be enormous, and experience shows that there can be no
                        remedy for this except some mea- sure of European control. We do not pretand
                        that the task before the delegates is an easy one. One of the first and moat
                        difficult steps they will have to take is to decide precise- ly what powers
                        they require to carry out their task ; and the next step, perhaps not less
                        difficult, will be to obtain them. No farther improvement in the state of
                        Mace- donia seems possible without some such scheme as the Powers have
                        devised, and it is hardly necessary to say that public opinion in this
                        country will support His Majesty’s Government in any joint measures that may
                        be needed to secure the compliance of the Porte. (“Times”).</p>
