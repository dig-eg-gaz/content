                            lamps all the various forms of spelling. Here are some illustrations of

                        <p>Some years ago the Indian Government adopted a uniform system of spelling
                            on the Hunterian method, to prevent confusion, and it is quite time the
                            Egyptian Government did the same. The stereotyped form could be left to
                            the Survey Department, who have already nearly completed a survey of
                            Egypt embracing every single hamlet, or ezbeh, ezbet, isba, izba, izbit.
                            This department could issue a general index, and also a geographical
                            list with mudiriehs, districts, villages, esbehs. It would be of much
                            use in fixing exact name and locality. Press notices of village
                            occurrences are at times very vague as to locality. Teh el Baroud, often
                            erroneously called Tel, is now spelt Stai el Baroud on Survey maps. The
                            names of natives is a great source of error, and a properly-spelt list
                            would be of much ser- vice. A native's identity is at times lost in the
                            vagaries of spelling.</p>

                    <p>During the week ending on Saturday last 57 deaths from bovine typhus were
                        reported throughout Egypt During the corresponding period last year, 7,169
                        deaths were reported. A slight recrudescence of the disease is noted daring
                        the last week, but this is entirely of a local character, confined to the
                        provinces of Gharbieh and Ghizeh.</p>
                    <p>Since the beginning of the outbreak the cattle of the localities infected and
                        neighbouring villages have been inoculated with serum. This has always
                        checked the development oI the disease. The quantity of serum at the
                        disposal of the Sanitary Administration is amply sufficient for inoculation
                        in case of local outbreaks, and a constant supply is furnished by the Serum
                        Farm. The Administration baa every ground for the hope that the disease will
                        have disappeared by the end of this year.</p>
                    <p>The serum seems to have little or no protective effect with animals coming
                        from Cyprus, many of which, though inoculated, have succumbed to the
                        disease. Similar experiments have been dumJc in India on animals coming from
                        the mountains and from the plains. The cattle of the plains are protected by
                        the serum, which, however, has little or no effect on the mountain cattle,
                        even when employed in strong doses. Under these conditions the Sanitary
                        Administration considers die importation of Cypriote cattle, as long as the
                        epidemic lasts, to be a mistake, as these animals are sure to be infected
                        sooner or later.</p>

                    <p>On Saturday two new cases of plague were reported, with a death outside
                        hospital, at Suez, and one new case with two deaths outside hospital at Kafr
                        el Fokaha, in the Toukh Markaz.</p>
                    <p>During the week ending the 31st December, 15 cases of bubonic plague occurred
                        throughout Egypt. An increase appears in the number of cases occurring at
                        Suez last week. It appears from the report that I have received from Dr.
                        Cresswell and from my own observations, (says Sir H. Pinching in his report)
                        that these cases are due to infection conveyed by rata, which had been
                        infected themselves by goods coming from India or Upper Egypt. One of the
                        persons attacked by plague at Suez is an assistant in a shop, which contains
                        large quantities of indigo coming from Calcutta and tea from Madras. In
                        moving the cases containing these goods the dead bodies of rats were found.
                        Large quantities of beans have also been imported from Upper Egypt, where
                        cases of plague occurred this year, the last of which was reported on July

                    <p>The new tariff which came into force yesterday on the Alexandria and Ramleh
                        Railway Company's line has aroused a considerable amount of indignation
                        among the inhabitants.</p>
                    <p>Mr. IL II. Birch sends us the following communication on the subject:—</p>
                    <p>The directors of tho Ramleh Railway Company, Ltd., have issued a notice that
                        no further contract tickets will be issued after 31st December, 1904, end
                        that in place of them “carnets,” or books of tickets, will be provided at a
                        price which more-than doubles the cost of the yearly contract. The reasons
                        given for this new departure are-</p>
                    <p>I “That many contract holders refuse to show their tickets to the conductors
                        when called upon to do so, and abuse and even assault them." The remedy for
                        this is to send the offenders before tho Tribunals, and exac the penalty for
                        their misconduct.</p>
                    <p>II“The company is now a tramway company and no such companies in Europe issue
                        contract tickets.” To this the reply is that it was a railway company when
                        the concession was obtained from the Egyptian Government, and if it has
                        suited the direction to convert the railway into a tramway for their own
                        benefit, it is no reason why the public should be sacrificed.</p>
                    <p>The Government, having granted a monopoly to the company, should take care
                        that this monopoly is not abused. The contract holders are mostly old
                        residents, and it is not only the proceeds of their tickets that benefit the
                        company, but also a further benefit accrues from the members of their
                        households and guests who visit them and who do not hold contracts. What is
                        to be the result of this new regulation? The increased charge is altogether
                        immensurate to the service rendered by the company. Numbers of people will
                        have to leave Ramleh, and rents, house property, and land will all decrease
                        in value. It behoves everybody to protest energetically against this
                        regulation, which is unjustifiable from ad points of view.</p>
                    <p>This morning we interviewed one of the members of the board of the company,
                        Mr. Lumbroso, who gave us the following exposition of the directors’
                        standpoint:—</p>
                    <p>In no country in the world are there season tickets for electric trams, but
                        only books of tickets. After the electrification of the line, and out of
                        consideration for the public’s demands, season tickets were issued on the
                        condition that every season ticket holder should have his photograph in the
                        ticket case and should show it whensoever asked by the company’s servants.
                        But, continued Mr. Lumbreso, this system has been rendered impossible owing
                        to the "mauvaise volonte” of the public and of the tricks played upon the
                        company by -false season ticket holders, who insulted and attacked the
                        employees when asked to show their tickets. The directors have had to stop
                        issuing season tickets, and have reduced the price of packets of 50 tickets
                        for the first class from P.T. 38 to P.T. 75 and for the second class from
                        P.T. 4.7 to P.T. 37J. This, said Mr. Lumbroso, was a sacrifice made by the
                        company for the sake of the public, since on a total of about L.E. 50,000
                        the amount realized from season tickets was only L.E. 8,000. On the other
                        hand, tho above must take into consideration the fact that if the present
                        price of the books of ticket appears to be higher than the season ticket
                        rate, the new system has the advantage of allowing them to give away the
                        tickets in the books to their families and servants if they wish to.</p>

                    <p>The heavy fail in American cotton has led to the failure of one of the
                        leading Syrian capitalists in Egypt, Mr. Selim Tawil, who belongs to a
                        family which is well known at Alexandria, and whose business connections
                        were very extensive. His speculations were chiefly directed to American
                        cotton, and on Friday last he found himself unable to pay his differences.
                        The amount he has failed for is said to be £180,000. As the Bourse and all
                        the banks are closed today it is impossible for us to obtain complete
                        details of the failure.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Tawil was arrested on Saturday but was at once released on the guarantee
                        of Mr. Gorra, late of the Imperial Ottoman Bank at Alexandria.</p>

                <head>A NEW SUEZ CANAL</head>
                <head>French Views</head>
                <head>Important Interview</head>
                <p>The Paris corrrespondent of the Standard, writing under date of the 18th December
                    sends the following interesting article to that news- paper:-</p>
                <p>The telegraphic announcement received here from London that Sir Theodore Angier,
                    of the shipping firm of Messrs. Angier Brothers, hi declared that the plans are
                    complete for a second Canal across the Isthmus of Suez, and that the contractors
                    are ready to commence its construction, was calculated to mislead the general
                    public into the belief that such a second Canal would really be cut without
                    delay, un- less to use the words of the despatch, “British cargo vessels
                    received fairer treatment at the hands of the present Canal Company."</p>
                <p>Before referring to the grievances of certain shipowners, it is right to point
                    out that the Suez Canal Company possesses a monopoly which will not expire till
                    the Canal, at the end of its concession in about seventy years, passes into the
                    possession of the Egyptian Govern- ment. It is, of course, possible that the
                    present Canal Company should, through violation of its concession, be pronounced
                    to have forfeited its monopoly; but at the present time the complaints do not go
                    so far as that.</p>
                <p>It is probable that if the present Company failed to keep its engagements, the
                    Egyptian Government, would quash its monopoly, and perhaps grant another
                    concession to a new company; but, the British Government, which possesses no
                    fewer than 176,000 of the Suez Canal Shares, and has its representatives on the
                    Board of Directors, has formulated no com- plaint against the management of the
                    enterprise which produces for a sufficiently large revenue to be of appreciable
                    value to the English Treasury.</p>
                <p>If the Canal were mismanaged, the British Government, as the largest shareholder,
                    would certainly be the first to complain; but under present circumstances its
                    representatives are in perfect accord with the president and other members of
                    the board of directors, so that is scarcely likely to advise the Khedive to
                    grant a concession for a second Canal.</p>
                <p>Even supposing the concession were granted by the Egyptian Government, there
                    would still remain the question of the Sovereignty of the Sultan, and of the
                    validity of that con- cession without the ratification of the Porte. It is,
                    therefore, clear that if the plans for the cutting of a second Canal are already
                    prepared, the moment has not yet come when the con- tractors can commence their
                    work.</p>
                <p>With regard to the Canal dues charged on the spaces on deck capable of being
                    utilised for cargo, M. Bonnet, the general secretary of the Company, assured me
                    to-day that the regulations for the measurement of those deck spaces were in
                    complete accord with the deci- sions of the Constantinople Conference, and that,
                    moreover, the Board of Trade approved them. Certain spaces on deck available for
                    cargo were still exempt, and were only taxed for the payment of Canal dues after
                    it had been demonstrated beyond doubt by the ship- owner himself that they were
                    destined to be oc copied with cargo by cargo being found in them. After a vessel
                    has once presented itself in the Canal with cargo in such previously exempted
                    spaces, those spaces are for the future always included in the tonnage on which
                    the Canal tolls are calculated.</p>
                <p>After reading the interview with Sir Theo- dore Angier, published in The Standard
                    of Saturday, I called again on M. Bonnet, who is leaving for Egypt on Tuesday
                    with Prince d'Arenborg. Their visit to the Isthmus is in no way connected with
                    the present agitation in favour of constructing an opposition canal but is
                    simply the annual visit of inspection al- ways made by the President of the Suez
                    Cana Company.</p>
                <p>Sir Theodore Angier (as reported in your issue of December 16) said to your
                    representa- tives :—"We defeated Mr. Gladstone's assump- tion of a monopolist
                    right, and he had to con- foss-that he was wrong. We got a new con-
                    cession."</p>
                <p>“Both these statements,” said M. Bonnet to me today, “are absolutely incorrect.
                    Mr Gladstone never contested the Company's monopoly, and no concession was ever
                    granted for a second Canal."</p>
                <p>The exclusive character of the Suez Canal Company's concession is unquestionable,
                    espe- cially as no one contests that the Canal now completely answers the
                    requirements of the shipping using it. Sir Theodore Angier com- plains that the
                    Suez Canal Company has in many ways violated what is known as “the London
                    programme," signed in 1883. M Bonnet's reply on this point was very clear He
                    said to me, in substance: —‘Sir Theodore Angier contends that our tonnage
                    measurements are arbitrary. The fact is that every vessel using the Canal has
                    two certificates of tonnage. In the case of British ships,t he Board of Trade
                    gives first its home certificate of tonnage, and secondly a Suez Canal
                    certificate, established in conformity with the regulations of that Com- pony,
                    drawn up by the Constantinople Con- ference. Tee Suez Canal authorities
                    naturally base their Canal dues on this latter certificate, and make
                    no-arbitrary charges."</p>
                <p>“With regard to the question of the di- vidend, taken in connection with the re-
                    duction of Canal dues,” went on M. Bonnet “the ‘London programme' suggested that
                    the future augmentation of the profits of the enterprise should be applied in
                    equal parts to increase the dividend on the shares and to reduce the Canal dues.
                    Thus, in 1883 when the dividend on the shares was only 93 francs, the Company
                    made its customers, the shipowners, 4 present of half its even- toal increased
                    profits. This agreement has been kept so for several years till 1891, when there
                    was no surplus to divide, whilst later on the surplus was sufficient only to
                    permit of an annual redaction of a few cen- times per ton. It was unanimously
                    agreed between all the French and foreign Directors of the Canal that the
                    reduction of dues should operate each time the surplus allowed of a reduction of
                    50 centimes per ton, and not before."</p>
                <p>“If the reduction of one or a fraction of a centime were made annually, the Com-
                    pany," said the secretary, "would run the risk of being obliged in a bad year to
                    reduce its dividend without being able to increase the Canal dues. Moreover the
                    divi- sion of surplus profits is based on tho dm- dend at the moment of the last
                    diminution of the toll."</p>
                <p>“It was also promised on the ‘London pro- gramme,’ " pursued M. Bonnet, “that
                    after the dividend on the shares should have reached 25 per cent., or 125 francs
                    per share, the totality of the surplus profits should go towards the reduction
                    of the Canal dues. That moment arrived quicker than was anticipated ; and,
                    immediately the surplus profits allow of the reduction of the present toll of 8
                    francs 50 centimes per ton by 50 cen- times, the diminution will be effected. In
                    the meantime the dividend has increased and will increase, and the further
                    surplus profits, after each reduction of the toll by 50 cen- times, will, as
                    heretofore, be calculated on the dividend declared simultaneously with the
                    lowering of the toll. Till now this interpretation of the ‘London programme' has
                    been uncon- tested, and it would evidently be impossible to get the shareholders
                    of any oompany to accept the position of the certainty of no increase in their
                    dividend with the possibility, and even the probability, of a reduction in their
                    income owing to the fact of all the surplus profits being employed to reduce
                    tolls which might, in the case of a period of prosperity being followed by one
                    of commercial depression, have been brought down so low as to entail a very
                    heavy lost to the share- holders."</p>
                <p>“The next reduction of fifty centimes in the toll will take place," added M.
                    Bonnot, “when the dividend on the share capital has reached one hundred and
                    thirty-five francs. Each ten francs increase of the dividend will correspond for
                    the future with a reduction of fifty centimes in the toll."</p>
                <p>As to Sir Theodore Angior’s idea that the British directors should be appointed
                    by the British shipowners, M. Bonnet pointed out to me what Prince d'Arenborg
                    wrote some weeks ago, and he declared there could be no ques- tion of reversing
                    that decision. The directors are, as in every company, selected by the board of
                    directors, and their appointment is ratified by the shareholders at the general
                    meeting.</p>

                    <head>THE EGYPTIAN DELTA LIGHT RAILWAYS, LIMITED.</head>
                    <head>A SATISFACTORY YEAR.</head>
                    <head>THE CAPITAL INCREASED.</head>
                    <p>The ordinary general meeting of the Egyp- tian Delta Light Railways, Limited,
                        was held at London on the 20th ulto. Sir A. Colvin (chairman of the company)
                        presiding.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary (Mr. F. J. Horne) read the notice convening the meeting.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman: Gentlemen, you will, I presume, as usual, take the report as
                        read. It is with much pleasure that we place in your hands such a
                        satisfactory account of the past year, the results achieved having been, as
                        you will see, excellent. And this notwithstanding the fact that the cattle
                        plaque prevailed throughout the year, and that no mouleds or religions fairs
                        were held. Whilst the increased average mileage worked has been less than
                        one-third per cent, the increase in the gross receipts has been £30,483 on a
                        total of £132,791 for 1903, or 23 per cent. Towards this our passenger
                        traffic has contributed £14,389—nearly one-half—the numbers carried have
                        gone up by 841,715 on a former total of 3,636,688, or nearly 23 per cent.
                        The goods traffic also was very good, the receipts having gone up by
                        £11,272, or over 20 per cent, the tons lifted showing a very large increase
                        of 274,167 tons on a former total of 471,530. But of this 195,198 tons were
                        for a special traffic in earth for reclaiming land by filling. This is
                        entered under the head of “Manure," and ac- counts for the very large
                        apparent increase under that head. The increase, therefore, under goods
                        proper is some 79,000 tons—say, 17 percent—there being an increase under
                        nearly every important item. There was a good cotton crop, and we carried
                        25,326 tons more, making a total of 136,375 tons of cotton moved, mostly
                        loose, on a total last year of 111,049. The through bookings with the Slate
                        Railway is steadily increasing, and this year amounted to 112,500 tons. The
                        stone traffic at the El-Mounir and Abou Zabel quarries has made a fair
                        start, and amounted to 8,667 tons, and as the condition of the country
                        improves—the improvement year by year is very notable—better houses will be
                        erected and more stone required for building them, so that we look for a
                        steady develop- ment of this traffic to find employment for our goods stock
                        in the slack season. In some very interesting articles in The Times last
                        year on American railways and their working, it was stated that one of the
                        principal freight agents of an important American system, on being asked
                        what would be the charges for the carriage of some 15-ton lots a distance of
                        35 miles, replied :—"Oh, we don’t worry ourselves about such business as
                        that We must carry most of our freight an average of 50 miles at least
                        before we can consider that we have paid expenses I would rather carry from
                        ten to forty tons of freight a distance of 1,500 miles for half a cent per
                        ton per mile than I would carry it fifty miles for five cents per ton per
                        mile.” We think our staff, therefore, deserve credit for the results
                        achieved, when I tell you that the average load of all our goods traffic is
                        only twelve miles with comparatively few consign- ments as large as 15 tons.
                        We had about 300 miles of telegraph open at the end of the year, and earned
                        £1,088, against an ex- penditure of £479. There is not much money in it, but
                        it is a great convenience to our customers and in train working. Sundries
                        also show a good increase of £4,610, due to hire of rolling stock for
                        construction purposes, and to profits realised for the sale of reclaimed
                        land. As regards our working charges, whilst the gross receipts have gone up
                        by £30,483, of this increase only £8,857 has been spent on extra working,
                        and this mainly on the addi- tional train mileage entailed by the growth of
                        the passenger and goods traffic. This brings our ratio of working down to
                        the satisfactory figure of 55.94 per cent against 62.12 last year. We trust
                        that the traffic will steadily increase, and enable us to put this figure
                        even somewhat lower; but on the other hand, we must remind you that as the
                        line grows older the charges for maintenance and renewal of permanent way
                        and rolling stock must increase. Well, gentlemen, when after meeting all
                        charges for Debenture interest, putting by the sum of £11,046 for the
                        sinking fund, and £2,834 for reserve, or a total ol £13,880, equivalent to
                        1.8 per cent on the Preference capital—although a considerable portion of
                        that capital was unproductive owing to delays in getting sanction for works,
                        in obtaining possession of land required, ant other causes-we found that we
                        had sufficient to pay you a dividend of 5 per cent for the year without any
                        material reduction of the amount brought forward from last year, to say
                        nothing of having an appreciable reserve in hand, considering the short time
                        we have been working, we thought that with favorable prospects for the
                        current year before us we were fully justified in recommending for your
                        approval that dividend.</p>
                    <p>Since the report was issued we have heard that Government have given their
                        consent to the fusion of the Helouan Railway with that owned by the Delta
                        Company, which has now been taken over and worked by us. As pointed out in
                        the report, the concession for the Cairo Quarry lines has been completed,
                        and we have now started work on them. For the reasons given in the report we
                        have not during the year made as much progress as we could have wished with
                        our extensions, having only opened some 17 miles ; since September 30th 6
                        miles more have been opened. The concession of the Province of Menoufieh is
                        still delayed, pending the completion, presumably, of Government
                        formalities, although we have done what we could during the past year to
                        bring the matter to a close. We have also, sur- veyed some 130 miles of
                        line, and carried out some improvements in the way of better stations,
                        conversion of flag stations into permanent stations, lengthening of sidings,
                        and such-like work necessitated by the growth of the traffic. Altogether we
                        have expended some £141,000, of which £47,611 has been spent on rolling
                        stock, we having put on the line twelve now 6-wheeled coupled engines which
                        take excellent loads, 25 new bogie coach ing vehicles, 100 new bogie steel
                        platform wag- ons, and since the close of the year 25 new bogie coaching
                        vehicles and six more engines have been completed and are ready to go. With
                        the growing extension and increasing traffic we must keep the line well
                        supplied with stock, and more will be required immediately. Your , board is
                        greatly indebted to the exertions and intelligent conduct of their affairs
                        by their staff in Egypt,to all of whom, and especially to their agent.
                        Captain Adams, RE., the acknowledg- ments of the company are largely due. I
                        am glad to be able to add that throughout the year we have continued to
                        maintain our customary excellent relations with the Egyptian Govern- ment
                        authorities. I may mention that the ma- naging director and myself hope to
                        be able to visit Egypt again this winter, to discuss various important
                        points with the local board and the Government, and I trust our visits will
                        con- tinue to be of the same use and advantage to the company as I venture
                        to believe has hitherto shown itself the case, both as regards the Govern-
                        ment and as enabling us personally to discuss with the local board,
                        questions which require dis- , cussion on the spot, and of which the
                        disposal is facilitated by such a direct exchange of views between your
                        directors. With your permission I propose to deal first with the ordinary
                        busi- ness of the meeting, and when that is disposed of to bring before you
                        proposals for an increase of capital. I will, therefore, now move :— “That
                        the report of the directors, dated November 30th, 1904, together with the
                        state- , ment of accounts and balance-sheet for the year ended September
                        30th, 1904, be and they are hereby approved, confirmed and adopted.” Before
                        putting the resolution to the vote I shall be very glad to answer any
                        question that shareholders may wish to put to me, or give any information in
                        my power.</p>
                    <p>The Hon. Sir C. W. Fremantle seconded the resolution.</p>
                    <p>No questions bring asked, the resolution was put to the meeting and carried
                        unan- imously.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman : Tho second resolution I have the honor to propose is : “That
                        the interim dividend paid in June, 1904, be con- firmed, and that a dividend
                        at the rate of 6 per cent per annum for the half-year ended September 30th,
                        1904, on the Preference share capital of the company be and here- by is
                        declared to be paid to the share holders of the Preference shares standing
                        on the registers of the company at Decem- ber 20th, 1904, and the holders of
                        Preference share warrants to bearer."</p>
                    <p>Lieutenant-Colonel R L. Marryat, R E (managing director), seconded the
                        resolution, and it was carried unanimously.</p>
                    <p>The Hon. Sir C. W. Fremantle moved, “That Sir Auckland Colvin, one of the
                        directors retir- ing in order of rotation, be re-elected"</p>
                    <p>This was seconded by Sir Francis L. O’Calla- ghan and carried
                        unanimously.</p>
                    <p>he Chairman then moved the re-election of the Hon. Sir C. W- Fremantle, and,
                        this having been seconded by Mr. Robert Miller, was carried unanimously.</p>
                    <p>On the motion of the Chairman, seconded by Mr. Montagu Sharpe, Maurice
                        Cattaui Bey was also re-elected a director. </p>
                    <p>Mr. Alfred Wilkins moved the reappoint- ment of Messrs. Frank Davies,
                        Meredith and Co as auditors.</p>
                    <p>Mr Benjamin Keable seconded the resolu- tion, and it was carried
                        unanimously.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman : Gentlemen, I have now to bring before you our proposals for
                        the increase of capital, the resolutions concerning which you will have seen
                        on the hack of the report. We are not in immediate want of cash, as we
                        probably have sufficient to carry us on for some months, but have come to
                        the end of our powers of issue, and we desire to be in a posi- tion to be
                        able to issue more capital as we require it, and to take advantage of a
                        favorable money market, for, as you must be aware, that market of late years
                        has not always been very favorable to fresh issues of capital. We there-
                        fore ask you to create 39,460 new Preference shares, it being understood
                        that we do not propose to issue the whole of this amount at once, as this
                        would form far too heavy a strain on our current revenue, but only such
                        amounts as we require from time to time and can reasonably expect to earn
                        interest on without seriously affecting your dividends in any par- ticular
                        year. I will, therefore, now move:— “That the capital of tho company be
                        increased by the creation of 39,460 now Preference shares of the nominal
                        amount of £10 each, and that such Preference shares be issued and allotted
                        by the board upon such terms and conditions as they may determine, but such
                        shares shall be issued upon the terms (subject to the powers of the board
                        under Article 166 to set aside sinking funds and otherwise) that the surplus
                        profits in each year after providing for a dividend on the amounts from time
                        to time paid, or credited as paid, otherwise than in advance on all
                        Preference shares at the rate of 5$ per cent for each year, shall be
                        applied, first, in making up the arrears of dividend on the Preference
                        shares of the company previously issued in respect of the period previous to
                        the date of issue of the new Preference shares hereby authorised, and when
                        those arrears have been paid, then in paying up the arrears (if any) which
                        may sub- sequently accrue on all Preference shares in the order in which
                        such arrears may have accrued, and thereafter the sum of 10s 9d per cent per
                        annum on the said £394,600 of new capital as part of the sinking fund
                        heretofore authorised in respect of the previous capital, so as to insure
                        the repayment of the whole of the share capital authorised up to the date
                        hereof in its due order of priority under the articles. Save as aforesaid,
                        the said new Preference shares shall rank in all respects with the existing
                        Preference shares of the company." </p>
                    <p>Sir C. W. Fremantle seconded the resolu- tion, and it was carried
                        unanimously.</p>
                    <p>A shareholder asked if the chairman had anything to say with regard to the
                        land com- pany as it affected this company.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman : The land company is still in an early stage. I think all that
                        is to be said about it at present is that it is in the stage of inquiry and
                        initial proceedings, but as far as we can see at present things are going on
                        very favorably, and quite up to any expectations we could have.
                        (Applause).</p>
                    <p>A vote of thanks was passed to the chair- man on the motion of Mr. J. H.
                        Busby, seconded by Mr. Wilkins, and the proceedings terminated.</p>

                    <head>HELOUAN FIRST WINTER MEETING.</head>
                    <p>We congratulate the Helouan Sporting Club on the success of the races held on
                        Saturday afternoon. Some of the causes which contribut- ed to their
                        success—the weather, for example, and the air—could not, it is true, be
                        assigned to the activity of the committee, but in all that concerned the
                        arrangements on the course we noticed an enormous improvement on last year.
                        The pari-mutuel is now behind the grand- stand, which bus been properly
                        roofed and fitted up. The arrangements for supplying tea were capital, and
                        the races began and ended as punctually as possible. There were many
                        residents and visitors at the races ; we noticed among them H.H. Prince
                        Mohamed Ibrahim, General Lance, C.B., Coles Pasha, Ishak Bey Hussein, Mr.
                        Astley Friend, Saleh Bey Yaghen, Mr. Carter Wilson, Mr. Webb, Judge and Mrs.
                        Satow, Capt. Herbert, Dr. and Mrs. Nolan, Dr. Bentley, Mr. Monteith- Smith,
                        Mr. Aspinall, Major Davidson, Ibrahim Bey Cherif, Ahmed Bey Bakri Mr.
                        Lockett, Ariz Pasha Izzet, Mr. Michaelides, and many others.</p>
                    <p>The chief feature of the racing was the success of Moharrem Pasha Chehin’s
                        horses : two firsts, a second, and a third was a good record, and in the
                        Sahara Stakes Bibico’s win was a very easy affair, and Aeolus was only
                        caught in the last 100 yards by Kobelon Tair. The fourth race was a long way
                        the best of the day, and Mizzaud lasting very well beat Shewiman, the
                        favorite, by a little. In the fifth race Fil do Fer was a rather unex-
                        pected winner. Roland’s effort in the third race was a little too late ; a
                        hundred and fifty yards more, and he would probably have been third, it may
                        be second.</p>

                    <p>From the start Soldat was nowhere and the race was obviously left to Saleh
                        Bey Yaghen’s horses, Miasser winning by 2 lengths ; Fahr come up well at the
                        last corner but could not stay and was a poor third. Time 1 min. 18 sec.</p>

                    <p>Moharrem Pasha Chehin’s br.a.h.- Togo, 9.11. Mr. A. J. Michaelides.</p>
                    <p>Togo gave a great deal of trouble at the start, going some half-a-mile up the
                        course be- fore the flag fell. When the horses at last were ready the start
                        was poor. Sayad II. and Togo led, but after the cutting Macdonald came up,
                        only to give way to Rainbow, who passed Togo but could get nowhere near
                        Sayad II., who won anyhow. Togo was third by 3/4 of a length. Time 1.27.</p>
                    <p>Totalisator paid P.T. 126 on winner. Places, 33, 44.</p>

                    <p>Ibrahim Bey Cherif's g.a.h. Sattam, 10.7. Elisea.</p>
                    <p>Firefly, which, with Roland, was a warm favorite, led at the start but at the
                        cutting Bibico and Aeolus were ahead and simply riding away from the rest,
                        who followed 4 or 5 lengths behind in a bunch. In the straight Sattam and
                        Roland rushed up, and the former going very hard caught Aeolus and was
                        second by half a length, Bibico winning without any undue exertion. Roland
                        kept his effort till too late but was going very well at the finish.</p>
                    <p>Totalisator paid P.T. 41 on winner. Places 30, 47, 32.</p>
                    <p>DESERT HANDICAP, of P.T. 3,000, 1st horse to receive P.T.2,000, 2nd P.T.700,
                        and 3rd P.T. 300. For Arab horses. Top-weight not to exceed 11 st. Distance
                        1 1/2 mile. Ibrahim Bey Cherif’s ch.a.h. Royalist, 10.7. Elias.</p>

                    <p>Moharrem Pasha Chehin’s g.b.h. Mizzand, 10.2. Michali.</p>
                    <p>After a moderate start Showiman led but Mizzaud and Royalist challenged him
                        and at the first time round it was anyone’s race. Se- cond time round
                        Mizzaud passed Royalist, all three horses still together but had to give way
                        to Shewimon, who looked like winning on emerging from the cutting. Then came
                        a splen- did race all the way home. Mizzaud came gra- dually up, got ahead
                        in the straight and just got home by half a-length. Royalist was a good
                        third but his jockey used whip too early.</p>
                    <p>Totalisator paid P.T.94 on winner, P.T.61 for place.</p>
                    <p>This race was followed by what appeared to be a private and informal sparring
                        display between two well-known Egyptian owners of racing stables, which was
                        not visible from the grand-stand.</p>
                    <p>TRIAL PLATE, of P.T. 2,500, 1st horse to receive P.T. 2,000, 2nd P.T. 300 and

                        advertised value of P.T. 1,000 or more. Weight for age. Galloways allowed

                    <p>Fil de Fer started off well, followed by Aeolus, who came up well in the
                        straight but could not reach Stillwell’s mount. Sihame picked up well at the
                        finish and was less than a length behind Aeolus. Time 1.57. Totalisator paid

                    <p>Not much interest was taken in this race, which ended in a fairly easy win
                        for Royalist. Togo was badly ridden or might have secured a place.</p>
