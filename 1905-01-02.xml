                    <p>Has not the time arrived for a stereotyped spelling of the names of towns and
                        villages in Egypt! The present variety is more confusing than pleasing. The
                        Journel Officiel often contains several spellings of the same place
                        according as the name is being used by the Public Works, Railway, Finance or
                        other administraion. Nor is an administration always uniform in its method,
                        for the Railway Administration sometimes exhibits in timetable, telegraphic
                        guide, tickets, station homeboards, and lamps all the various forms of
                        spelling. Here are some illustrations of variety taken from official
                        sources: Kalioubieh, Galioubieh, Qualiubia; Guzieh, Guiza, Giza; Kena,
                        Keneg, Qena; Assiout, Assyut, Assiut; Ebchan, Ebshan, Ibshan; Barqnaqs,
                        Barknaks. When names can be found indifferently under the inital K Kh H C G
                        or Q it is quite a labor to consult an index.</p>

                    <p>Some years ago the Indian Government adopted a uniform system of spelling on
                        the Hunterian method, to prevent confusion, and it is quite time the
                        Egyptian Government did the same. The stereotyped form could be left to the
                        Survey Department, who have already nearly completed a survey of Egypt
                        embracing every single hamlet, or ezbeh, ezbet, isba, izba, izbit. This
                        department could issue a general index, and also a geographical list with
                        mudiriehs, districts, villages, esbehs. It would be of much use in fixing
                        exact name and locality. Press notices of village occurrences are at times
                        very vague as to locality. Teh el Baroud, often erroneously called Tel, is
                        now spelt Stai el Baroud on Survey maps. The names of natives is a great
                        source of error, and a properly-spelt list would be of much service. A
                        native's identity is at times lost in the vagaries of spelling.</p>

                    <head>CATTLE PLAGUE.</head>
                    <p>During the week ending on Saturday last 57 deaths from bovine typhus were
                        reported throughout Egypt. During the corresponding period last year, 7,169
                        deaths were reported. A slight recrudescence of the disease is noted during
                        the last week, but this is entirely of a local character, confined to the
                        provinces of Gharbieh and Ghizeh.</p>
                    <p>Since the beginning of the outbreak the cattle of the localities infected and
                        neighbouring villages have been inoculated with serum. This has always
                        checked the development of the disease. The quantity of serum at the
                        disposal of the Sanitary Administration is amply sufficient for inoculation
                        in case of local outbreaks, and a constant supply is furnished by the Serum
                        Farm. The Administration has every ground for the hope that the disease will
                        have disappeared by the end of this year.</p>
                    <p>The serum seems to have little or no protective effect with animals coming
                        from Cyprus, many of which, though inoculated, have succumbed to the
                        disease. Similar experiments have been made in India on animals coming from
                        the mountains and from the plains. The cattle of the plains are protected by
                        the serum, which, however, has little or no effect on the mountain cattle,
                        even when employed in strong doses. Under these conditions the Sanitary
                        Administration considers the importation of Cypriote cattle, as long as the
                        epidemic lasts, to be a mistake, as these animals are sure to be infected
                        sooner or later.</p>

                    <head>BUBONIC PLAGUE.</head>
                    <p>On Saturday two new cases of plague were reported, with a death outside
                        hospital, at Suez, and one new case with two deaths outside hospital at Kafr
                        el Fokaha, in the Toukh Markaz.</p>
                    <p>During the week ending the 31st December, 15 cases of bubonic plague occurred
                        throughout Egypt. An increase appears in the number of cases occurring at
                        Suez last week. It appears from the report that I have received from Dr.
                        Cresswell and from my own observations, (says Sir H. Pinching in his report)
                        that these cases are due to infection conveyed by rats, which had been
                        infected themselves by goods coming from India or Upper Egypt. One of the
                        persons attacked by plague at Suez is an assistant in a shop, which contains
                        large quantities of indigo coming from Calcutta and tea from Madras. In
                        moving the cases containing these goods the dead bodies of rats were found.
                        Large quantities of beans have also been imported from Upper Egypt, where
                        cases of plague occurred this year, the last of which was reported on July
                        31.</p>

                        public auction of the furniture of Mr. Reich, a British subject, which was
                        seized on the application of Mustapha Ahmed, a coachman and local subject.
                        The sale will take place early in January. This announcement has aroused
                        some interest in Cairo, as Mr. Reich was up to a few weeks ago in

                        Reich and Mansfield. A short time back the partnership between these two
                        gentlemen was dissolved. The sale will begin at 10 a.m. on the 6th inst at
                        the Old Continental Hotel buildings, where are the offices and residence of

                    <head>RAMLEH ELECTRIC RAILWAY.<lb/>THE NEW TARIFF.</head>
                    <p>The new tariff which came into force yesterday on the Alexandria and Ramleh
                        Railway Company's line has aroused a considerable amount of indignation
                        among the inhabitants.</p>
                    <p>Mr. L. H. Birch sends us the following communication on the subject:—</p>
                    <p>The directors of the Ramleh Railway Company, Ltd., have issued a notice that
                        no further contract tickets will be issued after 31st December, 1904, and
                        that in place of them “carnets,” or books of tickets, will be provided at a
                        price which more than doubles the cost of the yearly contract. The reasons
                        given for this new departure are:–</p>
                    <p>I. “That many contract holders refuse to show their tickets to the conductors
                        when called upon to do so, and abuse and even assault them." The remedy for
                        this is to send the offenders before the Tribunals, and exact the penalty
                        for their misconduct.</p>
                    <p>II. “The company is now a tramway company and no such companies in Europe
                        issue contract tickets.” To this the reply is that it was a railway company
                        when the concession was obtained from the Egyptian Government, and if it has
                        suited the direction to convert the railway into a tramway for their own
                        benefit, it is no reason why the public should be sacrificed.</p>
                    <p>The Government, having granted a monopoly to the company, should take care
                        that this monopoly is not abused. The contract holders are mostly old
                        residents, and it is not only the proceeds of their tickets that benefit the
                        company, but also a further benefit accrues from the members of their
                        households and guests who visit them and who do not hold contracts. What is
                        to be the result of this new regulation? The increased charge is altogether
                        immensurate to the service rendered by the company. Numbers of people will
                        have to leave Ramleh, and rents, house property, and land will all decrease
                        in value. It behoves everybody to protest energetically against this
                        regulation, which is unjustifiable from all points of view.</p>
                    <p>This morning we interviewed one of the members of the board of the company,
                        Mr. Lumbroso, who gave us the following exposition of the directors’
                        standpoint:—</p>
                    <p>In no country in the world are there season tickets for electric trams, but
                        only books of tickets. After the electrification of the line, and out of
                        consideration for the public’s demands, season tickets were issued on the
                        condition that every season ticket holder should have his photograph in the
                        ticket case and should show it whensoever asked by the company’s servants.
                        But, continued Mr. Lumbreso, this system has been rendered impossible owing
                        to the "mauvaise volonté” of the public and of the tricks played upon the
                        company by false season ticket holders, who insulted and attacked the
                        employees when asked to show their tickets. The directors have had to stop
                        issuing season tickets, and have reduced the price of packets of 50 tickets
                        for the first class from P.T. 88 to P.T. 75 and for the second class from
                        P.T. 47 to P.T. 37½. This, said Mr. Lumbroso, was a sacrifice made by the
                        company for the sake of the public, since on a total of about L.E. 50,000
                        the amount realized from season tickets was only L.E. 8,000. On the other
                        hand, the abonné must take into consideration the fact that if the present
                        price of the books of ticket appears to be higher than the season ticket
                        rate, the new system has the advantage of allowing them to give away the
                        tickets in the books to their families and servants if they wish to.</p>

                    <head>BIG FAILURE AT ALEXANDRIA<lb/> LIABILITIES £180,000.</head>
                    <p>The heavy fall in American cotton has led to the failure of one of the
                        leading Syrian capitalists in Egypt, Mr. Selim Tawil, who belongs to a
                        family which is well known at Alexandria, and whose business connections
                        were very extensive. His speculations were chiefly directed to American
                        cotton, and on Friday last he found himself unable to pay his differences.
                        The amount he has failed for is said to be £180,000. As the Bourse and all
                        the banks are closed today it is impossible for us to obtain complete
                        details of the failure.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Tawil was arrested on Saturday but was at once released on the guarantee
                        of Mr. Gorra, late of the Imperial Ottoman Bank at Alexandria.</p>

                    <p>Saturday evening’s small dance at the Savoy was a huge success, and seldom,
                        even in the very height of the season, has there been a more enjoyable one.
                        Nearly all the officers of the Army of Occupation and of the Egyptian Army
                        were present, as wall as the usual habitatués of Savoy Saturday’s dances.
                        The restaurant was crowded both for dinner and supper. Dr. Milton gave a big
                        dinner party. His guests numbered 18, including the Misses Coles, Dr. Tribe,
                        Mr. McGillivray, Mr. Greville, Dr. Hayward, Mrs. Pidgeon, Mr. Russell, Miss

                            Their departure is a cause of general regret, and the very large

                    <head>A NEW SUEZ CANAL<lb/>French Views<lb/>Important Interview</head>
                    <p>The Paris corrrespondent of the <hi rend="italic">Standard</hi>, writing
                        under date of the 18th December sends the following interesting article to
                        that newspaper:– </p>
                    <p>The telegraphic announcement received here from London that Sir Theodore
                        Angier, of the shipping firm of Messrs. Angier Brothers, had declared that
                        the plans are complete for a second Canal across the Isthmus of Suez, and
                        that the contractors are ready to commence its construction, was calculated
                        to mislead the general public into the belief that such a second Canal would
                        really be cut without delay, unless to use the words of the despatch,
                        “British cargo vessels received fairer treatment at the hands of the present
                        Canal Company."</p>
                    <p>Before referring to the grievances of certain shipowners, it is right to
                        point out that the Suez Canal Company possesses a monopoly which will not
                        expire till the Canal, at the end of its concession in about seventy years,
                        passes into the possession of the Egyptian Government. It is, of course,
                        possible that the present Canal Company should, through violation of its
                        concession, be pronounced to have forfeited its monopoly; but at the present
                        time the complaints do not go so far as that.</p>
                    <p>It is probable that if the present Company failed to keep its engagements,
                        the Egyptian Government would quash its monopoly, and perhaps grant another
                        concession to a new company; but, the British Government, which possesses no
                        fewer than 176,000 of the Suez Canal Shares, and has its representatives on
                        the Board of Directors, has formulated no complaint against the management
                        of the enterprise which produces for it a sufficiently large revenue to be
                        of appreciable value to the English Treasury.</p>
                    <p>If the Canal were mismanaged, the British Government, as the largest
                        shareholder, would certainly be the first to complain; but under present
                        circumstances its representatives are in perfect accord with the president
                        and other members of the board of directors, so that is scarcely likely to
                        advise the Khedive to grant a concession for a second Canal.</p>
                    <p>Even supposing the concession were granted by the Egyptian Government, there
                        would still remain the question of the Sovereignty of the Sultan, and of the
                        validity of that concession without the ratification of the Porte. It is,
                        therefore, clear that if the plans for the cutting of a second Canal are
                        already prepared, the moment has not yet come when the contractors can
                        commence their work.</p>
                    <p>With regard to the Canal dues charged on the spaces on deck capable of being
                        utilised for cargo, M. Bonnet, the general secretary of the Company, assured
                        me to-day that the regulations for the measurement of those deck spaces were
                        in complete accord with the decisions of the Constantinople Conference, and
                        that, moreover, the Board of Trade approved them. Certain spaces on deck
                        available for cargo were still exempt, and were only taxed for the payment
                        of Canal dues after it had been demonstrated beyond doubt by the shipowner
                        himself that they were destined to be occupied with cargo by cargo being
                        found in them. After a vessel has once presented itself in the Canal with
                        cargo in such previously exempted spaces, those spaces are for the future
                        always included in the tonnage on which the Canal tolls are calculated.</p>
                    <p>After reading the interview with Sir Theodore Angier, published in <hi
                            rend="italic">The Standard</hi> of Saturday, I called again on M.
                        Bonnet, who is leaving for Egypt on Tuesday with Prince d'Arenberg. Their
                        visit to the Isthmus is in no way connected with the present agitation in
                        favour of constructing an opposition canal but is simply the annual visit of
                        inspection always made by the President of the Suez Canal Company.</p>
                    <p>Sir Theodore Angier (as reported in your issue of December 16) said to your
                        representa- tives :—"We defeated Mr. Gladstone's assumption of a monopolist
                        right, and he had to confess that he was wrong. We got a new
                        concession."</p>
                    <p>“Both these statements,” said M. Bonnet to me today, “are absolutely
                        incorrect. Mr Gladstone never contested the Company's monopoly, and no
                        concession was ever granted for a second Canal."</p>
                    <p>The exclusive character of the Suez Canal Company's concession is
                        unquestionable, especially as no one contests that the Canal now completely
                        answers the requirements of the shipping using it. Sir Theodore Angier
                        complains that the Suez Canal Company has in many ways violated what is
                        known as “the London programme," signed in 1883. M Bonnet's reply on this
                        point was very clear. He said to me, in substance: —‘Sir Theodore Angier
                        contends that our tonnage measurements are arbitrary. The fact is that every
                        vessel using the Canal has two certificates of tonnage. In the case of
                        British ships, the Board of Trade gives first its home certificate of
                        tonnage, and secondly a Suez Canal certificate, established in conformity
                        with the regulations of that Company, drawn up by the Constantinople
                        Conference. The Suez Canal authorities naturally base their Canal dues on
                        this latter certificate, and make no arbitrary charges."</p>
                    <p>“With regard to the question of the dividend, taken in connection with the
                        reduction of Canal dues,” went on M. Bonnet “the ‘London programme'
                        suggested that the future augmentation of the profits of the enterprise
                        should be applied in equal parts to increase the dividend on the shares and
                        to reduce the Canal dues. Thus, in 1883 when the dividend on the shares was
                        only 99 francs, the Company made its customers, the shipowners, a present of
                        half its eventual increased profits. This agreement has been kept so for
                        several years till 1891, when there was no surplus to divide, whilst<cb
                            n="2"/> later on the surplus was sufficient only to permit of an annual
                        redaction of a few centimes per ton. It was unanimously agreed between all
                        the French and foreign Directors of the Canal that the reduction of dues
                        should operate each time the surplus allowed of a reduction of 50 centimes
                        per ton, and not before."</p>
                    <p>“If the reduction of one or a fraction of a centime were made annually, the
                        Company," said the secretary, "would run the risk of being obliged in a bad
                        year to reduce its dividend without being able to increase the Canal dues.
                        Moreover the division of surplus profits is based on the dividend at the
                        moment of the last diminution of the toll."</p>
                    <p>“It was also promised on the ‘London programme,’ " pursued M. Bonnet, “that
                        after the dividend on the shares should have reached 25 per cent., or 125
                        francs per share, the totality of the surplus profits should go towards the
                        reduction of the Canal dues. That moment arrived quicker than was
                        anticipated ; and, immediately the surplus profits allow of the reduction of
                        the present toll of 8 francs 50 centimes per ton by 50 centimes, the
                        diminution will be effected. In the meantime the dividend has increased and
                        will increase, and the further surplus profits, after each reduction of the
                        toll by 50 centimes, will, as heretofore, be calculated on the dividend
                        declared simultaneously with the lowering of the toll. Till now this
                        interpretation of the ‘London programme' has been uncontested, and it would
                        evidently be impossible to get the shareholders of any company to accept the
                        position of the certainty of no increase in their dividend with the
                        possibility, and even the probability, of a reduction in their income owing
                        to the fact of all the surplus profits being employed to reduce tolls which
                        might, in the case of a period of prosperity being followed by one of
                        commercial depression, have been brought down so low as to entail a very
                        heavy lost to the share- holders."</p>
                    <p>“The next reduction of fifty centimes in the toll will take place," added M.
                        Bonnot, “when the dividend on the share capital has reached one hundred and
                        thirty-five francs. Each ten francs increase of the dividend will correspond
                        for the future with a reduction of fifty centimes in the toll."</p>
                    <p>As to Sir Theodore Angier’s idea that the British directors should be
                        appointed by the British shipowners, M. Bonnet pointed out to me what Prince
                        d'Arenberg wrote some weeks ago, and he declared there could be no question
                        of reversing that decision. The directors are, as in every company, selected
                        by the board of directors, and their appointment is ratified by the
                        shareholders at the general meeting.</p>

                        YEAR.<lb/>THE CAPITAL INCREASED.</head>
                    <p>The ordinary general meeting of the Egyptian Delta Light Railways, Limited,
                        was held at London on the 20th ulto. Sir A. Colvin (chairman of the company)
                        presiding.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary (Mr. F. J. Horne) read the notice convening the meeting.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman: Gentlemen, you will, I presume, as usual, take the report as
                        read. It is with much pleasure that we place in your hands such a
                        satisfactory account of the past year, the results achieved having been, as
                        you will see, excellent. And this notwithstanding the fact that the cattle
                        plaque prevailed throughout the year, and that no mouleds or religions fairs
                        were held. Whilst the increased average mileage worked has been less than
                        one-third per cent, the increase in the gross receipts has been £30,483 on a
                        total of £132,791 for 1903, or 23 per cent. Towards this our passenger
                        traffic has contributed £14,389—nearly one-half—the numbers carried have
                        gone up by 841,715 on a former total of 3,636,688, or nearly 23 per cent.
                        The goods traffic also was very good, the receipts having gone up by
                        £11,272, or over 20 per cent, the tons lifted showing a very large increase
                        of 274,167 tons on a former total of 471,530. But of this 195,198 tons were
                        for a special traffic in earth for reclaiming land by filling. This is
                        entered under the head of “Manure," and accounts for the very large apparent
                        increase under that head. The increase, therefore, under goods proper is
                        some 79,000 tons—say, 17 percent—there being an increase under nearly every
                        important item. There was a good cotton crop, and we carried 25,326 tons
                        more, making a total of 136,375 tons of cotton moved, mostly loose, on a
                        total last year of 111,049. The through bookings with the State Railway is
                        steadily increasing, and this year amounted to 112,500 tons. The stone
                        traffic at the El-Mounir and Abou Zabel quarries has made a fair start, and
                        amounted to 8,667 tons, and as the condition of the country improves—the
                        improvement year by year is very notable—better houses will be erected and
                        more stone required for building them, so that we look for a steady
                        development of this traffic to find employment for our goods stock in the
                        slack season. In some very interesting articles in <hi rend="italic">The
                            Times</hi> last year on American railways and their working, it was
                        stated that one of the principal freight agents of an important American
                        system, on being asked what would be the charges for the carriage of some
                        15-ton lots a distance of 35 miles, replied :—"Oh, we don’t worry ourselves
                        about such business as that. We must carry most of our freight an average of
                        50 miles at least before we can consider that we have paid expenses. I would
                        rather carry from ten to forty tons of freight a distance of 1,500 miles for
                        half a cent per ton per mile than I would carry it fifty miles for five
                        cents per ton per mile.” We think our staff, therefore, deserve credit for
                        the results achieved, when I tell you that the average load of all our goods
                        traffic is only twelve miles with comparatively few consignments as large as
                        15 tons. We had about 300 miles of telegraph open at the end of the year,
                        and earned £1,088, against an expenditure of £479. There is not much money
                        in it, but it is a great convenience to our customers and in train working.
                        Sundries also show a good increase of £4,610, due to hire of rolling stock
                        for construction purposes, and to profits realised for the sale of reclaimed
                        land. As regards our working charges, whilst the gross receipts have gone up
                        by £30,483, of this increase only £8,857 has been spent on extra working,
                        and this mainly on the additional train mileage entailed by the growth of
                        the passenger and goods traffic. This brings our ratio of working down to
                        the satisfactory figure of 55.94 per cent against 62.12 last year. We trust
                        that the traffic will steadily increase, and enable us to put this figure
                        even somewhat lower; but on the other hand, we must remind you that as the
                        line grows older the charges for maintenance and renewal of permanent way
                        and rolling stock must increase. Well, gentlemen, when after meeting all
                        charges for Debenture interest, putting by the sum of £11,046 for the
                        sinking fund, and £2,834 for reserve, or a total ol £13,880, equivalent to
                        1.8 per cent on the Preference capital—although a considerable portion of
                        that capital was unproductive owing to delays in getting sanction for works,
                        in obtaining possession of land required, ant other causes–we found that we
                        had sufficient<cb n="2"/> to pay you a dividend of 5 per cent for the year
                        without any material reduction of the amount brought forward from last year,
                        to say nothing of having an appreciable reserve in hand, considering the
                        short time we have been working, we thought that with favorable prospects
                        for the current year before us we were fully justified in recommending for
                        your approval that dividend.</p>
                    <p>Since the report was issued we have heard that Government have given their
                        consent to the fusion of the Helouan Railway with that owned by the Delta
                        Company, which has now been taken over and worked by us. As pointed out in
                        the report, the concession for the Cairo Quarry lines has been completed,
                        and we have now started work on them. For the reasons given in the report we
                        have not during the year made as much progress as we could have wished with
                        our extensions, having only opened some 17 miles ; since September 30th 6
                        miles more have been opened. The concession of the Province of Menoufieh is
                        still delayed, pending the completion, presumably, of Government
                        formalities, although we have done what we could during the past year to
                        bring the matter to a close. We have also surveyed some 130 miles of line,
                        and carried out some improvements in the way of better stations, conversion
                        of flag stations into permanent stations, lengthening of sidings, and
                        such-like work necessitated by the growth of the traffic. Altogether we have
                        expended some £141,000, of which £47,611 has been spent on rolling stock, we
                        having put on the line twelve new 6-wheeled coupled engines which take
                        excellent loads, 25 new bogie coaching vehicles, 100 new bogie steel
                        platform wagons, and since the close of the year 25 new bogie coaching
                        vehicles and six more engines have been completed and are ready to go. With
                        the growing extension and increasing traffic we must keep the line well
                        supplied with stock, and more will be required immediately. Your board is
                        greatly indebted to the exertions and intelligent conduct of their affairs
                        by their staff in Egypt, to all of whom, and especially to their agent,
                        Captain Adams, RE., the acknowledgments of the company are largely due. I am
                        glad to be able to add that throughout the year we have continued to
                        maintain our customary excellent relations with the Egyptian Government
                        authorities. I may mention that the managing director and myself hope to be
                        able to visit Egypt again this winter, to discuss various important points
                        with the local board and the Government, and I trust our visits will
                        continue to be of the same use and advantage to the company as I venture to
                        believe has hitherto shown itself the case, both as regards the Government
                        and as enabling us personally to discuss with the local board, questions
                        which require discussion on the spot, and of which the disposal is
                        facilitated by such a direct exchange of views between your directors. With
                        your permission I propose to deal first with the ordinary business of the
                        meeting, and when that is disposed of to bring before you proposals for an
                        increase of capital. I will, therefore, now move :— “That the report of the
                        directors, dated November 30th, 1904, together with the statement of
                        accounts and balance-sheet for the year ended September 30th, 1904, be and
                        they are hereby approved, confirmed and adopted.” Before putting the
                        resolution to the vote I shall be very glad to answer any question that
                        shareholders may wish to put to me, or give any information in my power.</p>
                    <p>The Hon. Sir C. W. Fremantle seconded the resolution.</p>
                    <p>No questions bring asked, the resolution was put to the meeting and carried
                        unanimously.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman : Tho second resolution I have the honor to propose is : “That
                        the interim dividend paid in June, 1904, be confirmed, and that a dividend
                        at the rate of 6 per cent per annum for the half-year ended September 30th,
                        1904, on the Preference share capital of the company be and hereby is
                        declared to be paid to the share holders of the Preference shares standing
                        on the registers of the company at December 20th, 1904, and the holders of
                        Preference share warrants to bearer."</p>
                    <p>Lieutenant-Colonel R L. Marryat, R E (managing director), seconded the
                        resolution, and it was carried unanimously.</p>
                    <p>The Hon. Sir C. W. Fremantle moved, “That Sir Auckland Colvin, one of the
                        directors retiring in order of rotation, be re-elected"</p>
                    <p>This was seconded by Sir Francis L. O’Callaghan and carried unanimously.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman then moved the re-election of the Hon. Sir C. W. Fremantle, and,
                        this having been seconded by Mr. Robert Miller, was carried unanimously.</p>
                    <p>On the motion of the Chairman, seconded by Mr. Montagu Sharpe, Maurice
                        Cattaui Bey was also re-elected a director. </p>
                    <cb n="3"/>
                    <p>Mr. Alfred Wilkins moved the reappointment of Messrs. Frank Davies, Meredith
                        and Co as auditors.</p>
                    <p>Mr Benjamin Keable seconded the resolution, and it was carried
                        unanimously.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman : Gentlemen, I have now to bring before you our proposals for
                        the increase of capital, the resolutions concerning which you will have seen
                        on the back of the report. We are not in immediate want of cash, as we
                        probably have sufficient to carry us on for some months, but have come to
                        the end of our powers of issue, and we desire to be in a position to be able
                        to issue more capital as we require it, and to take advantage of a favorable
                        money market, for, as you must be aware, that market of late years has not
                        always been very favorable to fresh issues of capital. We therefore ask you
                        to create 39,460 new Preference shares, it being understood that we do not
                        propose to issue the whole of this amount at once, as this would form far
                        too heavy a strain on our current revenue, but only such amounts as we
                        require from time to time and can reasonably expect to earn interest on
                        without seriously affecting your dividends in any particular year. I will,
                        therefore, now move:— “That the capital of the company be increased by the
                        creation of 39,460 new Preference shares of the nominal amount of £10 each,
                        and that such Preference shares be issued and allotted by the board upon
                        such terms and conditions as they may determine, but such shares shall be
                        issued upon the terms (subject to the powers of the board under Article 166
                        to set aside sinking funds and otherwise) that the surplus profits in each
                        year after providing for a dividend on the amounts from time to time paid,
                        or credited as paid, otherwise than in advance on all Preference shares at
                        the rate of 5½ per cent for each year, shall be applied, first, in making up
                        the arrears of dividend on the Preference shares of the company previously
                        issued in respect of the period previous to the date of issue of the new
                        Preference shares hereby authorised, and when those arrears have been paid,
                        then in paying up the arrears (if any) which may subsequently accrue on all
                        Preference shares in the order in which such arrears may have accrued, and
                        thereafter the sum of 10s 9d per cent per annum on the said £394,600 of new
                        capital as part of the sinking fund heretofore authorised in respect of the
                        previous capital, so as to insure the repayment of the whole of the share
                        capital authorised up to the date hereof in its due order of priority under
                        the articles. Save as aforesaid, the said new Preference shares shall rank
                        in all respects with the existing Preference shares of the company." </p>
                    <p>Sir C. W. Fremantle seconded the resolution, and it was carried
                        unanimously.</p>
                    <p>A shareholder asked if the chairman had anything to say with regard to the
                        land company as it affected this company.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman : The land company is still in an early stage. I think all that
                        is to be said about it at present is that it is in the stage of inquiry and
                        initial proceedings, but as far as we can see at present things are going on
                        very favorably, and quite up to any expectations we could have.
                        (Applause).</p>
                    <p>A vote of thanks was passed to the chairman on the motion of Mr. J. H. Busby,
                        seconded by Mr. Wilkins, and the proceedings terminated.</p>

                        <p>We congratulate the Helouan Sporting Club on the success of the races
                            held on Saturday afternoon. Some of the causes which contributed to
                            their success—the weather, for example, and the air—could not, it is
                            true, be assigned to the activity of the committee, but in all that
                            concerned the arrangements on the course we noticed an enormous
                            improvement on last year. The pari-mutuel is now behind the grandstand,
                            which has been properly roofed and fitted up. The arrangements for
                            supplying tea were capital, and the races began and ended as punctually
                            as possible. There were many residents and visitors at the races ; we
                            noticed among them H.H. Prince Mohamed Ibrahim, General Lance, C.B.,
                            Coles Pasha, Ishak Bey Hussein, Mr. Astley Friend, Saleh Bey Yaghen, Mr.
                            Carter Wilson, Mr. Webb, Judge and Mrs. Satow, Capt. Herbert, Dr. and
                            Mrs. Nolan, Dr. Bentley, Mr. Monteith-Smith, Mr. Aspinall, Major
                            Davidson, Ibrahim Bey Cherif, Ahmed Bey Bakri Mr. Lockett, Ariz Pasha
                            Izzet, Mr. Michaelides, and many others.</p>
                        <p>The chief feature of the racing was the success of Moharrem Pasha
                            Chehin’s horses : two firsts, a second, and a third was a good record,
                            and in the Sahara Stakes Bibico’s win was a very easy affair, and Aeolus
                            was only caught in the last 100 yards by Kohelon Tair. The fourth race
                            was a long way the best of the day, and Mizzaud lasting very well beat
                            Shewiman, the favorite, by a little. In the fifth race Fil de Fer was a
                            rather unexpected winner. Roland’s effort in the third race was a little
                            too late ; a hundred and fifty yards more, and he would probably have
                            been third, it may be second.</p>

                            the course before the flag fell. When the horses at last were ready the
                            start was poor. Sayad II. and Togo led, but after the cutting Macdonald
                            came up, only to give way to Rainbow, who passed Togo but could get
                            nowhere near Sayad II., who won anyhow. Togo was third by 3/4 of a
                            length. Time 1.27.</p>
                        <p>Totalisator paid P.T. 126 on winner. Places, 33, 44.</p>

                        <p>Firefly, which, with Roland, was a warm favorite, led at the start but at
                            the cutting Bibico and Aeolus were ahead and simply riding away from the
                            rest, who followed 4 or 5 lengths behind in a bunch. In the straight
                            Sattam and Roland rushed up, and the former going very hard caught
                            Aeolus and was second by half a length, Bibico winning without any undue
                            exertion. Roland kept his effort till too late but was going very well
                            at the finish.</p>

                        <p>After a moderate start Showiman led but Mizzaud and Royalist challenged
                            him and at the first time round it was anyone’s race. Second time round
                            Mizzaud passed Royalist, all three horses still together but had to give
                            way to Shewimon, who looked like winning on emerging from the cutting.
                            Then came a splendid race all the way home. Mizzaud came gradually up,
                            got ahead in the straight and just got home by half a-length. Royalist
                            was a good third but his jockey used whip too early.</p>
                        <p>Totalisator paid P.T.94 on winner, P.T.61 for place.</p>
                        <p>This race was followed by what appeared to be a private and informal
                            sparring display between two well-known Egyptian owners of racing

                            the finish and was less than a length behind Aeolus. Time 1.57.
