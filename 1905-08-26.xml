                    <p>KATSURA AND 1TO CONFER.</p>

                    <p>London, August 25.</p>
                    <p>The “Morning Post” learns-from Portsmouth that confidenoe is expressed that
                        peace will be concluded. It is asserted that Russia is willing to pay
                        £50,000,000.</p>
                    <p>The “'rimes.'' learns from Washington that Americans regard Japan’s terms as
                        fair. If the Tsar decides to oohtinue the war Americans will consider him
                        responsible for the further loss of life. </p>
                    <p>The same newspaper in a leading article says that, like other successful
                        belligerents, Japan conceives that she is entitled to re- imburse herself
                        for the war, and that there is no cause why she should forego doing so.
                        Japan appeals with confidenoe to the judgment of tho world on her own
                        attitude, and on that of Russia throughout the negotiations. Wo know what
                        tho judgment of Great Britain will be. (Reuter) </p>
                    <p>Portsmouth (N.H.), August 25</p>
                    <p>The American Ambassador's audienoe with tho Tsar, although unsatisfactory,
                        has, how- ever, loft an open door. It appears that the principal objection
                        of the Tsar to the Japanese compromise was the insertion of the prioe for
                        the repurchase of Saghalien. - It is understood that President Roosevelt is
                        now endeavouring to secure the acceptance of his proposal.of tho •23rd inst.

                    <p>St. Petersburg, August 25.</p>
                    <p>The Tsar rejects the compromise as opening up again the question of
                        indemnity. (Havas)</p>

                    <p>UPWARD TENDENCY IN PRICES</p>

                    <p>The value of the best quality of agricultural bred in this country has
                        increased enoimocsly of’ate, more especially within the past two yean or so,
                        and in some oases it has risen ten- fold daring the last quarter of a
                        oentnry. The decision arrived at last March by the Govern- ment on the
                        recommendation of Sir William Gcretin, to postpone the raising of the
                        Assouan Dam for a period of three years, and to stop the Bale of land for
                        reclamation purposes to either public companies or private speonlaton, , has
                        had the effect of adding a farther stimulus . to the extraordinary
                        enhancement we speak of. Aooording to Poilay Bey, a high authority ' on the
                        subject ol land values, the value is , likely to still tend upwardsj and in
                        a very ^ interesting artiole that appears in this month's '-Bulletin de
                        l'Union Syndioaledes Agrioul- , tours d’Egypfo" he expresses his opinion
                        that those persons who express -jnuprise al the j present high level to
                        whioh prices have attained | and who think that they have now arrived | at
                        their maximum, must prepare themselves for fresh surprises. He bases his
                        opinion on the information he has gathered from differ ent sources, whioh
                        shows that the onltivatore are already preparing to invest the larger '
                        profits expected from this year’s ootton crop and the higher prioes ruling
                        for ootton, in j the pnrehase of land. From every side, adds i Poilay Bey,
                        one hears of fresh transactions at t prices hitherto unheard of. 8ome
                        persons are t inclined to think that this enhancement is duo i mainly to
                        speculation, bnt such is not the foot, as in most cases it is tho owners of
                        small i holdings that are the purchasers, and speoulv t tion does not' enter
                        into these transactions, j It is with the sole objeot of cultivation and i
                        adding to their property that the fellaheen c landowners boy whenever they
                        have aeon- t mnlatod a few hundreds of pounds. The t writor iu the
                        "Bulletin” cites two instanoes as [ illustrating the extraordinary and
                        constant upward tendenoy noticeable in land values I within even a rooent
                        date. An omdeh in the a Behera provinco last month offered to a I leading
                        land oompany £135 per feddan, I for a small estate of 80 feddans whioh this
                        a same company bought only three years ago I at £85 and refase now to part
                        with under ( £145 per feddan, and the probability is that ( the company will
                        get this price. Another I omdeh in the Garbieh Province has just pur J
                        chased a small lot at £85 per feddan, although n only part of the land has
                        been reclaimed and the rest is not under reclamation.</p>
                    <p>But, says Poilay Bey, the region where prioes have been pushed np to unheard
                        of figures is that bordering on the Behera pro- „ vinoe, dose to the lakes,
                        in those places „ where the land is still totally uncultivated, a nearly
                        approaohing, in foot, a marshy oondi- j) tion. The greater part of this
                        region, de- 0 privod of water for irrigation though it be a and never likely
                        to be ever of much value, £ is selling at prioes that one never dreant of. h
                        Purchasers in these parts are evidently dia- t oounting the fatnre,for they
                        are perfectly aware j that some years must elapse before -they can £ obtain
                        water in anfficient quantities to irri- gate thoir lands and before tho
                        draining t be comes normal, yet Ihese came people do j, not hesitate to pay
                        the fancy figures asked. A lot in this same locality, consisting of j, some
                        thousands of feddans, and oonceded to a Q former Minister of War at
                        two-piastres tariff £ a feddan was told by him at £3. Three a years ago the
                        purchaser sold tha property j at £15 and now the present holder is asking
                        £36 per feddan 1 He has been offered £80 for land on whioh not a piastre has
                        yet been spent nor a ootton plant has grown, and this it is not - an
                        exceptional case, for many instanoes can be given, in this same region,
                        where people ° seem to have lost their reasoning powers and ® dispute among
                        themselves tor the possession ^ of each parcel offered. We find even somo ^

                        and each lot, where b scarcely anything else now grows but the wild 8
                        tamarisk, has its prioe. Many yean must elapse before these lands can be of

                    <p>GERMAN APPRECIATION.</p>
                    <p>The ‘Koelnische Zeitang’ of the 1st inst. oontains an interesting
                        appreciation of the late Grand Mofti of Egypt The writer points 1 oat (hat
                        though Sheikh Mohamed rtbdon’s idealism and his oonstant efforts to restore
                        the 1 glory of Islam by combining western culture with the Moslem belief
                        caused suspicion and hostility among the nnenlightened, his personal
                        popularity was great among all classes. He notices the great importance of
                        the Grand Mufti’s position as a consultative authority on all qcestions of
                        religions law, and compares it to that of Papinian and ths great Roman
                        jurists of the Empire. We are glad to note the writer’s insistence on the
                        literary activity and ability of the late Sheikh, and his special praise
                        both of the “El Tawhid,” the admirable philosophio essay on the Unity of
                        God, and of the excellent commentaries on the Koran, which are admired by
                        all liberally minded feachers and theologians, and represent in literary
                        form the dootrinea of the oelebrated Said Jemal-el-Din el Afghani, Sheik
                        Mohamed Abdon’s former tutor. </p>
                    <p>“AT HOME" ON THE AIDA.</p>
                    <p>lady Blomfield gave a very saooessfnl and pleasant “at home” on the Aida
                        yesterday. The weather was again too rough to admit of the guests visiting
                        the dredgers which are at work on the New Pass, though the breeze in tbe
                        inner harbonr was very pleasantly felt Tbe Customs band played on tho
                        harbonr tug alongside the Aida with great spirit, and at about 7.80 p.m.
                        nearly one hundred of the young musicians came on board, and were regaled
                        with oake and sweets to their great delight. We need not add that'-an
                        excellent tea was provided, and that Admiral Sir Masrie and Iedy Blomfield
                        gave their guests a most Among those present we noticedH.E Fakhry Pasha,

                    <p>RELIGIOUS LEADER EXILED. </p>
                    <p>Abbas Effendi, the head of the Babist oom- mniiity, ,who has long been
                        resident at Akka near Haifa, has been oondomnod to exile. It appears that
                        the Babi Sheikh reoently decided in an evil hoar for himself to bnild a
                        palaoe on the slopes of Mount Carmel it unfortun- ately happened that
                        the'palaoe commanded the whole town of Haifa and the Kaimakam’s house.
                        Suspicion was aroused and representa- tions were made to Constantinople that
                        the Babist leader was building “a fortress” for the benefit of the Arabs or
                        the Egyptian11 Abb is Effendi has therefore been exiled though the Babis,
                        who are exiles from Persia, have boen for the past forty, year most excel-
                        lent citizens. Religious quietista, their oon.dbot his always been marked by
                        toleration and charity, and since their settlement at Akka, they have
                        abstained from all forms of politics! activity. The reputed wealth of the
                        sect is no doubt the cease of Abbas Effendi’s exile. </p>
                    <p>RICE MILLS AT ALEXANDRIA. </p>
                    <p>As we announced some time ago in oar columns the Alexandria and Rosetta Rice
                        Mills Co., which has been formed by several Alexandrian merchants and
                        financiers, will begin work in the near fatnra. The oompany has obtained a
                        site, where moat of its plant and buildings are already erected, near the
                        Mah- moudioh Canal between Karmouas and Mo- hrrem Bey .This distriot, whioh
                        already oontains oil mills, asphalt works, and many other mills and
                        factories, seems destined to beoome the industrial oentre of Alexandria. Its
                        position is certain to give a great impetus to canal traffic and inland
                        navigation.</p>
                    <p>As the rice crop in Egypt is exhausted by the beginning of April the oompany
                        will import Rangoon rioe in both the rough and tbe olean states. It is
                        anticipated thata large trade between Alexandria and the rest of the Levant
                        will ensue. </p>
                    <p>SAN STEFANO CASINO. The following is the programme of the vocal part of the
                        oonoert to be given to-morrow morn- ing. We note that the “Mattinata” by

                    <p>STEAMER MOVEMENTS.</p>
                    <p>The express Khedivial mail steamship Ismalia will leave Alexandria at 4 p.m.
                        on Wednesday for Pineua, Smyrna, Mitylene and Constantinople.</p>
                    <p>The Moss liner Seti arrived yesterday after- noon from Liverpool, via

                    <p>(From our Correspondent. )</p>
                    <p>Port Said, Thursday.</p>
                    <p>Dixon Bey, the director of the Lighthonse department here, and representive
                        of the War Offioe, is leaving by the P. and 0. steamer on Tuesday next for a
                        well-earned holiday.</p>
                    <p>THE MATARIEH CANAL.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Diacono, who is the director of tbe Anglo-Amerioan Nile Company at this
                        end, and is now staying at the Eastern Exchange, is very hard at work on the
                        dredging and pre- parations for the navigation of the new canal The work
                        appears to be progressing very favorably, aud hopes are expressed that at
                        least a portion of the traffio will be at work by the winter.</p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>THE AFFAIR BAIOCCHI. </p>
                    <p>The latest hews I have of this nnpleesant afiair is that Ali Effendi Sabit
                        has been sus- pended pending the tria1, which was to have been held on 15th
                        September, bat whioh has been ordered to take place at the ‘Tribanaux
                        Sommairee" in as short a time as possible, pro- bably in the oonne of -next
                        week.</p>
                    <p>Then is quite a furore here amongst the local press, they taking two
                        different aides, and each sticking firmly to its own opinions. The native
                        papers have in many cares stated as a fact that Mr. Baiooohi, was armed with
                        varions aggressive weapons when the Custom House renoontre took plaoe, bat I
                        sm-iu a position to emphatically deny this.</p>
                    <p>The whole basiqess is much to be regretted, giving rise" as ittioesto wild
                        talk in many of the papera, and Ali Effendi 8abit waa well known for his
                        civility and courtesy in his some- what trying position at the Customs.
                        Still on the other hand H.E. the Governor is to be oongratnlated on the
                        severe measures taken and impartial treatment meted ont to all
                        concerned.</p>
                    <p>STILL THEY COME.</p>
                    <p>There are no lets than three Tarkish trans- ports, withj an aggregate of
                        4,000 troops on board, in the harbour;-all of them leave to-day for the Red

                    <p>  •Times." The latent news of the
                        Peace Conference is again very gloomy. The indemnity question was discussed
                        yesterday morning ; and at the dose of the sitting no common ground had been
                        iound by the envoys on this vital issue. On two questions which are vital to
                        the success of the negotiations, and which were known to it before Russia
                        assented to Mr Roosevelt's invitation, M. Witte and his colle- agues loudly
                        proclaim that concession or compromise is inadmissible. When Baron Komnra,
                        in the written statement which he dolivered at tho beginning of tne
                        Conference, asked for the cession ofSaghalien and the reim- bursement to
                        Japan of her expenses in the war, the Russian envoys immediately stated that
                        no such proposals oould be entertained. These proposals have now come up in
                        numeri- cal order for disoossion, and they have repeat- ed their previous
                        non pouumut. From that position, which seems qaite fatal tq the prospects of
                        peace, they do not show tho slightoit disposition to recede. So long as that
                        is the '-^ye, concessions on other points are the merest “make see." They
                        only show that, il Russia could have her way in essentials, she would not be
                        indispoeed to gratify the Japa- nese on subjects of subordinate oonoern.
                        ••Telegraph.” Having conceded so much, as the heavy penalty of unsuccessful
                        war, M. Witte, it would seem, is inclined to take the ground that it is cow
                        Japan's turn to concede something. The point of the pro Rassians is that the
                        money value, actual and prospective, of the railway ought to be set against
                        the money indemnity which Japan is, demanding. Japan, they say, is, by tho
                        articles already agreed to, placed in possession of all for which she went
                        to war. To press for more is to press for blood- money,and this would be
                        repugnautto the moral sense of the civilised world. Bat the answer to, all
                        this tall talk is the simple, and from the loser's point of view the brutal,
                        truth that in war the vanquished pays. Mdroover, the moral sense of the
                        civilised world, so far from being outraged by Japan’s demand for an
                        indemnity, cordially endorses her claim to it as one that is thoroughly
                        justified. •‘Standard.” , > ^ We can hardly imagine that M. Witte is
                        personally capable of the fatal blander of sup- posing that the Japanese do
                        not mean what they say. The various items in their require- ments form an
                        organio whole, and, taken in the aggregate, they represent what any impar-
                        tial intelligence must pronounoe a singularly moderate scheme of settlement.
                        It is simply childish to pretend that, because on certain of tha conditions
                        they have been met with ao- qniescence, they would be justified, as a mark
                        of their gratitude, in renouncing the remaining claims, which are of grave
                        moment in them- selves and essential to the completeness of the arrangement

                        years before the next one assembles. For these reasons we would desire that
                        Japan should waive the claim whioh, in the present condition of the
                        oombatante, is without precedent And our desire in this case is backed up by
                        the wish and opinion of the united nations of Christendom. If Japan stands
                        out for an indemnity she will forfeit most of the sympathy and the financial
                        support which #be has enjoyed hitherto in this country and the United
                        States. “Globe." There can be no considerations of "mag- nanimity,” no
                        desire to save Russian "face.” Japan has placed her irreducible minimum on
                        paper, and we may be sure she will adhere to it. The one hope for peace is
                        that events at home may be too strong for M. Witte and his master, and that
                        at the last moment, as the last grain of sand is running out, the Russisn
                        Plenipotentiaries may throw down their cards. •“New York Sow." ENGLAND,

                        course, it that our foreign politics are not Europtan but Imperial—that the
                        doe to them must be sought in Africa, Asia, America-f-any- where but in
                        Europe. We are not really Euro- peaus. The physical faot of our "splendid
                        isolation" in the North Sea must always give us a certain aloofness from
                        European politics- The secret of cur uow love for Prance, for instance, is

                        iasnbstantially to the effect that Germany desires nothing but an amicable
                        arrangement with France, that she will shortly astonish the world by the
                        large and liberal spirit which she will display to- wards France, and that
                        any hitches in the negotiations whioh may arise at the present stage are
                        due, not to German duplicity, but to the delays whioh are iuterposod by the
                        uecessity of consulting the Sultan of Morocco. As for tbo loan—admitted to
