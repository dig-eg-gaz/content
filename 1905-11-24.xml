                        responded to <persName>Mr. Balfour's</persName> appeal. The “Times”

                    <p>Considerable interest has been caused in political circles by strong hints,
                        both in the "Times” and “Daily Telegraph," that Mr. Balfour should, in view
                        of <persName>Mr. Chamberlain's</persName> attitude, take an early
                        opportunity for resigning. The Liberals would then form a Government, and
                        Parliament would be dissol- ved alter a brief meeting.</p>
                    <p>A meeting of the Cabinet will be held to- morrow. Rumour anticipates that the
                        result will be the first step towards resignation, which today is the
                        absorbing topic. The Liberal newspapers declare that <persName>Sir Henry
                            Campbell-Bannerman</persName> will refuse to form a Cabinet under the
                        present circumstances, and will insist on dissolution. (Reuter)</p>

                    <p>La petition sinsi presentee no laisse pas d’etre gaie. Faut-il que les

                        la preference aux anglais pour le service dans ses administrations, il ne

                        charitable d’insister davantage sur l’inco- herence de la démarche des
                        pétitionnaires. D’ailleurs S. E. Saba pacha, cousulte a ce anjet, leur a
                        fait entendre qu’il approuverait pleinement la reduction a un penny de la
                        taxe postale, pour tous les pays.</p>
                    <p>These opinions are erroneous, for in virtue of the Washington Convention
                        Egypt can agree to accept lower postal rates, but is prohibited from
                        increasing these rates. Thus it would be quite feasible for Egypt to enter
                        into conven- tion on this subject with the British Govern- ment.</p>

                    <head type="sub">SEVERO TORELLI.</head>
                    <p>Severo Torelli is one of those dramas in which declamation and humanity alike
                        are extended to their limit. Fine and impassioned in its phrasing, and yet
                        at the due moment condescending to exactly expressed familiarity, it should
                        be a sure test, and crucial, for actors. The play presents tyrants, crime,
                        oaths, to break which is to break the chains of Heaven, all, in a word, that
                        we know of 15th-century Italy. As we have intimated, the verse has not that
                        marble, and statuesque rigidity which needs unduly phenomenal acting to
                        transform it from literature to life. We saw it on Wed- nesday night played
                        by a caste who are versed in all the essentials of the highest French drama.
                        A criticism is somewhat difficult. One has to admit that attention was
                        concentrated wholly on the four chief "stars.” The others never seemed to
                        break away from the school and tradition and rhythm. Mile Jeanne Delvair and
                        M. Lambert pere were undoubtedly the best for interpretation and nataral
                        effective "human” acting, but yet we cannot be sure that <persName>M. Lambert</persName> fils did
                        not reach the highest point of all, though he allowed himself at mo- ments
                        to be carried away by conventional and exaggerated trenzy, and indulged in
                        the vocal crescendos and the looks of horror which must mar the illusion he
                        so nearly maintained. But for the rest he had intonations, sadden changes of
                        manner, gestures that were reality itself, car trying all the conviction
                        that is in that really great drama; and we must admit again, that the other
                        parts could not give occasion for such variety and scope. Donna Pia is a
                        woman, and through Mile Delvair, a heroic woman, keeping, then announcing,
                        and at last greatly avenging her twenty years’ secret; but we need not
                        discuss it—all women are potentially what we call “actresses,” men have a
                        harder task, as their emotions are usually more, separate from their life.
                        For the rest, it was all of interest, well-staged, and with no
                        inconsistencies or faults, the play is certainly a play to read and to see
                        as it was given us on Wednesday. And what greater respect can we show to its
                        interpreters than by criticizing so far as we may, from a psychological
                        point of view, instead of giving the usual list of names with a sentence or
                        two tasked on to each.</p>
                    <p>We cannot but recommend all who care for French drama to profit by the
                        remaining per- formances of this company in Cario.</p>
