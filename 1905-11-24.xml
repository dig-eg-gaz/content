                        <p>Considerable interest has been caused in political circles by strong
                            hints, both in the "Times” and “Daily Telegraph," that Mr. Balfour
                            should, in view of <persName>Mr. Chamberlain's</persName> attitude, take
                            an early opportunity for resigning. The Liberals would then form a
                            Government, and Parliament would be dissol- ved alter a brief
                            meeting.</p>
                        <p>A meeting of the Cabinet will be held to- morrow. Rumour anticipates that
                            the result will be the first step towards resignation, which today is
                            the absorbing topic. The Liberal newspapers declare that <persName>Sir
                                Henry Campbell-Bannerman</persName> will refuse to form a Cabinet
                            under the present circumstances, and will insist on dissolution.

                    <head type="sub">A MISAPPREHENSION.</head>
                    <p>Some misunderstanding appears to have arisen as to tho recent petition in
                        favor of placing Egypt on the same footing as the component parts of the
                        British Empire in respect to penny postage. For example, a Cairo French
                        contemporary commented on the petition in the following terms: - </p>
                    <p>La petition sinsi presentee no laisse pas d’etre gaie. Faut-il que les
                        signataires aient onblie que les postes sont soumises a une convention
                        internationale, et que s’il appar- tient au gouvernement égyptien de donner
                        la preference aux anglais pour le service dans ses administrations, il ne
                        peut favoriser l'Angle- terre d’nne taxe postale speciale.</p>
                    <p>Qu’on demande la reduction pour tous les pays, cela n’aurait rien que de
                        louable, et tout le monde applaudirait au project. Mais il serait peu
                        charitable d’insister davantage sur l’inco- herence de la démarche des
                        pétitionnaires. D’ailleurs S. E. Saba pacha, cousulte a ce anjet, leur a
                        fait entendre qu’il approuverait pleinement la reduction a un penny de la
                        taxe postale, pour tous les pays.</p>
                    <p>These opinions are erroneous, for in virtue of the Washington Convention
                        Egypt can agree to accept lower postal rates, but is prohibited from
                        increasing these rates. Thus it would be quite feasible for Egypt to enter
                        into conven- tion on this subject with the British Govern- ment.</p>

                    <p>On the 1st proximo the decree concerning the measures to be adopted in Cairo
                        in the case of rabies will come into force.</p>
                    <p>Kennels for 50 dogs have now been estab- lished at the infirmary of the
                        Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Boulac. All stray dogs of
                        every description will be arrested by the police and taken to these
                        kennels.</p>
                    <p>There is no registration for dogs, nor do the authorities supply medals
                        (metal plaques) for same, but proprietors should see that they wear a collar
                        or medal, bearing their name and address.</p>
                    <p>A dog found by the police will be kept a period of seven days pending claim.
                        After the seventh day, it will be disposed of if unclaimed.</p>
                    <p>In the event of a dog being lost; the pro- prietor can visit the kennels, and
                        should the dog be there, application should be made to the Traffic Office,
                        Gonvernorat, for same to be handed over after payment for keep.</p>
                    <p>ShouId a case of rabies or suspected rabies occur in any locality, an arrete
                        will at once be published, allowing three days from date of publication for
                        all dogs to be muzzled or led on leash, or both. Owners of dogs are there-
                        fore, advised to procure muzzles and leashes in case of accident.</p>

                    <p>At the meeting held last night of auto- mobile owners at the Mohamed Aly
                        Club, it was decided to form an Automobile Club, which is to be amalgamated
                        with the Auto- mobile Club d'Egypte. The following com- mittee was
                        elected:—H.H. Prince Aziz (pre- sident), M. George Zervadachi, Baron Alfred
                        de Meuasce, M. Constantin Choremi, M. M. C. Salvago, M. H. Fenderl, and Mr.

                    <head type="sub">SEVERO TORELLI.</head>
                    <p>Severo Torelli is one of those dramas in which declamation and humanity alike
                        are extended to their limit. Fine and impassioned in its phrasing, and yet
                        at the due moment condescending to exactly expressed familiarity, it should
                        be a sure test, and crucial, for actors. The play presents tyrants, crime,
                        oaths, to break which is to break the chains of Heaven, all, in a word, that
                        we know of 15th-century Italy. As we have intimated, the verse has not that
                        marble, and statuesque rigidity which needs unduly phenomenal acting to
                        transform it from literature to life. We saw it on Wednesday night played
                        by a caste who are versed in all the essentials of the highest French drama.
                        A criticism is somewhat difficult. One has to admit that attention was
                        concentrated wholly on the four chief "stars.” The others never seemed to
                        break away from the school and tradition and rhythm. Mile Jeanne Delvair and
                        M. Lambert pere were undoubtedly the best for interpretation and nataral
                        effective "human” acting, but yet we cannot be sure that <persName>M.
                            Lambert</persName> fils did not reach the highest point of all, though
                        he allowed himself at mo- ments to be carried away by conventional and
                        exaggerated trenzy, and indulged in the vocal crescendos and the looks of
                        horror which must mar the illusion he so nearly maintained. But for the rest
                        he had intonations, sadden changes of manner, gestures that were reality
                        itself, car trying all the conviction that is in that really great drama;
                        and we must admit again, that the other parts could not give occasion for
                        such variety and scope. Donna Pia is a woman, and through Mile Delvair, a
                        heroic woman, keeping, then announcing, and at last greatly avenging her
                        twenty years’ secret; but we need not discuss it—all women are potentially
                        what we call “actresses,” men have a harder task, as their emotions are
                        usually more, separate from their life. For the rest, it was all of
                        interest, well-staged, and with no inconsistencies or faults, the play is
                        certainly a play to read and to see as it was given us on Wednesday. And
                        what greater respect can we show to its interpreters than by criticizing so
                        far as we may, from a psychological point of view, instead of giving the
                        usual list of names with a sentence or two tasked on to each.</p>
                    <p>We cannot but recommend all who care for French drama to profit by the
                        remaining per- formances of this company in Cario.</p>
