                            <p>Considerable interest has been caused in political circles by strong
                                hints, both in the "Times" and "Daily Telegraph," that Mr. Balfour
                                should, in view of <persName>Mr. Chamberlain's</persName> attitude,
                                take an early opportunity for resigning. The Liberals would then
                                form a Government, and Parliament would be dissol- ved alter a brief
                                meeting.</p>
                            <p>A meeting of the Cabinet will be held to- morrow. Rumour anticipates
                                that the result will be the first step towards resignation, which
                                today is the absorbing topic. The Liberal newspapers declare that
                                    <persName>Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman</persName> will refuse to
                                form a Cabinet under the present circumstances, and will insist on
                                dissolution. (Reuter)</p>

                    <head type="sub">A MISAPPREHENSION.</head>
                    <p>Some misunderstanding appears to have arisen as to tho recent petition in
                        favor of placing Egypt on the same footing as the component parts of the
                        British Empire in respect to penny postage. For example, a Cairo French
                        contemporary commented on the petition in the following terms: - </p>
                    <p>La petition sinsi presentee no laisse pas d'etre gaie. Faut-il que les
                        signataires aient onblie que les postes sont soumises a une convention
                        internationale, et que s'il appar- tient au gouvernement égyptien de donner
                        la preference aux anglais pour le service dans ses administrations, il ne
                        peut favoriser l'Angle- terre d'nne taxe postale speciale.</p>
                    <p>Qu'on demande la reduction pour tous les pays, cela n'aurait rien que de
                        louable, et tout le monde applaudirait au project. Mais il serait peu
                        charitable d'insister davantage sur l'inco- herence de la démarche des
                        pétitionnaires. D'ailleurs S. E. Saba pacha, cousulte a ce anjet, leur a
                        fait entendre qu'il approuverait pleinement la reduction a un penny de la
                        taxe postale, pour tous les pays.</p>
                    <p>These opinions are erroneous, for in virtue of the Washington Convention
                        Egypt can agree to accept lower postal rates, but is prohibited from
                        increasing these rates. Thus it would be quite feasible for Egypt to enter
                        into conven- tion on this subject with the British Govern- ment.</p>

                    <head type="sub">SEVERO TORELLI.</head>
                    <p>Severo Torelli is one of those dramas in which declamation and humanity alike
                        are extended to their limit. Fine and impassioned in its phrasing, and yet
                        at the due moment condescending to exactly expressed familiarity, it should
                        be a sure test, and crucial, for actors. The play presents tyrants, crime,
                        oaths, to break which is to break the chains of Heaven, all, in a word, that
                        we know of 15th-century Italy. As we have intimated, the verse has not that
                        marble, and statuesque rigidity which needs unduly phenomenal acting to
                        transform it from literature to life. We saw it on Wednesday night played by
                        a caste who are versed in all the essentials of the highest French drama. A
                        criticism is somewhat difficult. One has to admit that attention was
                        concentrated wholly on the four chief "stars." The others never seemed to
                        break away from the school and tradition and rhythm. Mile Jeanne Delvair and
                        M. Lambert pere were undoubtedly the best for interpretation and nataral
                        effective "human" acting, but yet we cannot be sure that <persName>M.
                            Lambert</persName> fils did not reach the highest point of all, though
                        he allowed himself at moments to be carried away by conventional and
                        exaggerated trenzy, and indulged in the vocal crescendos and the looks of
                        horror which must mar the illusion he so nearly maintained. But for the rest
                        he had intonations, sadden changes of manner, gestures that were reality
                        itself, car trying all the conviction that is in that really great drama;
                        and we must admit again, that the other parts could not give occasion for
                        such variety and scope. Donna Pia is a woman, and through Mile Delvair, a
                        heroic woman, keeping, then announcing, and at last greatly avenging her
                        twenty years' secret; but we need not discuss it—all women are potentially
                        what we call "actresses," men have a harder task, as their emotions are
                        usually more, separate from their life. For the rest, it was all of
                        interest, well-staged, and with no inconsistencies or faults, the play is
                        certainly a play to read and to see as it was given us on Wednesday. And
                        what greater respect can we show to its interpreters than by criticizing so
                        far as we may, from a psychological point of view, instead of giving the
                        usual list of names with a sentence or two tasked on to each.</p>
                    <p>We cannot but recommend all who care for French drama to profit by the
                        remaining performances of this company in Cario.</p>

                        de charges sociales à rémunérer, un fonds de roulement limité, des frais
                        d'adminis tration très réduits et pourraient ainsi obteni un résultat
                        industriel réel et suffisant.</p>
                    <p>"Dans ces conditions, lea Voies Ex-Daïra seraient divisées en zones comme
                        d'ailleurs la New-Daïra l'avait prévu lorsqu'elle avait en- visagé la vente
                        partielle des Usines, en laissant un passage libre sur une des lignes
                        principales pour le besoin de toutes les sucreries.</p>
                    <p>"Messieurs les Contrôleurs paraissent ac- capter avec une réelle insouciance
                        la vente dès réreaux des voies agricoles Ex Daira, plus pré- occupés en leur
                        qualité de financiers de rés- liser des fonds que d'assurer l'avenir de
                        l'ex- ploitation qu'ils se proposent de reconstituer. Nous estimons que
                        cette aliénation quelles que soient les réserves faites et les garanties
                        doa- nées par l'acquéreur qui, dans l'espèce ne serait autre que le
                        Gonvernement, serait préjudiciable ADX. Usines desservies et à la Société.
                        Les rai- sons en sont nombreuses et la pratique dé montrerait vite que
                        l'approvisionnement ré gulier, déjà si difficile dans les conditions
                        actuelles, deviendrait impossible dans l'avenir.</p>
                    <p>"Dans tous les cas, ce n'est pas à une administration agonisante, encore
                        moins à une administration provisoire et incertaine, d'a- liéner une des
                        parties les plus essentielles de Bon exploitation et dont elle n'a pas su et
                        ne peut pas savoir tout le parti que l'on peut tirer.</p>
                    <p>"Cette vente n'est pas indispensable pour trouver les 350 à 400 mille Livres
                        Sterling qu'elle pourrait donner; nous estimons qu'il serait plus rationnel
                        de vendre immédiatement les Usines arrêtées de Dabayeh, Minieh et Magagah;
                        les bateaux de plaisance; l'im- meable du Siège Social dont on pourrait
                        retirer en ce moment, à cause de la hausse des terrains, L.E. 25,000 à
                        30,000; tout le maté riel des magasins et des parcs en ne conservant que le
                        strict nécessaire pour une période de cinq années et, s'il le tallait,
                        l'Usine de Bibeh avec son réseau de voies jusqu'à Magagah.</p>
                    <p>"Nous notons que les Contrôleurs considè- rent toute la dette de la Sagar
                        Corporation comme privilégiée. Pour nous, nous considé- rons comme
                        privilégiées les £944.000, valeur d'achat des Usines et Voies Ex-Daira.</p>
                    <p>"Mais quant aux £315.000 prêtées pour fonds de roulement c'est aux tribunaux
                        de décider si cette somme est privilégiée au même titre que les £
                        944.000.</p>
                    <p>"MM. les Contrôleurs se préoccupent sur- tout d'assurer le paiement de la
                        charge fixe obligatoire qui serait de LE. 40.000 pendant les cinq premières
                        années et de £ 43.840 lors- que l'amortissement commencera, prévoient que
                        les diverses économies à réaliser seraient suffisantes: mais il y a aussi
                        les porteurs. d'actions privilégiées et les porteurs d'actions ordinaires
                        qui ont également le droit de toucher des intérêts ou des dividendes comme
                        on lear fait espérer : il faudrait donc que les bénéfices fassent tels
                        qu'ils puissent assurer le paiement des charges sociales suivantes : Charges
                        obligatoires</p>
                    <p>5% aux Actions privilégiées 5% aux Actions ordinaires</p>

                    <p>"1</p>
                    <p>"MM. les Contrôleurs auraient pu ajouter à leurs propositions une étude
                        montrant com. ment et au moyen de quelles économies l'affaire, remise sur
                        pied, pourrait permettre de rétribuer toutes ces charges sociales, solder
                        les frais d'administration qui ne sauraient être négligés, amortir les
                        usines, et aussi payer les transfor- mations nouvelles à faire ou à
                        compléter.</p>
                    <p>Nous estimons que l'industrie améliorée, à condition d'avoir la canne
                        nécessaire et dans de meilleures conditions, pourrait donner des résultats
                        meilleurs que par le passé, mais jamais de bénéfices suffisants pour
                        supporter de pareilles charges, et nous craignons qu'après les deux années
                        d'essai proposées une liquida tion ne s'impose, liquidation qui serait plus
                        désastreuse qu'aujourd'hui, car les créanciers actuele qui auraient déjà
                        consenti à une ré- daction de 20 0/0 sur leurs créances se trou versient
                        alors exposés à voir le passif ang menté, l'actif diminué et une créance
                        privi légiée absorber la meilleure et la plus grande partie de cet
                        actif.</p>
                    <p>"Quant au bilan que MM. les Contrôleurs ont annexé à leur rapport il nous
                        semble que le système employé par eax de porter à l'actif les Usines pour
                        leur prix d'achat ou celui ré- sultant des écritures sans en faire une
                        estima tion nouvelle plus approximative n'est pas exact. De ce fait, résulte
                        pour la grande part, la différence existant entre le déficit présenté par
                        leur bilan soit Livres 1.377 306 et celui de notre, £ 2.682.550, soit le
                        double à peu prè "Nos critiques montrent assez clairement que les
                        propositions de MM. les Contrôleur n'ont pas été étudiées avec précision et
                        que lear essai de deux années ne saurait êt concluant.</p>
                    <p>"A notre avis le manque d'avenir de cette Société réside dans le fait qu'elle
                        n'a pas acheté les terrains que la New Daira Sanieh avait réservé pour les
                        usines et qu'elle l'engageait fortement à prendre."</p>
                    <p>The reading over, Me. Carton de Wiart ra marked that the experts, who were
                        the manda- tories of the law like the controllers, had criticised the latter
                        in their absence with considerable violence, Judge Tuck disagreed; the
                        experts were mandatories, the controllers were not, in his opinion. Another
                        discos ion followed and Judge Tack again proved inex orable. At 4.30 all was
                        over; Me. Carton de Wiart stated that the final proposals would be submitted
                        to the shareholders on Saturday next (to-morrow), and it was finally decided
                        that the creditors' final meeting should come off at 3 p.m. on Friday,
