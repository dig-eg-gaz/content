                            only requires the addition of water to make it ready for use. It is
                            quickly and easily applied with a whitewash brush, with half the labour
                            and at one third the cost of paint. HALL’S DISTEMPER ensures
                            cleanliness, and is pleasing to the eye. It appeals alike to artistic

                        <p>HALL’S DISTEMPER is of special value in hot climates. Owing to its cool,

                            properties, it lends itself to every kind of wall, wood, brick or stone

                            disinfectant at one third the cost of oil paint. It never blisters in
                            the hottest sun, and the fact that it can be washed adds greatly to its
                            sanitary advantages.</p>

                    <head>TRADE OF EGYPT.</head>
                    <head type="sub">IMPORTS DURING MAY.</head>
                    <p>TW Customs returns for May, 1905 (says the “Journal” of the British Chamber
                        of Commerce), show that the total value of the imports into this country
                        during the month amounted to L.E. 1,533,679, which gives an increase of L.E.
                        81,730, or 5.3 %, compared with the corresponding month of last year. Of
                        this gross increase Great Britain, unfortunately, has no share, her figures
                        for the same period being practically identical, though the balance of L.E.
                        839 is on the wrong side. </p>
                    <p>The principal contributor to the month’s total increase is flour, which is up
                        by L.E. 49,700. Out of a value of LE. 91,529 England only supplied L.E.
                        5,200 ,but, nevertheless, although our trade in this article is still very
                        small, we are pleased to record an increase of L.E. 4,459 over May 1904 and
                        of L.E. 2,889 compared with last April. There is, however, still room for
                        expansion, especially when we remember that about four years ago Great
                        Britain was responsible for some 12 % of the total flour imports. </p>
                    <p>Cotton fabrics have advanced by L.E. 12,177, though there is a loss of L.E.
                        8,367 if compared with the previous month. The figures under this heading
                        for the first five months of 1905 show an increase of LE. 209,045 over the
                        corresponding period of 1904, though 6 % of such gain is accounted for by
                        the augmentation—as from the 1st December last—of the Customs tariff for
                        estimating the value of the goods. A further reason for this large increase
                        is that merchants during the autumn refrained from buying in the hope of
                        lower prices. They were, however, forced to purchase in February as
                        manufacturers at that time were being booked up for months ahead by other
                        countries. Apart from all this, however, the bulk of the total gain is due
                        to the great development of the country, and the consequent increased
                        spending power of the people. </p>
                    <p>The imports of oxen and furniture are respectively L.E. 9,046 and 8,785
                        higher than in May 1904. For obvious reasons the latter item should still
                        further increase, and we only hope British manufacturers will make an effort
                        to obtain a satisfactory share of the additional trade. </p>
                    <p>Coal is L.E. 5,753 to the good, though since the commencement of the year the
                        figures show the enormous loss of L.E. 123,067. The main cause of this
                        decrease lies in the fact that during last October, November, and December
                        very large shipments were made with the inevitable result that sufficient
                        accommodation could not be found, and supplies had to be stopped. About
                        March the coal stocks began to move, and shipments recommenced. </p>
                    <p>The chief decreases between May 190e-4 are those of L.E. 18,360 under
                        petroleum, LE. 11,676 in raw silk and thread, and LE. 13,173 under the
                        heading “Brass, copper, and bronze goods.” In the latter case, the 1905
                        figures are lessened by all imports of brass bedsteads which are now
                        included in the return for “Iron and ironwork.” </p>
                    <p>Jewellery, of which England’s contribution to the total supply was
                        nil—against L. E. 7,721 in 1904,—is less by L. E. 7,202, another decrease
                        being noted under wood, which is lower by L. E. 9,140. </p>
                    <p>As regards England’s imports during the two months in question the main
                        variations were an increase of L E. 11,801 in cotton fabrics, and a loss of
                        LE. 14,714 under “Brass, copper, and bronze goods”. </p>
                    <p>The home country’s figures for iron and ironwork show an increase of L E.
                        6,392, which, however, is counterbalanced by a decrease of L. E. 7,721 in
                        jewellery.</p>
                    <p>An additional L.E. 8,751 gained in furniture —obtained largely through the
                        requirements of the Sudan—was nullified by a loss of L E. 9,292 under the
                        heading of “Other Machinery”. </p>
                    <p>Coal imports from England are higher by LE. 5,471, but cereals (excluding
                        wheat and maize) are down by LE. 3,711. </p>
                    <p>Although the total returns from all countries compare favorably with May
                        1904, they do not show up well when placed alongside those for April 1905,
                        there being a net decrease of L.E. 69,280, or 4.3 % between the two months.
                        The most unsatisfactory feature, however, of the case is the fact that the
                        whole of this decrease is borne by Great Britain, which, in addition,
                        suffers by the gain of L.E. 1,501 credited to the rest of the world. Her
                        total shrinkage is thus one of LE. 70,781, which is largely accounted for by
                        losses of L.E. 21,684 in coal, L.E. 16,577 in machinery, L.E. 9,219 in
                        instruments, LE. 7,739 in woollen fabrics and L.E. 6,053 under the
                        classification of “Other Textiles.” </p>

                    <p>The leader of the rising in the Yemen has issued a manifesto whioh opens as
                        follows :—</p>
                    <p>"To all the followers and adherents devoted to the Book of God (Koran) the
                        laws of His messenger and His pure family, who are the security of the
                        people of the land from every calamity, the Ark of Salvation, the
                        interpreters of the Book, and the comrades inseparable till the Day of Doom
                        : whenever a star setteth there ariseth another star, a guiding light of the
                        fountain-head of religion. And we are through God in a protection unshaken
                        by fears and a manifest proof unconcealed by futile words. And the reason
                        for this general proclamation is what God has made oar duty, namely, to
                        remind and to exhort when the sight has become blinded and the first
                        symptoms of humiliation, degradation, and despair have happened among the
                        Arabs. Know that God tries His servants to discriminate between the true and
                        false. As the Koran says : ‘Verily We shall assuredly try you so that We may
                        know the strivers and the patient amongst you.’ ”</p>
                    <p>The manifesto then declares that the Arabs have been tried by the incursion
                        of the Turks, whom it describes as foreigners and accuses of various

                        provisions and doing harm to their Mussulman brethren : and the Arabs have
                        despaired of fighting them and chastising them although they are among the
                        Arabs like a drop : nor do the Arabs seize the opportunity of being allowed
                        to bear arms which will be soon taken away from them if their negligence
                        continues, and their children will be carried off as hostages in the regular
                        army if the delay is prolonged. . . . What is the matter with you, ye
                        semblances and shadows of men, that you do not defend your spiritual and
                        temporal rights, your arms, and your children, and drive them from land to
                        land, from vale to vale, till you annihilate them like the tribe of Ad, as
                        did your noble ancestors of old? And the hearts of the Arabs in most parts
                        of Yemen have become emboldened, and God is with you and after Him, we are
                        in your succour, and soon shall we write to the Sheikh Nasir-al-Din Ali Bin
                        Magdad (may God protect him) to cast his eye towards you if you be of the

                        the case. Again, if the High Court requires further evidence before

                        Code, it may either summon the parties to appear before it, or commission
                        for the purpose the Court in whose jurisdiction they reside, while if the
                        High Court annuls a judgment on account of the incompetence of the Court
                        which gave it, it may order the re-hearing of the case by the competent

                    <head> THE SUDAN RAILWAY. ITS IMPORTANCE TO ENGLAND.</head>
                    <p>The Correspondent of the “Journal des Débats,” writing from Djibouti, draws
                        attention to the important results likely to follow the completion of the
                        Sudan Railway, the two sections of which, he says, starting respectively
                        from the Red Sea and the Nile, will certainly be finished in the early part
                        of next year. </p>
                    <p>Independently of the impetus England will be in a position to give to
                        commerce and industry in the Sudan, she will possess means of communication
                        which will greatly increase her military power in Egypt. Thanks to her naval
                        preponderance in the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean, she will be able to bring
                        native troops from India to Suakin and convey them thence by the Sudan
                        Railway to the shores of the Mediterranean. </p>
                    <p>The reorganisation of the Indian Army, to which Viscount Kitchener’s powers
                        are now devoted, leads to the belief that the troops at present prepared and
                        held in reserve in the Indian Peninsula represent an imposing force, which
                        the British Government will always hold in readiness to establish its
                        supremacy in the Eastern Mediterranean. </p>

                    <p>Yesterday, the troops of the 7th Battalion Egyptian Army paraded at-Ras el
                        Tin, on the occasion of the retirement of their commanding officer, Miralai
                        Moursi Bey Fehmy (who has attained the age limit) and the handing over of
                        the command of the 7th to Kaimakam Hassan Bey Helmi. After the troops had
                        been reviewed by their old and new commandants, the officer in charge of the
                        colour went through the ceremony of handing it to the Miralai Moursi Bey
                        Fehmy, who in turn gave it to the new commandant. The retiring officer then
                        gave a short address to the soldiers, wishing them success, and insisting on
                        the importance of discipline and good conduct. </p>
                    <p>The troops were obviously moved by the ceremony and by their colonel’s words,
                        some of the men shedding tears, for the late commandant of the battalion was
                        decidedly popular among his men. A large and orderly crowd witnessed the
                        ceremony. </p>

                    <p>This morning, on the occasion of the French national fête, a reception was
                        held at the French Consulate by M. Vice-Consul Campana. Most of the

                        well as a large number of the Frenoh clergy. A speech appropriate to the
                        occasion was delivered by M. Barbazza, Député de la Nation. He asked M.
                        Campana, at whose return to Alexandria he expressed his satisfaction, to
                        transmit to the President of the Republic, in the name of the Frenoh colony,
                        their due sense of thankfulness at the preservation of his life on the
                        occasion of the attempt to assassinate the King of Spain during his visit to

                        in felicitous terms, promising to convey the French colony's message to M.
                        Loubet. </p>

                    <p>The “Journal” of the British Chamber of Commerce for July contains some
                        interesting features which deserve mention. We are glad to see that original
                        articles are now appearing, the first place in this month’s number being
                        held by a most readable contribution, which we attribute to the new
                        secretary of the Chamber, entitled “Points for Manufacturers,” which sums up
                        the causes that prevent British manufacturers and traders from deriving as
                        much benefit as they might from the increased prosperity of Egypt. The
                        article deals with legal questions that affect commerce with foreign
                        countries, with the selection of agents, and the need for commercial
                        travellers, and though the writer seems to assign too much importance to
                        public opinion in Egypt, after all, an article with nothing in it to
                        criticise might be unreadable from its very orthodoxy. The articles on the
                        month's imports have commenced, and we are glad to see that the statistics
                        referring to the Customs returns have been amplified and now show Great
                        Britain’s position compared with the previous year’s figures during the
                        current year. The stock and share lists have also been entirely revised and
                        brought up to date. Altogether the number is very interesting and deserves
                        to be read carefully, </p>

                    <p>Cotons.—La tenue a continué à être bonne, surtout pour la vieille récolte et
                        ce n'est qu'à cause de Liverpool, qui est venu faible en avant-bourse que
                        nous avons eu une légere réaction en clôture. Le marché a été très actif
                        pendant toute la matinée.</p>

                        pour la vieille récolte, mais comme affaires le marché a laissé à
                        désirer.</p>
