                    <head>AFTER DENISHWAI.</head>
                    <p>The Court has given its decision, and four of the leaders of the savage mob
                        which committed a brutal and unprovoked attack on British officers will
                        within the next few hours have expiated their crime with their lives.
                        Various terms of imprisonment have been inflicted on the other criminals,
                        and there is every reason to believe that their punishment is thoroughly
                        deserved. Their crime was atrociously brutal and cowardly. Helpless men were
                        beaten, insulted, rob, beat, and threatened with death or torture. Their
                        assailants made it perfectly clear by their conduct that they were actuated,
                        not by a mistaken impression that the victims of their violence had set a
                        "girn" on fire, but by the determination to kill and maltreat any person
                        whom they found shooting pigeons near their village. The pigeons were wild,
                        and could not be said to be the property of any individual, but such
                        arguments were unlikely to appeal to a savage mob of criminal villagers.</p>
                    <p>We must at the same time, point out in common fairness to the Egyptians that
                        the people of <placeName>Denishwai</placeName> are by no means typical of
                        the population of the <placeName>Delta</placeName>. Europeans new to the
                        country must not allow themselves to be prejudiced against the fellah by the
                        misconduct of an exceptionally criminal village. We readily admit that the
                        great majority of Egyptian peasants are sober, peaceful, and industrious
                        cultivators, and we hope that the misconduct of a village or a district will
                        not injure the reputation of the whole community in the minds of those who
                        have been horrified by the outbreak of savagery which cost the British Army
                        one of its most promising officers.</p>
                    <p>Finally, we should like to express our admiration of the conduct of the
                        British officers, which was worthy of the best traditions of the Army.
                            <persName>Major Pine-Coffin</persName>, who was in command of the party,
                        did all that was in his power to quiet the villagers, and in his desire to
                        prevent a conflict deprived himself and his companions of the means of
                        reesistance to an attack which he had hoped to avert. <persName>Capt.
                            Bostock</persName>'s promptitude in warning the camp also deserves
                        mention, and the natives of the whole district have testified to the
                        discipline and forbearance of the Mounted Infantry under great provocation.
                        We have lost a gallant and distinguised officer, but the self-restraint and
                        forbearance shown on this tragic occasion adds to the honour of the British
                        Army.</p>

                    <head>THE CONGO QUESTION</head>
                    <p>The official correspondence concerning the affairs of the Congo Free State
                        seems to show that <persName>Sir Edward Grey</persName>is thorough in his
                        determination that the Free State Government shall not be permitted to snap
                        the fingers of irresponsibility at the opinion of all right-minded men as to
                        its discharge of the functions entrusted to it by
                            <persName>Europe</persName>. The correspondence ends before the date of
                        the open letter of <persName>King Leopold</persName>, with the amazing
                        assertion of his own "indivisible rights"; but the fact of the subsequent
                        publication of the challenge to public opinion renders <persName>Sir Edward
                            Grey</persName>'s dispatches all the more important as an indication of
                        the intentions of the British Government. The Foreign Secretary is struck by
                        the inadequate nature of the reforms recommended by the Commission of
                        Inquiry, which are far from realising that "large measure of reform" which
                        he postulates as indispensable. We observe, too, that the scheme of the
                        Belgian Reform Commissioners is severely criticised by <persName>N.
                            Cattier</persName>, the Belgian Professor of Colonial Jurisprudence.
                        Altogether, it would be well for <persName>King Leopold</persName> and his
                        agents to be wise in time, or they may find that his "indivisible rights"
                        are susceptible of impartial consideration by the signatory Powers of the
                        Berlin Act.</p>

                    <p>On Monday morning, <persName>Mr. H. Otway Smithers</persName> (of the
                        Bedfordshire Regiment), who has been wintering in
                            <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, recovering from the effects of enteric
                        contracted in the South African campaign, was proceeding from Church road,
                        Bulkeley, towards <placeName>Stanley Bay</placeName>, when his attention was
                        attracted by the screams of a lady and two children sitting helplessly in a
                        hired carriage and being conveyed down Mr. Ruffer’s Hill by a pair of horses
                        entirely without control, for there was no driver on the box. <persName>Mr.
                            Smithers</persName> ran after the runaways and, scrambling into the
                        carriage, reached the driver’s vacant box and managed to catch hold of the
                        reins. It was not before the bottom of the hill was reached that
                            <persName>Mr. Smithers</persName> was able to stop the horses. He then
                        drove back to Church road corner and found the - "arbaghi”—an abject
                        helpless creature,— waiting, stricken with terror at what might have
                        happened. <persName>Mr. Smithers</persName> rated him sound-ly in good

                    <p>To the Editor of the "Egyptian Gazette"</p>
                    <p>Sir,—We, the candidates of the Primary Education Certificate, have the honour
                        to ask you to join our cry to the Ministry of Public instruction for
                        ordering the party, which is concerned in putting the marks of the
                        examination papers of the dictation, to take notice of the many errors in
                        the dictation given to us.</p>
                    <p>These errors, however, were erroneously written not because of their
                        difficulty, but because of our mishearing these words from the dictators
                        who, on the other hand, had eaten up many letters and syllables.</p>
                    <p>Besides, their mode of dictating was quite different from that which we were
                        accustomed to by our Egyptian teachers who taught us that language; and that
                        was due to the fact that they were in a great hurry.</p>
                    <p>At last, we hope from you to deign and write our complaint on your newspaper
                        "The Egyptian Gazette." Your opinion, however, will not fail in
                        strengthening our demand. We hope again to accept our great thanks.</p>

                        officer’s gun. as was amply demonstrated by the evidence, but was started by
                        the natives, who, by nature, were capable of any crime. On the following
                        day, when the authorities were forming a cordon round the village, a woman
                        began to shout that a fire was burning in a "girn" and this second fire was
                        extinguished as quickly as the first. This was also caused by the natives
                        and, said counsel, was done in order to attract the attention of those
                        forming the cordon and afford the villagers, who were guilty of the attack,
                        time to run away. The accused were revengeful. He could not say why. Was it
                        becasue the officers were English or for other reasons? The villagers were,
                        however, as he said before capable of any crime. Even supposing that the
                        fire was caused by the officers, it must be remembered that they gave up
                        their guns. Why should the attack continue? The officers denied having
                        caused the fire. In giving evidence the officers had sworn to speak the
                        exact truth and he believed them whe they said that the four wounded persons
                        were not shot by them.</p>

                    <head>The Onbashi's Role</head>
                    <p>Referring to the onbashi of police who accompanied them, counsel said that
                        his evidence was in agreement with the prisoners. According to him, one of
                        the officers fired at the natives when they seized <persName>Lieut.
                            Porter</persName>’s gun. They did not call for evidence from the onbashi
                        of police in the first instance, as they did not wish to put forward the man
                        as an example of the shortcomings of the Egyptian police. They would rather
                        conceal the fact that the police were unintelligent and incapable. Counsel
                        for accused desired the evidence of the onbashi and the prosecution were
                        quite willing for him to be called. The evidence was as the Court had
                        already heard. The onbashi denied meeting any one on the road when he left
                        the officers in order to call the omdeh. He passed the house of
                            <persName>Hassan Mahfouz</persName> and it could not be determined that
                        he saw nobody; but he denied seeing anyone and instead of going to see the
                        omdeh, he went off to take lunch with <persName>Gabr Zohran</persName>. He
                        was also asked what took place during the attack and he said that the
                        natives and officers were beating and firing at each other. But he knew
                        nothing. He had fallen from his horse and became frightened. He first stated
                        that the officers fired at the natives and said later that he did know if
                        this was the case. He also said when telephoning to the markezz that the
                        natives fired, but even the officers did not say that they did so, so that
                        his evidence was obviously false.</p>

                    <head>Accidental Discharge of Gun.</head>
                    <p>It was asserted that the woman who was wounded was shot by the officers, but
                        ocunsel was convinced that she was shot when the gun was being wrested from
                            <persName>Lieut. Porter</persName>. The medical report showed that the
                        sheikh of the ghaffirs received his wounds in the knee from a gun about 20
                        ins. away and that the woman was about 1 metre away, while the officer was
                        surrounded by people, and this showed that the gun went off when it was
                        being taken away from the officer. All four persons received the shots from
                        the same gun in their legs, this showing that the gun was not fired
                        purposely. This was in accordance with the statements of the officers. The
                        guns were given up and why did the natives continue the attack except with
                        the intention of doing wilful harm? If the officers had known Arabic they
                        would have had far more evidence to present. On account of the
                        interpretation of the officers evidence the audience did not realise the
                        extreme gravity of their assertions, but counsel was in possession of the
                        full details and know exactly how it took place. The officers were disarmed
                        and ran away, not making any stand against the natives. The were beaten and
                            <persName>Major Pine-Coffin</persName> fell senseless three times.</p>

                    <head>Wanted to kill them.</head>
                    <p>The strokes were nearly all about the head as if it had been so arranged, and
                        from this it might be inferred that they intended to kill the officers. When
                            <persName>Major Pine-Coffin</persName> tell the people still continued
                        to attack the officers. "What did they want? They wanted to kill them.” When
                        they arrived at the carriages the natives did not let the officers go. The
                        arbagi tried to drive away, but was struck on the head by a nabout. The men
                        were using nabouts and the women throwing bricks and stones. The officers
                        were dragged back towards the village and the natives continued their
                        attempts to kill them. They had tibn; placed all round the officers with
                        which to burn them. It appeared, however, that one of the accused persuaded
                        them to abandon their terrible design. They tortured them for an hour. When
                        a quarrel arises both parties usually exchange blows; but in this case only
                        one side attacked. The officers did not even curse the villagers! Two of the
                        officers went ahead for help and three remained at the mercy of an ignorantt
                        and savage crowd. <persName>Capt. Ball</persName> was struck and afterwards
                        ran on for five kilometres to <persName>Sersina</persName>, which he reached
                        about two o’clock or half past. The thermometer stood at 42°C.</p>

                    <p><persName>Capt. Bull</persName> was not sufficiently conscious to keep to the
                        road and he fell in a field, about 7 metres from the main road.
                            <persName>Capt. Bostock</persName> swam across the canal, fully clothed,
                        in order to get to the camp. From the steps taken by the officers it was
                        easy to believe that they thought the natives intended to kill them. The
                        aggression of the people was not forcibly resisted by the officers. This was
                        the exact truth. Even those who were most prejudiced, either from ignorance
                        or from "national" feeling doubted the correctness of their prejudice in
                        this case when they wrote to the Officer in Command of the Army of
                        Occupation thanking <persName>Capt. Bostock</persName> for having reported
                        the death of <persName>Capt. Bull</persName> in accordance with the facts.
                        The correspondents of whom he spoke did not even believe what they wrote in
                        their papers, and had later expressed in other papers their belief that the
                        officers were blameless.</p>

                <div type="item">
                    <head>Premeditation.</head>
                    <p>The truth was self-evident. "Did the people previously intend to kill the
                        officers or did they suddenly conceive the idea after the attack had
                        commenced? I believe that it was previous intention—even before the officers
                        arrived at the village.” He believed the people intended to kill the
                        officers in the event of their coming near the village to shoot pigeons.
                        Counsel believed <persName>Hassan Mahfouz</persName> (No. 11); not only to
                        have taken part in the attaock, but to have been the leader. He denied
                        participation but the event took place opposite his house.</p>
                    <p>The Court then rose for an intervan of a quarter of an hour.</p>
                    <p>Counsel; continuing, said that from article 297 and note 8, page 414 of the
                        Code, “intention to kill" can be constituted by preparing arms, uttering
                        threats, showing hatred and anger in consequence of previous events. The
                        accused were therefore guilty of premeditation. In note 15 it is laid down
                        that the intent to kill may be formed from a past event. It is difficult to
                        say whether all the accused had previous intention to kill but there could
                        be no doubt of the intentions of the leaders. The fact, however, that they
                        supported the leaders constituted, by law, premeditated murder. As regards
                        the officers who escaped, it was attempted murder. <persName>Capt.
                            Bull</persName> was murdered and the accused are responsible for his
                        death. It was stated in the first medical report, which was made by the
                        Markas doctor and <persName>Capt. Bostock</persName>, that death was due to
                        concussion of the brain aggravated by sunstroke. The accused refused to
                        believe this report and it was afterwards demanded that the body of
                            <persName>Capt. Bull</persName> should be exhumed for the purposes of an
                        autopsy. The second report by <persName>Dr. Nolan</persName> confirmed the
                        first. The sunstroke, said counsel, was caused by the attack as much as the
                        concussion.</p>

                        (25), and <persName>Mohamed Darweesh Zohran</persName>(48) were the leaders
                        of the crowd. In the house of No. 48 two guns and other articles belonging
                        to the officers were found.</p>

                    <p>In concluding, <persName>Ibrahim Bey Helbawi</persName> said that the British
                        officers had given proof of their fine character. They might have killed
                        people to defend themselves, bu they desisted to preserve the honour of
                        their nation. These five officers had seen military service. <persName>Major
                            Pine-Coffin</persName> had distinguished himself in the Transvaal; he
                        bore a medal. He had receieved from the officer in command of the Army of
                        Occupation details concerning all the officers. According to any criminal
                        code the accused might be sentenced; including the Moslem law. The tribunal
                        woul dbe fulfilling its duty if it condemned to death seven of the accused

                        pleaded. He thanked God that no outrage against the Army of Occupation had
                        taken place with the exception of one at <placeName>Galioubieh</placeName>
                        and the attack which had recently taken place at
                            <placeName>Denishwai</placeName>. The outrage, the work of ignorant and
                        savage people, inhabiting a criminal district, would, it was to be hoped,
                        make no change in the relations of the British Army towards them.
                            <persName>Major Pine-Coffin</persName> had said that the natives were
                        always friendly to him. Counsel for the defence were very grateful for the
                        liberty which the Court allowed them. As for premeditation, it was in no way
                        established, and no one could say that the poeple of
                            <placeName>Denishwai</placeName> bore malice against the Army of
                        Occupation.</p>
                    <p>After giving a resume o the occurrence counsel said that <persName>Hassan
                            Mahfouz</persName> (11) had warned the party through their guide when
                        they were going to shoot. They were not attacked because the people intended
                        to do them harm but probably because they were shooting near the village. He
                        could not say that shooting pigeons justified murder. The reason of the
                        attack was the firing of the tibn and the wounding of a woman.
                            <persName>Mohamed Abd el Nebi</persName>, the owner of the "girn," saw
                        that the officer had a gun in his hand and he thought he saw fire coming
                        from its mouth. A man who saw his "girn" burnt and his wife shot would not
                        feel particularly grateful. The tree officers who came to assist their
                        colleague fired in his defence and the case then became graver. The
                        policeman said in giving evidence that the officers fired. He could not
                        believe that the gun went off after the people took it becasue
                            <persName>Lieut. Porter</persName> said that he had put it at "safety"
                        and the people did not know how to cock it. At any rate, if one rifle went
                        off accidentally and the others did not, and he believed that the officers
                        had fired and inflicted injuries on four persons. The natives could not take
                        the rifles and fire them themselves. As regards premeditation, the principal
                        witness wsa <persName>Ahmed Bey Habib</persName>. The fire could not have
                        been taken as a signal for an attack. Could it be thought that it would take
                        3,300 people, the number of inhabitants of the village, to kill five men? It
                        was the custom of the fellaheen to form a crowd. If they intended to kill
                        the officers, who could have prevented them? He asked for the release of the
                        accused.</p>

                        the fire to be due to the shooting, but it was now known that it was not due
                        to the officers. After taking the guns from the officers, the natives
                        behaved shamefully, but there was no evidence of previous intention to kill.
                        As regards to his second point, the Court must give judgment according to
                        the Egyptian Code. As regards to the third, it was evident from the medical
                        report that the blows were not sufficient to cause death, which was due to
                        sunstroke. Had the occurrence taken place when the heat of the sun was less
                        powerful it is probable that death would not have occurred.</p>

                    <head>INTERNATIONAL EXHIBITION IN NEW ZEALAND.</head>
                    <p>In a letter from <placeName>Christchurch, N.Z.</placeName>, to H.B.M.'s
                        Consul at Cairo, directing his attention to the New Zealand International
                        Exhibition, which is to open in November, 1906, and. continue until April,
                        1907, the Executive Commissioner states that he is derirous of securing
                        Egyptian representation.</p>
                    <p>The <placeName>Cairo</placeName> display at the Chicago Fair was generally
                        admitted to be a popular and interesting display, and he says he is derious
                        of securing the interest of some enterprising firm or firms to have their
                        goods shown at the exhibition or even take out selling rights for those
                        peculiarly novel Egyptian bazaar nic-nacs.</p>
                    <p>The Executive Commissioner adds: "The five Continents are well represented,
                        but that of <placeName>North Africa</placeName>, I regret to say, has not
                        yet applied for space. Any enterprising <placeName>Cairo</placeName> firm
                        who deal in scarabs, perfumes, attar of roses, Palestine goods, narghilis,
                        hookahs, Egyptian cigarettes, Arabian curios, antlers of big game,
                        Abyssinian skin rugs, Turkish delight, or articles of local interest, would,
                        I think, find an almost open field for their goods and a prospect of fair
                        remuneration at this exhibition.</p>
                    <p>"I am prepared to reserve space for any such firms, but as the time is
                        drawing near it is too late to correspond with them direct. <placeName>Great
                            Britain</placeName> is paramount in <placeName>New Zealand</placeName>
                        trade but a variety of Eastern goods to the people of this country is unique
                        to any Egyptian firm, as fully 2,000,000 visitors are expected to be
                        present.</p>
                    <p>"Exhibits, not goods for sale, are charged freight on the outward trip only
                        if consigned to Messrs. Shaw, Sevile and Coy., or the Union Steamship Coy.
                        Space is 2s. per sq. foot, flooring and light free; selling rights entail a
                        payment of a small royalty to the executive for the concession. Exhibits may
                        be landed direct from the steamer to the exhibition at a cost of 8s, 6d. per
                        ton."</p>

                    <p>The spread of the Pan Islamic agitation must be giving Lord Cromer no little
                        anxiety. The old Turks covet a return of the happy times when they could
                        plunder the public revenue, and as British control is incompatible with that
                        restoration, the clique of sordid conspirators strain every endeavour to get
                        rid of it by one method or another. The Pan-Islamic movement is accordingly
                        enlisted for the purpose, as the readiest means of drawing all Mohamedans
                        together against the Christian community. The Sultan was, no doubt, Chiefly
                        encouraged by this got-up religious fermentation to tend troops across the
                        Turco-Egyptian frontier, hoping no donbt, that Mukhtar Pasha, his agent at
                        Cairo, would help the armed enterprise by covertly preaching sedition. But
                        when strong British reinforcements arrived, the plot collapsed, and there is
                        just a possibility that the outrage near Tantah was an after consequence of
                        the previous unrest.</p>

                        the dominant issues. Free Trade is not for the moment a problem. And as to
                        Chinese slavery, we all know what has happened. Those who were "slaves”
                        before have been slaves—barring a dozen—since Sir Henry Campbell Bannerman

                        same time civilisers. Now in the Belgian Congo the European e'ement does not
                        civilise. It does not even colonise. It exploits. And it is an intolerable
                        situation to which the reforms announced ought to put an end. ("La Petit

                        international law obliging them to do so. In honour, the Congo Government
                        would be clearly bound to publish the full report. The fact that they prefer
                        to sacrifice honour rather than publish it is striking evidence of the
                        gravity of the case disclosed to the Commission. It makes more clear than
                        ever the duty of Europe to enforce the guarantees for good government, that
                        induced the Powers to sanction the founding of the Congo Free State. (“Daily

                    <head>The Modern Novel.</head>
                    <p>The main reflection to which one is brought by looking over modern novels is
                        that the novel is a passing form; it has had its day and must cease. It has
                        been overdone and cheapened until it is difficult to take even the finest
                        novels with seriousness. The external novel, the novel that lacks brooding
                        and profundity of truth and force of emotion, is simply negligible; and the
                        novel of mental process, in this age of tottering faiths and insecure

                        it is one which ought to be very cautiously and discreetly indulged. A flash

                        always welcome, but it is not given to every one, or even to every Judge, to
                        emit flashes of the rare quality. Laughter in Court, is very easily
                        produced, but it must be confessed that the observations which call it forth
                        do not always or even frequently impress those who do not breathe the

                    <head>CAIRO COMPANY INTERESTED.</head>
                    <p>(From our Correspondent.)</p>
                    <p>Beyrout, June 18.</p>
                    <p>The Imperial Iradé sanctioning the concession for the electric tramways of
                        Beyrout has at last been granted, and here is one of the many proofs of the
                        great favour and influence that Negib Pacha Malhamé enjoys at Yildiz. The
                        concession, as I have already mentioned, in a previous letter, has been sold
                        for £10,000. The sum is out of all proportion to the financial importance of
                        the scheme, the total cost of which is estimated at not more than six
                        million francs, and the only way the liberality of the concession purchaser
                        can be accounted for is the plausible conjecture that part of the sum is
                        payable in shares.</p>
                    <p>So far the capital required has not been found, but it is said that the
                        Barque de Paris et des Pays Bas is exerting itself in that direction. Most
                        probably the Franco-Belgian Company, which has supplied the Electric Tramway
                        Company of Damascus with the rolling stock and other material, will
                        undertake the construction. Others believe that the Companie des Tramways du
                        Caire may be undertaking the work.</p>

                <div type="item">
                    <head>Gas Versus Electricity.</head>
                    <p>The Gas Company of Beyrout, which, by virtue of its concession, has the
                        pre-emption for the electric lighting of the town, will forfeit this right
                        if, after three months' notice, it should not have decided to undertake the
                        work, and in that case the new electric company will have both the right for
                        locomotion and lighting exploitation. So far the official notice has not
                        been given to the Gas Company, which is in no way likely to undertake the
                        work, but which will try to make capital out of this pre-emptive right. The
                        director of the Gas Company feels confident that however cheaply the
                        electric company may be able to supply the lighting he can always underbid
                        them. The big halls of the Beyrout houses require very strong light which
                        the electric bulbs are too feeble to supply, and people prefer, on the other
                        hand, a heating agency which can be advantagegously supplied by gas but not
                        by electricity.</p>

                    <head>Benefits of Scheme.</head>
                    <p>The benefits accruing to the town of Beyrout from the execution of such a
                        scheme are incalculable. Cheap, rapid, and a comfortable mode of locomotion
                        is a public good too evident to be emphasized. Yet the town will benefit in
                        other important directions. The principal streets where the tramway lines
                        are to be laid will have necessarily to be solidly macadamized and well
                        kept, and for their maintenance proper sewers will have to be constructed,
                        and then the ruts and the dust and the nauseabond exhalations that offend
                        sight and smell and all the senses generally, and which disfigure our main
                        as well as our minor roads in a way such as cannot be seen even in a
                        neglected village, will no more have their raison d'etre. The hygienic
                        importance of the result cannot be overrated.</p>

                    <head>Beyrout's Streets</head>
                    <p>Some croaking pessimists are already talking of insuperable difficulties that
                        the tramway will meet with in the shape of insufficient width of the
                        streets. But barring a few spots where old buildings, relics of the old
                        uncivilized municipal days (sic) which jut out with obtrusive ugliness, the
                        streets where the lines are proposed to be laid are quite sufficient for the
                        simultaneous circulation o the tramway and other traffic. To superficial
                        observers our roads look too narrow, but no account seems to be taken of the
                        considerable space occupied by the stalls of fruit and vegetable vendors
                        who, through the laxity of interested connivance of municipal supervision,
                        encroach on the public roads, making thereof so much shop room. These,
                        however, will disappear as by magic if only the Municipality will exercise
                        its legitimate authority, as it will have eventually to do if the tramway
                        is, as we fondly hope, to become a "fait accompli." As regards the old
                        buildings, these being few, the question of their demolition can be easily
                        arranged on an equitable basis of expropriation.</p>

                    <p>The rumour regarding the project of the Uzai prespective garden city is
                        gaining wider publicity every day and with that more precision of detail.
                        The Anglo-Egyptian Land ALlotmaent Company is said to have come to a
                        preliminary agreement with Mr. Ibrahim J. Tabet, acting on his own behalf
                        and that of his partners, about the vast Uzai lands. The terms of this
                        agreement are thus roughly sketched. The Land Allotment will get the land at
                        20 paras per pic (drah.) and after allotting same according to the
                        up-to-date real estate system and making liberal allowance for wide streets
                        and spacious road points will fix the sale price at 3 piastres per pic. Then
                        the company will also undertake the construction of houses according to
                        plans devised by the would be proprietors, against the payment by the latter
                        of 25% of the cost, the remaining 75% to be sunk during a period of 20
                        years, after which the complete ownership of the house will revert to the
                        contracting party with the company.</p>

                        are to judge the result of this scheme by the deep interest evinced therein
                        by the inhabitants of Beyrout, the Land Allotment may from now be
                        congratulated on an almost certain success. The project has such important
                        bearings outside the domain of pure finance that it shoul dnot be wondered
                        that it might have originated in the mind of the director of the Land
                        Allotment Company, whos great financial schemes have always been
                        characterised with high purpose, a progressive spirit, and a vast

                    <p>I have it from an authoritative source that the Deutsche Orient Bank
                        Aktiengesellschaft is about to establish a branch in beyrout next authumn,
                        and that the directors of this branch are already appointed. Financiers must
                        know that the Deutsche Orient Bank was founded with a capital of 16 million
                        marks by the great German banking establishments, the Dresdner Bank, A.
                        Schauffhausen scher Bankverein, and the Nationalbank für Deutschland. The
                        expansion of German enterprise in Turkey does not seem to be confined to
                        shipping and railway building. Indeed the establishment of banking concerns
                        is a necessary corrolary of the fast development of German trade in Asiatic
                        Turkey. The Imperial Ottoman Bank must view, this apparent encroachment with
                        disfavour, the more so as it is alleged that the new German Bank will enjoy
                        the patronage of the Turkish Government.</p>

                        order to revive the drooping spirits of the garrison. The medal, which was
                        very rudely fashioned, was issued in several metals - the pewter was
                        distributed pretty generally among the civil population but the gilt star is
                        very rare. One of these primitive rewards was on view at the exhibition of

                    <p>It is well known that previous to the era of Mohamed and the writing of the
                        Koran, the religion of the Arabs around MEcca and Medina, and indeed
                        wherever they roamed, was polytheistic, and that they worshipped numerous
                        deities of both sexes.</p>
                    <p>In promulgating his montheistic religion the Prophet neccessarily denounced
                        all other gods than Allah, and being anti-feministic in his theology, though
                        hardly so in his actions, Mohamed specially warns his followers against
                        female deities. Among those anathematised in Chapter 53 of the Koran are
                        three known as Al'Lat, Al'Ouzza, ana Manat.</p>
                    <p>Of these, Al'Lat in the old pagan pantheon was the feminine counterpart of
                        Allah; and Manat is of Maui (Destiny); whilst Al'Ouzza is that of Al'Aziz
                        (Powerful).</p>
                    <p>The two first have frequently been found alluded to in ancient Arabian
                        inscriptions, but not so Al'Ouzza in any very direct manner. A Yemenite, or
                        Himyaritic, monumenta text recently presented to the Louvre, however,
                        clearly mentions Al'Ouzza. Its date is about A.D. 350. The inscription
                        relates the consecration of a memorial to the goddess 'Ouzza as a favour of
                        her devotees, the dedicator of the monument and his daughter.</p>
                    <p>These 'Ouzza worshippers were therefore two persons who adored one of those
                        goddesses of whom Mohamed said, "They are nothing more than names given by
                        yourselves, you and your ancestors, without Allah ever having bestowed on
                        them a particle of power."</p>

                    <head>FREIGHT WAR AND THE SUEZ DUES.</head>
                    <p>In reference to the shipping freight war which has been proceeding for some
                        time between the Peninsular and Oriental and British India lines on the one
                        hand and the Hansa Steamship Company on the other, a Bremen correspondent of
                        the Berlin "Böreen Courier" states that the manager of the German company is
                        reported to have again left for London in order to bring to an end the
                        negotiations for the conclusion of the rate war. It is expected in Bremen
                        that a definite settlement of the contest will be arrived at, as both
                        aprties are said to desire the termination of the costly fight. The trade of
                        the Hansa Company is so brisk that it is unable to cope with it by the use
                        of its own steamers, and has been compelled to charter thirteen vessels. In
                        the outward trade to India the correspondent states that the Hansa Company
                        has scarcely suffered, as all its ships are fully loaded and a freight rate
                        of 15s per ton is obtained, whereas the British competition has reduced rate
                        to 5% per ton. The reduction of the Suez Canal dues is also of advantage to
                        the German Company. There is again a lot of talk regarding the establishment
                        of a community of interests with the Hamburg American Company, although
                        little credence is attached to these reports in Bremen.</p>

                    <p>Le taux de l'escompte libre à Londres reste toujours invarié à 3 1/4 pour
                        cent.</p>
                    <p>Hier, an Stock Exchange, le Consolidé anglais a baissé de non moins de 5/8 de
                        livre à 80 1/8. L’Unifiée est restée invariée à 104 3/4, de même que la
                        National Bank à 25 5/8, la Daira à 17 1/8 et la Delta Light à 12.</p>
                    <p>A Paris, l’action Crédit Fonciér Egyptien a perdu 1 franc à 771. La Banque
                        d’Athène est demeurée inchangée à 154.</p>
                    <p>Ici, le marché des valeurs a été, aujourd'hui, moins animé, moins actif
                        qu’hier. Toutefois, les dispositions ne sont pas mauvaises, bien que la
                        fermeté ne se soit pas maintenue sur toute la ligne.</p>
                    <p>Pen d’afiaireè en National Bank, qui à couturé à 25 1/2-9/16. L’Agricolé
                        s’est tenue à son prix d’hier, soit 9 11/16. La Cassa di Sconto s’est
                        alourdie à 213 l’action ancienne, ainsi que la Banque d’Athènes à 154 et la
                        Banque d’Orient à 131 1/2. </p>
                    <p>L’action Crédit Foncier a molli à 770 et là part de fondateur à 910.</p>
                    <p> L’action Immobilière a fléchi à 366, l’Entreprise and Development à 11 15/16
                        et l’Agricole du Nil à 259; la part de fondateur a progressé, par contre, à
                        7 1/16.</p>
                    <p>Bonne demande en Improvements Corporation, qui a gagné 1/8 à 4 11/16 3/4.</p>
                    <p>L’action Entreprises Immobilière et Tra-vâux a’est raffermie à 4 1/16; la
                        part de fondateur, très recherchée, a avancé à 70.</p>
                    <p>L’action Wardan Estate s’est inscrite à 6 et la,Nile Land à 13 1/2.</p>
                    <p>La part de fondateur Land Allotment a encore faibli à 110.</p>
                    <p>L’action de capital Eaux du Caire a fait 120-121; les Jouissances ont clôturé
                        à 261 1/2 après avoir atteint 264.</p>
                    <p>Dans le groupe des Hôtels, les Nungovich, délaissés, sont restés à 15 7/16
                        l’action anciene, et 15 3/8 la nouvelle. Les Baehler ont débuté à 5 23/32
                        pour finir à 5 21/32 11/16. Lee National ont progressé à 3 3/8.</p>
                    <p>Parmi les petites valeurs, les Delta Land ont été' ramenés à 3 13/16 et les
                        Glymenopoulo à 1 9/16.</p>
                    <p>***</p>
                    <p>Nous détachons d’une lettre de Londres, en date du 19 Juin, les lignes
                        suivantes concernant la situation monétaire:</p>
                    <p>"Les conditions de l’argent se sont avanta-geaiement modifiées. L’encaisse de
                        la Banque d’Angleterre s’est considérablement accru et la proportion de la
                        réserve s’est élevée à plus de 47%. Le taux de l’escompte libre oscille
                        entre 8 3/8 et 3 1/4 pour cent. La situation est donc, sans conteste,
                        meilleure, bien que les disponibilités du marché aient à faire face à
                        l'emprunt irlandais, annoncé pour le 7 Juillet; là tenue du cours du
                        Consolidé anglais en est affectée. Le “Statist” ne prévoit pas une
                        augmentation prochaine des disponibilités et s’attend même à des sorties
                        considérables poor la fin du mois courant.</p>
                    <p>Le Stock Exchange jouit en ce moment d’un repos relatif; c'est l’effet de la
                        morte saison. Là clientèle est devenue rare, et les mouvements des valeurs
                        quelque peu somnolentes ont beaucoup perdu de leur étendue."</p>
                    <p>***</p>
                    <p>On annonce d’Athènes que L’assemblée générale extraordinaire des actionnaires
                        de la Banque du Crédit Industriel de Grèce, tenue samedi passé, a voté à
                        l’unanimité la fusion avec la Banque d’Athènes.</p>
                    <p>L’assemblée extraordinaire de la Banque d’Athènes, qui doit statuer sur le
                        même objet; est fixée comme on sait; au samedi 7 Juillet prochain.</p>
                    <p>***</p>
                    <p>On assure que l’arrangement négocié entre le gouvernement et la Société des
                        Sucreries et Raffinerie d’Egyptè concernant l’achat par l’Etat des lignes de
                        railways à voie étroite de cet té Société serait sur le point d’être conclu,
                        au prix d’environ LE. 350,000.</p>
                    <p>***</p>
                    <p>Au dire d’un journal d’Alexandrie, un groupe financier, à la tête daquel se
                        trouverait M. Scott, ancien directeur de la Compagnie d’assurance "The
                        Gresham," se propose de former une Société anonyme de constructions
                        economiques dont le siege social serait au Caire:</p>
                    <p>"Les acheteurs-locataires deviendraient pro priétaires au bout d’un certain
                        nombrè d’années en payant un loyer comprenant l’amortis sement du prix de
                        l’immeuble et une prime d’assurance, de sorte qu’en cas de mort leurs

                    <head>Mr. Justice Grantham and The Government</head>
                    <p>The Bodmin election petition trial was conluded on the 18th inst. The Judges
                        found that the election was void on the ground of corrupt treating, and
                        declared Mr. Agar-Robartes unseated, Counsel's speeches being concluded.</p>
                    <p>The Judges retired a few minutes after four o'clock, and after an interval
                        returned into court. Mr. Justice Graham read a long statement regarding
                        charges brought against himself. After remarking that what had recently
                        happened owing to findings of his own had justified in a remarkable way, the
                        refusal of the late Lord Chief Justcie Cockburn to be a party to appointing
                        Judges of the High Court to try election petitions on the ground that he
                        would be made the subject of attack by bitter politicians, Mr. Justice
                        Grantham, his voice broken, by his emotion, proceeded:-</p>
                    <p>"As everyone in this court and in this country knows, a notice of motion has
                        been made in the House of Commons accusing me of partisanship in the
                        Yarmouth petition. A majority of the members of the House have identified
                        themselves with the motion. It is idle for me, therefore, in giving my
                        judgment now to disguise from myself the fact which makes a delivery of this
                        judgment one of the most painful duties of my life. I cannot but feel that a
                        charge of the greatest gravity is haning over my head, which, if true, would
                        have made me unfit to try this petition, or to deliver this judgment and
                        would justify anyone and everyone adversely affected by it in saying it is
                        the judgment of an unjust Judge. I have been unfairly treated by the
                        Government, which has allowed me to proceed with such an important trial
                        before this charge had either been proved or withdrawn. As far as I know,
                        the charge is absolutely without foundation. No evidence upon which it is
                        based has been suggested that I am aware of though the mother of lies has
                        taken advantage of the opportunity which has been given her to fructify
                        lavishly ard spread her offspring all over the land. So I gather from the
                        numerous letters and newspapers sent to me.</p>
                    <p>"Simultaneously with the making of this charge I find that a gathering of
                        Liberal agents on the occasion of the annual meeting of the National Liberal
                        Federation (2,000 delegates met from 400 constituencies), after they had
                        appointed Lord Tweedmouth their president, adopted a resolution expressing
                        dissatisfaction at a grave miscarriage of justice in connection with the
                        petitions at Yarmouth and Maidstone, and urged the Government to amend the
                        Constitution of the election courts. Is it just to the judges of England
                        that such charges should be made and no effort made to prove or disprove
                        them at the earliest possible moment? The judges are powerless to defend
                        themselves at all times in the House of Commons, at whose special request
                        they are discharging these most difficult duties. They have a right to
                        expect protection if not defence. Their judicial lives and character are not
                        their own. Let it not be thought I complain of the 300 who signed the
                        petition to the Prime Minister. They might not have had a friendly motive to
                        me, but I attribute no motive. What I insist on is that before they
                        petitioned I had demanded of the Prime Minister that the mover of the notice
                        should be called upon to prove his charge. My answer was, and is, that the
                        written judgments in the previous petitions were placed in the hands of the
                        Government at the time they were delivered, and the Government could have
                        said at once whether there was any foundation for that charge. </p>
                    <p>"The only answer I have had given to me is that it was not intended to allow
                        the matter to be brought forward until my judgment had been given in the
                        Bodmin case. Again I assign no motive, but allow others to draw their own
                        inference. When a few days ago I was officially informed that it was the
                        intention of the government to have another postponement for three weeks I
                        could stand it no longer, and felt obliged to find a safety valve in speech.
                        If similar charges should be made in future against me or any of my brothers
                        I trust different treatment may be meted out to us."</p>
                    <p>Mr. Justice Grantham then reviewed the circumstances of the Bodmin case,
                        prefacing his remarks by stating that he differed from his learned brother
                        on one point-as to what were expenses for the purposes of an election, and
                        as to when a contest actually began. His Lordship's general conclusions were
                        that in regard to Mr. Robartes's ownacts of treating it woul dbe hard to
                        treat him as an old electioneerer, but that MR. Millman's (agent) acts of
                        treating alone and the treating at the Lanhydrock garden party were
                        sufficient to vitiate the election. There could be no doubt that Lanhydrock
                        was corrupt treating, though Lord and Lady Clifden might have been guilty of
                        treating without doing anything intentionally immoral or dishonest, "My
                        judgment is clear," Mr. Justice Grantham added, "that seat cannot be held
                        and that Mr. Robartes must be unseated."</p>
                    <p>Mr. Justice Laurance concurred.</p>
                    <p>The two Judges were hooted as they left the court, but they merely smiled and
                        bowed. The Unionist agent, Mr. Snell, was greeted with considerable hooting,
                        and had to be escorted to his hotel by a strong bodyguard of police.</p>

                    <head>BRITISH FLEETS ON THE DEFENCE.</head>
                    <p>In the final maneuvres of the British Fleets, which are to take place this
                        week, the naval correspondent of the "Daily Telegraph" writes, a rather
                        smaller naval force will be employed than cooperated in the early
                        operations, as a number of obsolescent ships which were raised to war
                        complement to test the mobilisation arrangements at the home ports have now
                        been demobilised, together with a number of torpedo craft, while the
                        cruisers Juno and Talbot have been detached to act as escort to the Prince
                        and Princess of Wales on their voyage to Norway for the coronation of King
                        Haakon and Queen Maud. With these exceptions, every efficient ship in home
                        waters and in the Mediterranean will be assisting in the scheme which has
                        been specially designed to test the efficiency of the British Fleet for the
                        defence of commerce. As the scheme of British naval defence is based on the
                        two-power standard- that is, the equality of the British Fleet with a
                        combination of the two next strongest navies in Europe, with a margin over
                        to provide for contingencies - the naval forces which are to be opposed to
                        each other in the comming maneuvres have been distributed so as to give the
                        Red British - Admiral a great superiority of strength.</p>
                    <p>The Red Fleet has England as its "territory," with GIbraltar as a distant
                        base, at which the Mediterranean Fleet is stationed, while the Blue Fleet
                        has as its "country". Ireland and Scotland and the Channel Islands, with
                        Lagos, on the Portuguese coast, as a distand base. How Blue will attack
                        British commerce depends, of course, entirely on the plans elaborated by
                        Vice Admiral Sir W.H. May, the Commander-in-Chief, but it is anticipated
                        that the main burden of the guerre de course will devolve upon Prince Louis
                        of Battenberg, who commands the Second Crusader Squadron, and has shown
                        himself a most original and dashing naval leader. On the other hand, it may
                        be accepted, without question, that nothing will be wanting in the scheme of
                        defence of Admiral Sir Arthur Wilson and his colleagues.</p>
                    <p>One of the advantages of these operations is that an unusually large number
                        of flag officers are to be employed, and will thus gain experience of the
                        greatest possible value. The following is a full list of the Admirals and
                        their flagships:</p>
                    <!-- List of Admirals and Ships -->
                    <p>The attack on commerce will take place over a very large area, which embraces
                        a part of the ocean which is most frequented by British merchant ships, and
                        it is here, as they draw in towards the British Isles, that they are most
                        open to attack by an enemy. The Admiralty have announced that it is proposed
                        to include in the scheme as many as possible of the slow steamers outward
                        bound via the Mediterranean Sea and South Atlantic, and steamers homeward
                        bound via the Mediterranean, but steamers carrying mails, passengers
                        (Excepting where the conditions of teh passengers' tickets authorise the
                        vessels cooperating in the maneuvres), live stock, chilled meats, green
                        fruit or vegetables, have not been asked to take part. Cooperating vessels
                        will conform to the following conditions:</p>
                    <p>1. They will call at Falmouth or Milford HAven if outward bound, and at
                        Gibraltar is homeward bound, and make their passages thence in company with
                        other vessels or otherwise, as may be directed by the senior naval officer
                        in these ports. It is proposed that as vessels collect in the above ports
                        they should be dispatched along the trade routes in groups of twelve or
                        less, and it is anticipated that vessels will not be delayed on their voyage
                        for more than sixty hours.</p>
                    <p>2. At each port the masters of vessels will receive full instructions
                        concerning the future conduct of their ships and the order in which their
                        groups will sail. They will be required to conform to these instructions and
                        to obey signals made to them.</p>
                    <p>3. Whilst cooperating they will fly a red ensign at the fore, the enemy's
                        men-of-war being distinguised by a blue ensign on the triatic stay abaft the
                        foremast.</p>
                    <p>4. They will be required to do their best to escape from the enemy and to
                        communicate any information they may possess to men-of-war of their own
                        side.</p>
                    <p>5. Should an enemy's man of war approach within three miles by day or one
                        mile by night of a vessel, fire three guns and hoist a signal to stop, the
                        vessel will be considered captured and will stop and allow herself to be
                        borded. After capture, a vessel will communicate no information to either
                        side.</p>
                    <p>6. Cooperation will be considered as having ceased, and a vessel will haul
                        down the red ensign, be free to part company, and shall proceed on her
                        voyage.</p>
                    <p> (a.) On passing the line between the Tuskar and Small Lights if bound up the
                        Irish Channel, the line through the Smalls and Lundy Island Lights if bound
                        up the Bristol Channel; the line between the Lizard and Ushant if bound up
                        the English Channel; the meridian of Cape Spartel if bound for the
                        Mediterranean; and the latitude of Cape St. Vincent if bound for the South
                        Atlanta.</p>
                    <p> (b.) After having been captured and boarded.</p>
                    <p> (c.) At noon on July 2.</p>
                    <p>It will be readily understood that with about 300 men-of-war, including
                        torpedo-boats and submarines, engaged, and with a larger number of merchant
                        ships cooperating, these operatinos will be of extraordinary interest.</p>

                    <head>FAUNA OF THE EMPIRE.</head>
                    <p>A deputation, headed by Lord Curzon of Kedleston and including the Duchess of
                        Bedford, Lord Monk Bretton, Sir Edward Tennant, Captain the Hon. Guy Baring,
                        Sir H. Seton Karr and Sir William Lee Warner, waited upon Lord Elgin at the
                        Colonial Office last week and presented, on behalf of the Society for the
                        Preservation of the Wild Fauna of the Empire, certain recommendations for
                        the protection of various species of wild animals which appeared to be in
                        danger of extinction.</p>
                    <p>The recommendations were drawn up as the result of reports called for from
                        the various Colonies and African Protectorates by Lord Elgin's predecessor
                        in office, Mr. Lyttelton, on representations being made to him by the
                        society last year. They are:- (1) That the returns of all game animals
                        killed should continue to be included in the annual reports of each
                        Protectorate or Colony. To them should be added statements showing the
                        receipts from all sources connected with the preservation of game, such as
                        licences, fines, etc., (2.) That a map should be prepared showing the
                        present game reserves in Africa; (3.) that the sale of hides, horns, etc.,
                        of game animals in the British dominions in Africa and at Aden should be
                        prohibited; (4.) that the sale of elephant tusks weighing less than 25 lbs.
                        should be prohibited and the tusks confiscated; (5.) that no shooting
                        whatsoever, except for administrative reasons, should be permitted in a
                        reserve; and (6.) that a strict return of all game killed should be made
                        annually by every license-holder.</p>
                    <p>Speeches were made by Lord Curzon, Sir H. Seton-Karr, Mr. E.N. Buxton, Mr.
                        S.H. Whitbread, M.P., and Mr. F. Gillett in explaining their views with
                        regard to reserves and their management. It was pointed out that the society
                        fully realized that the interests of the preservation of wild animals could
                        not be allowed to conflict with the development and occupation of British
                        Africa, and that it was no part of their programme to preserve the larger
                        carnivora or dangerous animals in proximity to settled districts. But the
                        speakers were strongly impressed with the imminent danger of extinction of a
                        number of rare and beautiful species in Africa, and felt that they had a
                        duty to perform in urging the Government do take adequate steps, before it
                        was too late, to presserve for posterity the fauna of the Empire. The
                        formation was advocated of definited reserves within which all animals might
                        find a sanctuary and breeding place of sufficient size to cover their annual
                        migrations, and it was stated that several such sanctuaries were already in
                        existence and had given evidence of the valuable protection they had
                        afforded. It was emphasized that such sanctuaries could not be effected
                        without adequate supervision, and that they should not be sanctuaries in
                        name only, but afford real security from molestation.</p>
                    <p>There was an exchange of views on various matters of detail, and Lord Elgin
                        throughout was most sympathetic and promised to give the recommendations of
                        the society his careful consideration.</p>
                    <p>Mr. E.N. Buxton expressed the deputation's appreciation of their reception,
                        and the proceedings then terminated.</p>

                    <head>ZION.</head>
                    <p>The horrible history of Bielostok has furnished Mr. Israel Zangwill with a
                        new text for preaching the urgency of the Zionist Territorial Scheme. We are
                        heartily with him in his aspirations. Here, on the one hand, is a land in
                        which, whenever political differences become acute, the Jews are massacred
                        on all hands; here, on another, is an empire unable to fill its waste
                        spaces, which is tolerant to the extreme in all religious matters, and which
                        has an unrivalled capaity for assimmilating all races under its rule; here,
                        in the third place, are some millions (perhaps) of people ready to occupy
                        one of its waste spaces under conditions of autonomy, with the money
                        available for giving the settlers a fair economic start. Why does not the
                        British Government exercise imagination, and make an experiment by which of
                        nothing can be lost, though much may be gained? Whatever we may feel about
                        the Jews, there is no gainsaying the fact that they are a race to be
                        trusted, and that, if they make a bargain, they will not forswear it,
                        "though it were to their own hindrance." Mr. Zangwill and others are
                        responsible for the idea that a new Jerusalem can be founded outside
                        Palestine. We may have our own opinion upon that subject; but the
                        responsibility is his, and there is no reason why we should refuse him the
                        opportunity of making the experiment.</p>

                    <head>OFFICIAL STATEMENT.</head>
                    <p>The Imperial Ottoman Embassy in London have issued the following statement
                        for publication:-</p>
                    <p>Several London papers of the 5th inst. have published a telegram from Bushire
                        reporting that Arab tribes of the Tigris, who were described as being in
                        revolt against the Imperial authority, fired on a British steamer, which was
                        on her way from Baghdad to Basra, many bullets piercing the sides of the
                        vessel, and that the Ottoman authorities were quite powerless to suppress
                        the rising, owing to the scarcity of troops. The facts are not as reported.
                        What really occurred amounts to this - some tribes fired a few shots, and
                        the Imperial authorities, on hearing of the incident, sent an adequate
                        number of troops at once to the spot and took necessary steps for the arrest
                        and exemplary punishment of the guilty men.</p>

                    <p>Before Mr. Justice Bigham, sitting as Bankruptcy Judge, in the King's Bench
                        Division, last week, Mr. Lusk, K.C., asked for a declaration that Madame
                        Katharina de Kohnle was entitles to the benefit of a proof of debt for
                        £14,121 dodged against Mr. J.R. Pilling's estate by Mr. David Chapman in
                        1898. Counsel explaind that Mr. Pilling obtained from Elias Effendi in 1890
                        a concession from the Turkish Government for the construction of a line of
                        railway from Acre to Damascus and was indebted to him in respect of the
                        purchase rights of his (Pilling's) interest in a sum of about £60,000. In
                        May 1894, Elias assigned his rights and interest in the concession to Mr.
                        Chapman, who brought an action against Pilling, and in 1896 obtained a
                        judgment for £14,121. Mr. Elias subsequently alleged that there had been a
                        total failure of the consideration as between Mr. Chapman and hiimself, and
                        in 1905 he assigned to MAdame de Kohnle, who had provided a lot of money in
                        connection with the scheme, all his rights in respect of the judgment debt
                        for which Mr. Chapman's proof had been admitted.- His Lordship said the
                        legal holder of the judgment debt was Mr. Chapman, who might at any time be
                        called upon to answer for the charges given upon the debt, and he could not
                        substitute. Madame de Kohnle for Mr. Chapman.-The motion was accordingly
                        dismissed, with costs.</p>

                        Offences Act, 1861) are conducted by the director. The particulars of such
                        prosecutions in 1905 show that there were 201 persons arrested for coinage
                        offences, 130 being in London. The report says: - "The serious increase in
                        the number of offences against His Majesty's Mint noticed in last year's
                        return has steadily continued during the period covered by the present one,
                        and the number of persons proceeded against in 1905 was nearly three times
                        as many, as 1902. Of the 53 persons convicted of coinage offences. Of the
                        total of 122 convictions in 1905, 53 were for felony, and of these 21 were
                        for making counterfeit coin, 14 for possessing moulds or other implements
                        for its manufacture; and three for gilding and selling coin. It is a
                        significant and disquieting fact that 35 makers of counterfeit coin or
                        possessors of moulds and tools for coining were convicted for the first
                        time. The number of pieces of base coin seized or found in connection with
                        the coinage prosecutions for the yeaer was 1,176."</p>

                    <p>Mr. Choate, in an interview, has taken exception to Bishop Potter's
                        pessimistic view of English professions of friendship for Americans. He
                        declared that the mutual respect and affection with which British and
                        Americans regard each other could not be dissipated by such incidents as the
                        recent commercial scandals. He regretted certain aspects of these scandals
                        because he felt that sensational journalism magnified the real condition of
                        things.</p>

                    <head>DEFICIT TO BE MADE GOOD BY TURKEY.</head>
                    <p>Replying to a question in the House of Commons last week, Sir E. Grey said
                        the Turkish Government have undertaken to make good any deficit in the
                        MAcedonian budget out of Imperial revenues generally. If the increased
                        Customs duties are devoted to this purpose the deficit to be made good from
                        other revenues will protanto be diminished.</p>
                    <p>The proceeds of the increase of 3 percent in the Customs duties will, if the
                        increase is agreed to be applicable to the Macedonian Budget as a whole, of
                        which the military expenditure forms a part.</p>
                    <p>His Majesty's Government have no control over Turkish revenues, the
                        allocation of which has not formed the subject of any agreement between the
                        two Governments. But it is estimated that the increased Customs duties will
                        fall considerably short of what is required to make up the deficit in the
                        Macedonian vilayets, and, in view of the difficulty which already exists in
                        meeting this it cannot be assumed that, if assistance is given, large
                        sources of Turkish revenue will automatically be set free for other
                        purposes.</p>

                    <p>With reference to the Press articles emanating from British, Italian, and
                        French sources stating that Germany intends taking political action in
                        Abyssinia, the "Kolnische Zeitung" is informed on good authority that
                        Kommerzienrat Bosch sent an expedition consisting of agricultural
                        instructors, architects, a merchant, a lady teacher, a house keeper, a

                    <p>The German Government is in no way connected with this enterprise, which is
                        of an entirely private character, and political motives play no part

                    <p>These sales commenced in London on the 4th inst. and concluded on the 8th.
                        They comprised 4,387 cases Cape, 7 cases from Australia, and 78 cases
                        Egyptian of which about 4.325 cases. Cape, 6 cases from Australia and 61

                    <p>The weight of feathers offered was 81,000 lb. against 77,400 lb. in April
                        last.</p>
                    <p>There was a good demand gnerally, but owing to bigger supply competition was
                        scarcely so keen as at the previous suctions. Wing feathers, of which there
                        was an exceptionally good and large selection, sold principally at a decline
                        of about 10 percent which, however, was not always marked on the better
                        qualities. The decline was most noticeable on defective and broken which
                        were 10 to 15 percent lower. White declined on the average about 10 percent,
                        broken and defective being 10 to 15 percent lower. White and light femina
                        sold the same as white. Dark femina rather lower. Byocks on the whole steady
                        to rather lower. Spadonas were scarce and very firm. White boos were
                        irregular, being steady to 5 percent lower. Femina boos and drab boos rather
                        easier, except light femina which were full up. Black butts unchanged. Long
                        and medium drab especially good lines firm, medium and medium and short
                        steady. FLoss, irregular, steady to 10 percent decline on short.</p>

                    <p>A BROKEN-DOWN SYSTEM.</p>
                    <p>This is a condition (or disease) to which doctors give many names, but which
                        few of them really understand. It it simply weakness—a break-down, as it
                        were, of the vital forces that sustain the system. No matter what may be its
                        causes (for they are almost numberless), its symptoms are much the same; the
                        more prominent being sleeplessness, sense of prostration or weariness,
                        depression of spirits and want of energy for all the ordinary affairs of
                        life. Now, what alone is absolutely essential in all such cases is increased
                        vitality—vigour--</p>
                    <p>VITAL STRENGTH &amp; ENERGY</p>
                    <p>to throw off these morbid feelings, and experience proves that as night
                        succeeds the day this may be more certainly secured by a course of the
                        celebrated life-reviving tonic</p>
                    <p>THERAPION No.3</p>
                    <p>than by any other known combination. So surely as it is taken in accordance
                        with the printed directions accompanying it, will the shattered health be
                        restored,</p>

                    <p>and a new existence imparted in place of what had so lately seemed worn-out,
                        "used up,” and valueless. This wonderful medicament is purely vegetable and
                        innocuous, is agreeable to the taste —suitable for all constitutions and
                        conditions, in either sex; and it is difficult to imagine a case of disease
                        or derangement, whose main features are those of debility, that will not be
                        speedily and permanently benefited by this never-failing recuperative
                        essence, which is destined to cast into oblivion everything that had
                        preceded it for this wide-spread and numerous class of human ailments.</p>
