                    <p>Trains run alongside the steamers on the quay, and passengers can be conveyed
                        to Famagusta, Nicosia, Morphou and intermediate stations. Good hotel
                        accommodation for tourists is provided at Famagusta, at the Savoy Hotel (Mr.
                        Najem Houry proprietor). Olympus Hotel, Mount Troodos, 6000 ft. above the
                        sea. Magnificent Scenery. Perfect climate. Season May to end of October. For
                        information apply to Mr. Najem Houry, Managing Director of Cyprus Hotel Co.,
                        Army Contractor, Limassol, Cyprus. There is a good carriage road from Kopia
                        (on Railway) to Troodos. At Famagusta may be seen the fine old Latin
                        Cathedral (now a mosque) begun in 1300 and finished in 1312, together with
                        other ancient ruins and the Venetian fortifications, the finest in the
                        world. Also the tower or palace, the scene of "Othello'' and of Ford's
                        "Lover's Melancholy.'' The climate of Cyprus in the winter months is
                        delightful and the Island will well repay a visit.</p>

                            <p>The religions Press and men who see the signs of the times are rather
                                despondent just now with regard to the stagnation of the Churches in
                                England. Recently the "Christian World" declared that "the Churches,
                                as at present organised, are in a backwater. Meantime the tide of
                                the national life rolls irresistibly forward. The question for our
                                religious leaders is as to how far their teaching and method
                                coincide with that movement, or is opposed to it. The future of the
                                Churches depends on the way that question is answered."</p>
                            <p>Referring to Mr. Meyer's recital to the Baptist Union of the
                                experiences gained daring his recent tour amongst the churches of
                                the denominatioD, the same paper says it "was of a somewhat mixed
                                description. It was as full of lights and shadows as an April day.
                                On ths whole, the shadows seemed to predominate. The lack amongst
                                them of commanding personalities such as were seen in the last
                                generation, the waste of energy involved in oreating snch multitudes
                                of small and limited spheres, the pressure of poverty in the
                                chnrches, and the disturbing theological tendencies of the time,
                                were amongst the conditions he noted. They cannot, indeed, escape
                                the attention of any observant mind .</p>
                            <p>"Another fact that, in this oategory, be failed to notice, Beems to
                                us one of the most ominons of all. It is that in a plaos lila>
                                London the whole combined energy of the Baptist chnrches in the
                                Union has resulted in an increase of no more than 200 members. If
                                this, however, be a symptom, it is one that is shared, apparently,
                                by all^the religious bodies. Methodism, with all its costly central
                                missions, has made no advaooe daring the year."Then the "British
                                Weekly," dealing with the Wesleyan Methodist census taken by the
                                "Methodist Recorder," which announces this year a slight decrease,
                                says; — "The decreases are: Full members, 1982; on trial, 6152;
                                junior members, 1989—or, in all, 10,123 fewer names on the class
                                books than twelve months ago. It will be remembered that this
                                decrease follows on large increases, and in all probability it
                                represents the usual reaction from a revival. None the less, it is a
                                grave fact, to be seriously weighed."The "Methodist Times" says : —
                                "It is perhaps not altogether surprising that this year's figures
                                show signs of some reaction. We desire neither to minimise nor to
                                exaggerate their significance. They call for very serious attention.
                                Whatever standpoint be adopted they represent a resnlt
                                incommensurate with the agencies of the Church. When we remember the
                                immense organisations represented by our Sunday-schools, Guilds,
                                Brotherhoods, and the like we ought to receive a Urge and steady
                                increase year by year. Moreover, we ought not only to keep pace with
                                the growth of the popuUtion, but to make great advances in the
                                effective evangelisation of the nation."The English Presbyterian
                                Church reports a membership of 85,775, an increase of only 540, as
                                against an annual average increase of 1558 during the last ten
                                years.The "Christian Commonwealth"declaiw that " The dearth of
                                candidates for ordination in the Church of England, the
                                unsatisfactory calibre of the young men who enter the Nonconformist
                                ministry, the small number of preachers of the Gospel who have a
                                spiritual (not a merely political or social) message that arrests
                                attention, the general decline in attendance at religious worship,
                                to which may be added the high mortality among religious newspapers
                                in both hemispheres in recent years, are a few of many indications
                                of the fact that organised Christianity has for some time past been
                                steadily loeing its hold npon the thinking portion of the nation. Is
                                it not time that Christian preachers took stock of their position,
                                and ascertained precisely where they stand, what they believe, and
                                what they have to offer 1 "The Established Church, says the
                                "Christian World," according to its published returns, has actually
                                gone backward. At a ruridecanal conference at Chulmleigh, and
                                reported by the "Standard," Achdeacon Seymour referred with regret
                                to the fact that chnreh attendance in rural districts was becoming
                                slack, owing to the shortage of Ubour on the farms. Farmers were not
                                able to get as many men as they nsed to years ago, and the result
                                was that they hod to do more work themselves on a Sunday. Mr. Cole,
                                a farmer, said things were rather worse than this. The Ubonrers
                                would not work on Sundays, and it thus became impossible for the
                                farmers to attend church more than once on the Sabbath. This rather
                                suggests the story of the cabman who, when asked by a lady whom he
                                had just pnt down at the church door " How do you spend your Sundays
                                1 " replied—" Driving the likes of yon to church."The Bishop of
                                Stepney sees the need of action. At the London Diocesan Conference a
                                few weeks ago he said:— "Whatever else the last general election
                                showed, it made clear, for weal or woe, that the springs of public
                                life were to be found for the future not in readers of the "Times",
                                but in those of the "Clarion", the vast masses of our working
                                classes, so seldon'heard in such assemblies as this. Not much could
                                be done in helping on the great moral and social questions of the
                                day by sermons or legislation. They wanted a new idea of Church life
                                and corporate responsibility. They must translate into concrete fact
                                in every parish what they had taught in the pulpit They talked much
                                of the rights of the laity, but too few hod an idea of rendering
                                active service in the Church of their baptism. They had thought too
                                much of machinery and too little of the men it was to influence.
                                They wanted the creation of a Demos of the Church. They must appeal
                                to the average manhood of the Church and seek their active service.
                                That was the object of the Church of England Men's Society."Mr.
                                Bernard Shaw is also among the prophets of gloom. Speaking to
                                members of the National Art Collections Fund, in the rooms of the
                                Society of Antiquaries, he declared that "there was, he thought,
                                more general recognition than there had been at almost any time in
                                onr history of the fact that art was really almost the only means of
                                teaching the people. It was becoming conspicuous that the Churches
                                were loeing their hold very largely on congregations, and that the
                                theatre was beginning to compete with them. The aid of art would
                                have to be obtained if the people were to be brought back to the
                                Churches. It was through art that we were going to keep up the
                                really great traditions which alone ooald constitute a really
                                permanent and stable society."</p>

                    <head>POSITION OF FOREIGN DIRECTORS.</head>
                    <p>What is the exact position of a Director of an English Company, who is not a
                        British subject, but who has erred against the statutory regulations of
                        English Company Law 1 This is a question that has recently been asked by
                        many shareholders in English companies in Egypt, and it is one which it is
                        considerably easier to ask than to answer.</p>
                    <p>For example according to English law, a Board of Directors who have
                        authorised the payment of a dividend out of Capital, are personally liable
                        to refund such money to the Company out of their own pockets, and can be
                        compelled by action in the Courts to do so. But suppose this board is
                        composed of two Englishmen and three members who do not ordinarily fall
                        under the British jurisdiction. The Englishmen can undoubtedly be attacked
                        in the English (that is the Consular) Court and will be dealt with there
                        according to English law. But what of their three confreres who have been
                        equally guilty 1 Can they too be summoned and compelled to pay by the
                        British Consul. With the Capitulations still in force such proceedings might
                        give rise to international complications and were the proceedings, as they
                        quite easily might be, of a criminal nature, under the present regime no
                        British Court would have the right to sit in judgment on any save a British
                        subject. The plaintiff or prosecutor, as the case might be, would of course
                        be of British nationality since it would be the company suing in its
                        corporate capacity : and according to the ordinary observances civil suits
                        between people of mixed nationality come before the Mixed Tribunals.</p>
                    <p>What law then would the Mixed Tribunals apply to the contravention of English
                        Statute law.</p>
                    <p>In the Code, by which proceedings in- the Mixed Tribunal are or should be
                        regulated, naturally none of the complicated rules of the English Company
                        Laws find a place but in Article 11 of the Civil Code occurs the following
                        passage. "Where the law is silent insufi- cient or obscure the judge shall
                        follow the principles of natural right and the rules of equity." Now it
                        might easily be contended by the layman at least that at first sight the
                        English Company law does not appear to be a law of natural right or a rule
                        of equity, that is as understood in the French meaning of the word.</p>
                    <p>But on the other hand it might well be argued that the Directors have signed
                        the prospectus in accordance with English law, and have done other acts
                        shewing their willingness to comply with English regulations and in-so doing
                        have held themselves out to have some knowledge of its broader principles.
                        In short should the British Consul refuse to legislate in a case of the sort
                        supposed, and should the matter be brought before the Mixed Tribunals the
                        only reasonable legislation for the Tribunals to adopt appears to be that
                        which the Directors viitually chose for themselves by forming their Company
                        under the "aegis" of English Law.</p>
                    <p>It seems in no way "a natural right or a rule of equity" that a man should
                        obtain all the benefit of such law and at the same time by a local
                        technicality be enabled to rid himself of all his obligations
                        thereunder.</p>

                        go to Kissin- gen, where he will remain six or eight weeks. Before returning
                        to Egypt his Highness will spend another week at Constantinople. According
                        to Reuter's telegram, the Khedive paid a visit yesterday to Sir Nicolas

                    <p>EXTRAORDINARY POLICY.</p>
                    <p>It is to be hoped that the Ministry of the Interior will scrutinise the very
                        curious proceeding at yesterday's meeting of the Alexandria Municipal
                        Commission. The Municipality recently gained a law suit in reference to a
                        claims to some land at Chatby. Yesterday on the proposition of Padoa Bey the
                        commission voted that three thousand pies of land at Chatby should be given
                        to Osman Bey, an official of the Municipality, director of the Tar.zim
                        Service at Alexandria, as a' reward for his services in the law suit. This
                        gift represents a cash value of about £15,000. The land thus given away is
                        public property and is situated at Chatby. Such an extraordinary system of
                        granting away the property of the city to officials of the Municipality
                        solely on the ground that the recipient did his duty deserves to be noted.
                        It should form a very useful precedent for similar grants of public property
                        to the fortunate officials of the Municipality.</p>

                        keen interest and pleasure by the hundreds of youths of all nationalities
                        who reap the benefit of healthful exercise and sound education, so
                        thoroughly well blended in this excellent institution, but by a very large
                        section of our cosmopolitan city, who are fortunate enough to obtain
                        invitation for the occasion.</p>
                    <p>Elaborate arrangements were made to ensure the success of yesterday's "fete
                        des jeux," and over three thousand spectators were comfortably seated in the
                        spacious playground on which special stands were erected for their
                        accommodation. The ground and stands were gaily decorated with garlands and
                        flags.</p>
                    <p>At 4.0 p.m. M. Pierre Girard, Consul General of France, arrived, and the
                        proceedings commenced with the march past. As the long procession of some
                        six hundred boys, smartly dressed in blue jerseys, white knickers, and red
                        sashes, made their appearance headed by the band of the college, and the
                        French and Egyptian flags, a hum of admiration and then a burst of applanse
                        arose from the crowded arena Surely Alexandria might well feel proud of such
                        a display of youthful vigour.</p>
                    <p>The various events were, as usual, an unqualified success, and Mr. Arthur
                        Elmas, the gymnastic instructor of the college, is to be heartily
                        complimented on having brought the boys to such a high standard of
                        perfection. The "mouvements d'ensemble" are worthy of more than passing
                        notice. Mr. Elmas has his pupils well in hand, and their excellent
                        performance of the several interesting drills produced enthusiastic
                        applause.</p>
                    <p>The performances on the horizontal bars and on the parallels showed a great
                        improvement on last year, the triple bar exercises being particularly good,
                        thanks again to Mr. Elmas. The boys conspicuous in gymnastics were O.
                        Giuliotti, C. Malak, L. Barbaza, Z. Simaiker and N. Galioringhi.
                        Unfortunately young Giuliotti was not in his best form yesterday, but he has
                        the making of a first class athlete : his work on the horizontal bar is far
                        beyond that of the average boy amateur. Excellent work was also done by
                        Malak, Barbaza and Sirmaiker.</p>

                        during the afternoon assisted in making it one of the most successful ever
                        held in the college. We tender our congratulations to the good brothers and

                    <p>L'acuite et l'imprlvu de la crise financihre qui s'est abattue sur l'Egypte
                        devaient fored ment imprtSgner nos publioistes de la n&amp;essiW de dlgager
                        et de pr&amp;iser le sens des meaures propres 5 remldier 5 la crise ou
                        writer son retour 5 l'avenir.</p>
                    <p>Vous avez vite fait de montrer dans l'un de vos demiers numd-ros ce qu'avait
                        d'ilfrgale, de trompeuse et de malsaine, la dernihre proposition de ce genre
                        sngg4r4e par un de vos confrere d'Alexandria et qui a vite fait d'accueiUir
                        1'approbation ou les suffrages de nos publicistes s'occupant de finance. On
                        ne sait vraiment qu'admirer le plus de l'extravagance crimi- nelle que
                        rechlent de pareilles meaures si elles 5taient appliqu&amp;a ou de
                        l'ing4nuite et de l'in- conscience avec lesquelles elles sont accueiliies ou
                        propag&amp;s. On ne saurait faire 4 mon avis de plus grand mal 4 la place
                        dans le marasme oh elle se ddbat actuellement, qu'en faisant luire ou
                        miroiter 5 ses yeux ces sortes d'erreurs comme les panaches souveraines
                        devant procurer les remhdea infaillibles 5 la situation.</p>
                    <p>On a d'abord commence par agiter la question de la transformation de la
                        National Bank en Banque d'Etak Cette transformation eat une belle chose.
                        Mais il s'agit de savoir quel est le but 4 poursuivre. Si je ne me trompe,
                        il s'agit d'assurer 4 l'Egypte une circulation mon4taire indlpendante et
                        stable et une somme de numeraire propre qui soit hors de portee ou de la
                        fluctuation des places ytranghres, quelles que soient les circonstances
                        s4vissant sur ces places on la nfltre.</p>
                    <p>Il suffira de remarquer d'abord que si la circulation mon4taire a ety raise 5
                        une rude ypreuve, si elle a subi une trhs forte contraction, contraction
                        incontestable, du fait du dy- faut de l'argent fibre snr la place, le
                        numeraire employ^ ou 4 l'usage de l'Egypte n'a pas snivi Ini, un pareil
                        declin, detenu qu'il est en grande partie dans les coffres des banques. La
                        question en r&amp;ditl est plus haute et se ramhne 5 celle-ci, savoir, qui
                        aura le contrble de l'argent de la Banque et de son emploi 1 Sera-ce
                        l'Egypte ou PE u rope 1 Oq qui dit possession dit contrble et qui dit
                        contrdle dit liberty d'agir. Et comme l'on sait perti- nemment que la pins
                        grande paitie du capital de la National Bank a iti foumie par l'Europe, ou
                        plus exactement par les capitalistes anglais, le contrdle de l'emploi dee
                        capitanx de la Banque fchappera forclment 5 l'Egypte taut que celle-ci
                        nesera pas kmdme de s'en rendre possesseur. Car on ne s'imagine pas les
                        capitalistes anglais acceptant par allhche- ment pour le profit, de r£server
                        l'emploi exclusif de cet argent pour l'Egypte, ou qui plus est, acceptant de
                        le maintenir en circulation sans souci de la situation ftnan- cihre ou
                        commerciale de la place. Us n'abdi- queraient pas leur liberty d'agir du
                        simple fait de la transformation de la National Bank en Banque d'Etat. A la
                        rigueur on pourrait leur imposer de ne pas exporter cet argent qui forme le
                        capital de le#Banque s'ils ne trouvent pas desirable ou opportun pour eux de
                        l'employer 5 mV moment donmS sur la place. Mais quel statut, rhglement on
                        arrgtd serait capable de leur imposer ou de d£cr4ter l'emploi forc4 de cet
                        argent sans contrflle ou liberty absolue de leur park Les Egyptians
                        eux-mfimes ne risqueraient pas leur argent dans une entreprise 4 qui pareil
                        sort serait r4serv4 et Ton voudrait que des capitalistes gangers se mettent
                        aux ordres de l'Egypte. Se figure-ton la Banque d'Etat du Maroc se mettant 4
                        la re morque de la place marocaine au lieu de suivre le mot d'ordre des
                        places europdennes] la Banque d'Etat, je le r&lt;-p5te, ne serait possible
                        telle qu'on la reve ou 4 pen prhs,—- car il reste 5 voir si le sens de
                        solidarity des aotion- naires de cette Banque avec les intyrtts de la place
                        les poussera 5 dyerhter l'emploi continu de leur argent quelles que soient
                        les conditions pryvalant 5 l'intyrieur ou 4 l'extyrieur du pays,—que si
                        l'argent qui forme le capital de la Banque est en majeure partie contrfiiy
                        par l'Egypte. L'acheminement vers la solution du problhme ryside done dans
                        l'afflnence ou l'importance de la participation des capitaux tigyptiens
                        appartenant en propre 4 l'Egypte dans nos institutions financihres ou toutes
                        celles qui se donnent pour objet le dyveloppe- ment et l'exploitation du
                        pays Tel devrait etre le sens dans lequel nos publicistes financiers
                        devraient travailler.</p>

                        et l'assurance qu'a le porteur de savoir que son argent est sous bonne garde
                        et qu'il est realisable sur-le-champ, et Ton va mettre 5 la place des

                        directe- ment 5 sa ruine. On ne guyrit pas une situation yoonomique mauvaise

                        faire marcher nos entreprises, notre commerce et en dernier lien notre

                        et capable* de faire coaler k nouveau ce large torrent d'or en Egypte ? Je
                        ne le crois pas 'et n'entrevois poor ma part que deux moyens connus et

                                in the course of an interview stated that Japan had no idea of
                                considering a new foreign loan. The increase of revenue without
                                increase of taxation proved the renewed prosperity of the coflfctry.
                                The Japanese did not like the recent incidents in San Francisco. If
                                they occured too often they would lead to misunderstandings, but the
                                talk of war was utterly ridiculous. Japan fully trusted the

                                result of the condition of the crops being shown as 72 % by the
                                Bureau, which constitutes a record for July. It is asserted that the

                    <head>DENISHWAI REVIVED.</head>
                    <p>Further to our review of the 29th inst. we extract the following passages
                        from Bernard Shaw's "John Bull's other Island" as examples of the
                        superficialness and immoderate flippancy of his work</p>
                    <p>Not only was there of course no jury at the trial, but considerably less than
                        no defence. Barristers of sufficient standing to make it very undesirable
                        for them tooffend the Occupation were instructed to "defend" the prisoners.
                        Far from defending them they paid high compliments to the Occupation as one
                        of the choicest benefits rained by heaven on their country, and appealed for
                        mercy for their miserable clients, whose conduct has caused the unanimous
                        indignation of all Egyptians. "Clemency" they said "was above equity." The
                        tribunal in delivering judgment remarked that the counsel for the defence
                        had a full hearing, nevertheless the defence broke down completely, and all
                        that their counsel could say on behalf of the prisoners practically amounted
                        to an appeal to the mercy of the Court.</p>
                    <p>Now the proper defence, if put forward, would probably have convinced Lord
                        Cromer that nothing but the burning of the village and the crucifixion of
                        all its inhabitants could preserve the British Empire. That defence was
                        obvious enough : the village was invaded by 5 armed foreigners who attempted
                        for the second time to slaughter the villagers farming stock and carry it
                        off ; in resisting an attempt to disarm them four villagers had been wounded
                        ; the villagers had lost their tempers and knocked the invaders about; and
                        the older men and watchmen had finally rescued the aggressors and sent them
                        back with no worse handling than they would have got anywhere for the like
                        misconduct.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Findlay is another interesting official correspondent of Sir Edward. Even
                        after the trial at which it had been impossible to push the medical evidence
                        further than to say, that the officer who died of sunstroke had been
                        predisposed to it by the knocking about he had suffered, and by his flight
                        under the Egyptian sun, while the officers who had remained defenceless in
                        the hands of the villagers were in court alive and well. Mr. Findlay writes
                        that the four hanged men were convicted of a brutal and premeditated murder
                        and complains that the native press disregards the fact, and is being
                        conducted with such an absolute disregard for truth as to make it evident
                        that large sums of money have been expended. Mr Findlay is also a bit of a
                        philosopher.The Egyptian being a fatalist, he says, does not greatly fear
                        death, and there is therefore much to be said for flogging as a judicial
                        punishment in Egypt. Logically, then the four lianged men ought to have been
                        flogged instead. But Mr. Findlay does not draw that conclusion. Logic is not
                        his strong point: he is a man of feeling, and a very nervous one at that. "I
                        do not believe that this brutal attack on British officers had anything
                        directly to do with political animosity." </p>
                    <p>It is however due to the insubordinate spirit which has been sedulously
                        fostered daring the last year by unscrupulous and in<cb n="3"/>terested
                        agitators. Again it is my duty to warn you of "the deplorable effect which
                        is been produced in Egypt by the fact that metnbers of parliament have
                        seriously called in question the unanimous sentence passed by a legally
                        constituted court, of which the best English and the best native judges were
                        members.</p>
                    <p>This fact will moreover supply the lever which has, up to the present been
                        lacking to the venal agitator who are at the head of the so-called patriotic
                        party." I find Mr. Findlay irresistible, so exquisitely does he give us the
                        measure and flavor of officialism. A few days after the Denshawai affray
                        some natives stoned and severely injured an irrigation inspector. Two days
                        ago three natives knocked a soldier off his donkey and kicked him in the
                        stomach: his injuries are serious. In the latter case theft appears to have
                        been the motive. </p>
                    <p>My object in mentioning these instances is to show the results to be expected
                        if once respect for the law is shaken. Should the present state of things
                        continue, and still more, should the agitation in this country find support
                        at home, the date is not far distant when the necessity, will arise for
                        bringing in a press law and for considerably increasing the army
                        ofOccupation. Just think of it! In a population of nearly 10 millions, one
                        irrigation inspector is stoned. The Denshawai executions are then carried
                        out to make the law respected. </p>
                    <p>The result is that three natives knock a soldier off his donkey and rob him.
                        Thereupon Mr. Findlay, appalled at the bankruptcy of civilization, sees
                        nothing for it now but suppression of the native newspapers and a
                        considerable increase in the army of Occupation, and Lord Cromer writes "all
                        I need say is that I concur generally in Mr. Findlay's remarks, and that,
                        had I remained in Egypt, I should in every respect have adopted the same
                        course as that which he pursued."</p>
                    <p>In any case let no Englishman who is content to leave Abdel Nebi and his
                        twenty year old neighbour in penal servitude for life, and to plume himself
                        on the power to do it,pretend to be fit to govern either my country or his
                        own. The responsibility cannot be confined to the tribunal and to the
                        demoralized officials of the Occupation.</p>
                    <p>The House of Commons had 24 hours clear notice, with the telegraph under the
                        hand of Sir Edward Grey, to enable it to declare that England was a
                        civilized power and would not stand these barbarous lashings and vindictive
                        hangings. Yet Mr. Dillon, representing the Irish party, which well knows
                        what British Occupations and Findlay loyalism mean, protested in vain.</p>
                    <p>Sir Edward on behalf of the new liberal Government (still simihering with
                        virtuous indignation at the flogging of Chinamen and the military executions
                        in South Africa in the forced presence of the victims under the late
                        Imperialist Government, not only permitted and defended the Denshawai
                        executions, but appealed to the House almost passionately not to criticise
                        or repudiate them on the ground- how incredible it now appears—that Abdel-
                        Nebi and Hassan Mahfouz and Darweesh and the rest were the fuglemen of a
                        gigantic Moslem plot to rise against Christendom in the name of the prophet*
                        and sweep Christendom out of Africa and Asia by a colossal second edition of
                        the Indian Mutiny. That this idiotic romance, gross and ridiculous as the
                        lies of Falstaff, should have imposed on any intelligent and politically
                        experienced human being is strange enough—though the secret shame of
                        revolted humanity will make cabinet ministers snatch at fantastic excuses—
                        but what humanity will not forgive our foreign secretary for, is his failure
                        to see that even if such a conspiracy really existed, England should have
                        faced it and fought it bravely by honorable means, instead of wildly lashing
                        and strangling a handful of poor peasants to scare Islam into terrified
                        submission. Were I abject enough to giant to Sir Edward Grey, as valid, that
                        main asset of thinking Imperially" the conviction that we are all going to
                        be murdered, I should still suggest to him that we can at least die like
                        gentlemen ? might 1 even be so personal as to say that the reason for giving
                        him a social position and political opportunities that are denied to his
                        tradesmen is that he is supposed to understand better than they that honour
                        is worth its danger and its cost, and that life is worthless without honor?
                        It is true that Sir John Falstaff did not think so ; but Sir John is hardly
                        a model for Sir Edward. Yet even Sir John would have had enough gumption to
                        see that the Denshawai panic was more dangerous to the Empire than the loss
                        of ten pitched battles.</p>

                        <p>The anticipation that Egypt would require more gold has proved correct,
                            and this week £175,000 has left the Bank for Alexandria. With the
                            gradual improvement in the financial position on your side, however, the
                            fear of further heavy withdrawals becomes more remote, until the cotton
                            demand is on us.</p>
                        <p>Gold is again being exported from America, but France has proved a very
                            successful competitor for the bulk of this. This is due to the shrewd
                            policy adopted by our neighbours of making advances during transit free
                            of interest. The Bank ot England took a leaf out of the French book, and
                            pursued this policy for a few days, and as a result managed to secure
                            about £350,000, but on their cancelling offers to make advances, all
                            subsequent engagement of gold was directed to Paris.</p>
                        <p>Yesterday the sum of £500,000 in Indian gold was released at the Bank and
                            added to the general reserve. This announcement caused an easing off in
                            the discount market, and three months' fine bills, after being 3 j,
                            relapsed to 3$.</p>
                        <p>This week a large amount of cash has gone into the country to meet
                            quarter-day requirements, but the net influx from abroad of £229,000 has
                            somewhat counterbalanced this demand, with the result that the stock of
                            coin and bullion only shows a shrinkage of £124,000. On the other hand
                            the note circulation has expanded to the extent of £390,000, and the

                        <p>It is a wise saying that it is never safe to prophesy until you know, and
                            this is especially true of the stock markets. In these panicky times the
                            movements of shares are so easily influenced, that one can never tell
                            what a day will bring forth. Allowing the necessity for caution,
                            however, it is no exaggeration to say that the atmosphere of the Stock
                            Exchange during tho past week is a good augury for the future, and the
                            opinion we expressed last week that the end of the long lane of
                            depression had been almost reached has been fully justified. The failure
                            of the Cassa di Sconto was looked upon as the climax of the trouble in
                            Egypt, and the steady improvement in prices of Egyptian securities
                            during the past few days has been gratifying evidence of a returning
                            spirit of confidence. When it is mentioned that National Bank shares
                            have been as low as 16 and closed last night at 20$, it will be seen
                            that the improvement has been real.</p>
                        <p>Those far-seeing investors who came in when prices were at rock-bottom
                            levels are already finding themselves rewarded for their confidence in
                            the future of these shares. As we have previously hinted "one never
                            knows" but all the signs point to a continued improvement all-round.</p>
                        <p>Markets generally have been much firmer this week, though inclined to be
                            rather irregular. A very good impression was created by the announcement
                            of Mr. Asquith that the Government had no intention of bringing forward
                            the new Transvaal loan during the present financial year. In view of the
                            very depressed state in which the market for gilt- edged stock has been
                            for some months, this is a wise decision.</p>

                        <p>The market for gilt-edged stocks is now much firmer, and the liquidation
                            in Consols has been effectively checked by the Government's announcement
                            regarding the South African loan. Yesterday the premier security plosed
                            an $ higher for the account at 84, 9/16, after being 11/16. To-day they

                        <p>The improvement in the gilt-edged section has had a favourable influence
                            on home rail way shares, which have been much in favour. Another very
                            good point is the fact that the dividend announcements are now imminent,
                            and it is confidently expected that in many cases these will be very
                            satisfactory. With this prospect before them, the shares certainly<cb n="5"/> seem
                            very cheap at present prices. The railway employees have had the good
                            sense not to force a strike at this juncture, and it is now hoped that
                            the differences may be settled without such a misfortune occurring.
                            Yesterday a feature was the strength of Metropolitans, which advanced 2
                            £ to 44 J. North Easterns and Great Easterns were also favoured, and
                            improved $, while Midland Deferred were $ better. The market has further
                            advanced to-day, the heavies having been very firm.</p>

                            as a bear influence, the effect was just the opposite, the leading
                            brokers here looking upon this as marking the end of the crisis.
                            Quotations for the best shares quickly iallied, and the rise has
