                    <head>JUVENILE CRIMINALS.</head>
                    <p>Coles Pasha’s latest report contains much more detailed information regarding
                        juvenile criminals than has previously been given. It appears that 2,461
                        boys got into trouble for contraventions last year of whom about half were
                        whipped, and the rest imprisoned. They were for tho most part not Arab
                        "hoolig- gans," but little shoeblacks without their badges, or were guilty
                        of the heinous crime of leading about blind beggars in forbidden quarters.
                        'Assault’ is a term as often as not applied to a street son file or
                        squabble, and most of the little thieves appear to be first offenders. It
                        really seems that the police of some towns in Egypt devote an amount of
                        attention to the exploits of small boys that is not just- ified by their
                        criminality, The Cairo police- man of course makes the largest haul, but it
                        is curious that comparatively small towns like Itai el Barood, Deshna, and
                        Diknrni. should produce l42,69 and 51 oases of juvenile crimin- ality
                        respectively, while Mansonrah only boast. 34, and the large town of Mehalla
                        el Kubra 15.</p>
                    <p>The Ministry of Justice has established a “Joveaile Court" in Ciin bifi.-j
                        whuh an y youthful offndiri appear. Ai Ctlas t'aifu points oat, tin fait
                        that the Goirt sita only onoeaweak is nit calcilatjl to j iitify tbs

                        seventy of the punishment is esiased by its brevi y When yon keep, say, a
                        badge lees bootblack f ir five days in gaol and then whip him— a sturdy
                        shawish inflating the penalty—there is nothing to oonnterbalanoe the pain,
                        which is bat the oalmination of an nnpleasant experience. It seems to m that
                        imprisoning your jnvenile offender first, and than inflicting a fresh pun
                        ishment (whioh is supposed to take the plaos ol imprisonment) on tbe
                        nnfortanate little wretffi is a needless piece of oxaelty. Coles Pasha
                        suggests that a special bureau dealing with jnvenile offenders should be
                        organised, and a single member of the Parquet appointed to reoeive daily
                        reports of oass of offenoes by children, and the number of children awaiting
                        trial in prieon throughout the ooontry. Snob a measure would check tbe
                        excessive zeal of the type of shawish, who is ready enough to blackmail an
                        arbaghi, or to pounoe upon an annoying boot-black, but will not stop a
                        ‘oarro’ manned by a sturdy carter, from backlog onto the pavement, or bestir
                        himself after midnight to silence a roaring band of festive Berberins, wfcld
                        prevent oarelessness cm the part of the Parquet, and would in a great
                        measure remove the class of juveniles awaiting trial from the prisons. Bat
                        whst is most required is a law providing for waifs an i strays. Gnat as is
                        the charity of the Moslem poor, then an nambers of homeless little vagabonds
                        who live—for no one will ever die of banger in Egypt—bat learn nothing and
                        grow up nnder conditions that an bound to foster criminal tendencies.</p>

                    <head>LANCASHIRE'S COMING TROUBLE.</head>
                    <p>Judging from the despondent tone of the leading Lancashin papers, it appears
                        only too likely that the cotton industry may be largely paralysed within a
                        fortnight. As usual the cause is a suicidal quarrel between capital and
                        labour, the operatives demanding a 5 per cent addition to the wage rate all
                        round, while their employers contend that the present condition of business
                        does not warrant any augmentation. This would look to be precisely the sort
                        of issue suitable for arbitration, bat on neither side is any desire
                        expressed for that method of settlement. Among the men, a suspicion exists
                        that many of their employers would be rather glad than sorry to limit
                        output, as the best way of connteraoting the renewed efforts of the American
                        ring to create a speculative corner in the raw materiaL Its price has been
                        lately poshed op almost to prohibitive level by those gamblers, and on the
                        last occasion of the sort, it was found that the best remedy was the
                        limitation of manufacturing produc tion. The Lancashire mill owners also
                        contend that the moderate profits they are now making go bat a little way
                        towards wiping oat the enormous losses they suffered daring the cotton
                        famine. The operatives urge,on the other hand, that they suffered even more
                        through the loss of wages. Without weighing these conflicting arguments in
                        comparative scales, we cannot too vehemently recommend both parties to
                        accept arbitration, sooner than embark in hostilities beneficial only to
                        their foreign com petitors, and absolutely ruinous to the great British
                        industry on whose prosperity their own wholly depends.</p>
