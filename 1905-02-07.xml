                    <head>PORT ARTHUR.</head>
                    <p>The fall of Port Arthur brings to a close the first greet phase of the war in
                        the Par East, a phase that has been prolonged beyond all calculations by
                        Stoessel’s obstinate and heroic resistance. The temptation to moralise is
                        almost irresistible. The ignomi- nious end of the great squadron of the
                        Pacific, the gradual crumbling of tho almost im- pregnable fortifications
                        are in themselves both a sermon on the vanity of human wishes, and an
                        illustration of what foresight and organisation can achieve when united to
                        discipline, to oourage, and to patriotism. But the practical and strategical
                        lemons to be learnednom this long siege ere of even greater interest to us
                        as a maritime Power, and they deserve to be studied the more caretully be-
                        cause of th' erroneous deductions to which the catastrophe of Port Arthur
                        may give rise. Because the valour of the Kussian soldiers sad sailors has
                        been in vain, and because the Russian Empire has suffered a humiliation to
                        which the capture of Sebastopol was as nothing, it has been suggested by
                        some authorities, end especially by the military correspondent of the Times,
                        that fortifications are themselves a delusion and a snare, that the harbour
                        of Port Arthur has been like a fatal magnet to the ships of the squadron,
                        and that Kuropstkin should have begun his campaign by withdraw- ing every
                        man and every movable gun from the Liao-tang Peninsula. In other words, Port
                        Arthur is claimed to have been what Metz actually was, and what Ladysmith
                        nearly became—a fatal entanglement, engulfing its own garrison, and finally
                        compromising the forces outside of it by robbing them of the power of
                        initiative. Had Stdessel got the gar- rison away while the railway was
                        unout, had Stark or Makaroff sailed off with the remnants of their fleet,
                        the abandonment of Port Arthur itself; the enormous lost ot material, and
                        the blow to Russian prestige, would have been more than compensated for by
                        the freedom which it would have given to Kuropatkin from his first arrival
                        on the scene.</p>
                    <p>Such an inference and such a teaching are, in our judgment, not only wrong,
                        but highly dangerous, as tending to discredit the value of naval bases end
                        garrisons to a maritime Power alike in peace and in war. They ignore the
                        faot that the misfortunes of the Russian Fleet have been due solely and
                        entirely to its own in- efficiency and to the incapacity of those who
                        directed its movements. The ruin dates from the first night of the war, when
                        the Japanese torpedo-boats were allowed to work their will, end it was
                        oompleted by the reluotanoe and inability of the blockaded squadron to give
                        battle to the adversary in open water. If the Russian Fleet had been bandied
                        as the fleet of a first-class Power ought to be, and as every country has a
                        right to expect from its naval officers, Port Arthur would have been an
                        absolutely invaluable asset to Russia during the war, and the march of the
                        Japanese armies on Manchuria would have been definitely delayed. A glance at
                        the map shows that Port Arthur is an ideal “point d’appui" for any nation at
                        war with Japan; and its importance can best be realised by the pro- digious
                        sacrifices which the latter Power has undergone during the process of
                        reducing it. Nor does it seem to be realised how much the prolongation of
                        the siege has actually affected the course of the campaign ; to say nothing
                        of the fearful loss of men, which will be felt more and more as the war
                        drags, it deprived the Japanese of the superiority in numbers which would
                        have turned the battle of Liao-yang into another Leipaic. And it has so
                        absolutely absorbed the energies of Admiral Togo that he has been unable-to
                        spare a single ship from his fleet of observation, even when the cruisers of
                        Skrydloff were ravaging in the home waters of Japan. Had the Baltic Fleet
                        been able to sail in the early summer, as Captain Mahan anticipated, the
                        Japanese com- mander would have found himself in the presence of a dilemma
                        which might well have proved fatal.</p>
                    <p>Indeed, the supreme importance of a well- fortified and well-garrisoned naval
                        base has never been so dearly indicated, unless we go beck to the siege of
                        Gibraltar in 1779-83. And the conclusion to ourselves ought to be
                        irresistible. Our own naval bases, to say nothing of minor ooaling stations,
                        are scattered over every see, and their retention at all ooists is the prioe
                        of our existence as a naval Power. Gibraltar, Malta, Siqaimanlt, Halifax,
                        Ber- muda, Singapore, Houg Kong, not to mention others, have each their own
                        port to play in any scheme of Imperial defence. They do not all require the
                        same sort of protection. Ber- muda, for instanoe, surrounded by its shoal
                        water, and guarded by its mine-fields, needs a garrison rather then big
                        guns. Halifax, with its rampart of the Atlantic surges, is practio- ally
                        immune from a torpedo flotilla. But they all have to be defended, if we are
                        to retain the power of sending our fleets securely from one part of the
                        globe to another, and it is essential that, one and all, they must be able
                        to guard themselves and their priceless stores of coal and material without
                        dependence on the Fleet.</p>

                        The papers are angrily demanding an explanation. Some of them declare that
                        Germany will now Work with redoubled energy in order to increase her sea
                        power.</p>

                        and that what he said was that we must assume all naval powers to be
                        possible enemies. Owing to the growth of. such naval powers, our possible
                        enemies are more numerous than hitherto, and, consequently, we have to keep
                        an anxious eye not only on the Medi- terranean but also on the North Sea.

                    <p><persName>Lord Cromer's</persName> speech here yesterday has made a very good
                        impression, and his strongly- worded criticism on the growth of drinking
                        habits has been taken to heart. Many of the omdehs who were among Lord
                        Cromer’s au- dience, were so impressed that they have told me that they
                        intend to petition the Govern- ment against the manner in which liquor shops
                        are being opened everywhere in the villages without let or hindance. I
                        intend to found a local society hero to combat the alcohofic habit among the
                        natives. Lord and Lady Cromer and <persName>Lady Betrice Thynne</persName>
                        paid a visit to one of the native kuttabs hero which is under the care of
                        the Ministry of Public Instruction They also visited the native

                    <head>A CASE FOR ENQUIRY.</head>
                    <p>A cairo correspondent writes:- to the west of Abdeen-square is a nasty
                        quarter where few sanitary and moral laws are enforced and where the
                        grossest criminality prevails. While in that locality today I learned that
                        in a quarrel between an armenian and three natives the armenian was so badly
                        beaten that he, after a week or more, died, and nothing has been done to
                        assailate or murderers. In fact, the principal was pointed out to me, and i
                        was informed that a seargant of police was bribed to strike this mans name
                        off the book for they all were arrested at the time of the quarrel. I wish
                        this matter to be inquired into, for it is a most gross outrage if it is
                        true as i am led to believe it is.</p>

                    <p><persName>Professor Felix's</persName> concert took place at the Khedivial
                        Hotel on Saturday night as an- nounced, and considering the wet and tem-
                        pestous weather, was well attended. We must congratulate the professor on
                        his courage in fixing a more modest price for the tickets than is customary
                        here for local artists, who ex- pect their kind friends to pay the same
                        price for the pleasure of bearing them perform as they would do for
                        distinguished artistes from Europe who can command audiences without the
                        disagreeable touting system in vogue in this country. Mr. Felix's selection
                        of piece was as it ought to have been, a happy one, as his silvery touch was
                        shown off to perfection in most of them. If there was one piece more than
                        another that elicited enthusiastic applause we might pick out an exquisite
                        Nocturne of Chopin's (Opus 15 No. 2), in which an oft-recurring melody
                        framed in flow mg cadenzas brought ont the pianist's remark able agility of
                        finger. Wagner’s "Choeur des Fileuses” from his "Vaissean Fantome” arranged
                        by Lizt, was also much appreciated. Mr. Felix's wonderfully delicate touch
                        is not so well suited to the heavier German music, which requires greater
                        breadth of tone and a deeper sentiment. To our mind his conception of
                        Mendelssohn’s "Fruhlings Lied” was quite incorrect and far removed from the
                        traditional one as taught in German Conaervatories,but on the other hand,
                        the Duo by the same com- poser was faultlessly played. Professor Felix was
                        ably supported by Mrs. Frederick Cree, who sang, first, a romance by
                        Giordano from Andrea Chenier with great refinement, and in the socond part
                        Beetho- ven's famous “Per Pieta.” Her passionate rendering of the presto,
                        “Ah crudel I” quite carried away her audience, and on being encored she
                        repeated it with even more verve than the first time. We must not omit the
                        lovely little duet by Missa, “Les Roseaux Chanteurs," charmingly suug by
                        Mrs. Cree and Mme. Felix, nor the instrumental trio performed very ably by
                        Mr. H. and Mr. L. Suzan accom panied by Mr. Felix. Altogether a very plea-
                        sant concert, but we must suggest that another time the pauses between the
                        items should be curtailed, and that a performer does not ussually retire
                        from the platform between two pieces bracketed a and b. All praise to

                        obtained from the Sudan Government Railways The "Sealark" after surveying
                        here and at Sheikh Barghout, will probably go into dock and then continue
                        her survey as far as Australia, which is her final destination. The British

                    <p>The Khedlvial Opera House reasserted itself in La Totea. The performance was
                        in every way excellent. <persName>Signora Pandolfini</persName> obtain- ed
                        and justified the welcome due to an old Cairo favorite both by her singing
                        and by her acting. <persName>Signor Girand</persName> was pleasing and
                        artistic, and Signor Polese was conspicuous for the excellence of his
                        acting; we could wish: that all opera singers would give as much attention
                        to details. "II Sagrestano" was amusing ; and we should like to hear more of
                        Sig- nor Sala, the “timbre" of whose voice has some charm. Staging and
                        choris were alike all that could be desired. We trust that other
                        performances will maintain this level, and do away with the undoubtedly bad
                        impression caused by Rigoletto (amongst Other pieces given). We would say
                        one word as to the orchestra. Though, it is certainly composed of good
                        musicians and directed by an efficient oonductor, there is often apparent a
                        certain want of judgment, which might well be remedied, a lack of complete
                        harmony with the singers, This, in light opera, where the melodies for the
                        chief performers are the most prominent part, may not be so harmful in
                        effect: but it is fatal in any such opera as Tristan, or indeed in any piece
                        where the composer has devoted his attention to the music and not only to
                        these who execute it In a word, we would wish to find (and we-have a right
                        to expect) that sense of ensemble which it is the duty, as it should be the
                        pleasure, of the Khedlvial Opera Honse to</p>

                    <p><persName>Signora Isabella Sricher</persName>, the celebrated operatic
                        artiste, who created such a furore at the Verdi Theatre in Cairo, and whose
                        advent bad been anxiously awaited by a large section of the music-loving
                        public, made her debut at the Abbas helmy Theatre on Satdrday Even- ing in
                        Lucia di Lammermoor, and her magni- ficent performance reached to the full
                        the highest expectations which had been formed regarding her. To say that
                        Signora Svicher was admirable or excellent, would be but to very mildly
                        express the quality of her per formapoe, from every point of view. Indeed,
                        we venture to say that never has Egypt before been honored by the presence
                        of two such magnificent artistes as Signs. Gemma Bellin- cioni and Sigus.
                        Isabella Sricher, and from the rapturous applause so lavishly bestowed by
                        enthusiastic and delighted audiences on each of these accomplished ladies,
                        it is certain that the season will be a successful one. Signa. Svicher's
                        Lucia, on Saturday, was an inter- pretation such as is seldom seen. Her
                        singing was certainly a revelation to many present, and herr acting was of a
                        high order and showed careful study of this mobt difficult rfllo. The tenor,
                        Signor Tomiaaui being unwell, the role of Sir Edgard was sustained by Signor
                        Pagani, who scored a distinct success. In fact, we think we have never heard
                        Signor Pagani to better advantage. Signor Baldelli, in the small part of
                        Raimondo, was excellent. The other minor parts were in good hands and the
                        orchestra and chorus were fully up to their usual standard.</p>

                    <head>ANDREA CHENIER.</head>
                    <p>An admirable performance of Giordano’s Andrea Chenier was given on Sunday
                        night. <persName>Signor Pagani</persName> was in splendid voice and gave an
                        excellent interpretation of the exceedingly trying title role. He was the
                        success of the evening. <persName>Signora D. Bassich</persName>, who made
                        her debut on this oocasion, gave a fairly good rendering of the part of
                        Maddalens di.'Coigny, but her voice is not robust enough to stand her in
                        good steed in an opera like Andrea Chenier. As Carlo Gerard, the baritone
                        Badini, who possesses a voice of delightful freshness, was eminently
                        successful. <persName>Sig. Montanari</persName> also scored a distinct
                        success.</p>

                    <head>RIGOLETTO</head>
                    <p>Last night, a very excellent performance of Rigoletto was given at the Abhas
                        Theatre. Excellent, we say, because in every respect the “ensemble” was a
                        matter for admiration and, at times, even for Surprise. In Rigoletto Verdi
                        began to realise in a way which he hitherto had not surmised, the important
                        and extensive powers of his mind Up to this point he had written many tunes
                        which had been hummed and sung throughout the whole world, but here he
                        seemed to forego the enormous spirit of tune that was within him, and to
                        give himself up entirely to the dramatic matter in hand. Last night's per
                        formance of the opera was eminently successful. Signora Svicher, in the part
                        of Gilda, was from every point of view a very great success ; her voice,
                        which possesses some of the most exquisite qualities of modern vocalisation,
                        was proved on this oocasion to possess an exquisite and, if one may use the
                        adjective in connection with singing, a shining quality that impressed one
                        enormously, by reason of the absolute purity of its evocation. Her range is
                        enormous; she never misses her effects, and, to sum up, we regard her in no
                        other light than that she is dazzlingly brilliant She was frantically
                        applauded, especially after her delightful rendering of “Caro noms,” which
                        she was obliged to repeat Sig. Tomisani took the part of the Duke and
                        enchanted everybody by the magnificence of his singing. He is a tenor of
                        great power, and was in good form last night, enthusiasm on the part of the
                        audience following everything he did. It stands to reason therefore that his
                        rendering of "La Donna e mobile” waa triumphantly successful. In the part of
                        Rigoletto Signor Badini sang excellently, though he did not impress us very
                        much with his acting. The other parts were in good hands. The chorus was at
                        times disappointing, but on the whole good, while the orchestra deserves
                        credit. Tomorrow night, Signore Ballincioni will appear in Fedora</p>
