                    <p>Paris, June 21. It is stated that M. Rouvier will very shortly hand Prince
                        von Radolin the note indicating the conditions under which he would accept
                        the conference, pointing out however that it is impossible to question the
                        rights accorded to France by the agreement with Spain and England;

                    <p>Stockholm, June 20. The Riksdag has been opened. The Government has
                        introduced a bill asking for authority to enter into negotiations with the
                        Norwegian Storthing to draw up a conditional settlement in the event of
                        separation. The Premier stated that Sweden had no interest in resorting to
                        coercion, and would therefore rather consent to negotiate for a dissolution
                        of the union. (R.)</p>

                        <p>One of our native contemporaries states that on the 9th inst. the omdeh
                            of Dishna, Keneh pro vince, while making his rounds, heard a
                            consi-derable amount of noise in the caracol. Looking in he found a
                            woman and some policemen carousing, and naturally expressed his opinion
                            of their conduct. The shawishes promptly dragged him into the caracol
                            and beat him. The officer in charge, hearing the omdeh’s cries, came to
                            his rescue, but had to wait twenty minutes before the policemen opened
                            the door, and meantime they pummelled the unfortunate omdeh to their
                            heart’s content. The officer, on entering, immediately put them under
                            arrest. They refused to listen to him, and used such violent and
                            insulting language that the officer sent to the moudir, who dispatched

                    <p>At the informal reception held by the King in the quadrangle of Windsor
                        Castle on Wednesday last, of various guests staying at the Castle, his
                        Highness the Khedive was a conspicuous figure in the group standing by the
                        side of the King, whose Ministers were represented by the Premier and the
                        Marquis of Lansdowne, Secretary of State for. Foreign Affairs. The Khedive
                        spent some time in conversation with Mr. Balfour and Lord Lana-downe. The
                        King and Queen afterwards went for a short drive in the Park with the Grand
                        Duchess of Baden, while Prince Arthur of Connaught accompanied the Khedive
                        to the Royal Mausoleum at Frogmore, where his Highness laid a wreath on the
                        tomb of Queen Victoria.</p>
                    <p>The Paris correspondent of the “Globe" says Abbas II., Khedive of Egypt, had
                        a pleasanter time in Paris incognito than it he had come here as a Chief of
                        State. Patting up at a quiet hotel near the Arc de Triomphe, he led during
                        his short visit the life of an ordinary traveller. Every morning, dressed in
                        an ordinary tourist suit, and wearing a bowler hat, he rode in the Bois do
                        Boulogne in his autom b le, or sauntered on foot along the gay boulevards.
                        He took his meals at a restaurant near the Champs Elysees, where the waiters
                        were far from suspecting whom they had to serve. His evenings were spent
                        either at the theatres or at the more select music-halls. Few knew him, and
                        those who did pretended not to, which amounts to the same thing. About the
                        only visit paid by him was to the Turkish Embassy, where he had a long
                        interview with Munir Pasha. How Alfonso XIII; would have liked such a quiet,
                        enjoyable time)</p>

                        Rickmers,” which ran ashore last Thursday near Ras Garib lighthouse, in the
                        Suez Gulf, was successfully refloated with the assistance of the Khedivial
                        Mail liner “Rahmanieh,” after having discharged part of her cargo of rice.
                        Both steamers arrived at Suez at 6 o’clock yesterday afternoon, and the
                        former will take in the cargo she discharged in due course. The damages the
                        “Helen Rickmers” sustained, if any, are not yet ascertained.</p>

                    <p>Those who have an opportunity of leaving Egypt during the warm summer months,
                        should especially remember that from Trieste hey may reach the centre of the
                        Austrian Alps within a few hours’ railway journey. There is no doubt that
                        the air in the mountain districts of Styria Corinthia, Tyrol, and up to the
                        Semmering, near Vienna, is most remarkable, invigorating, and health-giving,
                        and many constitutions, which have broken down during the sojourn in
                        tropical countries, have completely recovered strength and health during
                        even a few weeks’ stay in the Alps. The Paster Valley may especially be
                        recommended, as also the Ampezzo opening up from Toblach. Cortina is an
                        extremely popular place amongst English people, and thence the ridge is
                        easily reached, as also the Brenner railway, which takes the traveller in a
                        few hours over the Brenner pass into the Inn valley, and to the Tyrolese
                        capital, Innsbruck, one of the finest centres for excursions imaginable, or
                        else to Saltzburg, which is especially renowned for its idyllic scenery and
                        its lovely waterfalls. Hotel accommodation at moderate charges is everywhere
                        excellent.</p>

                    <head>ON THE HEDJAZ RAILWAY.</head>
                    <byline>BY P.P.G.</byline>
                    <p>Directly south of Damascus the line passed through orchards and green
                        cornfields bearing a good crop and well watered by irrigation channels. To
                        the eastward the flatness of the land and the intense cultivation recalled
                        the Sharkieh province, but a glance to the west dispelled the illusion
                        instantly for there were the southern spurs of the Anti-Lebanon, sandy grey
                        with patches of snow on Jebel Shekif and all the higher summits, and
                        southward again and farther from the line rose the colossal ridge of Hermon,
                        its lower half yellow in the sunlight and mottled with the dark shadows of
                        ravines and gullies, its upper half still snow-covered, flecked here and
                        there with brown rooks and saw-backed ridges on which the snow had melted or
                        fallen into the preci-pitous glens beneath. For a time the white of Jebel
                        “Sannin was visible in a gap between the Anti-Lebanon and the isolated mass
                        of Hermon, and all day long Hermon remained visible, ever growing smaller
                        and whiter as the train drove southward.</p>
                    <p>After a while the orchards and corn-land gave place to stony ground bearing a
                        poor barley crop and abundance of thistles. High rounded hills rose steeply
                        from the plain, bare, treeless and lifeless but for a herd or two of goats)
                        and the railway curving to the S.E. on a steep gradient followed the winding
                        course of a valley between two of the highest hills. The rails had worn
                        badly here and the bumping was terrific : the heat was trying, and to crown
                        our discomfort certain animals, of which we thought this carriage at least
                        was free, issued from their lairs, bit the commissioners, and were slain for
                        their temerity. Happily no more appeared and Raif Pasha suggested lunch. His
                        orderlies displayed considerable activity for a quarter of an hour and then
                        we ate with considerable appetite, considering how early it was. The dishes
                        were all excellent and Oriental, and a plateful of a sort of “Marzipan,”
                        which I was assured was of Albanian origin, terminated our meal very
                        pleasantly. After lunch conversation became animated and the Koweit question
                        came up, among others, for general discussion. But the conversation was
                        suddenly switched off for an instant to continue in Turkish for a time,
                        after which the Marshal and Mr. Meissner discussed European and Asiatic
                        systems of marriage from a most philosophic standpoint.</p>
                    <p>The hills of the Jebel Iswid were soon left behind and the tract through
                        which the line passed became more and more fertile. At one little wayside
                        station a ragged Indian appeared and begged for “roti” (bread) and did not
                        seem at all content when one of the Pasha’s A. D. C.’s gave him a beshlik
                        and three or four metallics. No one seemed to know what he was doing in
                        Syria, nor, I think, did he know himself, for he looked half-witted. We left
                        him standing on the track waving his arms at the train.</p>
                    <p>By this time we were well in the Hauran and I was amazed at the fertility of
                        the country. The wheat and barley grew everywhere in great unfenced fields.
                        The crop seemed thoroughly healthy, large in the ear and without a sign of
                        disease. Houses and villages seemed few and far between, but I was told that
                        in a few weeks’ time the plain would be full of people at work harvesting
                        the corn.</p>

                        "Missir” got on a reef just outside Suakin on the 10th inst. The Governor of
                        Suakin, on being apprised of the fact, immediately ordered the Port tug
                        steamer "Hawk” and several sambouks to go to her assistance and bring in all
                        the passengers. This was done, and the "Missir" remain ed for two days
                        endeavouring to get off. *She at last succeeded with the aid of the ‘Hawk’
                        (Captain Tagliaferro, late of the Khedivia Mail Co.) and entered Suakin
                        harbour on the 12th inst.</p>

                    <p>(From a Correspondent). Jerusalem, June 19. Mr. Haydn Righton, the organist
                        and director of the music at St George’s Collegiste Church, gave his second
                        organ recital on the 13th instant. The programme provided was a varied and
                        interesting one, and included works by Handel, Bach, Mendelssohn, Chopin,
                        and Wagner. The features of the programme were Mendelssohn’s Second Organ
                        Sonata, Handel's First Organ Concerto, and Bach’s Prelude and Fugue in A
                        major. These Were admirably played and demonstrated fully the capabilities
                        of the new organ. Batiste's popular Andante in G, and a Communion in F by
                        Jules Grison (in which the softer stops of the instrument were heard to
                        advantage), were charmingly given. In the course of the programme, Master
                        Abdallah Jamal sang "The Chorister" (Sullivan)and “But Thou didst not leave”
                        (Handel). Wagner’s grand march from “Tannhauser” brought a successful
                        recital to a close.</p>

                    <head>EGYTIAN SHARE MARKET.</head>
                    <p>(From Our Financial Correspondent), London, 16. “The watched pot never boils
                        old adage. Never is a long time and there are distinct signs this morning
                        that the pot containing on the fire and though nothing definite has come of
                        it yet, probably before this reaches yon something may be ready to submit to
                        the public gaze. The consequence of all this is that there has been
                        pratically no change in the Stock and share market during the past week,
                        which has included the White suntide holidays, a reason sufficient in itself
                        to keep all markets inactive, and on the return from their holidays the
                        dealers have all been occupied with the mid-month settlement.</p>
                    <p>Egyptian stocks are idle and show no feature worth noting this week. National
                        and Agricultural Banks keep firm at 26 1/4 and 13 3/4 respectively.</p>
                    <p>The land companies are for the moment neglected, and the mining section also
                        is without much interest. The report of the Sudan Goldfields, Limited, which
                        has made its appearance today, should prove pleasant that the directors have
                        every confidence in the mine, and that it is turning out better than was
                        originally anticipated.</p>
