ROYAL WEDDING.
BRILLIANT SPECTACLE.
MAGNIFICENT WEATHER.
FURTHER DETAILS
(From our Special Correspondent).
Windsor, June 15.
I bui able to give yon farther details regarding the gteat event of the day in England. I had the honor of attending the Royal wedding at tho special invitation of the Lord High Chamberlain. The happy function was favored by magnifioent weather, which added to the splendour of the proceedings. The marriage ceremony, as 1 have already said, was performed at St George’s Chapel at half-past twelve o’clock by the Archbishop of Canterbury, assisted by the Bishop of Oxford, the dean and canons of Windsor, and thfi Chaplain General of H.M.’s Forces. Prinoesa Margaret of Connaught, who was given away by hei father, tba Duke oPOonnaught, was supported by (our biiilo-maids, her sister, Prinoesa Pa tricia of Connaught, Prinoesa Victoria of Bat tenberg, Princess Mary of Wales, and Princess Beatrice of Saxe-Coburg.
The lloyal guests occupied the whole of the chancel of the chapel, and the spectacle afford ed was brilliant in the extreme, the ladies being in evening drees -and wearing dazzling gems, while the men were in military uniform* or lev£e dress. Among the principal guests, besides H. H. the Khedive and suite, were Mr Vincent Corbett, Colonel Watson, Boutros Pasha Gbali, General Sir Godfrey Clark, etc.
The hymn song previous to the arrival oi the wedding procession was “When God of old/ the concluding hymn being “Now thank we ali our God/’ followed by Mendelssohn's Wedding March. The organist was Sir Walter Parrott, organist of the Chapel Royal
The Royal dejeuner was given in the State dining-room of Windsor Castle. The wedding o&ke was five feet high and was borne on foui Grecian oolumna.

_MORB FIRES IN CAIRO.
r ■	.	r>,	1
j	*	f
Cairo has been the scene of tyo further fires since the large outbreak in ;the Darb-el-Ahmar district, but happily the. results have not been so disastrous as on (mat occasion. It appears to be the season of fires iu Cairo, and indeed in the provinces, for the frequency with whifch they have occurred during the last few weeks is quite alarming. Only a few days ago we had oocaaion to report a fire in the provinces which caused tho doetraodon of over 300' houses and the loss of twelve- lives, and also two other fires which were ofe&ainly not so serious, but at the same time assumed considerable proportions and from one of which a fatality occurred. A few days later came the news of the fire which we have already mentioned and which involved a loss of over £lO,OQO to the inhabitants of a poor and orowded district
To add to this tale of woe and destruction we have to record that a fire broke out on Wednesday evening in the Haret Darb el Ziont, Clot Bey-street, and was only subdued after an hour’s bard fight by tho members of the Fire Brigade, whoso effort* prevented the dames from spreading to the neighbouring houses, and thus limited tl e destruction to bat a small area. A few hours later the brigade received another alarm; they , were informed that a fire was raging in Sharia Kasr el-Aini, and arrived at the soene of the conflagration to find the house of Mu e Zsnab Hanem in danger of being gutted Here, too, the Fire Brigade waged its war against the deadly (lames with their accns tomed energy, and confined the damage done. to one spot It is estimated that the damage in the case of the first fire recorded amounts to £600 and in the latter case to £500.
•Cairo can indeed be congratulated on the smartness and efficiency of its Fire Brigade. In the 166 days which have parsed daring the present year the brigade has received the call of duty some 120 times, and ou each occasion has done the work roqaired of it in a manner worthy of the bast-trained London brigade. The work of the men speaks admirably for Captain Blake, who governs and trains them, and for the men themselves, who never fiinch'ln the performance of their perilous task.
QUARANTINE IN TURKEY.
A telegram from Peru states that arrivals in Tarkish ports from Suez undergo disinfection and from Alexandria the destruction of rats on board. The measures against Port Said have been suppressed.
“ABBASSIEH DESERT OASIS.”
A correspondent writes :—“The forcible representations which you have made against the acquisition of a large area of land in the Abbassieh Desert Oasis by two private individuals are receiving wide-spread sympathy and support in Cairo. Everyone to whom I have broaohed the subject is disgusted at the action of the Government in this matter and is eagerly waiting to see if any explanation, satisfactory or otherwise, will be forthcoming. It is indeed astounding that a concession shonld be granted on soch terms, and without, any stipulation as to what prices may be asked for the houses which are to be built, to any two private person^- . I also understand that i another certain well-known individual in Cairo > applied for the conoeesion at an earlior date than those to whom it was granted, but was refused it If this is the case, and I have no reason to dodbt its being so, is the Government prepared to answer why ? What prior right have the two successful gentlemen to the land over any othevndividoal or company V* Another correspondent writes : — “Like the rest of the world 1 am fall of astonishment at the sale of tirndat Abbassieh which the Govern r meat has made to Boghos Pasha Nubar and l M. Bmpain. Who are responsible ! and where ) are they t Lord Cromer is on his way to i England ; Mr. Corbett is already there ; Mr. i Mitchell-1 ones is not yet back. Is this last-named gentleman to face all the indignation wheu he retoms, alone ? Or are all the officials conscious of such spotless purity, that they ’ are ’ rendered fearless, and only expeoting 7 public approval of their latest effort at just government t”

The religious ceremony began shortly after 9 p.m. and was conducted by His Holiness Kyrilloc, the Greek Catholic Melohite Patriarch of Egypt, assisted by a number of high ecclesiastics. At the close of the religious ceremony the bride and bride groom received (he congratulations of their wedding guests and afterwards all adjourned to a most sumptuous buffet which was served by the Nungovich Hotels.Company under the personal superintendence of Mr. I^andaueiv manager of the San Stefano Hotel Casino.

The presents were numerous iud costly. The bridegroom is the manager of the Agricultural Bank of Egypt for the Galioubieb Province. Rostovitz Bey, President of the Greek com inanity in Cairo, acted as best man.
CONCERT AT KASR EL NIL
The second ot the most enjoyable open-air ooheerta which are held periodically through out the summer at Kasr el-Nil Barracks took place on Wednesday evening,and was even more largely attended than the first one at which we assisted. The audience thoroughly en joyed the varied programme which Mr. Watson-Ramsay, bandmaster of the 2nd Royal Innis-killing Fusiliers, had arranged for them. .After the playing of “The Merry Monarch” by tha Inniskilling band, CoLSergt. Grant led off with the humorous song iu Devonshire dialect Farmer Giles” and evoked an encore by his excellent rendering of it This was followed by a duet, “The Veteran’s Toast,” by Corporals Conyers and Gilbert, both of whom have good voices and sang exceedingly well. Mr. Holmes, too, scored a great success in the comic song Where I am lodging now,” and was also encored, as indeed was every item. “Signor Jackson winski” and his three comrades greatly amused the audieace with 1‘Dicks' Private Band.” The second part was opened by Buocalosi’s “Hunting Scene,” admirably played by the hand of the iimiskillings, andjMr. S. H. Trimen then sang “I’m Tired” in such a realistic manuor that he soon had nearly all the audience yawuing in sympathy with him Lieut. G. C. Adams, who is always a favorite, sang “The Little Irish Girl” and as an enoore “Off to Philadelphia,” in the chorus of which the whole audience joined, vying with each other as to which should sing the loudest and the longest. The performance was concluded hy the sketch “A Lunatic Asylum,” the parts being played by Lance-Corporals Mulhall, TrowelC Lilburn, and Jordan. The various characters were excellently portrayed, espe dally that of the new warder by Mr. Jordan.
BRITISH RECREATION CLUB.
Mr. Russell and Mrs. Sl John, society euter-tainers, who are making a tour round the worlds and have oome to Egypt from South Africa with an excellent reputation, gave an entertainment at the British Reoreation Club, Cairo, on Wednesday evening. The audience was not so large as it might have been, no doubt on account of tho fact that there was a conoert at the Kasr-el-Nil barrack* the same evening, but those who were present fully appreciated the performance and gave every encouragement to the artiato?. The first part of the programme consisted mainly of 6oi>g.^ and Mr. Russell fully sustained hi* well-earned reputation with his humorous rendering* of Up in the World,” “The Way to Sing u Song,” and other comic items. Mrs. St John, who.is known on the st^ge as “Carmen, is able to sing in two distinct voices, a full tonqd soprano and a mellow baritone, and changed from one to tbe other with marvellou; ease. The two songs by which she scored her greatest suooesses on the evening ot which wo write were “I’ll leave my happy home fo' you” and “Hiawatha,” and in these she showed admirably the wide range of notes ot which Bhe has command. Mr. Cooper drew forth roars of laughter Dy his rendering of “Laugh ing all over my faoe” and his humorous recita tion of the “Light Brigade,” whilst Mr. Ru* sell’s imitations of Sir Henry Irving and other prominent actors fully deserved the applause they evoked. The sooond half of the programme wa* composed of two sketches, “A Study in Black and White” and“Robbing a Burglar," both of whioh were exceedingly well acted and oaused much amusement. Tho whole entertainment was an immense success and greatly enjoyed by all who were prwent, and we feel sure that when the Rusfell* and 8l Johi troupe pay a visit to Alexandria, where thqy will arrive on the 25th of this month, they will meet with the appreciation whioh they deaem,
EGYPTIAN SHARE MARKET’.
(From our PrNANciAff Correspondent!
.	London, June 9.
The last 48 hours have very much chang ed .tho aspect of prices on the Stock Ex ebauge, owing to what woold appear to’ be well founded report that Russia is at la*t beginning lo realise that the “game is up, and has asked Paris and Washington to assist her towards obtaining a cessation of hostilities by opening pourparlers with Japan. Consols and Japanese Bonds have been dealt in to-day at rising prices, and leave off at 90 11/16 and 99^ respectively, with a firm tone. It is hardly necessary to point out that a declaration of peace would have a very beneficial effect in the financial world.
The feeling of uneasifio?* owing to the fear ‘ possible "complications effectively checks new enterprise, causing bankers and financiers to reduce their commitments to the lowest possible point ; their resources remain looked up in case of eventualities ; once the cause is removed wo may confidently look for a revival in almost all kinds of business. Money, already cheap, will become more abundant, and consequently cheaper. Should Japan receive any pecuniary indemnity, it will surely be financed in London, and a large portion will remain to meet Japan’s obligations here. Apart from the stronger tone given to prices from the above cause, there is really little change to report since last week. The very interesting paper read by Mr. Edgar Speyer at the London Institution has been very well received, and if it only causes a halt in muuioipal borrowings, which have been much overdone of late, it will have served a very useful purpose, and one for which the city will feel grateful.
The markets all round close with a cheerful tone, and investment stocks are being more enquired for, especially in the Homo Rail market, helped no doubt by the fact that traffics on the Northern lines have been better than expocted. In Americans, prices are inclined to rise above New York parity, and are a good market.
Iu the Egyptian market the feature this week has been the selling of National Bank shares, which at one time touched 26. We foreshadowed this in our letter a fortnight ago; but holders need not be the least alarmed, as the fall has been caused by shareholders desirous of changing their old shares for the new. The price has steadied up again now to 26$—J, due to good buying support from Egypt.
In the miuing section there is little change to report. Nile Valleys have improved a fraction to H- The report of the UmRus mine, just issued to theshareholders, ha* been well received and the near future should show au improve-meqt in their shares, as the mine is evidently being carefully worked, and the interests of the shareholders are in good hands.
AMERICA# PRESBYTERIAN MISSION.
The annual association meeting of the above Vission is to be held at Ramleb on the 4th proxo. under the presidency of Rev. T. J. Finney and will remtin in session about two weeks. It will be attended by all the members of the mission at present in Egypt. The total missionary and teaching staff numbers about SO persons of both sexes, but several are away for the summer, bo it is not expected that more than half will attend. The mission was established in this country in 1854, so that it now enters upon its jubilee year, and the work done during those 50 years has been remarkable' in every seuse of tbe word.
It is interesting to note that Dr. Thoma3 McGague, who btiil lives at Omaha, U. S. A., oegan in that year, with Mrs. MoCague alone! at Cairo, the work which to-day is represented* by 78 workers from the home churches, besides some 500 oo-workere from among the people of Egypt
Dr. Harvey has resided in this country talmost continuously for about 40 years, whilst the term of service by the three senior missionaries nrw out here—Drs. Ewing, Harvey and Watron—already totals up to 123 years.
Mention riiould be made also of the medical work carried on by the mission in Lower and Upper Egypt Tantah and Assiout are the two towns which serve as cent tom whence the work nidiates to the surrounding villages. Tho Assiout hospital stands as the representative of medical work to the south of Cairo. As a 'oe rd of what is accomplished there we may state that in the course of the past twelve months the patients admitted numbered be-tvven l,3t>0 and 1,400 mfen, women,and children. Of this total some 300 wert Moslems, whilst the remainder were native Christians of different persuasions, but mostly* Copts. ’This hospital was opened about 9 years ago and he number of in-patients has been steadily on the increase since, whilst at times tho building has been crowded to its utmost oapacity.
A new girls’ college is to be built on Abbas-boulevard, Cairo. The ground on which the college will be (Sonstrnctod is 14,000 metres in extent and was purchased from SakakiqrPasha at a oost 0f £6,400, whilst the buildings are estimated at another £16,000. They^will be erected from plans designed by Mt^JBkynder, the Cairo architect. There will be accommodation for between 150 and 200 boarders, besides 200 day scholars.
At present there is in the girls’ college in the Rsbekioh auarter nearly 100 boarders and shout donble that number of day scholars, but many applications for the former class of pMpils have to bo refused for want of room, ind there are no means of enlarging the premises, so that the new college on Aboas-boulevard, when oompleted in about two years’ time, will prove a great boon and an incentive to the cause of native female eduoation now oarried on by the pinion,

THE KHEDIVE.

Lowa Thurneysson Pasha, Equerry to the Khedive, is leaving Alexandria to-morrow by tho Mewageries Maritimes S.S. “Senegal” for Marseilles, en rente to join the Khedive at Divonne.
Tho Khedive has bestowed the following gradei :

KH EDI VIAL DECORATIONS.

Mr. G. H. West has been appointed temporary sub-inspector for cotton-worm duty in the Bebera province.
Our Minet el Kamh Correspondent says that the following are the places in the Minet el Kamh Markaz in whioh the cotton worm has appeared daring the week ending last Saturday: (1) The teftisb of Prince Ibrahim Helmy Pasha in Bishot Amer ; (2) the tettish of Prinoe Mo-hamed Poy Ibrahim in Telbana ; (3) Bauadf; (4) Okdeh ; (5) Karakra, and (6) Malamis.
The villages of Minet-el-Kamh Markaz in which the cotton worm has appeared now number 12.
WHITE SLAVE TRAFFIC.
The ramifications of this iniquitous traffic extend far and wide, as is evidenced by the fact reported in our issue of last Saturday that a Japanese girl had been rescued from the hands of those who would have wrought her rain. This girl, an intelligent and apparently innocent young woman of 16, is now at the Rudolph Home. There being no Japanese Consul in Alexandria, the British Consn 1-Goneral, Mr. K B. Gould, I.S.U., has takon tho matter in hand, and has oom municated with the British representative in Japan with a view to the girl’s restoration her own oountry.
We understand that measures have been taken by the recently appointed executive committee of the repression society for the effective supervision of all incoming ships, and it is to be hoped that by this means a stop will be put to a scandal whioh has been prominently before the public of late.

“ABBASSIEH DESERT OASIS.” PERSONAL AND SOCIAL.
_H6rE DETAIL8. ^
Onj of the moet suspicions and inoompre hensible items in the Government’s agreement with Boghos Pasha Nubar and.M- Empain in regard to the “Abbassieh Desert Oasis” iJ that the Government does not stipnlato for any share in the profits, as has been invariably the case hitherto. In the esse of other concessions the Government insists on a share in the profits, often oven a half share.
Another point is that these two gentlemen have obtained a concession for 70 years, while in the casos of English oompanies’ oonoessions (such, for example, as the Egyptian Markets, the Helouan Railway Company, and others), the concession is for a much more limited period, less than half of the time given to the Abbassieh Oasis concessionaires.
A Cairo correspondent writes :—“The above remarkable transaction is causing more than an uproar in Cairo, in view especially of the fret that only a few months back an official notioe issued by the Government stated emphatically that no big areas of land would be disposed of in future. Directly opposed to this, however, fifteen thousand feddans, i.e., sixty-threi million square metres of land, eminently snitable for building purposes, in the immediate vicinity to the north-west of the largest oity in Africa, is sold for L.K 15,000—ajbig deal and certainly the finest bargain from thepurohasers’ point of view ever reoorded here. The concession for quick elec trio communication with the city granted at the same time to the two private buyers, a native Pasha and a Belgian gentleman connected with the Cairo trams, will bring this projected suburb within twenty minutes of Opera-square. For years it has been known that the gentlemen at the head of the Cairo trams could get anything from tho Government for the mere trouble of asking, bat the present transaction really beats anything on record.
.“It will be plain to everyone that the principal losers are first and foremost the Egyptian Government, who could have asked and obtained with ease a sum of at least one million sterling for the land in question. The second to lose by the transaction is very obviously the Delta Light Railway, who have just taken over at a heavy cost the Helouan line in spite of the opposition of the Cairo trams. One can read between the lines, however, and sec that the latter have now attained something towards taking from the English oompany the laurels so dearly bought by it, whioh are now ' v this strategical move as good as gone

Another Cairo correspondent writes:—“With referonoe to th'q leading article in yonr issue of the 12th inst, regarding the. “Abbassieh Desert^’ your surmise is perfectly correct, aud I may tell you that I am in a position to state that the fall in the price of land at Abbassieh is solely due to this enormous sale of Government land to a very few people, and at a ridiculous figure. It may bo of interest to your readers * know that several large and bond fide deals ... land at Abbassieh have recently fallen through purely on the grounds that the large sales were whispered tonnd, and if some persons can purchase a few feddans at £1 a feddan, what is the good of paying a mnch greater ■ price per metre t Far better to wait until these speculators have brought the value of ground down to the lowest point Bnt in the meanwhile what are the bond fide land-owners going to do t Calmly sit still and make no effort with the Government to urge them to be just and true in all their dealings, or let the few favored ones bring them to min T”

THE COTTON MARKET-
Kearsley and Cunnikoham’s Weekly Report.
Liverpool, June 8.
In Egyptian Cotton only a moderate business has been done, and quotations are generally reduced ^ d. @ £ d. per lb.
Egyptian Futures bare been idle all the week and prioes show a decline of 18 points for Jane and 15 points fur other positions. The following are the latest quotations, vis:—
Jane 6.40 Aug. 6.42 Oot 6.37
July 6.44 8ep. 6.89 Nov. 6.34 Deo. 6.30
American Futures.—The market this week has been decidedly lees active and prioes have experienced a sharp decline, amounting to 15 @17 points from those of last Thursday. Near months have been pressed for sale and show tho largest deoline. The sharp fall in prioes is chiefly due to improved weather reports and to the Bureau report being better than expected, both as regards the decrease in hcreage and also in the estimated condition of the crop. Should the weather remain favorable throughout the month of June, we should expect the Crop to recover much of its present lateness and also to make good muoh of the reoent unfavorable condition. The price of 4id. per lb., seems for the moment to faifly represent/the situation, and the only (pinion we can form, in a market whioh is so dependent upon daily Crop reports, is that we are not likefcjo have any important movement in .prices bnt may expect frequent fluctuations.
