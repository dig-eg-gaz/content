                            and the voluntary contributions of the scattered residents and friends

                            suggest that the real pigeons be replaced by clay ones, which would not
                            only be just as good sport, but no doubt considerably cheaper; and it
                            people must bet, this could be indulged in just as well with clay

                        in England. I had the honor of attending the Royal wedding at tho special
                        invitation of the Lord High Chamberlain. The happy function was favored by
                        magnifioent weather, which added to the splendour of the proceedings. The
                        marriage ceremony, as 1 have already said, was performed at St George’s
                        Chapel at half-past twelve o’clock by the Archbishop of Canterbury, assisted
                        by the Bishop of Oxford, the dean and canons of Windsor, and thfi Chaplain
                        General of H.M.’s Forces. Prinoesa Margaret of Connaught, who was given away
                        by hei father, tba Duke oPOonnaught, was supported by (our biiilo-maids, her
                        sister, Prinoesa Pa tricia of Connaught, Prinoesa Victoria of Bat tenberg,
                        Princess Mary of Wales, and Princess Beatrice of Saxe-Coburg. The lloyal
                        guests occupied the whole of the chancel of the chapel, and the spectacle
                        afford ed was brilliant in the extreme, the ladies being in evening drees
                        -and wearing dazzling gems, while the men were in military uniform* or lev£e
                        dress. Among the principal guests, besides H. H. the Khedive and suite, were
                        Mr Vincent Corbett, Colonel Watson, Boutros Pasha Gbali, General Sir Godfrey
                        Clark, etc. The hymn song previous to the arrival of the wedding procession
                        was “When God of old/ the concluding hymn being “Now thank we ali our God/’
                        followed by Mendelssohn's Wedding March. The organist was Sir Walter
                        Parrott, organist of the Chapel Royal The Royal dejeuner was given in the
                        State dining-room of Windsor Castle. The wedding oke was five feet high and
                        was borne on foui Grecian oolumna. Prince and Prinoesa Gustavos Adolphus of
                        Sweden and Norway left Windsor at 4.20 p.m for Suighton Grange, Chester,
                        which has beer lent to them by the Right Hon. George Wynd ham. Ou Monday the

                    <p>Cairo has been the scene of tyo further fires since the large outbreak in
                        ;the Darb-el-Ahmar district, but happily the. results have not been so
                        disastrous as on (mat occasion. It appears to be the season of fires iu
                        Cairo, and indeed in the provinces, for the frequency with whifch they have
                        occurred during the last few weeks is quite alarming. Only a few days ago we
                        had oocaaion to report a fire in the provinces which caused tho doetraodon
                        of over 300' houses and the loss of twelve- lives, and also two other fires
                        which were oftainly not so serious, but at the same time assumed
                        considerable proportions and from one of which a fatality occurred. A few
                        days later came the news of the fire which we have already mentioned and
                        which involved a loss of over £lO,OQO to the inhabitants of a poor and
                        orowded district To add to this tale of woe and destruction we have to
                        record that a fire broke out on Wednesday evening in the Haret Darb el
                        Ziont, Clot Bey-street, and was only subdued after an hour’s bard fight by
                        tho members of the Fire Brigade, whoso effort* prevented the dames from
                        spreading to the neighbouring houses, and thus limited tl e destruction to
                        bat a small area. A few hours later the brigade received another alarm; they
                        , were informed that a fire was raging in Sharia Kasr el-Aini, and arrived
                        at the soene of the conflagration to find the house of Mu e Zsnab Hanem in
                        danger of being gutted Here, too, the Fire Brigade waged its war against the
                        deadly (lames with their accns tomed energy, and confined the damage done.
                        to one spot It is estimated that the damage in the case of the first fire
                        recorded amounts to £600 and in the latter case to £500. Cairo can indeed be
                        congratulated on the smartness and efficiency of its Fire Brigade. In the
                        166 days which have parsed daring the present year the brigade has received
                        the call of duty some 120 times, and ou each occasion has done the work
                        roqaired of it in a manner worthy of the bast-trained London brigade. The
                        work of the men speaks admirably for Captain Blake, who governs and trains
                        them, and for the men themselves, who never fiinch'ln the performance of
                        their perilous task.</p>

                        and European colonies at Alexandria attended the wedding. The exterior of
                        the house was brilliantly illuminated, the facade beiug adorned with hundred
                        of lamps, which presented and most pleasing and artistic effect. The
                        religious ceremony began shortly after 9 p.m. and was conducted by His

                        by a number of high ecclesiastics. At the close of the religious ceremony

                        periodically through out the summer at Kasr el-Nil Barracks took place on
                        Wednesday evening,and was even more largely attended than the first one at
                        which we assisted. The audience thoroughly en joyed the varied programme
                        which Mr. Watson-Ramsay, bandmaster of the 2nd Royal Innis-killing
                        Fusiliers, had arranged for them. .After the playing of “The Merry Monarch”
                        by tha Inniskilling band, CoLSergt. Grant led off with the humorous song iu
                        Devonshire dialect Farmer Giles” and evoked an encore by his excellent
                        rendering of it This was followed by a duet, “The Veteran’s Toast,” by
                        Corporals Conyers and Gilbert, both of whom have good voices and sang
                        exceedingly well. Mr. Holmes, too, scored a great success in the comic song
                        Where I am lodging now,” and was also encored, as indeed was every item.
                        “Signor Jackson winski” and his three comrades greatly amused the audieace
                        with 1‘Dicks' Private Band.” The second part was opened by Buocalosi’s
                        “Hunting Scene,” admirably played by the hand of the iimiskillings, andjMr.
                        S. H. Trimen then sang “I’m Tired” in such a realistic manuor that he soon
                        had nearly all the audience yawuing in sympathy with him Lieut. G. C. Adams,
                        who is always a favorite, sang “The Little Irish Girl” and as an enoore “Off
                        to Philadelphia,” in the chorus of which the whole audience joined, vying
                        with each other as to which should sing the loudest and the longest. The
                        performance was concluded hy the sketch “A Lunatic Asylum,” the parts being
                        played by Lance-Corporals Mulhall, TrowelC Lilburn, and Jordan. The various
                        characters were excellently portrayed, espe dally that of the new warder by
                        Mr. Jordan.</p>

                        Wednesday evening. The audience was not so large as it might have been, no
                        doubt on account of tho fact that there was a conoert at the Kasr-el-Nil
                        barrack* the same evening, but those who were present fully appreciated the
                        performance and gave every encouragement to the artiato?. The first part of
                        the programme consisted mainly of 6oi>g.^ and Mr. Russell fully sustained
                        hi* well-earned reputation with his humorous rendering* of Up in the World,”
                        “The Way to Sing u Song,” and other comic items. Mrs. St John, who.is known
                        on the st^ge as “Carmen, is able to sing in two distinct voices, a full
                        tonqd soprano and a mellow baritone, and changed from one to the other with
                        marvellou; ease. The two songs by which she scored her greatest successes on
                        the evening ot which wo write were “I’ll leave my happy home fo' you” and
                        “Hiawatha,” and in these she showed admirably the wide range of notes ot
                        which Bhe has command. Mr. Cooper drew forth roars of laughter Dy his
                        rendering of “Laugh ing all over my faoe” and his humorous recita tion of
                        the “Light Brigade,” whilst Mr. Ru* sell’s imitations of Sir Henry Irving
                        and other prominent actors fully deserved the applause they evoked. The
                        sooond half of the programme wa* composed of two sketches, “A Study in Black
                        and White” and“Robbing a Burglar," both of whioh were exceedingly well acted
                        and oaused much amusement. Tho whole entertainment was an immense success
                        and greatly enjoyed by all who were prwent, and we feel sure that when the
                        Rusfell* and 8l Johi troupe pay a visit to Alexandria, where thqy will
                        arrive on the 25th of this month, they will meet with the appreciation whioh

                        <p> The last 48 hours have very much chang ed .tho aspect of prices on the
                            Stock Ex ebauge, owing to what woold appear to’ be well founded report
                            that Russia is at la*t beginning lo realise that the “game is up, and
                            has asked Paris and Washington to assist her towards obtaining a
                            cessation of hostilities by opening pourparlers with Japan. Consols and
                            Japanese Bonds have been dealt in to-day at rising prices, and leave off
                            at 90 11/16 and 99^ respectively, with a firm tone. It is hardly
                            necessary to point out that a declaration of peace would have a very
                            beneficial effect in the financial world. </p>
                        <p>The feeling of uneasifio?* owing to the fear ‘ possible "complications
                            effectively checks new enterprise, causing bankers and financiers to
                            reduce their commitments to the lowest possible point ; their resources
                            remain looked up in case of eventualities ; once the cause is removed wo
                            may confidently look for a revival in almost all kinds of business.
                            Money, already cheap, will become more abundant, and consequently
                            cheaper. Should Japan receive any pecuniary indemnity, it will surely be
                            financed in London, and a large portion will remain to meet Japan’s
                            obligations here. Apart from the stronger tone given to prices from the
                            above cause, there is really little change to report since last week.
                            The very interesting paper read by Mr. Edgar Speyer at the London
                            Institution has been very well received, and if it only causes a halt in
                            muuioipal borrowings, which have been much overdone of late, it will
                            have served a very useful purpose, and one for which the city will feel
                            grateful.</p>
                        <p>The markets all round close with a cheerful tone, and investment stocks
                            are being more enquired for, especially in the Homo Rail market, helped
                            no doubt by the fact that traffics on the Northern lines have been
                            better than expocted. In Americans, prices are inclined to rise above
                            New York parity, and are a good market. </p>
                        <p>In the Egyptian market the feature this week has been the selling of
                            National Bank shares, which at one time touched 26. We foreshadowed this
                            in our letter a fortnight ago; but holders need not be the least
                            alarmed, as the fall has been caused by shareholders desirous of
                            changing their old shares for the new. The price has steadied up again
                            now to 26$—J, due to good buying support from Egypt. </p>
                        <p>In the mining section there is little change to report. Nile Valleys have
                            improved a fraction to H- The report of the UmRus mine, just issued to
                            theshareholders, ha* been well received and the near future should show
                            au improve-meqt in their shares, as the mine is evidently being
                            carefully worked, and the interests of the shareholders are in good
                            hands.</p>

                        on the 4th proxo. under the presidency of Rev. T. J. Finney and will remtin
                        in session about two weeks. It will be attended by all the members of the
                        mission at present in Egypt. The total missionary and teaching staff numbers
                        about SO persons of both sexes, but several are away for the summer, bo it
                        is not expected that more than half will attend. The mission was established
                        in this country in 1854, so that it now enters upon its jubilee year, and
                        the work done during those 50 years has been remarkable' in every seuse of
                        the word. It is interesting to note that Dr. Thoma3 McGague, who btiil lives
                        at Omaha, U. S. A., oegan in that year, with Mrs. MoCague alone! at Cairo,
                        the work which to-day is represented* by 78 workers from the home churches,
                        besides some 500 oo-workere from among the people of Egypt Dr. Harvey has
                        resided in this country talmost continuously for about 40 years, whilst the
                        term of service by the three senior missionaries nrw out here—Drs. Ewing,
                        Harvey and Watron—already totals up to 123 years. Mention riiould be made
                        also of the medical work carried on by the mission in Lower and Upper Egypt
                        Tantah and Assiout are the two towns which serve as cent tom whence the work
                        nidiates to the surrounding villages. Tho Assiout hospital stands as the
                        representative of medical work to the south of Cairo. As a 'oe rd of what is
                        accomplished there we may state that in the course of the past twelve months
                        the patients admitted numbered be-tvven l,3t>0 and 1,400 mfen, women,and
                        children. Of this total some 300 wert Moslems, whilst the remainder were
                        native Christians of different persuasions, but mostly* Copts. ’This
                        hospital was opened about 9 years ago and he number of in-patients has been
                        steadily on the increase since, whilst at times tho building has been
                        crowded to its utmost oapacity. A new girls’ college is to be built on
                        Abbas-boulevard, Cairo. The ground on which the college will be (Sonstrnctod
                        is 14,000 metres in extent and was purchased from SakakiqrPasha at a oost 0f
                        £6,400, whilst the buildings are estimated at another £16,000. They^will be
                        erected from plans designed by Mt^JBkynder, the Cairo architect. There will
                        be accommodation for between 150 and 200 boarders, besides 200 day scholars.
                        At present there is in the girls’ college in the Rsbekioh auarter nearly 100
                        boarders and shout donble that number of day scholars, but many applications
                        for the former class of pMpils have to bo refused for want of room, ind
                        there are no means of enlarging the premises, so that the new college on
                        Aboas-boulevard, when oompleted in about two years’ time, will prove a great
                        boon and an incentive to the cause of native female eduoation now oarried on
