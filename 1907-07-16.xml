                        other ancient ruins and the Venetian fortifications, the finest in the

                    <head>COLONIAL COTTON GROWING. </head>
                    <p>The "Wall Street Journal" of New York remarks : </p>
                    <p> The position taken by the European representatives at the International
                        Cotton Congress of Vienna, emphasizing their purpose to extend the area of
                        cotton cultivation in all parts of the world where the fibre could be grown,
                        is one which must make for the advantage of the cotton interests abroad as
                        well as at home. </p>
                    <p> The ground taken was, that for climatic reasons the European cotton milling
                        industry could not afford to stake its prosperity upon the outcome of the
                        crop in any one country, even though it be the United States. The world's
                        production for mill | consumption last year was nearly 20,000,000 bales, of
                        which the United States supplied two-thirds, which grows within an area of |
                        700,000 square miles. This crop, the Europeans contend, is grown on too
                        small a climatic area to be depended upon exclusively or to the extent now
                        prevailing. Nearly 40 per cent. of the cotton grown in the United States is
                        now gathered from the territory west of the Mississippi, and four states
                        lying along the Gulf, on both sides of that </p>
                    <p> river, grow 65 per cent. of the total crop. | A failure to the extent of 50
                        per cent. of the yield in these states would probably close one-third of the
                        cotton mills of the world. From the consumers standpoint, therefore, it is
                        good insurance to push cultivation in other parts of the world. </p>
                    <p> >Another advantage often overlooked is that which comes to American spinners
                        and growers from outside competition. The idea that the United States has a
                        monopoly of cotton growing has done more harın than good to the methods of
                        cultivation. Such a sense of advantages inevitably superinduces
                        indifference, resulting in lack of progress. The resoluteness of the
                        European representatives, in pushing cotton cultivation in Africa, in Asia
                        and in colonial possessions generally, is to be commended rather than
                        discouraged. Several American mills are already depending almost wholly upon
                        Egyptian cotton for lack of the long staple upland which has almost ceased
                        to be grown. The time may come when foreign grown cotton will figure much
                        more largely in the raw material demands of our mills than it does now..
                        There will then be no small advantage accruing from the foresight of
                        European consumers. </p>

                            deals with the delicate problem of how to treat the natives. It is

                            with the death of an English stoker from a merchant vessel in the

                            various place. He expired from his wounds. It appears that this stoker
                            visited an immoral establishment in the parlieus of Sisters-street. A
                            dispute arose about the question of payment between the man and the

                    <p>CELEBRATIONS IN CAIRO.</p>
                    <p>Praise of the work of the committee which has so ably carried out the arduous
                        task of the fourteenth of July celebrations, is general in the press and
                        amongst the public. The praise is richly deserved, for their efforts have
                        been crowned with the success so richly merited. The soirée de gala of "la
                        Grande Famille" held in the Garden Theatre on Saturday evening was most
                        excellently attended. The rôles were well sustained and any individual
                        distinction would be rather difficult; we might, however mention Mr.
                        Alazet's rendering of the cheerful and happygo-lucky Corporal to whom
                        nothing came amiss. As befitted the occasion there was a yeneral demand for
                        the "Marseillaise" which was sung by Miss Lambertini --tastefully garbed as
                        the Republic, the chorus being taken up by the rest of the troupe grouped on
                        the stage with the tricolour in their midst, and the whole of the audience,
                        who rose from their seats unanimously.</p>
                    <p>On Sunday morning the usual visits were exchanged, and a considerable amount
                        of bunting was displayed in the principal quarfers ; a very large number of
                        Hellenic flags were in evidence and the French nation should be proud to see
                        what a general Hesire there was on all hands to brighten up the city on
                        their festival. Some of our contemporaries even go so far as to describe the
                        fourteenth of July as an International Fête.</p>
                    <p>It is many years since a finer sight has beer seen than that of the Esbekieh
                        Gardens wher thrown open to the public on Sunday evening and it wanted only
                        the liberal attendance o the admiring crowds to complete the gratifying
                        success attending the function. It would be hard to estimate the number
                        present, but from the moment of the opening of the gates unti an early hour
                        on Monday morning, a steady stream of visitors thronged the provisiona
                        pathway opened from the central gate opposite the Continental to the
                        pavilion in the centre on the site of the old lake, which was rendered
                        almost as bright as day by the hanging lanterns on both sides.</p>
                    <p>At the entrance, our old friend, the Arc de Triomph, which has officiated at
                        so many fourteenths of July, Khedivial and Turkish Anniversaries, etc. was
                        brilliantly lighted and looked quite youthful under the kind shield o
                        night.</p>
                    <p>The reception pavilion was graced by another arch, simply, but well
                        ornamented with jets, and all the side avehues were bordered with lanterns ;
                        the sight was extrernely effective, and altogether the scene of the
                        continnally moving crowds. formed a veritable picture which will be
                        remembered with pleasure by all who were present, while the well-chosen
                        programmes rendered by the deservedly popular band of the Inuiskilling
                        Fusiliers under their able conductor, Mr. Watson Ramsey, and the Egyptian
                        Cavalry Banil added greatly to the enjoyment of the evening.</p>
                    <p>The French Minister and Mr. Reffye arrived in good time and were received by
                        the members of the committee, and the French and Egyptian anthems were
                        played while Messrs. Caneri and Waast, Deputies of the French nation,
                        received the official griests, among whom were the leading residents of all
                        nations now in the Capital.</p>
                    <p>The theatrical performance was extremely well patronised as well as the open
                        air dancing The display of fireworks was open to criticism and better
                        displays have been seen on similar occasions, although, we believe, there
                        are certain restrictions in this matter which preclude a really fine
                        display, owing to the proximity of the houses surrounding the garden.</p>
                    <p>Where everyone, from the gasman to the President of the Committee, spared no
                        effort to make the occasion a complete success comment would be invidious ;
                        it is to be hoped, however, that this band of workers will be again to the
                        fore on the next occasion and achieve as notable a success as 1907. A final
                        tribute is due to the hospitality of the French Nation to their guests ;
                        refreshments were good and plentiful and the Press were received with marked
                        consideration. -</p>

                        decorated with fags and profusely illuminated with electric lights. In the
                        afternoon various amusements were indulged in, and in the evening dancing
                        commenced in the open enclosure to the accompaniment of an excellent string

                    <p>Captain Lyons has just compiled a ver useful and interesting work on the
                        rains of th Nile basin and last year's food.</p>
                    <p>The series of seven dry years which begal with the exceptionally low flood of
                        1899 wher the volume discharged by the Nile was 37 pe cent below the
                        average, and ended with tha of 1905 which was 35 per cent déficient, wai
                        succeeded last year by a flood' which was more nearly of average volume.</p>
                    <p>Year by year it is possible to supplemen existing information by newer and
                        more ample data," and to fill gaps in the chain of condition: which lead up
                        to the summer rains of Abyssinia the feeders of the Nile flood. A few years
                        ago the resemblance between the gauge curve of: rising flood and that of
                        some former year wa used as the only means of anticipating it: probable
                        development; then it was suggester that the Bombay rainfall might be
                        utilizec as a basis of prediction, but with the re opening of the Sudan and
                        the establishment of meteorological stations there, supplement ed by others
                        in the equatorial regions, ou knowledge has rapidly increased, and deduc
                        tions from accurate observations have largely replaced empirical methods.
                        Today we cai follow the northward extension of the rain: of tropical East
                        Africa froin Mauritius and Zomba (in British Central Africa) which lie just
                        within the southern tropic, throng! German East Africa up to the lake
                        plateau. Il the Seychelles Islands of the Indian Oceai and in British East
                        Africa and Uganda, wi note them as they pass on to the Somali Coas and to
                        the Bahr el Jebel. Further north again a chain of meteorological stations
                        now supplie full information about the intensity and the extension of the
                        rains from the Nile-Congo watershed through the Bahr el Ghazal, and along
                        the Bahr el Jebel and the Sobat acros: the Sudan plains to the limits of the
                        Monsoor region near Dongola and Berber ; to the sout! of the Abyssinian
                        tableland information is stil meagre, and we are dependent on the journal of
                        the few travellers who have traversed the region.</p>
                    <p>In Abyssinia itself, more systematic study of the meteorological conditions
                        is urgently needed. When the heavy rainfall of July and August has set in,
                        the conditions of the surrounding regions seem to give but slight
                        indications of the variations which take place on the tableland, and as 30
                        per cent of the total rainfall falls in each of these months, a break in the
                        rains lasting for 10 days may reduce the volume of the Nile flood by 10 per
                        cent. At Addis Abbaba alone is the rainfall measured at present, and it is
                        not yet possible to get observations from places lying further to the west,
                        which are thus more representative of the Blue Nile basin. In 1907 a
                        qnalified meteorologist will be sent to Addis Abbaba in order to study the
                        local conditions on the plateau during June, July, August and September.</p>
                    <p>It is also proposed to investigate the upper region of the Monsoon current
                        over the Sudan plains by means of kites carrying self-registering apparatus,
                        but this work which was to have been commenced in 1907 is now unavoidably
                        postponed till 1908.</p>
                    <p>The Nile has presented several features of special interest during the past
                        year. In both February and March, heavy rainstorms occurred in Abyssinia and
                        the Southern Sudan, which raised the river levels and greatly improved the
                        low stage supply of the spring months ; the steady improvement in the
                        rainfall of August and September furnished a flood about 10 per cent below
                        the average while the maximum gauge readings at · Wadi Halfa just exceeded
                        the mean, a great improvement on the conditions experienced during the past
                        seven years. We have therefore a flood of nearly normal volume to study, and
                        our task is greatly facilitated by the new river ganges built in masonry
                        which have been constructed by the Sudan Irrigation Service to take the
                        place of temporary gauges.</p>
                    <p>The rains were somewhat late in reaching the Sudan plains and were at first
                        rather .weak ; in July an improvement took place, which was maintained in
                        August and the early part of September so that the flood on the whole was
                        fairly satisfactory, and as guaged by the estimated volume passing Aswan,
                        reached 0:87 of an average flood. From this it may be considered as about
                        equal to the floods of 1900 and 1901. but coming as it did, immediately
                        after good low-stage levels (see p. 57) and increasing to a somewhat late
                        maximum, it may be characterized as fairly good rather than moderate
                        only.</p>
                    <p>From May onwards, public opinion strongly inclined to the view that the flood
                        would be an exceptionally large one, as the favourable low-stage levels, due
                        to abnormal rainfall in February and March, were generally interpreted as
                        the result of an early and unusual development of the sumiuer rains, but the
                        meteorological conditions in the regions south of the Sudan never lent any
                        support to this view, indeed, in May the prospect was distinctly
                        unfavourable, and it was not unti after June that a decided improvement was
                        discernible.</p>

                    <head>THE VIVANTE MYSTERY.</head>
                    <p> On Sunday, the police arrested' Arundsen, the ex-employé óf Vivante, and
                        confronted him with the staff of the hotel where Vivante met his death. The
                        staff, however, failed to recognise him and he was accordingly released. </p>
                    <p> Yesterday "Arundsen underwent a crossexamination ly the Alexandria Police at
                        the Menshieh Caracol. He was also medically inspected by the police to see
                        whether there were any scratches, marks, contusions and other signs about
                        his person to show that he had been engaged in a struggle. Neither in the
                        cross-examination nor in the medical inspection did anything come to light
                        of a compromising character against him. :* </p>
                    <p> The mystery as to how the death was brought about remains as deep as ever.

                    <p>resté à 3 5/8 pour cent. Au Stock Exchange, le Consolidé anglais a haussé,

                    <p>Comme d'ordinaire tous les lundis, nous avons en, ce matin, un marché
                        flasque, indécis et tant soit peu lourd, dans l'attente du vent qui
                        soufflera cette semaine de Londres et cie Paris.</p>

                    <p>Nous détachons de notre correspondance de Londres, en date du 8 Juillet,
                        l'intéressant passage suivant :</p>
                    <p>" Il s'est produit en fin de semaine, au Stock Exchange, de bonnes demandes
                        en valeurs égyptiennes, . spécialement en National Bank, qui a atteint 20,
                        et en Agricole, qui se maintient ferme à 8. Ces achats ont été faits en
                        grande partie pour le continent et pour l'Ecosse. On commence, décidément, à
                        se rendre un compte plus exact de l'excellence des conditions économiques
                        générales de la vallée du Nil de l'abondante récolte du coton et du haut
                        prix qu'on en tirera, ce qui ramènera l'or en masse dans le pays. Certes, la
                        crise que les marchés do Caire et d'Alexandrie viennent de traverser aura
                        des effets pendant quelques mois encore, ainsi que sa répercussion sur les
                        autres branches de l'activité sociale. Mais c'est pousser le pessimisme à
                        outrance que de prétendre que la contrée est ruinée pour une lon <cb n="2"/>
                        gue série d'années </p>
                    <p> "Une haute personnalité financière d'ici, dont le nom a été souvent cité ces
                        temps derniers à propos des embarras du marché égyptien, a eu l'occasion de
                        déclarer que l'Egypte est appelée, malgré tout, à donner lieu à des
                        surprises encore plus agréables que celles que nous ont déjà values ses
                        vingt premières années de développement et de prospérité. </p>
                    <p> " La conversation portait sur l'avenir des terrains, ainsi que des Sociétés
                        qui s'en occupent. L'éminent financier dont il est question a bien reconnu
                        que la spéculation avait imprimé, en dernier lieu, à la plus-value un essor
                        imprudemment rapide ; mais il s'est élevé, avec raison, contre l'opinion
                        suivant laquelle le prix du terrain en général serait appelé à suivre à
                        l'avenir une marche décroissante. " On perd de vue, a-t-il fait remarquer en
                        dernier ressort, que la population de l'Egypte est composée, pour plus de

                                protest against any "entente" with Russia, whose regime was bitterly
                                denounced. Subsequently, the crowd, led by Mr. Thorne, M.P., the
                                Socialist Mr. Hyndman, and others, marched to the Foreign Office.
                                The police dispersed them after half an hour's desperate
                                scrummaging. Several persons were badly bruised, including Mistress

                    <head>THE TYRANNY OF LONDON.</head>
                    <p>"People who write from London about London for the provinces very frequently
                        speak of 'London opinion,' saying that the 'London opinion' on such-and-such
                        is so-and-so; but they rarely state in what way they get 'London opinion,'"
                        says the "Edinburgh Evening News,"</p>
                    <p>"An entertaining and suggestive article on 'The Tyranny of London' is
                        contributed to the "Referee" by Mr. Sydney Brooks, a jonrnalist from
                        America...... He remarks that London is not only the biggest capital in the
                        world, bnt the most comprehensive. 'London,' writes Mr. Brooks, 'not only
                        dominates England, but overpowers it-in a measure devitalises it.' He adds
                        that no other capital, with the doubtfal exception of Paris, absorbs so much
                        of the national life around it. Berlin is not to Germany, Rome is not to
                        Italy, Vienna is not to Austria, still less is Madrid to Spain, all that
                        London is to England-by which, presumably, Mr. Brooks means Great
                        Britain.</p>
                    <p>"While admitting the extent to which London dominates the rest of the land,
                        Mr. Brooks says that there is one sphere beyond the influence of its
                        absorbent magnetism, the sphere of politics. 'Except,' he writes; 'at brief
                        moments of intense national excitement, London has never had the same
                        political power as Paris. For one thing, provincial and local life and
                        government are far too highly developed among us to permit of the
                        centralised ascendancy of anyone city. For another, London is altogether too
                        languid, too social, and too sociable to be a keen politician. There is no
                        city in which it is so hard to start a 'movement.' Its political opinions
                        nine times out of ten are the opinions of clubland and the West End,</p>
                    <p>"No doubt there is much truth in this—and the great political movements of
                        recent years did not have their origin here. At the same time innumerable
                        movements have begun here, as Mr. Brooks may be willing to admit. Take such
                        movements as Æstheticism, Anti-Vaccination, Votes for Women,
                        Bernard-Shawism, Rodinism, Archeritis, the Society of Twelve, and Tubes-all
                        these things had their birth in London, and of some of them London is very
                        proud indeed. ... Mr. Brooks proceeds that the city is at once too big and
                        too much de. pendent on society to have either the concentration or the
                        energy necessary for political leadership, adding that even to its own
                        affairs it is magnificently indifferent. 'It has no civic consciousness' he
                        says, for sense of a corporate life or local pride'. ...</p>
                    <p>"Mr. Brook expresses wonder as to whether or not it is a good thing for a
                        country to be ruled by so overwhelming a capital as we. possess in London.
                        He wants to know if the domination of a Paris or a London is a real or only
                        a seeming advantage. He asks :</p>
                    <p>Does a nation fare better or worse when it escapes the toll which such huge
                        agglomerations exact on the social health, the intellectual alertness, and
                        the politicat virility of the people? : . . Washington is a capital by
                        prenatal malice aforethought; it was to be the capital that it was called
                        into existence. And within the last year or two history has repeated itself
                        in the Antipodes with curious carefulness. The same fears and jealousies
                        that moved Americans over a century ago to fix the seat of the Federal
                        Government on a stretch of marshy woodland, far away from the real life of
                        the nation, have all been stirring the Australian democracy; and the
                        rivalries of the States, and especially of the big cities like Melbourne and
                        Sydney, have finally cast the Australian capital of the future into the
                        outer solitudes.</p>
                    <p>"Having so delivered himself, Mr. Brooks has a statement that will not easily
                        pass muster without range of Bow Bells, which is that the talents of the
                        kingdom are so concentrated on London that England (meaning Britain, no
                        doubt, Mr. Brooks ?) as a whole is left comparatively depleted and
                        stagnant.'"</p>

                        one time Governor of the Lebanon. He was born in Constantinople in 1856 and
                        entered the service of the Imperial Government at the age of 17. He was
                        first attached to the secretariat of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and

                        the first Peace Conference. | Youssouf Pasha Franco has throughout | his
                        career at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs displayed diplomatic abilities of
                        the highest order, and he is a persona gratissima both in Ottoman official
                        circles and in the Diplo| matic Body. No better choice could have been made
                        for the important office his Excellency is now called upon to fill, and we

                    <p>EXHIBITION AT KING'S COLLEGE.</p>
                    <p>The exhibition of the results of the season's work by the Egypt Exploration
                        Fund, which opened last week at King's College, is one of more than usual
                        interest. It represents the finish of one of the greatest works of archæolo
                        gical exploration ever undertaken by an English society. More than fourteen
                        years ago the fund commenced its work of clearing the great temple on the
                        face of the cliffs at Deir el Bahari, near Thebes. This immense edifice, |
                        built by the great Queen Hatshepsu, was one of the wonders of Egypt,
                        differing in style from all other temples, and, especially from the |
                        temples of Thebes. The work entailed not merely the exploration of the
                        temple, but also, as far as possible, a restoration of the edifice by
                        restoring the fallen or broken pieces to their positions, and the removal of
                        Coptic and other buildings which had been built within the temple.</p>
                    <p>All visitors to Egypt are familiar with this beautiful edifice, rising as it
                        does terrace above terrace from the plain to the face of the cliff. The
                        festival hall, the curious birth chamber, the corridor with sculptures
                        representing the naval expedition to the incense land of Persil, now called
                        Somaliland, have all been cleared and restored as far as possible. This work
                        occupied about ten years, and was carried out by Professor Neville, assisted
                        by Mr. Howard Carter. The large temple belonged to the eighteenth dynasty,
                        B.C. 1800. In clearing away the apparent rubbish heaps on the south side of
                        the enclosure, an astonishing find was made of a beautiful funeral temple of
                        Mentuhetys, of the eleventh dynasty. Four Seasons have been devoted to the
                        exploration of this beautiful temple, and the work is now complete, having
                        occupied about fourteen years at an average expenditure of about £1,000 a
                        year. It is from this temple that the objects now exhibited come.</p>
                    <p>THE TOMB OF THE KING. The whole of the edifice was grouped round a central
                        pyramid which marked the tomb of the King. The chief object of this year's
                        work was to find this tomb. After much labour a sloping passage, 600ft.
                        long, was found under the platform, but it was impossible to enter the
                        chamber this way as the huge blocks of sandstone forming the roof had
                        fallen. It was then resolved to dig a side passage into the tomb chamber,
                        and at last entrance was obtained. But tomb robbers had been there before.
                        There are here exhibited many objects of interest-funeral boats, little
                        models of groups of servants, bows, arrows, and staffs of office, which had
                        been in many cases stripped. of their gold plating. One very fine boat with
                        a double line of oars is exhibited. In the centre of the tomb was a great
                        shrine, over 12ft. high and 10ft. wide, constructed of translucent
                        alabaster, but it was too heavy to move.</p>
                    <p>By far the most attractive portion of this exhibition will be the beautiful
                        painted sculptures in a style peculiar to the period, and probably the work
                        of Mertisen, who was the Court artist and sculptor of that day, The
                        portraits of the King and his queens, especially the Queen Aashait, exhited
                        on Table B, have a delicacy of workmanship that is most astonishing. The
                        coloured hieroglyphics are really miniature works of art. The procession of
                        princesses is a beautiful piece of drawing. Especially t be noticed are the
                        painted scenes</p>
                    <p>from the Chapel of the Princess Kemsit, pro- bably a negress. This work of
                        art and the mummy of the lady will be fouud later in the British Museum.
                        Students of art should notice the hunting scenes and the fine drawing of
                        birds. There is only one warlike scene, and that appears to represent a war
                        against the people of Sinai.</p>
                    <p>THE SMALLER EXHIBITS. In the clearing up many sinall objects of great
                        interest were found, such as workmen's tools, hammers, nails, chisels, and
                        paint brushes. The display of the beautiful blue glazed ware, used
                        especially as votive offerings to Hathor, the goddess of the turquoise land,
                        is very fine. The textile work is also good, including painted pieces of
                        linen with figures of a whole family, and especially rare are the pieces of
                        linen with beads interwoven, not sewn on. Mention of some curious pilgrim
                        "ex votos" must be made. These are tracings 1 of men's sandals, with their
                        names scratched l in the middle. If the exhibition is somewhat mixed, it
                        represents the completion of a great work. Next season the fund will
                        undertake Tavtensive work at Abydos.</p>

                    <head>ROWING. CAPTAIN DARELLS VICTORY. </head>
                    <p> The victory at Henley of Captain Darell, who belongs to the Army of
                        Occupation at Cairo, has around considerable interest among that officer's
                        many friends in Egypt. Mr. Aug. Nickolls comments on the feat in the
                        following words: </p>
                    <p> The Diamond Sculls provided some excellent racing. The heat between the
                        veteran Blackstaffe and Captain Darell, won by the latter by half a length,
                        was a real treat, honours being almost equally divided. It was also good to
                        see the Guardsman scull Herr Barnhard von Gaza to a standstill a quarter of
                        a mile from the finish in the ante-fipal. MacCulloch, the Oxford freshman,
                        was badly boated, and he won an unsatisfactory race against R. V. Powell,
                        who stopped for him when he took a pile at the end of 70 seconds' sculling.
                        The Henley Regatta Committee should make a strict rule that ne boat should
                        be allowed to wait for an opponent who steers off the course. After all, bad
                        steering should be just as much a disqualification for victory as bad
                        sculling. If a man stops when his adversary makes a mistake he is naturally
                        called a good sportsman, but after all why should he wait, especially if he
                        has other races to row or scull ? Captain Darell is a very much improved
                        sculler; he stays well and goes fast. His victory was well deserved, and the
                        ordinary layman does not fully realise what a Guardsman has to give up in
                        order to train for the Diamonds. MacCulloch sculled well, and he has time
                        and youth in his favour ; he is a natural waterman, but has got to learn how
                        to row himself ont. With careful training and coaching and a strengthening
                        op of his will power the highest honours are easily within his grasp. </p>
