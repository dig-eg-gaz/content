                        HORROR.</head>
                    <dateline>St. Petersburg, January 21.</dateline>
                    <p>The situation here is most serious. The town is in partial darkness. The
                        papers will probably be unable to appear. The civil employes at the Arsenal
                        have joined the strikers. It is feared that the railway and telegraph
                        operators will also join. A monster demonstration was held on Sunday in
                        front of the Winter Palace, in order to present a petition to the Tsar. The
                        petition, which was the most remarkable and outspoken document ever
                        presented to an autocrat, declared that the people were insulted and treated
                        like slaves, burdened with labour beyond their strength, stifled by
                        despotism and the intolerable yoke of officialdom the injustice of which had
                        reached its limit. Death was preferable to the fearful sufferings of the
                        people. National representation was indispensable, immediate convocation of
                        the representatives of all classes was the sole balm for the people’s
                        wounds. The petition says “Satisfy these demands and you make Russia happy
                        and glorious. If you do not reply to the people's prayer, we prefer to die
                        in the Square before your Palace.</p>
                    <p>The Prefect has issued a notice forbidding gatherings and processions, which
                        workmen and the public are warned to avoid, as the employment of the
                        military may cause accidents.</p>

                    <p>The prefect's notice was issued especially in view of the notification that
                        400,000 men are to march on Sunday afternoon to the Palace. They will be
                        headed by a young priest, <persName
                            ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q299681?uselang=fr">Father
                            Gapon</persName>, in canonicals with crucifix, who is heart and soul in
                        the movement. The workmen will insist upon seeing the Tsar himself.</p>
                    <p>It is noteworthy that the garrison here is about 40,000, largely composed of
                        reservists. Hitherto the police have been absolutely passive. People are
                        nervous and excited. Everyone is buying candles anticipating a stoppage of
                        the gas and electric light. The newspapers have not been published.</p>
                    <p>A deputation of three workmen has gone to Tsarskoe Selo, with the object of
                        trying to deliver the text of the petition, so as to enable the Tsar to
                        consider it before the monster demonstration.</p>
                    <p>Father Gapon has selected 400 picked men to act as a bodyguard to the Tsar if
                        the latter consents to meet the people. Gapon also has a personal bodyguard
                        of 50 men in order to prevent his arrest.</p>
                    <p>All the cavalry regiments are concentrated here, from the surrounding
                        barracks. Other regiments are being hurried up from Reval, Riga and
                        elsewhere, as it is feared that the troops of the ordinary garrison would
                        not fire on the demonstrators in the event of disorders.</p>

                    <p>About 2 o clock the crowd invaded the approaches to the Winter Palace. The
                        troops fired, 130 men and women being killed.</p>
                    <p>At 3.40 p.m. a conflict on Nevsky Prospect caused the deaths of thirty

                    <p>Early in the morning ike Cossacks and other troops marched to the Winter
                        Palace. Detachments of cavalry and infantry, each 150 strong, were stationed
                        at various points of the city, but the artillery were concealed from view.
                        15,000 strikers started from the Neva works for the Winter Palace. Their
                        route was barred by Cossacks, who fired three volleys in blank, charged the
                        strikers with heavy whips, and finally drove back the demonstrators. It is
                        unknown bow many were killed and injured.</p>
                    <p>A furious conflict took place between the soldiers and the strikers round the
                        Winter Palace square. The troops, who were driven hack by the weight of the
                        mob, fired repeatedly and finally dispersed the crowd. There were 150 killed
                        and wounded. The strikers are now infuriated and are erecting wire
                        entanglements, tearing down the telegraph poles, and raising barricades.
                        They are organising an armed resistance. Sanguinary conflicts are taking
                        place all over the city.</p>
                    <p>The Police Superintendent is among the killed and Father Gapon among the
                        wounded.</p>

                    <p>(Later). Fatal conflicts between the strikers are taking place in every
                        quarter of the city. The excitement is increasing. The crowd on Nicholas
                        Bridge was stopped by the infantry and Uhlan Cossacks. The strikers appealed
                        to the soldiers not to shoot their brothers. The infantry laid down their
                        rifles but the Cossasks charged, wounding many. The Tsar remains at Tsarkoe
                        Selo.</p>
                    <p>Many women and children have been killed and wounded. The scenes are
                        indescribable. The air is rent with cries of women and the angry shouts of
                        men. The city appears to be plunged in an open revolution. A night of horror
                        is in prospect. (Reuter.)</p>

                        fell into the hands of the mob. Their swords and epaulettes were torn off.

                    <p>It was announced on Wednesday that the list of invitations to the Ball given
                        By his Highness the Khedive on the 20th instant was closed, over 1,400
                        invitations having already been issued. Judging from the crowded aspect of
                        the rooms at Abdeen Palace on Friday evening, there can have been but few
                        absentees from this, the most important social function of the Cairo
                        Season.</p>
                    <p>In view of the enormous number of his guests, the Khedive confined himself to
                        receiving only the most important, among whom H.R.H. Prince Gustavus
                        Adolphus of Norway and Sweden was, of course, the principal. An Egyptian
                        guard of honor escorted the Prince from Shepheard's Hotel to the palace,
                        where he arrived about half-past ten. Prince Mohamed Aly Pasha and other
                        members of the Khedivial House, the whole of the Diplomatic Corps, the
                        Ministers, and the officers of the Army of Occupation and Egyptian Army, as
                        well as all the leading members of the English and foreign communities, were
                        also present.</p>
                    <p>The scene was of truly regal magnificence. The gilded saloons brilliantly
                        illuminated, formed a fitting background to the array of gorgeous uniforms
                        and beautiful gowns and the dazzling display of orders and jewels. In the
                        ball-room the private bond of the Khedive played a spirited selection and
                        dancing was kept up with great vigour, Prince Gustavus Adolphus and the
                        members of his suite proving themselves adepts at this fast vanishing
                        art.</p>
                    <p>In the early part of the evening the Khedivah received a number of the lady
                        guests in a saloon near the ball-room. The Khedive entertained the principal
                        guests of the evening at sapper in a private room, the large supper room was
                        thrown open at midnight and the long tables which lined it on three sides
                        were immediately besieged. In a short time the vast saloon became so crowded
                        that it was difficult to find standing room. The fare provided was of the
                        most sumptuous kind, and almost justified the scramble that was made to
                        procure it.</p>
                    <p>Amid such a galaxy of pretty dresses it is difficult to single out any for
                        special remark. The Countess of Cromer wore a stately gown of oyster-white’
                        satin; Mme. van der Does de Villebois looked well in a mauve dress, and her
                        daughters wore frocks of pale yellow and pale blue Crepe de Chine
                        respectively. Mrs. Pindlay was in a black dress with sequiu trimming. Lady
                        Palmer wore light blue arranged with cream-colored net. Lady Rogers also
                        wore blue, a striking gown ot dark, 'royal blue’ shade, relieved by white
                        muslin and lace at the neck and sleeves. Another most effective gown was
                        worn by Mi»s Slade ; this was of chiffon-velvet in a pale shade of yellow,
                        with a pompadour desigu of red roses and other flowers upon it : made in the
                        princess style, it was bordered by a deep, transparent flounce of black
                        sequined lace over cream colour. Pink was the prevailing color. Mrs.
                        Mellwraith wore it, and Miss Royle's gown of the same hue was very dainty
                        and becoming. Madame Harari Pasba was attired in a smart frock of
                        orange-pink silk. Mrs. Arnold Perry’s costume of white mousseline de soie
                        patterned with pale pink roses was admired. Mrs. Hunter wore a picturesque
                        frock of black taffetas, the skirt gathered very full and the bodice à la
                        Marie Antoinette, a band of laoe-like passementerie simulating the wide
                        effect of the fichu which it replaced. Mrs. Watson looked exceedingly well
                        in white satin with flounces of fiue point d Alençon lace, and her war
                        medals as her only ornaments. Mrs. Hooker wore cre'pe de Chine of a deep
                        violet shade. Chiffon-velvet, rucked and tucked, and the skirts arranged in
                        a multiplicity of full, rich folds, was the dernier cri of fashion. Mme. de
                        Martino Pasha wore a handsome pale-blue gown of this material ; Mrs.
                        Campbell was in grey velvet. Taffetas, very sheeny and crisp, was much seen,
                        and soft ‘Liberty’ satins were also popular. Fine nets were much used, and
                        spotted muslins were greatly in vogue for the toilette de jeune fille.
                        Another pretty girl's frock was of soft blue satin, with a "three-decker'
                        skirt, and a large bunch of Parma violets on the bodice. An exquisite gown
                        was of fine black net over white, arranged in Directoire style, with narrow
                        straps of black velvet ribbon across the front and a garniture of pale blue
                        tru-lover's knots and beautiful white lace.</p>

                        and lined its whole length. The queue was well preserved, but we are
                        inclined to think that the’ manipulation of the traffic Joining the main
                        from the side streets was not as perfect as it has been on fermer occasions,
                        and caused some unnecessary delay.</p>
