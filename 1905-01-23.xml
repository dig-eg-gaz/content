                    <head>RUSSIA'S PLIGHT.</head>
                    <p>Every fresh telegram bears witness to the acute state of unrest in Russia,
                        and this morning's despatches from St. Petersburg show that the Tsar has had
                        thousands of his hapless subjects slaughtered in order to preserve his
                        autocracy. The butchery of the populace yester day afternoon in the streets
                        of the Russian capital is a striking commentary on the Tsar's answer to the
                        demands of the Zemstvos delegates a few weeks ago, when he offered as a
                        counter attraction to the franchise, "civil tranquillity and the
                        uninterrupted satisfaction of the daily needs of the people." But neither
                        the empty words of the Tsar's decree nor the ruthless destruction of the
                        hapless workmen yesterday will have any effect in quashing the revolution,
                        although it may be postponed. If the habitually brutal methods of Russian
                        officialdom are successful, the revolutionary movement may be crushed for
                        the time being, for rulers often go very near the precipice without falling
                        over. On the other hand, it is by no means impossible that the events of
                        yesterday after- Loon may precipitate a really serious crisis. Suppose the
                        news of the massacre is quick <cb n="6"/>ly disseminated throughout the
                        provinces and some sudden madness were to seize upon the peasantry, who for
                        the first time saw their "Little Father" revealed in his true colors. In
                        such a case it is very possible to imagine a general revolt taking place in
                        which al the other disaffected elements in the Empire, from Poland to
                        Russian Armenia, and from Finland to the Jewish Pale, would spring into
                        life. But it may well be doubted whether an immediate and general
                        revolutionary movement is possible, for while war is going on the ins tinct
                        of national self-preservation seems to keep down rebellion even in States
                        whose gene ral condition makes for revolution.</p>
                    <p>The fall of Port Arthur has no doubt been a great factor in bringing about
                        the present crisis, for it has brought home to the people the real position
                        of affairs in the Far East, which has hitherto been obscured by the
                        mendacious optimism of an inspired Press. They see that trade is falling,
                        that employment is evermore scarce, that factories are closing, and that a
                        state of semi-starvation exists in many rural districts; and they ask
                        themselves for what purpose is this war Their own country is not threatened,
                        and like the rest of the world they cannot understand what business their
                        Government has in Manchuria at all. Accordingly they detest this unnecessary
                        war, and their feeling is shown in the increasing difficulty which the
                        Russian War Office experiences in getting the Reservists to join the colors.
                        But there are even graver elements of disaffection at work among other great
                        sections of the population, besides the actual Russians themselves. The last
                        ten years has seen the growth within Russia ot a vast number of political
                        enemies to the Russian Government. The policy of forcible Russifi cation has
                        been carried out relentlessly, and apparently successfully, but not without
                        much heart-burning. The best known case is that. of Finland, but other
                        non-Russian nationalities have suffered almost as much. The Finns cannot
                        revolt, but it is impossible to doubt that the dearest wish of the majority
                        of the population is to escape from the iron circle of the Empire which is
                        oppressing them. The Poles remain, as always, irreconcilable, even though
                        they may consider that the Russian Government treats them better than does
                        the German. These cases are patent; but it must also be remembered that the
                        Bussification of the Baltic provinces, and the cold shoulder shown to the
                        German and Lutheran elements in those districts, have produced anything but
                        loyalty and confidence in an important, if numerically small, class.
                        Something of the same kind has been going on on the other side of the
                        Empire. The Armenians were once held in great esteem in Russia, Loris
                        Melikhof actually rising to the very highest place in the bureaucracy. Now,
                        however, the Armenians receive little fa vor, and the whole property of the
                        Ar menian Church in Russia has been con fiscated in order to force them to
                        enter the Orthodox Communion. The Armenians bear the persecution ill, and
                        must now be counted among the disaffected sub-nationalities in Russia.
                        Lastly, there are the Jews. With the massacre of Kishineff before their
                        eyes, and the whole terrible story of the Anti-Jewish movement, can we
                        wonder that they are restless and unfriendly? But in Russia the disaffection
                        of the Jews does not mean, as it would in France or Germany, the
                        disaffection of a small, if powerful, body. It means the hostility of
                        several millions of men concentrated in a special area. The fact is that in
                        Russia just now only the Slavonic and Tartar elements are allowed to come to
                        the front, while the men of the other nationalities, unless they become
                        members of the Orthodox Church, are depressed, and even persecuted. As a
                        result, the political power of Russia and her administrative effi ciency
                        have greatly suffered, while at the same time a sense of oppression has
                        invaded bodies of men who in a former geueration were good Russians. Never,
                        indeed, has the political folly of persecution, civil and reli gious, been
                        made more plain. In addition to these dangers of a racial nature must be
                        reckoned those which come from the growth of Socialism and Nihilism within
                        the Russian body politic. The Russian Nihilist may be less dangerous than he
                        was; but the growth of Socialism and of liberal ideas has been steadily
                        progressing. And the Russian revolutionary does not do things by halves. The
                        man who wants revolution in Russia does not mind with whom he co-operates in
                        order to get it, and yesterday afternoon's massacre will weld together the
                        numerous dissatisfied elements of Russian society against the ruthless and
                        wicked despotism of Russian Administration.</p>

                            <p>The situation here is most serious. The town is in partial darkness.
                                The papers will probably be unable to appear. The civil employes at
                                the Arsenal have joined the strikers. It is feared that the railway
                                and telegraph operators will also join. A monster demonstration was
                                held on Sunday in front of the Winter Palace, in order to present a
                                petition to the Tsar. The petition, which was the most remarkable
                                and outspoken document ever presented to an autocrat, declared that
                                the people were insulted and treated like slaves, burdened with
                                labour beyond their strength, stifled by despotism and the
                                intolerable yoke of officialdom the injustice of which had reached
                                its limit. Death was preferable to the fearful sufferings of the
                                people. National representation was indispensable, immediate
                                convocation of the representatives of all classes was the sole balm
                                for the people's wounds. The petition says "Satisfy these demands
                                and you make Russia happy and glorious. If you do not reply to the
                                people's prayer, we prefer to die in the Square before your
                                Palace.</p>
                            <p>The Prefect has issued a notice forbidding gatherings and
                                processions, which workmen and the public are warned to avoid, as
                                the employment of the military may cause accidents.</p>

                            <p>The prefect's notice was issued especially in view of the
                                notification that 400,000 men are to march on Sunday afternoon to
                                the Palace. They will be headed by a young priest, <persName

                                soul in the movement. The workmen will insist upon seeing the Tsar
                                himself.</p>
                            <p>It is noteworthy that the garrison here is about 40,000, largely
                                composed of reservists. Hitherto the police have been absolutely
                                passive. People are nervous and excited. Everyone is buying candles
                                anticipating a stoppage of the gas and electric light. The
                                newspapers have not been published.</p>
                            <p>A deputation of three workmen has gone to Tsarskoe Selo, with the
                                object of trying to deliver the text of the petition, so as to
                                enable the Tsar to consider it before the monster demonstration.</p>
                            <p>Father Gapon has selected 400 picked men to act as a bodyguard to the
                                Tsar if the latter consents to meet the people. Gapon also has a
                                personal bodyguard of 50 men in order to prevent his arrest.</p>
                            <p>All the cavalry regiments are concentrated here, from the surrounding
                                barracks. Other regiments are being hurried up from Reval, Riga and
                                elsewhere, as it is feared that the troops of the ordinary garrison
                                would not fire on the demonstrators in the event of disorders.</p>

                                Winter Palace. Detachments of cavalry and infantry, each 150 strong,
                                were stationed at various points of the city, but the artillery were
                                concealed from view. 15,000 strikers started from the Neva works for
                                the Winter Palace. Their route was barred by Cossacks, who fired
                                three volleys in blank, charged the strikers with heavy whips, and
                                finally drove back the demonstrators. It is unknown bow many were

                                telegraph poles, and raising barricades. They are organising an

                                on Nicholas Bridge was stopped by the infantry and Uhlan Cossacks.
                                The strikers appealed to the soldiers not to shoot their brothers.

                                The troops were firing recklessly, but one regiment is reported to
                                have refused to fire. All classes appear inflamed alike. A number of
                                wounded officers fell into the hands of the mob. Their swords and
                                epaulettes were torn off. The ambulances are busy everywhere.

                            apology for the scurrilous, dastardly and cowardly attack made, without
                            the slightest provocation, upon the reputation of a person you have had
                            no dealings with, either directly or indirectly, and, evidently, do not

                        Adolphus of Norway and Sweden was, of course, the principal. An Egyptian
                        guard of honor escorted the Prince from Shepheard's Hotel to the palace,
                        where he arrived about half-past ten. Prince Mohamed Aly Pasha and other

                        Ministers, and the officers of the Army of Occupation and Egyptian Army, as
                        well as all the leading members of the English and foreign communities, were
                        also present.</p>
                    <p>The scene was of truly regal magnificence. The gilded saloons brilliantly
                        illuminated, formed a fitting background to the array of gorgeous uniforms
                        and beautiful gowns and the dazzling display of orders and jewels. In the
                        ball-room the private bond of the Khedive played a spirited selection and
                        dancing was kept up with great vigour, Prince Gustavus Adolphus and the
                        members of his suite proving themselves adepts at this fast vanishing
                        art.</p>
                    <p>In the early part of the evening the Khedivah received a number of the lady
                        guests in a saloon near the ball-room. The Khedive entertained the principal
                        guests of the evening at sapper in a private room, the large supper room was
                        thrown open at midnight and the long tables which lined it on three sides
                        were immediately besieged. In a short time the vast saloon became so crowded
                        that it was difficult to find standing room. The fare provided was of the
                        most sumptuous kind, and almost justified the scramble that was made to
                        procure it.</p>
                    <p>Amid such a galaxy of pretty dresses it is difficult to single out any for
                        special remark. The Countess of Cromer wore a stately gown of oyster-white'
                        satin; Mme. van der Does de Villebois looked well in a mauve dress, and her
                        daughters wore frocks of pale yellow and pale blue Crepe de Chine
                        respectively. Mrs. Pindlay was in a black dress with sequiu trimming. Lady
                        Palmer wore light blue arranged with cream-colored net. Lady Rogers also
                        wore blue, a striking gown ot dark, 'royal blue' shade, relieved by white
                        muslin and lace at the neck and sleeves. Another most effective gown was
                        worn by Mi»s Slade ; this was of chiffon-velvet in a pale shade of yellow,
                        with a pompadour desigu of red roses and other flowers upon it : made in the
                        princess style, it was bordered by a deep, transparent flounce of black
                        sequined lace over cream colour. Pink was the prevailing color. Mrs.
                        Mellwraith wore it, and Miss Royle's gown of the same hue was very dainty
                        and becoming. Madame Harari Pasba was attired in a smart frock of
                        orange-pink silk. Mrs. Arnold Perry's costume of white mousseline de soie
                        patterned with pale pink roses was admired. Mrs. Hunter wore a picturesque
                        frock of black taffetas, the skirt gathered very full and the bodice à la
                        Marie Antoinette, a band of laoe-like passementerie simulating the wide
                        effect of the fichu which it replaced. Mrs. Watson looked exceedingly well
                        in white satin with flounces of fiue point d Alençon lace, and her war
                        medals as her only ornaments. Mrs. Hooker wore cre'pe de Chine of a deep
                        violet shade. Chiffon-velvet, rucked and tucked, and the skirts arranged in
                        a multiplicity of full, rich folds, was the dernier cri of fashion. Mme. de
                        Martino Pasha wore a handsome pale-blue gown of this material ; Mrs.
                        Campbell was in grey velvet. Taffetas, very sheeny and crisp, was much seen,
                        and soft 'Liberty' satins were also popular. Fine nets were much used, and
                        spotted muslins were greatly in vogue for the toilette de jeune fille.
                        Another pretty girl's frock was of soft blue satin, with a "three-decker'
                        skirt, and a large bunch of Parma violets on the bodice. An exquisite gown
                        was of fine black net over white, arranged in Directoire style, with narrow
                        straps of black velvet ribbon across the front and a garniture of pale blue
                        tru-lover's knots and beautiful white lace.</p>

                        arrangements for control ling the carriages en route for Abdeen appeared to
                        be very complete ; a strong force commanded the entrance! to Abdeen Street
                        and lined its whole length. The queue was well preserved, but we are
                        inclined to think that the' manipulation of the traffic Joining the main
                        from the side streets was not as perfect as it has been on fermer occasions,
                        and caused some unnecessary delay.</p>

                    <p>Last Saturday's small dance was attended with the usual success. The
                        restaurant was again quite full, and an additional private dining-room bad
                        to be converted into a restaurant to accommodate all who had ordered tables.
                        The list of diners would take up too much space. We may however mention
                        Tueni Bey's party, including Prinoe Djamil Toussouo, Prince Aly Paxil and
                        Princess Fazil, M. Raphael Suares, Mme. and Mile. Sursock, M. and Mme.
                        Michel Tueni The Duke of Montremart was with Prince de Tonnay Charente and
                        Marquis d'Audriffed Pasquier. M. and Mme. Çhoremi were with M. and Mme.
                        Benacbi and M. and Mme. Trehaki. Mr. Thubron had a party of 6 ; Mr. Charles
                        Royle a party of 7, including Miss Royle, Mr. and Mrs. Drummond-Hay, and Dr.
                        and Mrs. Warnock ; M. de Bilinsky a party of 8, including Mr. and Mrs.

                        Findlay, and Mr. Greville</p>
                    <p>We also noticed Lady Clarke, Mrs. Jay, Mr. Carter Wilson, Major E Herbert,

                    <p>The restaurant was also well filled for sapper.</p>
                    <p>Owing to the increasing success of the Savoy small dances, the management has
                        decided to give an extra small dance on Tuesday, 31st inst. The Saturday's
                        small dance will take place every week as usual.</p>
                    <p>There will also be a small danoe on Friday evening next, after the concert

                        concerned, Russia must sooner or later turn her eyes once more to india For
                        such an invasion she requires no Rodjestvensky. Her troops are practically
                        on the frontier, her railways are ready to be laid, and the plan of campaign
                        has been carefully prepared. To resist such an attack, instant
                        reinforcements from this country would be absolutely necessary. That means
                        fast transports to Bombay and Karachi rid the Suez Canal.</p>
                    <p>A POSSIBILITY</p>
                    <p>Now, without suggesting for a moment the possibility of any sympathetic
                        laxity on the part of the custodians of the Canal, it is obvious that "a
                        regrettable incident" in the shape of an "accidental" obstruction of the
                        waterway might Basily be brought about at a crisis when delay would be of
                        vital importance to us; in fact, if my memory serves me correctly, something
                        of the kind did actually occur during the period of the Arabi troubles, when
                        troops from India were delayed by the stranding of a merchant Steamer which
                        was not removed until Lord Alcester threatened to send up a force of blue-
                        jackets to do the work. It is quite true that our fleets can protect the
                        ends of the Canal, hat it is not at the ends the mischief would ceur, but in
                        the fairway, open to merchant ships of all nations.</p>

                        the claims of shipowners and other in the commercial world for better
                        treatment from these Canal directors, and place in the front rank the
                        imperative necessity, from the point of view of our national existence, for
                        the construction of an inde pendent Canal across the Isthmus of Suez 1 I go
                        further, and say that only by some such independent means of communication

                        will think twice before commencing operations against India, but so long as
                        we are restricted to one waterway, and that not controlled by ourselves, the
                        temptation to Kussin to gratify her life-long ambition a most rresistible.
                        Now a glance at THE IMPERIAL SITUATION. Consider the extraordinary anomaly
                        of the position. We as a country do the bulk of the Fastern trade both in
                        ships and merchandise, the ports of destination being in most cases those
                        belonging to the Empire: India, with <cb n="2"/> its £75,000,000 of trade,
                        the Straits; the treaty ports of China, commercially almostentirely ours
                        Australia, and New Zealand.</p>
                    <p>The whole of this immense trade, with the exception of a considerable slice
                        which the exactions of the Canal Company seem to have driven via the Cape,
                        is condemned to pass tinough this narrow isthmus, controlled and poled by
                        aliens, leaving behind it as toll the large sam of over one hundred millions
                        of franes annually The very country through which the Canal is cut is now,
                        in effect, British soil. What country except poor patient England would
                        stand it No one seeks to deprive the descendants of the courageous Lesseps
                        and their compatriots of their concession, though the said concession was
                        granted by a Sultan of Turkey long before the British -occupation of Egypt,
                        and under such circumstances some of our neighbours might not be so
                        particular, but it is quite another matter to say that no other waterway
                        must be built. A man can do what he likes with his own.</p>
                    <p>THE PRESENT COMPANY</p>
                    <p>have no exclusive right to the sands and lakes of the isthmus, they never
                        had. Therefore, if grievances exist and I gather that they do -the Company
                        must expect opposition. Commercially speaking, Egypt cannot fail to benefit
                        by a multiplicity of waterways, and her sagacious ruler, Lord Cromer, may be
                        trusted to look after the interests of a country which has progressed so
                        famously under his able régime. Egypt has been very badly treated by the
                        Canal. Compelled, owing to the heavy mortalty, to withdraw the corvée, or
                        forced labour, the Canal Company made Egypt pay some £1,200,000 damages.
                        India can only view with alarm the continuance of the present exorbitant
                        impost on her trade; and Lord Curzon, than whom no man has a better grasp ot
                        his Empire's immense potentialities, would, I feel sure, be the first to
                        advocate</p>
                    <p>A BRITISH CANAL</p>
                    <p>with moderate dues. In regard to Australasia, we are looking for a commercial
                        boud of union with the mother country, and yet we tolerate this toll of 4s.
                        to 88. per ton on her imports and our exports. There is no question here as
                        to who benefits by the tax; it is the Canal Company. Apart from these all
                        important considerations, the British, and indeed the German and French,
                        shipowner considers that on more than one point the Canal directors have
                        broken faith with him, and the present strained position has arisen. I
                        sincerely trust the matter will be forced to a conclusion. It is not a
                        reduction in dues and amelioration of condi ons that are wanted. I observe
                        the directors think to appease their clients by the offer of a reduction of
                        half a frauc per ton. This from the present charge of 84 trans Could any
                        thing be more ridiculous! It is not a reduction n dues that is wanted. It is
                        a new C'anal However important from 24 national and Imperial point of view
                        this may be, we are a commercial people, and it will be on a commercial
                        basis</p>
                    <p>THE BRITISH CANAL</p>
                    <p>will be built. A proposition that shows a sound 8 to 10 per cent. return,
                        taking only half the present dues and half the present tonnage using the
                        Canal, cannot fail to appeal to the commercial instincts of this country,
                        and, backed by the vast shipping and trading interests of the kingdom,
                        counselled by the heads of Empire beyond the seas, and commended by the
                        highest naval and military authorities at home, it would be a bold Ministry
                        which, for the sake of difficulties possibly temporary, would venture to
                        withhold its sanction from such a scheme.</p>

                        finish, which however only resulted in a dead heat for second place as
                        Bimbashi, keeping an inside course, won cleverly by a neck. Sinbad was last.
