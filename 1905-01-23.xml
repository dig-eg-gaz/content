                    <p>The situation here is most serious. The town is in partial darkness. The
                        papers will probably be unable to appear. The civil employes at the Arsenal
                        have joined the strikers. It is feared that the railway and telegraph
                        operators will also join. A monster demonstration was held on Sunday in
                        front of the Winter Palace, in order to present a petition to the Tsar. The
                        petition, which was the most remarkable and outspoken document ever
                        presented to an autocrat, declared that the people were insulted and treated
                        like slaves, burdened with labour beyond their strength, stifled by
                        despotism and the intolerable yoke of officialdom the injustice of which had
                        reached its limit. Death was preferable to the fearful sufferings of the
                        people. National representation was indispensable, immediate convocation of
                        the representatives of all classes was the sole balm for the people’s
                        wounds. The petition says “Satisfy these demands and you make Russia happy
                        and glorious. If you do not reply to the people's prayer, we prefer to die
                        in the Square before your Palace.</p>
                    <p>The Prefect has issued a notice forbidding gatherings and processions, which
                        workmen and the public are warned to avoid, as the employment of the
                        military may cause accidents.</p>

                    <p>The prefect's notice was issued especially in view of the notification that
                        400,000 men are to march on Sunday afternoon to the Palace. They will be
                        headed by a young priest, <persName
                            ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q299681?uselang=fr">Father
                            Gapon</persName>, in canonicals with crucifix, who is heart and soul in
                        the movement. The workmen will insist upon seeing the Tsar himself.</p>
                    <p>It is noteworthy that the garrison here is about 40,000, largely composed of
                        reservists. Hitherto the police have been absolutely passive. People are
                        nervous and excited. Everyone is buying candles anticipating a stoppage of
                        the gas and electric light. The newspapers have not been published.</p>
                    <p>A deputation of three workmen has gone to Tsarskoe Selo, with the object of
                        trying to deliver the text of the petition, so as to enable the Tsar to
                        consider it before the monster demonstration.</p>
                    <p>Father Gapon has selected 400 picked men to act as a bodyguard to the Tsar if
                        the latter consents to meet the people. Gapon also has a personal bodyguard
                        of 50 men in order to prevent his arrest.</p>
                    <p>All the cavalry regiments are concentrated here, from the surrounding
                        barracks. Other regiments are being hurried up from Reval, Riga and
                        elsewhere, as it is feared that the troops of the ordinary garrison would
                        not fire on the demonstrators in the event of disorders.</p>

                        troops fired, 130 men and women being killed.</p>

                        Palace. Detachments of cavalry and infantry, each 150 strong, were stationed
                        at various points of the city, but the artillery were concealed from view.
                        15,000 strikers started from the Neva works for the Winter Palace. Their
                        route was barred by Cossacks, who fired three volleys in blank, charged the
                        strikers with heavy whips, and finally drove back the demonstrators. It is
                        unknown bow many were killed and injured.</p>
                    <p>A furious conflict took place between the soldiers and the strikers round the
                        Winter Palace square. The troops, who were driven hack by the weight of the
                        mob, fired repeatedly and finally dispersed the crowd. There were 150 killed
                        and wounded. The strikers are now infuriated and are erecting wire
                        entanglements, tearing down the telegraph poles, and raising barricades.
                        They are organising an armed resistance. Sanguinary conflicts are taking
                        place all over the city.</p>
                    <p>The Police Superintendent is among the killed and Father Gapon among the
                        wounded.</p>

                    <p>(Later). Fatal conflicts between the strikers are taking place in every
                        quarter of the city. The excitement is increasing. The crowd on Nicholas
                        Bridge was stopped by the infantry and Uhlan Cossacks. The strikers appealed
                        to the soldiers not to shoot their brothers. The infantry laid down their
                        rifles but the Cossasks charged, wounding many. The Tsar remains at Tsarkoe
                        Selo.</p>
                    <p>Many women and children have been killed and wounded. The scenes are
                        indescribable. The air is rent with cries of women and the angry shouts of
                        men. The city appears to be plunged in an open revolution. A night of horror
                        is in prospect. (Reuter.)</p>

                    <p>The mob has erected two barricades at Basilisland from which they refuse to
                        retreat despite the repeated volleys of the troops. They are also trying to
                        erect barricades on the Nevsky Prospect.</p>
                    <p>At five o’clock the hiring was going on in every quarter of the city. The
                        troops were firing recklessly, but one regiment is reported to have refused
                        to fire. All classes appear inflamed alike. A number of wounded officers
                        fell into the hands of the mob. Their swords and epaulettes were torn off.
                        The ambulances are busy everywhere. (Reuter.)</p>

                        <head>DETAILED REPORT.</head>
                        <p>It was announced on Wednesday that the list of invitations to the Ball
                            given By his Highness the Khedive on the 20th instant was closed, over
                            1,400 invitations having already been issued. Judging from the crowded
                            aspect of the rooms at Abdeen Palace on Friday evening, there can have
                            been but few absentees from this, the most important social function of
                            the Cairo Season.</p>
                        <p>In view of the enormous number of his guests, the Khedive confined
                            himself to receiving only the most important, among whom H.R.H. Prince
                            Gustavus Adolphus of Norway and Sweden was, of course, the principal. An
                            Egyptian guard of honor escorted the Prince from Shepheard's Hotel to
                            the palace, where he arrived about half-past ten. Prince Mohamed Aly
                            Pasha and other members of the Khedivial House, the whole of the
                            Diplomatic Corps, the Ministers, and the officers of the Army of
                            Occupation and Egyptian Army, as well as all the leading members of the
                            English and foreign communities, were also present.</p>
                        <p>The scene was of truly regal magnificence. The gilded saloons brilliantly
                            illuminated, formed a fitting background to the array of gorgeous
                            uniforms and beautiful gowns and the dazzling display of orders and
                            jewels. In the ball-room the private bond of the Khedive played a
                            spirited selection and dancing was kept up with great vigour, Prince
                            Gustavus Adolphus and the members of his suite proving themselves adepts
                            at this fast vanishing art.</p>
                        <p>In the early part of the evening the Khedivah received a number of the
                            lady guests in a saloon near the ball-room. The Khedive entertained the
                            principal guests of the evening at sapper in a private room, the large
                            supper room was thrown open at midnight and the long tables which lined
                            it on three sides were immediately besieged. In a short time the vast
                            saloon became so crowded that it was difficult to find standing room.
                            The fare provided was of the most sumptuous kind, and almost justified
                            the scramble that was made to procure it.</p>
                        <p>Amid such a galaxy of pretty dresses it is difficult to single out any
                            for special remark. The Countess of Cromer wore a stately gown of
                            oyster-white’ satin; Mme. van der Does de Villebois looked well in a
                            mauve dress, and her daughters wore frocks of pale yellow and pale blue
                            Crepe de Chine respectively. Mrs. Pindlay was in a black dress with
                            sequiu trimming. Lady Palmer wore light blue arranged with cream-colored
                            net. Lady Rogers also wore blue, a striking gown ot dark, 'royal blue’
                            shade, relieved by white muslin and lace at the neck and sleeves.
                            Another most effective gown was worn by Mi»s Slade ; this was of
                            chiffon-velvet in a pale shade of yellow, with a pompadour desigu of red
                            roses and other flowers upon it : made in the princess style, it was
                            bordered by a deep, transparent flounce of black sequined lace over
                            cream colour. Pink was the prevailing color. Mrs. Mellwraith wore it,
                            and Miss Royle's gown of the same hue was very dainty and becoming.
                            Madame Harari Pasba was attired in a smart frock of orange-pink silk.
                            Mrs. Arnold Perry’s costume of white mousseline de soie patterned with
                            pale pink roses was admired. Mrs. Hunter wore a picturesque frock of
                            black taffetas, the skirt gathered very full and the bodice à la Marie
                            Antoinette, a band of laoe-like passementerie simulating the wide effect
                            of the fichu which it replaced. Mrs. Watson looked exceedingly well in
                            white satin with flounces of fiue point d Alençon lace, and her war
                            medals as her only ornaments. Mrs. Hooker wore cre'pe de Chine of a deep
                            violet shade. Chiffon-velvet, rucked and tucked, and the skirts arranged
                            in a multiplicity of full, rich folds, was the dernier cri of fashion.
                            Mme. de Martino Pasha wore a handsome pale-blue gown of this material ;
                            Mrs. Campbell was in grey velvet. Taffetas, very sheeny and crisp, was
                            much seen, and soft ‘Liberty’ satins were also popular. Fine nets were
                            much used, and spotted muslins were greatly in vogue for the toilette de
                            jeune fille. Another pretty girl's frock was of soft blue satin, with a
                            "three-decker' skirt, and a large bunch of Parma violets on the bodice.
                            An exquisite gown was of fine black net over white, arranged in
                            Directoire style, with narrow straps of black velvet ribbon across the
                            front and a garniture of pale blue tru-lover's knots and beautiful white
                            lace.</p>

                            a much later hour that the last of them had quitted the palace. The

                            but we are inclined to think that the’ manipulation of the traffic
                            Joining the main from the side streets was not as perfect as it has been
                            on fermer occasions, and caused some unnecessary delay.</p>
