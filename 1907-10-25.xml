                    <p>Trains run alongside the steamers on the quay, and passengers can be conveyed
                        to Famagusta, Nicosia, Morphou and intermediate stations. Good hotel
                        accommodation for tourists is provided at Famagusta, at the Savoy Hotel (Mr.
                        Najem Houry proprietor). Olympus Hotel, Mount Troodos, 6000 ft. above the
                        sea. Magnificent Scenery. Perfect climate. Season May to end of October. For
                        information apply to Mr. Najem Houry, Managing Director of Cyprus Hotel Co.,
                        Army Contractor, Limassol, Cyprus. There is a good carriage road from Kopia
                        (on Railway) to Troodos. At Famagusta may be seen the fine old Latin
                        Cathedral (now a mosque) begun in 1300 and finished in 1312, together with
                        other ancient ruins and the Venetian fortifications, the finest in the
                        world. Also the tower or palace, the scene of “Othello'' and of Ford's
                        “Lover's Melancholy.'' The climate of Cyprus in the winter months is
                        delightful and the Island will well repay a visit.</p>

                    <head>ASIA MINOR AND MESOPOTAMIA.</head>
                    <p>At an opportune moment there has appear ed an intelligible plea for the
                        Baghdad Railway and for appreciation of the natare and spirit of that German
                        enterprise it is to be foand in the October number of the “Edinburgh
                        Review". The writer abandons for a moment that na tional point of view
                        which, necessary though its acceptance is for the purpose of construe tive
                        purpose of constructive policy, ought never to obscure the larger survey for
                        which his torical study should prepare the statesman. He endeavours to
                        conmder the future of Asia Minor and of Mesopotamia from an examina tion of
                        their past and present condition. We shall attempt to trace the outlines of
                        his thought. In the history of mankind and of its relations to the earth as
                        ite dwelling place there is no contrast so striking as that between the
                        ancient and the modern conditions of the countries between the Bosphorus and
                        the Persian Gulf. Asia Minor from the age of Croesus to that of Diocletian,
                        was a rich and populous and highly civilised country. Its map is covered
                        with the names of towns familiar to all readers of pagan of Christian story,
                        towns which to-day are not only ruined but covered by the dust and earth of
                        centuries. From Troy to Tarrus from Halicarnassas to Trebizond, most of the
                        cities have gone and are known only either by the map, by ruins too great to
                        have been entirely buried, or by the excava tions of modern scholars. In
                        northern Syria, beyonf the Taurus, were some of the most splendid cities of
                        the Graco-Roman world, of which only the names and sometimes a modern town,
                        the remains of some city of the early Calphs are to-day the representatives.
                        From the Gulf of Alexandria to the East coast of the Persian Gulf there runs
                        a great sweep of mountains enclosing a vast plain, watered by the two great
                        rivers that flow southwards from the northern part of the mountain wall,
                        where it supports the highlands of Armenia, and by their tributaries from
                        the ridges of Western Persia. This plain was probably the cradle of
                        civilisation. In the earliest times of which records and monuments are
                        preserved it was the seat of a rich agriculture cherished by a settled
                        government. It has gradually lost its population and its productivity. The
                        rich crops were due not only to a diligent agriculture but also to a
                        systematic and intelligent administra tion, ruling the whole region and
                        carrying irrigation to a degree of excellence that has since never been
                        surpassed, perhaps never been equalled. The decay of government which began
                        long before Alexander and became rapid as the Roman Empire weakened has
                        brought with it the neglect of the canals, the ruin of agricul ture, and the
                        disappearance of population. These contrasts of conditions have had their
                        parallels through not their equals. Egypt, Algeria, and Morocco were in the
                        ancient world civilised and prosperous counries, and Egypt had an
                        agriculture based upon irriga tion which at one time rivialled that of Meso
                        potamia. But there is also a modern contrasr suggesting a new analogy.</p>
                    <p>The complete decay of all the counrties to which reference has been made
                        dates from the decline of the Ottoman Empire in which they were all
                        included. That Empire long ago lost all power of effcient administarion, and
                        the countries where it was most at home were those that decayed the most.
                        Two of them have in modern times been restroed to a new prosperity, which
                        may in time rival that attested by the</p>
                    <cb n="6"/>
                    <p>ancient records. In Egypt first the French and afterwards the English have
                        restored in turn the idea of civilisation and the order due to settled and
                        efficient government. In Ailgerna the French have carried on a similar task
                        which they would tike to undertake in Morocco also. Both nations in these
                        enterprises have left themselves to be and have been recognised as the
                        missionaries of European civilisation to countries tuat were mach in need of
                        it. The attention of Germany, fully equal in her civilisation and her energy
                        for its propagation to either of them, has had her attention direct ed
                        towards Asiatic Turkey. This is no new thing it dates from the reign of
                        Sultan Mabmoed II who engaged German officers to aasist him in reforming his
                        army, officers who were among be early scientific explorers of Asin Minor
                        and Mesopotamia, and whe have been followed by a long succession of
                        geographical and historical pinoneers. The result has been that Germany hae
                        taken &amp; growing interest io Asia Minor and Mesopotamia, has heen
                        represented by many fruitful researches of every kind, and has in recent
                        years attempted in various ways that "peaceful penetration” of which England
                        and France have given so many examples. Thus it has come about that German
                        men of business have of late years taken the lead in developing the network
                        of railways in Asia Minor. They have been helped, no doubt, by the policy of
                        the German Government, just as English and French private enterprise in
                        Egypt and Algeria has benefited through the policy of the British and French
                        Governments. Why should not Germany by the “peaceful penetration” of Turkey
                        in Asia attempt to restore some of the ancient prosperity of Asin Minor and
                        of Meso potamia ! That is the question put, and it seems to us rightly put,
                        by the “Edinbergh Review"</p>
                    <p>Those who have asked themselves what the justification of the British Empire
                        have found that the answer mast be that Great Britain has the mission of
                        taking order to countries where there was none, and of thus rendering
                        possible in those countries a better life than was to be found or could
                        exist before her advent. The civilisation she has is Euro pean. It has been
                        gained in a thousand years of membership of the European commanity in India
                        and in Egypt Great Britain in the mediator between European civilisation and
                        populations that had lost the power of govern nent. It is a mission ot which
                        no Power can have a monopoly. That France should be Eng land’s fellow
                        worker, each in its own sphere, has long been well understood Why not Ger
                        many also ! That is the question put by the "Edinbergh Review” The only
                        reasonable, the only intelligible, reply is, Why not! It may be true that
                        with German commercial and industrial enterprise are associated German
                        national ambitions. But that kind of associa tion is nataral and right. It
                        exists in the case of England in Egypt and of France in Algeria Tunis, and
                        Morocco. By all means then let our countrymen reconsider in the light of
                        this question that of British relations with Ger many. In that way it may be
                        possible to find that mach of the friction of recent years is lue to the
                        over-tension of national feeling rritated, it matters little how, and
                        degenerat ng, as it is prone to do, into Chauvinism. If the Germans can
                        reproduce in Mesopotamia the cornfields of the Babylonians, as, accord ing
                        to Sir William Willcocks whose report confirms the suggestions of the
                        ‘Edinbergh "Review" it is quite possible for them to do, they will benefit
                        both Turkey and Great Britain, and are entitied also reap some benefit
                        themselves</p>

                    <p>The American financial crisis has developed into a panic</p>
                    <p>Yesterday, thanks to the efforts of Mr. Cor telyou, Secretary to the

                    <p>There should not have been such trouble and excitement, there being no reason

                    <head>GOODS TRAIN DERAILED</head>
                    <p>Serious Delay of Mail</p>
                    <p>During the early hours of this morning a goods train on the Alexandria-Cairo
                        line was derailed at Saft el Melouk by collision with a bale of cotton which
                        had fallen from an earlier train. In consequence of this accident the night
                        mail train from Cairo, which is due at Alexandria at 6 a.m., was delayed
                        four and a half hours, while trains due here at 9.15 and 11 a.m. did not
                        arrive until 11.07 and 11.30 a.m. respectively. Though perhaps somewhat too
                        early to pass an opinion, it seems to us that a derailment within such a
                        short distance of Tantah, a divisional centre, should not have necessitated
                        so long a delay of what is in relaity the most important train of the day.
                        inasmuchas it is the carrier of the heaviest mail. The delay of such a train
                        seriously handicaps the work of all local busniness firms communicating with
                        the capital, towns of the province, Upper Egypt and the Sudan and we trust
                        that a strict enquiry will be made into the cause of the accident and the
                        steps taken to clear the line</p>

                        an extra parochial spirit shall we not find that, after all, however,
                        mistaiten Mr. Blunt may have been, in our opinidin, as to the merit ot the
                        movement at the head of which Arabi Pasim found himself, he was, at least,
                        perfectly sincere, perfectly disinterested, absolutely untiring in his
                        efforts to voice what he thought he recognised as the inarticulate cry for
                        freedom of an oppressed people and that, after Tel el Rebir, he did not
                        spare him self in his efforts to see that fairplay, of which we English
                        claim the monopoly, was obtained for Arabi</p>
                    <p>And whilst we gather round the village pump perhaps somebody from the great
                        world will step by and beg us bear in mind that Mr. Wiltred Blant, the poet
                        the dreamer, the distinguished littératear was in 1881 and 1889, the period
                        in connection with which, we here, can hardly think of him without gnaahing’
                        of teeth, was, in London society, a prominent figure and amoch sought after
                        guest in hbere, where, had he been the blood-stained traitor ot our
                        imagination, he would surely not have beed admitted.</p>
                    <p>Having realised this, it may help nsto more homane view of Mr. Wilfred Blunt
                        and we may even some to recognise him as a bene- factor and erect statues to
                        Arabi Pasha and himself in our market-place, Wécnuse, after all, should we

                        shareholders im the “Standard” no vowe at all in the matter. It seems as
                        though the object of the Pasha is to make a nice, little tamily party in
                        these concerns, al! his re lations beigg put into positions There ia first

                        Sabri, as “responsible secretary” of the “Standard” and put his English
                        editor Mr Rady, in a position of inferionty to this man. It is rumored in
                        the purtiens of the Sharia el Daweweeh that the Pasha is contemplatng the

                        said, will replace Mr. Maloney on the “Standard” at an early date. These

                    <p>Sir,— I am an ardent reader of your wide- spread paper. Amoungst the
                        important articles <cb n="4"/> I so often read I encountered lately the name
                        of Mr. Dunlop, the Adviser to the Minister of Education. This gentleman has
                        been attacked by some people that seem to be eprsistant to their old habits,
                        and consequentl, are adverse to seeing the postion of young Egyptian
                        betttered in this futurre</p>
                    <p>From the short time of my staying in this country, I see that other reforms
                        are urgently needed and this time in the Egyptian State Railways. I am in
                        possession of a printed timetbale and strange it may seem to be that it
                        obliges me to refer to my friends or to just ask either my servant, a
                        barbarine, or stop some individual in the streets just to explain to me the
                        name of the different stations, mostly those where I happen to be proceeding
                        to. The timetable in question, allow me to mention is a puzzle in itself and
                        a laughing stock to both Britisher and some foreigners English speaking,
                        most especially to the innmerable tourists flocking in this country every
                        winter aye all the year round.</p>
                    <p>I remember last yeat of having met in a train de Luxe an American gentleman
                        with his lady and a young lady. The former was persuing a railway timetable.
                        Nearly during the whole of the journey be critised in a most shameful way
                        the wording of the names of the stations therein included. My whole blood
                        rushed into my face and so vehement, I became that for the respect of his
                        skin I would have run at him. However, I succeeded, and no sooner I
                        explained to him with studied polite manners how the Anglo-French matter of
                        affairs stand in this country; that it takes some time before the sole
                        English language would be definitely installed all round. Of his criticisms
                        I mention the most important one, where he said there are no Britishers
                        employed in the railways and if these really exist they are of such a low
                        class and breed that if donkeys would be put in their stead they would cut a
                        beter figure. He was talking of the fine donkeys he saw in this country
                        before he produced the time table. Undoubtly his lady and co. burst a loud
                        laugh and boisterously, and it was here that I intrudded.</p>
                    <p>My intention of writing to you this time is to attract the attention of that
                        offical in charge of the Department where timetables and names of stations
                        are issued. Perhaps it would be better that a brother or a kin or another
                        Mr. Dunlop be installed there.</p>

                    <p>Sir- By the present I desire to endorse the opinion of your correspondent
                        "Cairene" regarding the dastardly assault on an Englishwoman at Port-Said by
                        a guide. Accepting the report of your Port-Said correspondent as accurate in
                        detail it is indeed a disgrace to the British community of that town that
                        the man is again at work (to repeat such crimes, doubtless) and in good
                        health. In the event of no action being taken by the authorities, the
                        British community, had it been worthy of the greatest nation of the world,
                        woud have taken the law into their own hands and administered the severest
                        thrashing to the blackguard, and would have refused to allow him to continue
                        work in any way dealing with the public. Also, what have the so-called
                        British community done as regards the owner of the shop! -Yours truly</p>

                        have been just published will, we think, be found a very acceptable volume
                        by visitors to Egypt during the ensuing season. It contains a brightly
                        written, and not too wordy, description of the varied features found here,
                        with carefully summarised acounts of the historical objects. The author, it
                        is quite evident, fell uner the spell of the country, and his language is
                        that of the enthusiast. He becomes someone melancholy when referring to the
                        many changes which the introduction of western ideas has b brought, but we
                        cannot agree when he says that, in common with the old order of things, the
                        spirit of Egypt will in time pass away. In the towns modern conditions may
                        supplant ancient customs, but the old world spirit of the Land of the
                        Pharaohs will remain</p>

                        brought in its train untold blessings for the people of Egypt. From the
                        aesthetic standpoint they may be regretted, in the same waythat Englishmen
                        refer to the "good old days", the actual reutrn to which they would be the
                        last to desire</p>

                            the increase of crime in Egypt "Al Watan" remarks</p>
                        <p>We find with the most profound degree that Egypt has become a notable
                            exception so the rule of nations through the ever increasing number of
                            crime year after year. Even India which is now practically in a state of
                            unrest amounting to a serious mutiny shows an improvement and cannot be
                            considered as marching onward in its criminal career. So far Russia
                            which has been for many years undergoing a revolutionary upheaval
                            showing signs of a slow return to the normal conditions of social life.
                            But Egypt is still on the high road to anarchy and ruin. Who does not
                            remember this fact without a pang of sorrow and regret.</p>
                        <p>There are so many reasons to this calmity that we can refer to one each
                            time we write on this subject. The inefficiency of the Parquet stands,
                            of course, first and foremost by the admission of every newspaper and
                            every thinking expert in the country. But among the secondary causes for
                            this growth in criminal tendencies the treatment of prisoners may be a
                            very important one. Here we seem to be bent upon helping all prisoners
                            to become criminals of the desperate class by our unique system of
                            housing all offenders under the same roof and treating them all in the
                            same manner. We have no difference between a political offender or a
                            misguided miscreant and the murder or foriegner as far as the treatment
                            of prisoners is concerned. Compare our prison system in this respect
                            with the English system and you will at once understand why the present
                            crisis in Egypt is growing in horror from day to day. The other day Mr.
                            Wallace, K.C. made the following statements at the opening of the
                            Clerkewell Sessions</p>
                        <p>"I am happy to say", he said, "that there has been a general diminution
                            in crime. Some 20,000 fewer persons were sent to prison in the last
                            tweleve months than in the previous year. That is a matter of
                            crongratulation for every law abiding subject in thr kingdom"</p>
                        <p>"One of the causes is the great effort made to prevent first offenders
                            sinking into the ranks of hardened criminals. Instead of persons being
                            sent to gaol which often develops them into criminals, they have been
                            assisted to start again, and many of them have become reputable
                            citizens".</p>
                        <p>"The Probation of First Offenders Act", he continued "extends the power
                            of the courts in the direction in which they have been endeavouring, as
                            far as possible, to act. Power is now to be given to all courts, not
                            merely to bind prisoners over to come up for judgement, but also to make
                            special orders in regard to them"</p>
                        <p>"An instance is the appointment of what I may call a judicial guardian, a
                            probation officer, whose duty it will be to watch over those bound over,
                            to advise and help them and, if possible to obtain work for the. The
                            greatest difficulty of many of those appearing in the dock is that it is
                            almost impossible for them to get honest employment when the stigma of
                            crime has been attched to them.</p>
                        <p>"From the beginning of next year every court will have an officer
                            attached to it whose duty it will be to visit and report with regard to
                            first offender"</p>
                        <p>Seeing that our prisoners are huddled together and that the habitual
                            criminals are allowed to imbue those who are sentenced to prison for the
                            first time with their own wrtehced principles, and remembering the fact
                            that many an innocent person is here sent to prison tgrough the
                            notorious defects of our judicial system and the deplorable ineffeciency
                            of those who administer justice, is it wonderful that our criminals grow
                            in audacity and numbers from year to year</p>

                        <p>The Chairman of the Great Eastern Railway ina manifesto absolutely
                            refuses to recognise the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants He says
                            that most of the employés are non unionists and desire to be protected
                            from the tyranny of an irresponsible body. He deolares that the demand
                            for recognition is the first move in a deep laid socialistic campaign
                            against individaalism and capital. (Reuter)</p>

                        <p>It is generally assomed that the manifesto of the Great Eastern Railway
                            represents the decision of the Companies as a whole. Mr. Bell complains
                            that it has made the position of Mr Lloyd George most awkward if he
                            desires to offer conciliatory proposals. (Reuter)</p>

                        <p>Later reports show that many villages in Calabria have been ruined or
                            balt ruined. The ancient cathedral of Gerace, containing works of art,
                            collapsed during the earthquake. The Pope was moch grieved at the news

                    <head>THE EGYPTIAN ELEPHANT</head>
                    <p>One of the most remarkable dicoveries in paleontology of recent years has
                        been the solution of the problem of the orgin of the elephant and a great
                        deal of intrest therfore attches to the recent discovery in the Fayoum of
                        the "beast of Lake Mocris", the Meritherium which represens ts the very at
                        of transtion from an ordinary typical mammal into the nascent form of an
                        elephant, and the Paleimastodon, the direct forerunner of the elephants. In
                        teh year 1899 paleontology had advanced to such a point that the orgin of
                        many families was known, but there remained in doubt the group of elephants,
                        certainly the most paradoxical in structure of all the quadrupeds, and
                        appearing in the Lower Miocane period, both in Europe and North America,
                        fully formed, as if from teh sky or by a flat of the Creator. No one knew
                        whence they came nor how their remarkable charcters had evolved. There were
                        great unexplored regions in Asia ; the history of Chine was unknown ; and
                        many writers were looking to the Orient for an answer to this question.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Henry Osborn, an American, in the year 1900 ventared on a prophecy which
                        the original home of the elephants and of several other great groups in
                        Africa At the time it seemed a curious fact that this theater of evolution
                        of mammals had not sefficiently considered. Following the initial
                        suggestions of Huxley, most writers were talk- ing of the invasion of Africa
                        from the north by animals of European or Asiatic orgin, and few seemed to
                        have in mind the possibility of a reversed current; namely, of the invasion
                        of Europe Asia, and North America by animal orginating in Africa.</p>
                    <p>According to this theory of Mr. Osborn's Atrica in early geological times was
                        a great centre of independent evolution , that, after its long isolation by
                        the sea, when the trans- Mediterranean land routes were formed, suc cessive
                        waves of animals migrated northward and poured into Europeand Asia, driven
                        oat, perhaps, as man is driven out, by surplas popalation ; that there
                        seemed tobe evidence in Europe of three such chief waves of life from Africa
                        , and that promineut among the quadrupeds were the mastodons, ancestors of
                        the great family of elephants.</p>
                    <p>Thus, if the paleontology of Africa could be- come known, the problem of the
                        origin of the elephants might be solved.</p>
                    <p>So long ago as 1879, the German explorer Schweinfarth had obtained in the
                        Payoum desert some bones of the great whalelike animal named Zeaglodon,

                    <p>We believe from evidence of many different kinds that all ot North Africa at
                        that remote time was comparatively well watered ; chiefly hecanse our
                        present glimpses of the life, as known from the fossilized remains, included
                        no desert living animals whatever, but exclusively animals which might have
                        lived in a fairly weil watered delta or estuary country bordering the sea,
                        partly open, partly wooded, bat not densely forested, with stretches of
                        sandy plains ot muddy and clayey bottom-lands traversed by large streams,
                        with currents of considerable velocity. As Beadnell observes, the enormous
                        quantities of silicified wood which occur among these sands, and the
                        hundreds of trees of great length and girth, together with the numerous
                        remains of land animals as well as of crocodiles, tartles, and tortoises,
                        indicate that rivers of considerable size emerged from the land to the
                        south. While the trunks of the trees may have been floated a long distance,
                        for the branches are all torn off, the pertect contours of the bones of the
                        animals prove that they had not been transported very far</p>
                    <p>The country was certainly not heavily forested, however, because the close
                        proximity of the sea, as well as the number of very large animals, precludes
                        the existence of a continous and densely tropical forest in the immediate
                        environment. Large quadrupeds cannot find food in the shade of a dense
                        forest , they need the food which is developed on the ground by sonlight.

                    <p>We judge of the nature of the soil from the structure of the limbs and feet.
                        In constrast with the finely drawn limbs of the desert animals of modern
                        Libya, the animals of Eocene Libya had feet fitted for walking on soft if
                        not moist and sinking ground. Thus the soil of the period was certainly not
                        dry hard, although it was partly sandy. There are, however, some evidence of
                        the proximity of the great stretches of dry land because we ind giant land
                        tortoises (Testudo ammon, named after the Egyptian god Ammon) resembling
                        those of Madagascar. There were also giant pythons (Gigantophis) thrity feet
                        in length. There were ostrich-like birds, but they have been partly forest
                        dwellers, like the emus of New Zealand</p>
                    <p>So far, therefore, as animals mirror their surroundings. Eocene Libya was a
                        savannah country, partly open, partly thicketed or jungled, partly forested,
                        of about the same temperature as to-day, fairly well watered, and subject to
                        occasional freshets and floodings from the south. Such a general picture of
                        the landscape may at least be drawn from the discoveries of the Egyptian
                        Survey</p>
                    <p>THE FAYOUM ELEPHANTS MARCH</p>
                    <p>The world wide march of the Egyptian Elephant trom its old home began in the
                        lower Miocene and Pticapne when Africa ceased to be a great island and the
                        elevation of the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea formed one land bridge
                        after another, and the great exodus from peot-up Africa began. The sea-cows,
                        the giant conies, the mastodons, and several other African autochthones
                        entered Europe in great numbers.</p>
                    <p>What the results would have been if the elephants had been released from
                        Atrica in an earlier stage of evolution can only be guessed at, but that
                        they were superbly equipped for foreign travel and conquest when they actual
                        ly did emerge is absolutely demonstrate! As secure as the Romans with their
                        phalanxes and their legions, these quadfapeds marched over one or other of
                        the land bridges as soon as they were formed. They saddenly appeared in the
                        Lower Miocene of Europe in the vicinity of modern Paria The race spread so
                        fast and maltiplied so rapidly in the Northern Hemis phere that in the
                        Middle Miocene they reached the geographical point in North America now
                        known as eastern Colorado By the upper Mhorene, or perhaps earlier, they
                        were foand in Texas and Mexico. Most opportunely in the Lower Pliocene the
                        Isthmus of Panama rose out of the sea, connecting North and South America,
                        which had been separated for an enor mously long penod, and the mastodons
                        invad ed South Amenca, and, following the line of the Andes, pushed as far
                        south as the Pampaan region</p>
                    <p>As time went on, the elephants began to evolve and replace the mastodons in
                        vanous parts of the world Their geographical range, which extended from the
                        British Isles all over Europe, along the northern shores of Siberia, into
                        Texas and Mexico, is equally marvelous. In the whole history of creation no
                        other animal, with the single exception of the horse, accomplished soch

                    <p>American Futures The Market opened this week rather depressed and weak,
                        showing that the predicted frost ables had failed _ the “Bearixh” character

                        <p>The first Alans battleship “Goliath,” whieh is undergoing a thoroagh
                            refit at Portemouth at an authorised expenditare of £48,419, is to be
                            realy for the pennant by the end of Janaary next. Her sister battleship
                            “Canopus,” which will be taken in hand at Portsmooth neat month, and a
                            sum of £25,498 expended apon her, is to be ready for sea by the end of
                            March. | Both these battleships are destined for the Mediterranean
                            Pleet, in which they will replace the two “Formidables” in accordance
                            with the decision of the Admiralty already announced in these notes The
                            “Goliath” was completed for sea in 1900, and was commissioned in that
                            year for service on the China Station, on which she spent three years.
                            Returning bome in 1903, she was again commissioned by Captain Kingsford
                            in June, 1905, for another turn on the same station, she was recalled
                            whilst at Colombo, and seot to the Mediterranean Fleet, with which she
                            served till January 1906, when she was transferred to the Fleet. The
                            “Canopus” spent her maiden commission on the Mediterranean Station,
                            1899-1908, and she, too, was on her way to the China Station, along with
                            the “Goliath,” when she was re-called for service with the Atlantic
                            Pleet, June, 1905. The ships of the “Canopus” typearse smaller than |
                            the “Formidables," and their armamentis not so strong, but they havea
                            slight advantage in the matter of speed. The “Cioliath” and “Canopus”
                            will be manned by 750 of all ranks as private sbipa. In service circles,
                            the weakening of the battle squastron of the Mediterranean leet by the
                            withdrawal of the “Furmidables” does not meet with unqualified
                            approval</p>
