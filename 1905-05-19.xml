                        <p>In view of the mass of new companies which have been already totaled in
                            Egypt, and which i ire still appearing on tho horizon, one wel- comes
                            any publication which takes a sane view of the situation, and is based
                            on common j tense. The first number of ‘‘La Revue Inter- nationale
                            d'Egypte” has just appeared, and it: contains an article by M. Leopold
                            Jullien on ; “La Situation Economique de l’Egypte,” which • is well
                            worth perusal. M. Ju'.liea points out that formerly there wore few
                            company shares! dealt in on the Bourses of Alexandria and i Cairo, as
                            shares were held by large capitalists, j and only small lots were
                            available for the public; but all that is now in god, and the public are
                            entering on share speculation in any company which is presented. It says
                            though wealth of the public aid the bushel spirit of eater- j prise
                            would be a matter of congratulation if the situation were normal, but,
                            hi add*, this infatuation of the public is not normal and tho position
                            of the share market is becoming more dangerous. In this we omit. The
                            rashing up of new companies to a premium before they have begun
                            operations is quite without justification on any solid business grounds,
                            and equally arousing is the fall, after a week or two, when some other

                            buys land and borrows money and all Egypt lives on him. If Europeans
                            have acquired wealth in Egypt, tho fellah is the basis of it all.
                            Railways, ports, import and export houses are all for the fellah, fur
                            there are no industries in the country. Truly the Egyptian Atlas has a
                            heavy load on his back : a land tax of £4,750,000, interest on 30
                            millions private indebtedness, say £2,250,000, and rout on 6,000,000
                            feddans, say £18,000,000. The new companies have two foots stated above,
                            "the fellah buys land and borrows m mey”—an 1 subiidiary to that people
                            living on him need houses. There are three geographical words: Egypt,
                            Nile, Delta; four financial words, Land, Bank, Trust, Investment. All
                            that is needed is a clean sheet of paper and a fluent pen, and perhaps a
                            little historical knowledge of what other companies did which were
                            established long ago under different conditions. With this
                            stock-in-trade a proipectus is easily pre pared, no originality is
                            needed. An infatnatod public apply for shares, not because they wish
                            sound investment, but to get shares of good speculative character. M.
                            Jullien restates u good many facts which have already been eet forth by
                            other authorities, and they all go to prove the soundness of laud values
                            in Urn* but as he points out, it is difficult to proprietors know SO
                            little of the value of their lands that they sell at a price which
                            justifies the shares of the pur- chasing company at once being doubled
                            in value. That good solid business is possible we do not doubt, but
                            public duty compels as to sound &amp; note of serious warning against
                            too much discounting of the future. To dis- count in this way is simply
                            to buy money, and the unexpected which proverbially happens may be a
                            windfall, bat is mire likely to prove being "left to hold the baby.</p>

                        <p>COTTAGE HOSPITAL OR NURSING HOME. To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.
                            Sir,—I read with pleasure your article on the above question yesterday,
                            and I hope it may lead to good results. I am aware that this subject was
                            discussed at various meetings about two years ago and that the
                            suggestion was finally dropped. Those, however, who were in favor of the
                            bchemo were not, I think, at all convinced that their theory was wrong.
                            There can be no doubt that the want of a nursing home or cottage
                            hospital is felt by many. At the present moment there are three
                            Englishmen at the Government Hospital, who would undoubtedly have gone
                            to a nursing Lome, had it existed. I am sure that we all recognise the
                            excellent work done by the (i.rman Hospital at Moharrem Bey, but the
                            fact remains, as you pointed out, that we like to be nursed by English
                            nurses, and this unfor- tunately is against the rules of this excellent
                            institution. I think a nursing home would be a better scheme than a
                            cottage hospital, and one rule I would suggest is that the patient
                            should be allowed whatever medical attendant lie or she wished. The home
                            could be started on a small scale.—I am, etc., X. Alexandria, May

                        <p>EGYPTIAN HOTELS COMPANY. The Egyptian 'Hotels' Company, Limited, has
                            gained a groat impetus owing to the ohange in the ownership of the
                            majority of the shares, which, as our readers are aware, passed last
                            year from the hands of the Grand Hotel Company to those of Mr. Charles
                            Baehler. The excellent result of this season’s working will allow of a
                            substantial dividend being declared. The company have offers for their
                            ground at Ghezireh, which, if accepted, will amply cover the entire
                            debenture capital. The remaining capital will therefore in an average
                            year yield dividends that very few companies will be able to compare
                            with. The Ghezireh Palace estate has developed so greatly that it is now
                            the most fashionable suburb in Cairo. The Ghezireh Palace Hotel itself
                            has made a record season, and has quite outgrown its old reputation as a
                            drag on Shop heard’s Hotel, for with tho advance of fashion- able Cairo
                            towards tho west, this hotel will soon be in the centre of a very

                        <p>We understand that at Shepheard’s Hotel great improvements are to be
                            made, especially in regard to the immediate neighbourhood. The shops,
                            for example, iu Kamel-street, on the property of the hotel, are all to
                            be modern- ised. The frontage o.‘ the Shephc-ird’s Hotel property
                            towards Halim Pasha-street is to be built upon and a line of fashionable
                            shojis is to be constructed there. Another line of shops is to be built
                            in tho other frontage, facing the new estate of the Socidtd Beige
                            Egyptienne, which is the direct road to and from the station. By these
                            additions the revenue from the Shepheard's Hotel property will be tre-
                            bled. The prospects of tbe company are thns bright in the extreme, and
                            under the manage ment of Mr. Baehler the investor may consider that his
                            capital will be safely and remunera- tively employed.</p>

                                which the Khedive would in no cir: mmti' ces give his consent. All
                                Mussulmans are aware of this, and they are becoming embittered even

                                entire situation as being governed by '‘the antagonism between Lord
                                Kitcbei er and Lord Curzon.” Lord Kitchener, it says, is convinced
                                that the centre of gravity of Indian do'bnce is in Afghanistan,
                                where the Russian monaco is constantly prescut, whereas Lord
                                Cuizon’s view, which accords with the view hold by the authorities
                                in London, is that it is urgently necessary to counter Russia in
                                Persia. Lord Curzon, concludes the "National Zeitnng,” evidently
                                regards the moment ns opportune for effecting a grand coup in the
                                Persian Gulf, and "it is in this connection that the real
                                significance of British policy in the Yemen must be sought. Lord
                                Kitchener, on the other band, fears that any action in the Persian
                                Gulf will induce a counter-move on the part of Russia again the land
                                frontiers of India. Ho is not ignorant of the meaning of tho
                                concentration of Russian troops near Afghanistan, and he probably
                                knows better than Lord Curzon the actual state of British
                                defences.”</p>

                                having said a certain something in a recent speech of mine at tho
                                Trocadero Restaurant and yet be nnablo to admit that it can be
                                charged with culpability. The speech was about the purchase of tho
                                Khedive's Suez Canal shares in 1875, when Sir Edward Stanton was
                                Consul-General at Cairo ; and among other things I said that Lord
                                Derby, annoyed at the want of information from the Consulate on that
                                matter, exclaimed, "Master Stanton shall hear of this !” and then
                                came the words, "and Master Stanton did hoar of it. He was quietly
                                removed from his post, and went into retire- ment, I believe, to
                                some Consulship on the Black Sea." Thereupon Sir Edward Stanton
                                wrote mo a letter of complaint and explanation which I immediately
                                communicated to the "Times.” (His sou, Colonel Stanton, now tells
                                your readers that I "quoted part of the letter but omitted to insert

                                confess that “retirement” is not the right word for the removal of a
                                Government official from one post to another, and that I spoke from
                                uncertain recolleotion—as the words “I believe" indicat- ed—in
                                saying that Sir Edward Stanton was transferred to some post on the

                                reference is to my removal, is absolutely untrue. The negotiations

                                out entirely by myself ; and I remained at my post till 1876, when I
                                gladly accepted the promotion to tho post of Chargd d’Affaires in
                                Bavaria, having previously declined the offer of the Legation of
                                Chile, offered me by Lord Derby."</p>
                            <p>In transcribing this statement for the “Times” I made no objection to
                                any part of it, nor did I offer any remark upon it And I would
                                gladly say no more now, except that I am truly sorry for having
                                dropped a sentence which a moment’s reflection would have told me
                                must give pain. Now, however, I am put in this position by the
                                publication in the "Times” of a letter from Sir Edward Stanton’s
                                son:—Either I must teem to admit by silence that Sir Edward’s
                                statement contradicts me and that I have been culpably wrong, or
                                else 1 mast place that statement under the light of certain facts
                                which Sir Edward himself asserts. There is no other choice, and I
                                cannot be blamed, 1 think, for not choosing silence.</p>
                            <p>That Lord Derby had reason for dissatis- faction is expressly
                                admitted. For the rest, Sir Edward’s own statement is that, whereas
                                the affair of tho Caual shares happened near the close of 1875
                                (middle of November in that year), he left Egypt in 1876, and that
                                in this year he was first offered the Legation of Chile, which he
                                declined, and then gladly accepted the post of Charge d’Affaires in
                                Bavaria. But what then ! 1875...1876, Egypt, Chile thirty years ago,
                                and Munich after the confederation of the German Empire. Would it be
                                unfair to say that, so far, there is more confirmation than
                                contradiction 1 Now, however, Colonel Stanton adds a particular
                                which Sir Edward did not mention. He says that his father, “for
                                purely private reasons, and on tho score of health, asked for a
                                chaugo," and then was offered Chile. There is no resisting that
                                statement and there can be no wish to do so. But without it, and
                                under any circumstances, I should' still regret the heedlessness
                                which, as I well understand, must have troubled Sir Edward Stanton
                                with- out need.</p>

                                understand that the latest reports to hand state that this man was
                                not even in Biabmo on the night when the attack took place, so that
                                although ho may have been an instigator, he was not at any rate a
                                participator in the crime. We hope to be able to publish a full

                            <p>Mohamed Bey El Wakil suggested that an ■‘Agricultural Review,”
                                dealing with trees and flowers, the method and periods of their cul-
                                tivation, etc., should bo published periodically and distributed
                                among agriculturists. He stat- ed that the absence of such a review
                                kept gardening in a backward state in Egypt. Ismail Boy Dabus
                                suggested that the society should distribute rewards among persons
                                who took pains in cleaning their cotton crop, so as to encourage
                                others to follow their example. He also suggested that the Miuistry
                                of the Interior should issue a circular to the omdehs informing them
                                that a deputation of the K.A.S. would go round the provinces to
                                examine the cotton plantations, and that in satisfactory cases the
                                board would instruct the banks who purchase the cotton to sell to
                                the society the cotton s-icd from the cotton purchased. Iu this way,
                                ho stated, the society would possess a store of cotton seed from
                                different provinces. There were many other proposals of a minor

                            <p>EXCAVATIONS AT THEBES. Professor Naville and Mr. H. R. Hall have been
                                excavating at the eleventh dynasty tem- ple at Dfir-el-Bahari at
                                Thebes this winter for the Egyptian Exploration Fond and some im-
                                portant discoveries have resulted. The site of their work was the
                                space left untouched dur- ing Prof. Naville’s excavation of the
                                well- known temple of Queen Hatshepsut. The ro- sult of ;heir
                                labours is tho discovery of the funerary temple of tho eleventh
                                dynasty king Montnhotep III. (Noblnpet-Ra), containing the graves of
                                priestesses of the goddess Hathor, a divinity specially worshipped
                                at D6r el Bahari. The existence of eleventh-dynasty buildings here
                                had long been suspected, but not hitherto discovered. The temple was
                                reached in the course of the first season’s work, 1903 4, and the
                                great court and the northern colonnade cleared, and some fine
                                reliefs were discovered. In the past season, 19L4-5, the temple was
                                approached from the south, and the central pyramid and shrines of
                                the priestesses of Ha- thor were cleared. In the course of the
                                digging some fine portrait-statues of the twelfth-dy- nasty king
                                Usertsen III. were unearthed, as well as many small objects, such as
                                workmen’s tools, left during tho repairs to the temple, which seem
                                to have been effeoted during the reign of Siptah, of whom a relief
                                was found on the facing of the pyramid. The temple is of importance
                                as being the most perfect known temple-building of this early
                                period, and the mo3t ancient building at Thebes. Architectur- ally
                                it is interesting, as it stands on an arti- ficially squared
                                platform of rock, approached by a sloping ramp, flanked by
                                colonnades which led up to a granite doorway, beyond which was a
                                sort of ambulatory of proto-Doric columns surrounding a square
                                central erection apparently the bare of a pyramid. At the back of
                                this are finely decorated shrines oft he priest- esses of Hathor.
                                What lies beyond remains yet to be explored. About two-thirds of the
                                work is completed, and it is expected that tho excavation of the
                                remainder of the si*e will reveal the existence of the king’s own
                                shrine, which, if well preserved 1, will be a most remark- able

                                and Alexandria have not yet woke up to the ad- vantages of telephone
                                communication between the two cities. This is obvious from the
                                statistics of the telegrams for last year. The number of messages
                                sent over the Egyptian lines was, in round figures, 1,825 000, an
                                in- crease of 179,000 over 1903. Of this increase, 176.000 was in
                                Arabio telegrams, and only 3.000 in European telegrams. The European
                                traffic was adversely affected by the com- petition of the C
                                riro-Alexandria telephone. Thesame cause also led to a diminution of
                                13$ per cent, in the number of "urgent" (triple- tax) telegrams sent
                                over the line-1. The tele- jihonio communication between Cairo and
                                Alexandria brought in to tho Government a revenue of L.E. 8,423 in

                    <p>THE STATE RAILWAYS. BY “TRAFFIC.” (SECOND ARTICLE). The work to be done by
                        the Council and the General Manager may be summed up as the "Administrative”
                        work, or work of control, and, this having been provided for, there remains
                        the executive work or actual working of the railway. This falls naturally
                        under their heads having reference to the object with which a railway is
                        established. This is, to provide for the conveyance of goods and passengers
                        from place to place over the lines of the railway, and there are three prime
                        essentials that go to the realization of this object; first, the provi- sion
                        of the “railway," the lines, stations, etc.; secondly, that of vehicles to
                        carry the goods and passengers, and, thirdly, that of the motive power. The
                        provision and employment of these essentials under the conditions that
                        affect the management of a modern railway involve a number of minor
                        departments such as the Signaling Telegraph Stores etc which are
                        inderdependent.</p>

                        more importance than that these different depart- that they may work
                        together, each accomplish- ing its own work m the best manner and each
                        contributing in the largest possible manner to the efficiency of the others.
                        This interdependence of the different departments goes down to the minutest
                        details in all branches of the work, and it is evident therefore that the
                        first essential of an effective executive service is the proper coordination
                        of its various sections How this can best be attained is a question upon
                        which authorities are not agreed. Almost every railway has its own method,
                        the great diversity that obtains in actual praotice being however largely
                        due to the varying conditions and circumstances under which the different
                        lines are worked. As a generally applicable system, and one that very nearly
                        approaches that at present adopted by the State Railways, the following
                        diagram gives a clearer idea than can be obtained from a mere verbal
                        explanation:-</p>
                    <p>This diagram is defective in respect that it , Ices not sufficiently clearly
                        show the close , relation existing between the Traffic and the | Signaling
                        Departments. Originally, when rail- way signaling was of the most primitive
                        kind, 1 it was always looked upon as part of the work of the Permanent Way,
                        or Way and Works, hut with the use of the modem block systems ! of signaling
                        this department absolutely 1 demands tho services of special experts, who 1
                        must be wholly guided in their work by the ' requirements of the traffic,
                        and while there- 1 fore still bound to work in close co-operation ' with tho
                        Way and Works it may justly be ; looked upon as a sister branch of the whole
                        work of the lines rather than as a section of the Way.</p>
                    <p>It will be seen that this table gives eleven departments instead of the “four
                        or five” mentioned by the Commission. Of these, 3, 4,5 and 6 represent the
                        work of which the traffic manager is, or should be, the controlling chief, 5
                        and 6 may be and often are, as here in Egypt, united in one department. No.
                        7, the Way and Works, is the department that lays the lines and keeps them
                        in repair and so forth, and it must therefore work in the most perfect har-
                        mony with the Traffic but with the utmost independence as to its internal
                        organization and working.</p>
                    <p>The Stores Department having to provide all the materials of every kind
                        necessary for tho working of the railway, should have as branches of its
                        work the printing and lighting (by oil, etc.), at present, I believe, worked
                        in- dependently. The internal organization of this /department is a matter
                        of great importance. To be efficient there should be one head or central and
                        controlling office, aided by a num- ber of local stores in required centers,
                        for the distribution of material.</p>
                    <p>Finally, the Account Department should be in a measure at once the obedient
                        servant and the absolute master of all the others. It should be divided, not
                        as the Commission suggest into two, but into three sections, the accounts
                        proper, the registering of income and expendi- ture, the cash, and the audit
                        This latter should be quite independent.</p>

                        rauk of lieutenant-colonel. Major Moore has also had the advantage of
                        Eractical as well as theoretical campaigning, aving seen service in the
                        Sudan operations of 1885-S6, including the action of Ginniss having seen
                        service in the Sudan operation of 1885-S6, including the action of Ginnia
                        (medal and Khedive’s star). Says a contemporary—Lord Cromer and the Sirdar,
                        Sir Reginald Wingate, are anxious to increase the efficiency of the Sudanese
                        batta- lions of the Egyptian Army and to induce a larger number of recruits
                        to join the colours One most successful method was that adopted with the
                        native Egyptians by the military authorities years ago.</p>
                    <p>In the “good old days” of Egypt—modern j Egypt, of course—the recruit never
                        know how i long he would have to serve ; enlistment was 1 next door to
                        banishment; the comfort of the private soldiers was not thought of; barracks
                        i were offensively foul. However, when Lord i Dufferin took charge all this
                        was changed. The i men were properly fed, clothed, and housed ; their pay
                        was regular ; they were looked after i when ill. The soldier actually got
                        leave, and i wont home to his native village with money in | his pocket. No
                        better inducement could be i placed before the fellaheen.</p>
                    <p>But apparently the Shilluks and Dinkas of ' the Sudan have neither forgotten
                        the old con- ditions nor properly understood the new, and are shy of taking
                        service. These black men of the Sudan, however, unlike the Egyptians, do not
                        take kindly to drill. They can scarcely be described as muscular, being
                        tall, slight, nar- row-shouldered men, liable to chest complaints, but they
                        are full of activity, and have a posi- tive love of fighting. The Dinks is
                        first cousin to “Fuzzy-Wuzzy,” and only needs the lead of a capable British
                        officer to face any foe. They fear nothing, and appear to have more in
                        common with white troops than with their Egyptian contemporaries.</p>
                    <p>The dramatic climax in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s “Waterloo,” in which the old
                        Guards- man falls back dead after recounting his fight- ing days, is
                        recalled in a striking manner, says the “Chronicle,” by the death of a
                        Crimean veteran, named Friend, at Shoe buryness. After being unconscious for
                        three days, Friend seemed to rally somewhat, and the watchers by his bedside
                        noticed that he appeared to be attempting to describe something that was
                        passing through his mind, Presently he was heard to mutter, “Hark! Music 1
                        the band of the 44th I” The old man raised himself np in bed, while a faint
                        smile Bickered about his face, and then fell back almost immediately. He was
                        dead. Friend enlisted in the old "Fighting 44th,” and was made a sergeant
                        fox a deed of heroism at the battle of Ain a. He stood beside Captain Nolan
                        when the “Charge” was ordered ' at Balaolava, and Nolan's body fell at his
                        feet when the dead rider’s horse stopped after the charge.</p>
                    <p>Something like coma or suspended anima- tion has fallen upon the much vexed
                        subject of Army reconstruction. We may still believe that things are in a
                        bad way, but apparently we do not greatly care, and are content to leave the
                        new men to work their will without protest or interference. One very serious
                        ques- tion, that of our reserves, is being more and more neglected, and to a
                        dangerous degree. The new sobbed of the General Service Army may have much
                        to recommend it, but when fully in working order the reserve naturally must
                        suffer. The system of prolonged service with the colours must of course
                        impoverish the reserve, and, so far, no steps have been taken to meet the
                        depletion. The true remedy is in the development of the other part of the
                        scheme, the creation of the home or short ser vice army from which men will
                        pass quiokly and in considerable numbers into the reserve. It is very
                        reasonably feared that candidates if they have their choice between engaging
                        for three or nine years will almost certainly elect the former, and we shall
                        once more find a deficit the foreign drafts</p>

                        campaign of excavation carried out by M. Gayet at Antinode. In this, his
                        ninth season of research, M. Gayet again devoted his atten- tion entirely to
                        the „ necropolis, the tombs forming which are excavated in the hill ^ sides,
                        or in the defiles of the hills behind tho site of the ancient city. The
                        entrances to the sepulchers had, however, been almost entirely covered up by
                        the accumulating sands of centuries, rendering it difficult to disci v.-r,
                        and dangerous to excavate them nnlers all the debris was removed in the most
                        thorough and consequently costly manner, s beyond the possibility of the
                        funds at the explorer’s disposal.</p>
                    <p>Not with standing these difficulties, the results I of the work have been as
                        successful as upon \ auy previous occasion, and will almost oer- j taiuly
                        tempt the society to provide the j means for further carrying on the
                        researches. Among the sepulchers excavated is one be- longing to an actor in
                        the Olympic games, ] a charioteer, .and a gladiator. Also one of a lady
                        named Khelnies, the singer of Oseris- j Antinon". Many of the mummies have
                        the faoe and busts protected by cartonage masks, or breastplates painted and
                        gilded, the oolours still brilliant aud the excellent workmanship of the
                        painter well preserved. There are the usual terra cottas and vases of all
                        ages, from the old Mykenaen style to tho Persian, s and even Byzantine
                        epoch. A quantity of I late ivory carvings are among the smaller t class of
                        relios.</p>
                    <p>As in previous years the quantity of dress £ fabrios and tissues forms the
                        chief produot of i the excavations. They are of immense variety f and many
                        of the designs of most fantastio oha- c racter. M. de Bidder thinks one

                        may be retained in i Franoe.</p>

                        families, or notabilities, and deserve recording because the notice of them

                        to connecting them with monuments of their relatives, and thus hasten the
                        time when the great history ol Egypt, its Pharaohs, officials, - and people,
                        from Menes to Alexander can be 1 written.</p>
                    <p>Some funerary statuettes from theElKharjeh oasis give us a new ohief of that
                        distriot, “the prince of the southern oasis,Nehmehy.”A frag- ment of a

                        Museum. Very interesting from the scientific post of view, as displaying tho
                        metallurgical knowledge of the ancient Egyptians in very early times, is a
                        oopper vase which Professor Petrie asoribas to Papi I. of the 6th dynasty,
                        and as Mr. Quibell found large bronze statues of that period atHieracon-
                        opolis, the bronze founders of that epoch must have been experts.</p>
                    <p>Last year the Brussels Museum received a large imitation of a feather plume,
                        stuccoed and gilded, which on close examination proved to be of bronze; it
                        therefore may be considered to have fitted into the head dress of such a
                        brotize statue. Among the thousands of objects found by M. LegTab last year
                        at the Karnak temple he enumerates “grandee plumes ornant la coiffure
                        d’Osiris en bronze borustd et dob.” From the Amelineau sale came a large
                        vase ornamented with a figure of Osiris incised upon the clay of the vase,
                        and bearing a long hieroglyphic inscription giving the names of two priests.
                        It dates from the 19th dynasty or thereabouts, to judge from the
                        workmanship. Of the same period is a little miniature sarcophagus of a
                        scribe named Si 1 Isis, and a statuette of a certain Peduhor, son 1 of
                        Pedubastit.</p>

                        inscribed with names of the earliest dynasty monarchs, such as Nar Mer,
                        Hotel-Aharri, and Noteren, also a princess Neit-Hotep, perhaps of the first
                        dynasty. These were completed by the acquisition of a gTanite fragment
                        bearing the name of King Den. Of the same epoch are two ivory figures of a
                        dog and a lion; the latter an exceedingly well-executed piece of realistic
                        work.</p>

                            <p>EGYPTS PROGRESS Mr. Joseph Chamberlain presided at the annual dinner
                                of the London School of Tropical Medicine, held at the Hotel Cecil,
                                London, on the 10th inst. The guests numbered nearly 500. In
                                proposing the toast, “The London School of Tropical Medicbe,” Mr.
                                Chamberlain, in the course of his speech, said : Just think for a
                                moment of one or two well-known instan- oea. Compare the condition
                                of Egypt as it was a quarter of a century ago, when this rich coun-
                                try was apparently b the down stage, and it seemed hardly possible
                                that it could ever agab rise from its ashes. Compare it as it was,
                                almost impotent owing to the extortions practiced b it, with the
                                Egypt of Lord Cromer—the Egypt of to-day. Look at the case perhaps
                                even more extraordinary, of the Sudan—five years ago devastated by
                                the brutal tyranny of its rulers, the people tortured and oppressed,
                                the whole country depopulated till there were not enough souls in
                                the land to till it and gab its riohes. Now see it, a few years
                                later, rising bto a greater prosperity than ever before.</p>

                                members from previous privileges and rights. This is practi- cally
                                expulsion. The four cotton spining companies they represent b Oldham

                                Mariont, in Bgyyt, being a portion of the estate of H.H. the Khedive
                                of Egypt. The property has been reported upon by Messrs. Sir Doaglaa
                                Fox and Partners, Consulting Engineers of the Company and the
                                conclusion of their Report to the Di- rectors, dated 26th January,
                                1905, is as follows:— Taking a broad view of the whole matter, we
                                feel that we can recommend the property, and that-with' a canal
                                constructed and given sufficient water, your Compauy formed to
                                acquire and work the Batata, should prove a success.</p>

                                to irrigate the Brtate and the various crops per feddan which should
                                be produoed therefrom, and the conclusion of these estimates is that
                                when the whole of the area is under cultivation the orops will pro-
                                duce, as a minimum estimate, a net profit of £72,000 per annum.

                                reoommended by Sir Douglas Fox 4 Partners in their report, for the
