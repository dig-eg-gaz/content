                        <p>In view of the mass of new companies which have been already totaled in
                            Egypt, and which i ire still appearing on tho horizon, one wel- comes
                            any publication which takes a sane view of the situation, and is based
                            on common j tense. The first number of ‘‘La Revue Inter- nationale
                            d'Egypte” has just appeared, and it: contains an article by M. Leopold
                            Jullien on ; “La Situation Economique de l’Egypte,” which • is well
                            worth perusal. M. Ju'.liea points out that formerly there wore few
                            company shares! dealt in on the Bourses of Alexandria and i Cairo, as
                            shares were held by large capitalists, j and only small lots were
                            available for the public; but all that is now in god, and the public are
                            entering on share speculation in any company which is presented. It says
                            though wealth of the public aid the bushel spirit of eater- j prise
                            would be a matter of congratulation if the situation were normal, but,
                            hi add*, this infatuation of the public is not normal and tho position
                            of the share market is becoming more dangerous. In this we omit. The
                            rashing up of new companies to a premium before they have begun
                            operations is quite without justification on any solid business grounds,
                            and equally arousing is the fall, after a week or two, when some other
                            company ; has appeared, of the same shares to a discount. The fellah
                            buys land and borrows money and all Egypt lives on him. If Europeans
                            have acquired wealth in Egypt, tho fellah is the basis of it all.
                            Railways, ports, import and export houses are all for the fellah, fur
                            there are no industries in the country. Truly the Egyptian Atlas has a

                        <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette. Sir,—I read with pleasure your
                            article on the above question yesterday, and I hope it may lead to good
                            results. I am aware that this subject was discussed at various meetings
                            about two years ago and that the suggestion was finally dropped. Those,
                            however, who were in favor of the bchemo were not, I think, at all
                            convinced that their theory was wrong. There can be no doubt that the
                            want of a nursing home or cottage hospital is felt by many. At the
                            present moment there are three Englishmen at the Government Hospital,
                            who would undoubtedly have gone to a nursing Lome, had it existed. I am
                            sure that we all recognise the excellent work done by the (i.rman
                            Hospital at Moharrem Bey, but the fact remains, as you pointed out, that
                            we like to be nursed by English nurses, and this unfor- tunately is
                            against the rules of this excellent institution. I think a nursing home
                            would be a better scheme than a cottage hospital, and one rule I would
                            suggest is that the patient should be allowed whatever medical attendant
                            lie or she wished. The home could be started on a small scale.—I am,

                        meeting of the George Nungovich Hotels Company was hold last evening in tho
                        Grand Continental Hotel, Cairo. Tho board of directors was given power by a

                        guaranteed by a mortgngo to bo raised on the Continental and Helonan Hotels.
                        This sum is to bo devoted to tho enlargement of tho Savoy Hotel and
                        alterations to tho Continental Hotel, an account of which was given in our

                        Company. M. Bonligny contested the validity of the vote, but it was carried.
                        A dividend of 10s. was agreed upon by the meering, and the board of

                    <p>EGYPTIAN HOTELS COMPANY. The Egyptian 'Hotels' Company, Limited, has gained a
                        groat impetus owing to the ohange in the ownership of the majority of the
                        shares, which, as our readers are aware, passed last year from the hands of
                        the Grand Hotel Company to those of Mr. Charles Baehler. The excellent
                        result of this season’s working will allow of a substantial dividend being
                        declared. The company have offers for their ground at Ghezireh, which, if
                        accepted, will amply cover the entire debenture capital. The remaining
                        capital will therefore in an average year yield dividends that very few
                        companies will be able to compare with. The Ghezireh Palace estate has
                        developed so greatly that it is now the most fashionable suburb in Cairo.
                        The Ghezireh Palace Hotel itself has made a record season, and has quite
                        outgrown its old reputation as a drag on Shop heard’s Hotel, for with tho
                        advance of fashion- able Cairo towards tho west, this hotel will soon be in
                        the centre of a very fashionable residential suburb, .and is therefore
                        becoming year by year more patronised.</p>
                    <p>We understand that at Shepheard’s Hotel great improvements are to be made,
                        especially in regard to the immediate neighbourhood. The shops, for example,
                        iu Kamel-street, on the property of the hotel, are all to be modern- ised.
                        The frontage o.‘ the Shephc-ird’s Hotel property towards Halim Pasha-street
                        is to be built upon and a line of fashionable shojis is to be constructed
                        there. Another line of shops is to be built in tho other frontage, facing
                        the new estate of the Socidtd Beige Egyptienne, which is the direct road to
                        and from the station. By these additions the revenue from the Shepheard's
                        Hotel property will be tre- bled. The prospects of the company are thns
                        bright in the extreme, and under the manage ment of Mr. Baehler the investor
                        may consider that his capital will be safely and remunera- tively
                        employed.</p>

                    <p>THE ARABIAN TROUBLE REMARKABLE ASSERTIONS. Berlin, May 11. The progress of
                        the revolt in tho Yemen is being followed with keen attention in Germany,
                        where the conviction is now publicly proclaim- ed that Great Britain is
                        spinning a vast web of intrigue against the authority of the Sultan.
                        Professor Schumann, the friend and travel- ling companion of tho Emperor,
                        identifies him self in tho “Kroux Zeitung" with the connection put forward
                        by Dr. Ular in the "Revues des Ilevues,” that Groat Britain is endeavouring
                        to foment a movement having .for its object the transfer-reo of the
                        Kbalifate from the Snltan to tho Khedive. He quotes with approval the
                        supgp.lin i th it Ben Said, as well as the Emir of Kuweit, whose object is
                        defined as the establishment of on independent Empire in Central Arabia, are
                        puppets of Great Britain, and adduces the authority of Mustapha Kamel Pasha
                        in support of the assertion that Great Britain will never succeed in
                        "realising th? Napoleonic dream of laying hands on the Khalifate,and thus
                        acquiring a moral dominion over the entire Mussulman world.”</p>
                    <p>According to Mustapha Kamel Pasha, who is described as an Egyptian patriot,
                        the removal of tho supremo religious authority from Con- stantino; le would
                        inevitably lead to the de- molition ol Islam, to which the Khedive would in
                        no cir: mmti' ces give his consent. All Mussulmans are aware of this, and
                        they are becoming embittered even to the pitch of fanaticism against the
                        Arab rebels against the Porte.</p>
                    <p>Profesor Schiomannrpanta to the magni- tude of ihe efforts which Turkey is
                        making to recover her authority in the Yemen, and wains E-gland that if she
                        promotes an in- surrectionary movement her action, taken in conjunction with
                        French policy in Morocco, will provoke a Pan-Ldamitic rising against
                        European influence, which would gravely affect the condition of Tunis,
                        Egypt, and India. The riot mil significance of Professor Schie- manii’s
                        curious admonitions, which wore pub- lished yesterday, is reudered apparent
                        to-day by a j umber of Press articles, in which expressi. n is givon to the
                        fear that Great Britain is of couraging Arabian ambitions in order that she
                        may proclaim a protectorate over Koweit and Baesorah, “the terminus of the
                        Bagdad Railway.” It is farther pointed out that a Ci ntrol Arabian Empire
                        would directly menace that railway, which, by-the-way, has not yet ' e p
                        constructed.</p>

                    <p>The "National Zeiting,”in an elaborate lead- ing artiolo,depicts the entire
                        situation as being governed by '‘the antagonism between Lord Kitcbei er and
                        Lord Curzon.” Lord Kitchener, it says, is convinced that the centre of
                        gravity of Indian do'bnce is in Afghanistan, where the Russian monaco is
                        constantly prescut, whereas Lord Cuizon’s view, which accords with the view
                        hold by the authorities in London, is that it is urgently necessary to
                        counter Russia in Persia. Lord Curzon, concludes the "National Zeitnng,”
                        evidently regards the moment ns opportune for effecting a grand coup in the
                        Persian Gulf, and "it is in this connection that the real significance of
                        British policy in the Yemen must be sought. Lord Kitchener, on the other
                        band, fears that any action in the Persian Gulf will induce a counter-move
                        on the part of Russia again the land frontiers of India. Ho is not ignorant
                        of the meaning of tho concentration of Russian troops near Afghanistan, and
                        he probably knows better than Lord Curzon the actual state of British
                        defences.”</p>

                        tho papers in tho Islamic section bore reference to the local fea- tures of
                        Mohamcdanism in Egypt, while others dealt with tho Islamic system of

                    <p> Mr. P. Greenwood writes as follows to tho editor
                        of the "Times” Sir,—I hope it is possible to be sorry for having said a
                        certain something in a recent speech of mine at tho Trocadero Restaurant and
                        yet be nnablo to admit that it can be charged with culpability. The speech
                        was about the purchase of tho Khedive's Suez Canal shares in 1875, when Sir
                        Edward Stanton was Consul-General at Cairo ; and among other things I said
                        that Lord Derby, annoyed at the want of information from the Consulate on
                        that matter, exclaimed, "Master Stanton shall hear of this !” and then came
                        the words, "and Master Stanton did hoar of it. He was quietly removed from
                        his post, and went into retire- ment, I believe, to some Consulship on the
                        Black Sea." Thereupon Sir Edward Stanton wrote mo a letter of complaint and
                        explanation which I immediately communicated to the "Times.” (His sou,
                        Colonel Stanton, now tells your readers that I "quoted part of the letter
                        but omitted to insert the whole of it.” Here- with I enclose tho original,
                        from which you will see that I did soud to the "TimeB” every word of
                        explanation and complaint which the letter contains.) At tho same time I had
                        to confess that “retirement” is not the right word for the removal of a
                        Government official from one post to another, and that I spoke from
                        uncertain recolleotion—as the words “I believe" indicat- ed—in saying that
                        Sir Edward Stanton was transferred to some post on the Black Sea. Sir Edward
                        Stanton’s statement of the case was this :— "I have, of course, no knowledge
                        as to what may have passed between Lord Derby and yourself. But I beg leave
                        to state that your reference is to my removal, is absolutely untrue. The
                        negotiations with the Khedive for the purchase of the Canal shares were car-
                        ried out entirely by myself ; and I remained at my post till 1876, when I
                        gladly accepted the promotion to tho post of Chargd d’Affaires in Bavaria,
                        having previously declined the offer of the Legation of Chile, offered me by
                        Lord Derby."</p>
                    <p>In transcribing this statement for the “Times” I made no objection to any
                        part of it, nor did I offer any remark upon it And I would gladly say no
                        more now, except that I am truly sorry for having dropped a sentence which a
                        moment’s reflection would have told me must give pain. Now, however, I am
                        put in this position by the publication in the "Times” of a letter from Sir
                        Edward Stanton’s son:—Either I must teem to admit by silence that Sir
                        Edward’s statement contradicts me and that I have been culpably wrong, or
                        else 1 mast place that statement under the light of certain facts which Sir
                        Edward himself asserts. There is no other choice, and I cannot be blamed, 1
                        think, for not choosing silence.</p>
                    <p>That Lord Derby had reason for dissatis- faction is expressly admitted. For
                        the rest, Sir Edward’s own statement is that, whereas the affair of tho
                        Caual shares happened near the close of 1875 (middle of November in that
                        year), he left Egypt in 1876, and that in this year he was first offered the
                        Legation of Chile, which he declined, and then gladly accepted the post of
                        Charge d’Affaires in Bavaria. But what then ! 1875...1876, Egypt, Chile
                        thirty years ago, and Munich after the confederation of the German Empire.
                        Would it be unfair to say that, so far, there is more confirmation than
                        contradiction 1 Now, however, Colonel Stanton adds a particular which Sir
                        Edward did not mention. He says that his father, “for purely private
                        reasons, and on tho score of health, asked for a chaugo," and then was
                        offered Chile. There is no resisting that statement and there can be no wish
                        to do so. But without it, and under any circumstances, I should' still
                        regret the heedlessness which, as I well understand, must have troubled Sir
                        Edward Stanton with- out need.</p>

                        attended. The Irrigation Inspector, the Chief Engineer, the sanitary

                    <p>Mohamed Bey El Wakil suggested that an ■‘Agricultural Review,” dealing with
                        trees and flowers, the method and periods of their cul- tivation, etc.,
                        should bo published periodically and distributed among agriculturists. He
                        stat- ed that the absence of such a review kept gardening in a backward
                        state in Egypt. Ismail Boy Dabus suggested that the society should
                        distribute rewards among persons who took pains in cleaning their cotton
                        crop, so as to encourage others to follow their example. He also suggested
                        that the Miuistry of the Interior should issue a circular to the omdehs
                        informing them that a deputation of the K.A.S. would go round the provinces
                        to examine the cotton plantations, and that in satisfactory cases the board
                        would instruct the banks who purchase the cotton to sell to the society the
                        cotton s-icd from the cotton purchased. Iu this way, ho stated, the society
                        would possess a store of cotton seed from different provinces. There were
                        many other proposals of a minor character.</p>

                    <p> Professor Naville and Mr. H. R. Hall have been
                        excavating at the eleventh dynasty tem- ple at Dfir-el-Bahari at Thebes this
                        winter for the Egyptian Exploration Fond and some im- portant discoveries
                        have resulted. The site of their work was the space left untouched dur- ing
                        Prof. Naville’s excavation of the well- known temple of Queen Hatshepsut.
                        The ro- sult of ;heir labours is tho discovery of the funerary temple of tho
                        eleventh dynasty king Montnhotep III. (Noblnpet-Ra), containing the graves
                        of priestesses of the goddess Hathor, a divinity specially worshipped at D6r
                        el Bahari. The existence of eleventh-dynasty buildings here had long been
                        suspected, but not hitherto discovered. The temple was reached in the course
                        of the first season’s work, 1903 4, and the great court and the northern
                        colonnade cleared, and some fine reliefs were discovered. In the past
                        season, 19L4-5, the temple was approached from the south, and the central
                        pyramid and shrines of the priestesses of Ha- thor were cleared. In the
                        course of the digging some fine portrait-statues of the twelfth-dy- nasty
                        king Usertsen III. were unearthed, as well as many small objects, such as
                        workmen’s tools, left during tho repairs to the temple, which seem to have
                        been effeoted during the reign of Siptah, of whom a relief was found on the
                        facing of the pyramid. The temple is of importance as being the most perfect
                        known temple-building of this early period, and the mo3t ancient building at
                        Thebes. Architectur- ally it is interesting, as it stands on an arti-
                        ficially squared platform of rock, approached by a sloping ramp, flanked by
                        colonnades which led up to a granite doorway, beyond which was a sort of
                        ambulatory of proto-Doric columns surrounding a square central erection
                        apparently the bare of a pyramid. At the back of this are finely decorated
                        shrines oft he priest- esses of Hathor. What lies beyond remains yet to be
                        explored. About two-thirds of the work is completed, and it is expected that
                        tho excavation of the remainder of the si*e will reveal the existence of the
                        king’s own shrine, which, if well preserved 1, will be a most remark- able
                        relio of Egyptian antiquity.</p>

                    <p> The Arabic-speaking population of Cairo and
                        Alexandria have not yet woke up to the ad- vantages of telephone
                        communication between the two cities. This is obvious from the statistics of
                        the telegrams for last year. The number of messages sent over the Egyptian
                        lines was, in round figures, 1,825 000, an in- crease of 179,000 over 1903.
                        Of this increase, 176.000 was in Arabio telegrams, and only 3.000 in
                        European telegrams. The European traffic was adversely affected by the com-
                        petition of the C riro-Alexandria telephone. Thesame cause also led to a
                        diminution of 13$ per cent, in the number of "urgent" (triple- tax)
                        telegrams sent over the line-1. The tele- jihonio communication between
                        Cairo and Alexandria brought in to tho Government a revenue of L.E. 8,423 in
                        1904, Of this sum, I/.E. 1.P60 represents the rent paid by the Telephone
                        Company for the two circuits leased to them, The balance of L.E 2,078 waR
                        earned by the two circuits worked by tho Telegraph Department between the
                        Bourses of Cairo and Alexandria. This latter sum represents 41,460 calls of
                        three minutes’ conversation.</p>

                    <p>THE STATE RAILWAYS. BY “TRAFFIC.” (SECOND ARTICLE). The work to be done by
                        the Council and the General Manager may be summed up as the "Administrative”
                        work, or work of control, and, this having been provided for, there remains
                        the executive work or actual working of the railway. This falls naturally
                        under their heads having reference to the object with which a railway is
                        established. This is, to provide for the conveyance of goods and passengers
                        from place to place over the lines of the railway, and there are three prime
                        essentials that go to the realization of this object; first, the provi- sion
                        of the “railway," the lines, stations, etc.; secondly, that of vehicles to
                        carry the goods and passengers, and, thirdly, that of the motive power. The
                        provision and employment of these essentials under the conditions that
                        affect the management of a modern railway involve a number of minor
                        departments such as the Signaling Telegraph Stores etc which are
                        inderdependent.</p>
                    <p>Now that a railway may be worked economically and efficiently nothing is of
                        more importance than that these different depart- that they may work
                        together, each accomplish- ing its own work m the best manner and each
                        contributing in the largest possible manner to the efficiency of the others.
                        This interdependence of the different departments goes down to the minutest
                        details in all branches of the work, and it is evident therefore that the
                        first essential of an effective executive service is the proper coordination
                        of its various sections How this can best be attained is a question upon
                        which authorities are not agreed. Almost every railway has its own method,
                        the great diversity that obtains in actual praotice being however largely
                        due to the varying conditions and circumstances under which the different
                        lines are worked. As a generally applicable system, and one that very nearly
                        approaches that at present adopted by the State Railways, the following
                        diagram gives a clearer idea than can be obtained from a mere verbal
                        explanation:-</p>
                    <p>This diagram is defective in respect that it , Ices not sufficiently clearly
                        show the close , relation existing between the Traffic and the | Signaling
                        Departments. Originally, when rail- way signaling was of the most primitive
                        kind, 1 it was always looked upon as part of the work of the Permanent Way,
                        or Way and Works, hut with the use of the modem block systems ! of signaling
                        this department absolutely 1 demands tho services of special experts, who 1
                        must be wholly guided in their work by the ' requirements of the traffic,
                        and while there- 1 fore still bound to work in close co-operation ' with tho
                        Way and Works it may justly be ; looked upon as a sister branch of the whole
                        work of the lines rather than as a section of the Way.</p>
                    <p>It will be seen that this table gives eleven departments instead of the “four
                        or five” mentioned by the Commission. Of these, 3, 4,5 and 6 represent the
                        work of which the traffic manager is, or should be, the controlling chief, 5
                        and 6 may be and often are, as here in Egypt, united in one department. No.
                        7, the Way and Works, is the department that lays the lines and keeps them
                        in repair and so forth, and it must therefore work in the most perfect har-
                        mony with the Traffic but with the utmost independence as to its internal
                        organization and working.</p>
                    <p>The Stores Department having to provide all the materials of every kind
                        necessary for tho working of the railway, should have as branches of its
                        work the printing and lighting (by oil, etc.), at present, I believe, worked
                        in- dependently. The internal organization of this /department is a matter
                        of great importance. To be efficient there should be one head or central and
                        controlling office, aided by a num- ber of local stores in required centers,
                        for the distribution of material.</p>
                    <p>Finally, the Account Department should be in a measure at once the obedient
                        servant and the absolute master of all the others. It should be divided, not
                        as the Commission suggest into two, but into three sections, the accounts
                        proper, the registering of income and expendi- ture, the cash, and the audit
                        This latter should be quite independent.</p>

                    <p>BIG COTTON WAREHOUSE DESTROYED. Loss to the extent of nearly £50,000 was
                        caused last week by a fire at a cotton ware- hc uie of the Lancashire and
                        Yorkshire Rail- way, at Oldham. Over 4,0C0 hales of cotton were involved,
                        and the blaze was tremendous. The warehouse, which was 60 yards square, was
                        specially built for cotton storage. For- tunately, tho flames were kept from

                    <p>Major Charles Moore, Royal Berkshire Re- giment, Superintendent of Gymnasia
                        at Col- chester, has passed the qualifying examination for promotion to the
                        rauk of lieutenant-colonel. Major Moore has also had the advantage of
                        Eractical as well as theoretical campaigning, aving seen service in the
                        Sudan operations of 1885-S6, including the action of Ginniss having seen
                        service in the Sudan operation of 1885-S6, including the action of Ginnia
                        (medal and Khedive’s star). Says a contemporary—Lord Cromer and the Sirdar,
                        Sir Reginald Wingate, are anxious to increase the efficiency of the Sudanese
                        batta- lions of the Egyptian Army and to induce a larger number of recruits
                        to join the colours One most successful method was that adopted with the
                        native Egyptians by the military authorities years ago.</p>
                    <p>In the “good old days” of Egypt—modern j Egypt, of course—the recruit never
                        know how i long he would have to serve ; enlistment was 1 next door to
                        banishment; the comfort of the private soldiers was not thought of; barracks
                        i were offensively foul. However, when Lord i Dufferin took charge all this
                        was changed. The i men were properly fed, clothed, and housed ; their pay
                        was regular ; they were looked after i when ill. The soldier actually got
                        leave, and i wont home to his native village with money in | his pocket. No
                        better inducement could be i placed before the fellaheen.</p>
                    <p>But apparently the Shilluks and Dinkas of ' the Sudan have neither forgotten
                        the old con- ditions nor properly understood the new, and are shy of taking
                        service. These black men of the Sudan, however, unlike the Egyptians, do not
                        take kindly to drill. They can scarcely be described as muscular, being
                        tall, slight, nar- row-shouldered men, liable to chest complaints, but they
                        are full of activity, and have a posi- tive love of fighting. The Dinks is
                        first cousin to “Fuzzy-Wuzzy,” and only needs the lead of a capable British
                        officer to face any foe. They fear nothing, and appear to have more in
                        common with white troops than with their Egyptian contemporaries.</p>
                    <p>The dramatic climax in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s “Waterloo,” in which the old
                        Guards- man falls back dead after recounting his fight- ing days, is
                        recalled in a striking manner, says the “Chronicle,” by the death of a
                        Crimean veteran, named Friend, at Shoe buryness. After being unconscious for
                        three days, Friend seemed to rally somewhat, and the watchers by his bedside
                        noticed that he appeared to be attempting to describe something that was
                        passing through his mind, Presently he was heard to mutter, “Hark! Music 1
                        the band of the 44th I” The old man raised himself np in bed, while a faint
                        smile Bickered about his face, and then fell back almost immediately. He was
                        dead. Friend enlisted in the old "Fighting 44th,” and was made a sergeant
                        fox a deed of heroism at the battle of Ain a. He stood beside Captain Nolan
                        when the “Charge” was ordered ' at Balaolava, and Nolan's body fell at his
                        feet when the dead rider’s horse stopped after the charge.</p>
                    <p>Something like coma or suspended anima- tion has fallen upon the much vexed
                        subject of Army reconstruction. We may still believe that things are in a
                        bad way, but apparently we do not greatly care, and are content to leave the
                        new men to work their will without protest or interference. One very serious
                        ques- tion, that of our reserves, is being more and more neglected, and to a
                        dangerous degree. The new sobbed of the General Service Army may have much
                        to recommend it, but when fully in working order the reserve naturally must
                        suffer. The system of prolonged service with the colours must of course
                        impoverish the reserve, and, so far, no steps have been taken to meet the
                        depletion. The true remedy is in the development of the other part of the
                        scheme, the creation of the home or short ser vice army from which men will
                        pass quiokly and in considerable numbers into the reserve. It is very
                        reasonably feared that candidates if they have their choice between engaging
                        for three or nine years will almost certainly elect the former, and we shall
                        once more find a deficit the foreign drafts</p>

                    <p>BY JOSEPH OFFORD. In the "Bulletin de la Socfctd Framjaioe Jo Fnui les
                        Archcologiqnes,” 2nd fascicule, M. de Riddtr ^ivea a summary of the last
                        campaign of excavation carried out by M. Gayet at Antinode. In this, his
                        ninth season of research, M. Gayet again devoted his atten- tion entirely to
                        the „ necropolis, the tombs forming which are excavated in the hill ^ sides,
                        or in the defiles of the hills behind tho site of the ancient city. The
                        entrances to the sepulchers had, however, been almost entirely covered up by
                        the accumulating sands of centuries, rendering it difficult to disci v.-r,
                        and dangerous to excavate them nnlers all the debris was removed in the most
                        thorough and consequently costly manner, s beyond the possibility of the
                        funds at the explorer’s disposal.</p>
                    <p>Not with standing these difficulties, the results I of the work have been as
                        successful as upon \ auy previous occasion, and will almost oer- j taiuly
                        tempt the society to provide the j means for further carrying on the
                        researches. Among the sepulchers excavated is one be- longing to an actor in
                        the Olympic games, ] a charioteer, .and a gladiator. Also one of a lady
                        named Khelnies, the singer of Oseris- j Antinon". Many of the mummies have
                        the faoe and busts protected by cartonage masks, or breastplates painted and
                        gilded, the oolours still brilliant aud the excellent workmanship of the
                        painter well preserved. There are the usual terra cottas and vases of all
                        ages, from the old Mykenaen style to tho Persian, s and even Byzantine
                        epoch. A quantity of I late ivory carvings are among the smaller t class of
                        relios.</p>
                    <p>As in previous years the quantity of dress £ fabrios and tissues forms the
                        chief produot of i the excavations. They are of immense variety f and many
                        of the designs of most fantastio oha- c racter. M. de Bidder thinks one
                        tableau re- e presents an episode in the legend of Dionysius, t as preserved
                        in the Alexandrian oomedy.Many e of the worked figures have the
                        characternames i embroil icred beside them iu Greek letters. i The fi eat
                        specimens of M. Gayet’s earlior i finds of vestments are now in the Brussels
                        c Museum, and it is to be hoped that the oollec- t tion obtained last year
                        may be retained in i Franoe.</p>
                    <p>During the year 1904 the Musses Royanx c at Brussels have secured numerous
                        additions e to’the Egyptian collection there, chiefly by ] pnrehase from the
                        Amelineau sale b Paris, ( and by presentation from the British "Egypt
                        Exploration Fund."</p>
                    <p>Among the various objects, several provide new names of members of royal
                        families, or notabilities, and deserve recording because the notice of them
                        may lead to the identification of other memorials of the same personages, or
                        to connecting them with monuments of their relatives, and thus hasten the
                        time when the great history ol Egypt, its Pharaohs, officials, - and people,
                        from Menes to Alexander can be 1 written.</p>
                    <p>Some funerary statuettes from theElKharjeh oasis give us a new ohief of that
                        distriot, “the prince of the southern oasis,Nehmehy.”A frag- ment of a

                        Thyi- mer-en ast A larger portion of tbs stele is now stored iu the Cairo
                        Museum. Very interesting from the scientific post of view, as displaying tho
                        metallurgical knowledge of the ancient Egyptians in very early times, is a
                        oopper vase which Professor Petrie asoribas to Papi I. of the 6th dynasty,
                        and as Mr. Quibell found large bronze statues of that period atHieracon-
                        opolis, the bronze founders of that epoch must have been experts.</p>
                    <p>Last year the Brussels Museum received a large imitation of a feather plume,
                        stuccoed and gilded, which on close examination proved to be of bronze; it
                        therefore may be considered to have fitted into the head dress of such a
                        brotize statue. Among the thousands of objects found by M. LegTab last year
                        at the Karnak temple he enumerates “grandee plumes ornant la coiffure
                        d’Osiris en bronze borustd et dob.” From the Amelineau sale came a large
                        vase ornamented with a figure of Osiris incised upon the clay of the vase,
                        and bearing a long hieroglyphic inscription giving the names of two priests.
                        It dates from the 19th dynasty or thereabouts, to judge from the
                        workmanship. Of the same period is a little miniature sarcophagus of a
                        scribe named Si 1 Isis, and a statuette of a certain Peduhor, son 1 of
                        Pedubastit.</p>
                    <p>The antiquities received from the "Egypt Exploration Fond” include objects
                        inscribed with names of the earliest dynasty monarchs, such as Nar Mer,
                        Hotel-Aharri, and Noteren, also a princess Neit-Hotep, perhaps of the first
                        dynasty. These were completed by the acquisition of a gTanite fragment
                        bearing the name of King Den. Of the same epoch are two ivory figures of a
                        dog and a lion; the latter an exceedingly well-executed piece of realistic
                        work.</p>
                    <p>An interesting relic is the wooden "plan- Odette" of a scribe of the Roman
                        epooh, valu- able as a specimen of Coptio calligraphy, for hoth sides of the
                        object are covered with Coptio writing giving the accounts of some church. A
                        small collection of papyri is selected from the vast stores recovered by
                        Messrs. Grenfell and Huntione contains the commence- ment of chant 19 of the

                            <p>EGYPTS PROGRESS Mr. Joseph Chamberlain presided at the annual dinner
                                of the London School of Tropical Medicine, held at the Hotel Cecil,
                                London, on the 10th inst. The guests numbered nearly 500. In
                                proposing the toast, “The London School of Tropical Medicbe,” Mr.
                                Chamberlain, in the course of his speech, said : Just think for a
                                moment of one or two well-known instan- oea. Compare the condition
                                of Egypt as it was a quarter of a century ago, when this rich coun-
                                try was apparently b the down stage, and it seemed hardly possible
                                that it could ever agab rise from its ashes. Compare it as it was,
                                almost impotent owing to the extortions practiced b it, with the
                                Egypt of Lord Cromer—the Egypt of to-day. Look at the case perhaps
                                even more extraordinary, of the Sudan—five years ago devastated by
                                the brutal tyranny of its rulers, the people tortured and oppressed,
                                the whole country depopulated till there were not enough souls in
                                the land to till it and gab its riohes. Now see it, a few years
                                later, rising bto a greater prosperity than ever before.</p>

                                conclusion of their Report to the Di- rectors, dated 26th January,
                                1905, is as follows:— Taking a broad view of the whole matter, we
                                feel that we can recommend the property, and that-with' a canal
                                constructed and given sufficient water, your Compauy formed to

                                be produoed therefrom, and the conclusion of these estimates is that
                                when the whole of the area is under cultivation the orops will pro-
                                duce, as a minimum estimate, a net profit of £72,000 per annum.
                                Early application will be made to the Egyptian Government, as
                                reoommended by Sir Douglas Fox 4 Partners in their report, for the
