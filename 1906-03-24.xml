                    <p>Berths can be definitely engaged beforehand. Plans can be seen at the Offices
                        of the Company's Agents.</p>
                    <p>The through Steamers for Marseilles, Gibraltar, Plymouth and London are
                        Intended to leave Port Said after the arrival of the 11 a.m. train from
                        Cairo, every Monday. A steam tender will meet the train to convey passengers
                        to the ship.</p>
                    <p>The Brindisi Express Steamer leaves Port Said directly the Indian Mails
                        arrive. Passengers can go on board the evening before.</p>
                    <p>The express steamer usually reaches Brindisi on Wednesday afternoon, the
                        special train starting at 8 p.m. and arriving in London at the very
                        convenient hour of 4.56 p.m. on Friday.</p>
                    <p>The combined Sea and special train fare is £22.9.11 Port Said to London via
                        Brindisi or via Marseilles.</p>
                    <p>Passengers having paid fall fare in one direction are allowed an abatement of
                        25 per cent, on returning within 12 months.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the above regular weekly service there are sailings about
                        twice a fortnight of 5,000 to 7,000 tons steamers to London, calling at
                        Malta or Marseilles.</p>
                    <p>TO THE EAST.</p>
                    <p>The Mail Steamers leave Suez for Aden and Bombay every Wednesday, and for
                        Australia and China every alternate Wednesday. A steamer leaves for
                        Calcutta, fortnightly, and another for Japan. Passengers can embark at Port
                        Said.</p>

                    <head> EUROPE'S FUTURE: RETRENCHMENT OR REVOLUTION. </head>
                    <p>With the exception of Russia. Lord Avebury in th. "Nineteenth Century ''
                        says, the greatStates of Europe cannot produce the food required by their
                        people, even at the present rate of living. They all import food and export
                        manufactures. Take away the market for their manufactures and they will be
                        unable to buy the food they require. Until recently, however, they have had
                        no effective competition. The United States were, till within the last few
                        years, mainly an agricultural commodity. Even now they require most of their
                        manufactures for home use. Gradually, however, the surplus is increasing and
                        the competition becoming more severe, Our great Colonies, moreover, wisely
                        or unwisely</p>
                    <p>- unwisely as I think-are all endeavouring to check the development of their
                        great tracts of virgin soil, and to foster the town at the expense of the
                        country. Take Canada, for instance, and look at the effect of Canadian
                        duties on Canada herself. The winters -are very cold, and she compels her
                        people to pay 10, 15, or even 20 per cent. more than they need for warm
                        clothing. She needs railways to develop her magnificent agricultural
                        districts in the West, and she artificially enhances the prices of rails.
                        When I think over these things I sometimes doubt whether men have reason
                        after all! But the military and naval expenditure of the Colonies is
                        trifling. They decline to bear any fair proportion of our expenses on the
                        Army and Navy, and are technically within their right in doing so. We
                        cannot, if we would, compel them, and would not if we could. If they
                        contribute it must be done voluntarily. Only they must remember that there
                        are at present no Imperial forces. The Army and Navy are entirely supported
                        by, and belong to, the British Isles. If a colony gets into trouble with any
                        first-class Power, any assistance we might give would be an act of grace ;
                        they cannot claim it as a right. The military and naval expenditure of the
                        United States and of our Colonies is then very small compared with ours and
                        that of other European States. Competition with America and our Colonies is
                        therefore becoming more and more difficult. Manufactures will, cateris
                        paribus, gradually be transferred to the countries which are most lightly
                        taxed. This will more and more aggravate the evil, so that unless we turn
                        over a new leaf the prospects of Europe are very grave. In fact, as long as
                        these armaments are maintained we are sitting on a volcano. The enormous and
                        wasteful expenditure of Europe means lower with higher prices of the
                        necessaries of life, and harder work. It makes life a heavier, and for
                        millions an almost intolerable, burden. ... Bayonets are good as weapons,
                        but not to sit on... Unless something is done the condition of the poor in
                        Europe will grow worse and worse. It is no use shutting our eyes. Revolution
                        may not come soon, not probably in our time, but come it will, and as sure
                        as fate there will be an explosion such as the world has never seen. If the
                        monarchs of Europe are to retain their thrones, and if we are to maintain
                        peace, European statesmen must devise some means of fostering better
                        feelings, and diminishing the burdens which now press so heavily on the
                        springs of industry and aggravate so terribly the unavoidable troubles of
                        life. Is this hopeless? … Is it altogether utopian to suggest that come
                        representatives of the navies of England, France, Germany, and Russia might
                        meet and agree on a common basis, not, of course, as binding on, but as a
                        suggestion to their respective Governments? .... I have argued the question
                        mainly on material and economical grounds. But, after all, we ought not to
                        forget that we are a Christian people. The present state of Borope is
                        discreditable to us not only as men of common sense, but as being altogether
                        inconsistent with any form of religious convictions ? … "</p>

                            The vessel was watched, and two sacks, containing 110 kilos of hashish,
                            which were thrown overboard, were seized. Two well-known smugglers, who
                            were on board and threw the sacks into the water were also

                    <head>MANSOURAH'S PROGRESS.</head>
                    <p>Mansourah is the most advanced of the provincial centre of population in the
                        Delta, and all who are interested in the progress of Egypt will read the
                        report of the working of the Municipal Commission of that town from 1899 to
                        the end of 1905. The Mixed Municipal Commission of Mansourah was founded by
                        a Khedivial decree in June, 1881, but the institution did not have any
                        practical existence until the end of 1898, owing to the difficulty of
                        persuading the various elements of the population to pay a municipal tax
                        without which a Municipal Commission could not exist. But in 1903 the
                        discontent with the institution showed itself by many of the inhabitants of
                        the town officially notifying, "par acte d'huissier," the chairman of the
                        Commission that they would no longer agree to pay the tax.</p>
                    <p>Mustapha Pacha Maher, the Moudir of Dakaklieh, Chairman of the Commission,
                        however, succeeded in persuading them to renew their engagement as to the
                        municipal tax for a third triennial period, from 1905 to 1907, and he gave
                        them an undertaking to publish a conscientious account of the actual
                        situation of the Municipality. This publication has just been issued and it
                        is a very useful document for all those (we do not believe they are many)
                        who take an interest in the development of municipal institutions in Egypt.
                        The subjects treated of are naturally excessively local and of no interest
                        to anyone outside the town. But they show that Mansourah is steadily
                        progressing and that the persons responsible for the control of the
                        Municipal Commission have some ideas of civic duty.</p>
                    <p>We congratulate Mustapha Pacha Maher on bis labours, for the report he has
                        drawn up should convince the people of Mansourah that they get a good deal
                        of value for a very light burthen of taxation, and that the Egyptian
                        Government is doing its best to help them in advancing the well-being of one
                        of the most pleasant provincial towns in Egypt.</p>

                    <head>THE MINET-EL-BASSAL FIRE.</head>
                    <p> AN AMERICAN'S INTERESTING QUERIES. </p>
                    <p>The adjustment committee have finished the settlement of all the claims
                        arising out of the recent great cotton fire at Minet-el-Bassal. It is very
                        satisfactory to find how speedily the enormous amount of work, which has had
                        to pass through the committee's hands, has been transacted.</p>
                    <p>Within less than two months of the configuration the parties interested,
                        namely, two of the most important cotton-exporting firms in Egypt, have
                        received the total amount claimed by them. Such expedition is unknown in
                        similar cases in Europe. Here it is due to the liberal and easy terms of the
                        agents of the insurance companies, who have done all they can to satisfy
                        claimants as they are in this case well aware of the bona fides of all the
                        firms concerned.</p>
                    <p>We know perfectly well that the work of salvage has been a record, for over
                        1,930 bale steam pressed, were put on sale out of the whole lot of 1,280
                        pressed bales damaged, producing, with a few insignificant items added, over
                        L.E. 35,000. This is in a great measure due to the celerity of the
                        adjustment committee and also to the great judgment exercised by Mr. Frank
                        Haselden, whose competence and resources for dealing with such crises are
                        unparalleled in Egypt.</p>
                    <p>A New York correspondent has prt to the "Manchester Guardian" certain
                        questions with reference to the above fire, which the journal confesses its
                        inability to answer. The letter is as follows :-</p>
                    <p>"Referring to the recent cotton fire at the Choremi Press in Alexandria,
                        Egypt, kindly let me know in what condition the bulk of the bales were after
                        the fire. I mean as compared to bales which were not so heavily compressed.
                        What density did these bales have? Also what pressure was used (per square
                        inch) in compressing them? Was the fire due to spontaneous combustion of the
                        cotton? What is the greatest density obtained either by steam or hydraulic
                        compressing? What is the limit of pressure which can be used in compressing
                        a cotton bale? These are interesting questions, and it is possible that some
                        of our readers can throw light on them.</p>

                    <p>The American Diplomatic Agency in Egypt has lost one of its most popular
                        members by the departure of the Hon. Fred. Morgan, who has resigned the post
                        of Vice-Consul-General which he has held for over three years, and left on
                        Wednesday for Marseilles. A large gathering of friends was present at the
                        railway station to wish him good-bye. Mr. Morgan will in all probability
                        resign the diplomatic service altogether. His handsome residence and grounds
                        at Kasr-el Doubara were lately sold to the Princess, former wife of H.H.
                        Prince Abmed Fouad Pachs. The mansion is at present occupied by the American
                        Agency, but as the lease of the house, when sold in November was for one
                        year, the offices of the Agency and Consulate will have to be removed
                        elsewhere at that date.</p>

                    <p>LA FAILLITE DES SUCRERIES</p>
                    <p>The Ministry of the lnterior has issued a full and interesting report on the
                        cotton worm in 1905. The experience of last year taught cultivators and
                        officials much that they did not know before, and the cotton worm, which had
                        hitherto done such a vast amount of injury, last year did absolutely
                        none.</p>
                    <p>If the Government had not taken up the matter of the worm, the result would
                        have been disastrous for the crop. All the lessons learned are to be applied
                        this year, and until such time as every cultivator can be relied upon to
                        look after his own crops.</p>
                    <p>Many of the modifications indicated as desirable will be adopted, and it is
                        to be hoped the sympathy and the support of the population can be relied
                        upon.</p>
                    <p>Improved seed and artificial mandres will continue to be supplied by the
                        Khedivial Agricultural Society, and the executive may be relied upon to
                        renew its exertions ; but the mystery of the boil-worm must be solved, and
                        an effort must be made to see whether it will not be possible to evolve some
                        means of dealing more scientifically with the water which the Irrigation
                        Department can supply Scepticism, apathy and inertia on the part of the
                        smaller cultivators were the chief difficulties with which the authorities
                        had to contend. The moudirieh and markaz officials at once grasped the
                        importance of their task, and responded to the call, but some of the omdehs
                        and sheikhs could not be induced to take it seriously until a certain number
                        of punishments had been inflicted and the smaller fellaheen only began to
                        believe when they saw that their cotton from which they had collected so
                        many millions of eggs was now healthy and strong, whereas last year in many
                        cases nothing but the wood was left. "These English learned about the worm
                        from books," said a fellah in Mazala, and another in Faraqur told an
                        inspector that he would have done all this long ago if he had known that the
                        worms came from eggs and could be destroyed.</p>
                    <p>The fellah is quite unable to work out his own salvation, but when once he
                        has been forcibly convinced that his interest lies in certain direction his
                        opposition gradually ceases. For years he has seen Europeans and wealthier
                        proprietors clean their land with certain measure of success, but it
                        required, Decree and a very vigorous application, of make him do anything

                    <p>ADDIS ABEBA, March 23. </p>
                    <p>Ras Makonnen is dead. (Reuter) </p>
                    <p>The death of Ras Makonnen is an important matter for Abyssinia as he was
                        always held to be the probable successor of Menelik as Emperor of Abyssinia,
                        for Menelik has no children. Res Makonnen, it will be remembered, was
                        designated by the Emperor as his representative at King Edward's coronation,
                        and Earopeans who have visited Abyssinia have almost invariably carried away
                        the impression that, notwithstanding the absence of any formal indication of
                        his wishes, Menelik was anxious to prepare the way for Ras Makonnen's
                        succession to the Abyssinian Throne in the event of his own decease. Ras
                        Makonnen was distinguished from the general bulk of the high officials who
                        constitute the ruling class in Abyssinia. Mr. Angostas B. Wylde described
                        him as "by far the cleverest and most enlightened man that the country
                        possesses," and other Earopeans who have been brought into personal or
                        official relations with him hwe formed a similarly high estimate of his
                        character and talents. His exact age does not appear to be known, or at any
                        rate to have been recorded, but he was probably a little over forty
                        years.</p>
                    <p>In character, no less than in attainments. Ras Mekonnen stood somewhat apart
                        both from the general body of his countrymen and from other members of the
                        ruling class. The Abyssinian soldier is by nature a roystering, swaggering
                        fellow, and since the defeat of the Italians Europeans travelling in the
                        country have not infrequently had to complain of the conduct of the
                        undisciplined bands of soldiery whom they encountered. Ras Makonnen was
                        brave and a tried soldier, as be proved on many expeditions against
                        rebellious chiefs and in the Italian campaign, but there was nothing of the
                        swaggerer in his composition, Physically he was not a strong man, and in a
                        country where religion is little more than a name he had the reputation of
                        being some bing of a religions enthusiast. M. Hugues le Roux, one of the
                        most recent European visitors to Abyssinia, gives a vivid little pen picture
                        of the man: "Il est difficile de se figurer un visage plus charmant. Devant
                        ce profil si fio,ces grands yeux presque trop expressifs et eu l'extase
                        religieuse apparaît comme volonté, remplaçant l'ironie sémite, on songe aux
                        petits christs byzantine, tout en expression, tout en âme, cachant dans les
                        plis d'un étroit manteau on corps asce iqne." Another French traveller, M.
                        Charles Michel, who visited Abyssinia as second in command of the Bonchamps
                        Mission, which was intended to join hands from the Abyssinian side with the
                        Marchand Expedition at Fashoda, has also placed on his impressions of Ras
                        Makonnen, He described him as a grand sei neur of the olden time, "très
                        froid, très réflé-hi, et très digne," who impressed himself on the French
                        traveller as being "quelqu'un." Further acquaintance only served to
                        strengthen the original impression, and M. Micbel states as a remarkable
                        and, indeed, in Abyssinia an astonishing fact that not only was Ras Makonnen
                        full of dignity but that he was a man of irreproachable life. </p>

                       M. LE BARGY'S COMPANY.
                    </p>
                    <p>(FROM A Cairo CORRESPONDENT.)</p>
                    <p>M. Le Bargy and his colleagues are here at last and have so far given two
                        performances <hi rend="italic">Le Marquis de Priola</hi> and <hi
                            rend="italic">Le Demi Monde</hi> What a change from the usual "show" at
                        the theatre! Real acting, and real plays, instead of the sham boredom with
                        so few relieving touches, endured (if not even admired!) by the unchanging
                        audience of the Khedivial Opera House. For all that, the audience was much
                        the same as usual : there were the familiar faces, and the familiar cough,
                        rustle, and whispered mistranslation from French into Arabic of this or that
                        phrase. It is indeed difficult to follow and listen to plays under such
                        circumstances ; and that is my chief excuse for giving no more than a
                        general impression of both the plays so far presented. M. Le Bargy and Mlle.
                        Baréty are certainly the two stars, and so far each has had one great part,
                        he as le Marquis de Priola, and she as Mme d'Ange. He is infinitely and
                        delightfully varied, dignified, fiery-"fougueux" is the real word, - "subtle
                        and persuasive" ; in fact the real "homme d'esprit." Somehow, though, there
                        were moments in the Marquis de Priola where he seemed to force the note, to
                        be too ardent and emphatic ; but the rapid delicacy of his "courtship"
                        scenes, with their subdued fire, were a delight. That play is what most
                        worthy people would call "very French," but for all its cynicism, it has
                        something most natural throughout, and typical.</p>
                    <p>The other play, Le Demi Monde, is older, and more psychological possibly,
                        longer, and except for most of the last three acts, not so interesting. But
                        those acts : the end of the 3rd, the 4th, and the beginning of the finale,
                        these are great, and Mlle. Baréty gave a great interpretation. Every glance,
                        intonation, gesture, was reality, painful and absorbing. I was able to
                        follow that part, as the audience were really held by it, and, relatively
                        speaking, one could bear all that was said on the stage.</p>
                    <p>We have <hi rend="italic">Le Duel</hi> to-night, one of M. le Bargy's great
                        parts. The whole programme indeed is good. The rest of the caste seemed to
                        me to be quite adequate, not exactly wonderful but well able to appear with
                        credit in the company of the two stars: and that says much. Mlle. Bernou was
                        perhaps the best. M. Dauvillier was good as de Nanjac, very good now and
                        again. It will be easier to criticise after a few more performances, and
                        when we have seen the various "sides" of all these performers : certainly M.
                        Le Bargy and Mlle. Baréty are in themselves a whole world of different
                        phases of humanity : it is an education to see such acting.</p>

                    <p>To ensure a natural movement of the bowels, it is most important to take
                        plenty of exercise every day. Many men and women don't do this, and they
                        become more or less costive, sometimes going two or three days without a
                        passage from the bowels. This is a very serious thing, not only because
                        constipation makes our food and blood impure, but because the prolonged
                        presence of waste matter in the bowels strains the muscular walls,eventually
                        paralysing them, so that instruments have to be used to remove the
                        impurities.</p>
                    <p>Those who cannot get enough exercise, or whose work is sedentary, should use

                        liver, stomach, and whole digestive organism. Doan's Dinner Pills soften the
                        mass of clogging waste, preventing piles,and inflammation of the intestines;
                        and they care sluggish liver, indigestion, biliousness, headache, poor
                        appetite, impoverished blood, and every symptom of liver, stomach, or bowel

                    <p>Dear Mr. Ward, -Your delightful and most interesting book on the Sudan has
                        reached me. I congratulate you heartily on the excellent manner in which the
                        work is written and illustrated. All of us who have done our little buast to
                        regenerate the country, after its terrible misfortunes, have received more
                        than kind treatment at your hands... I don't suppose anyone realises more
                        than I do the change that has come over the Sudan since my old and
                        tyrannical master the Khalifa disappeared from the scene. Your description
                        of the 'Peace and Progress' is, in fact, a sequel to my 'Fire and Sword in
                        the Sudan.'</p>
                    <p>With kindest regards, believe me,</p>
                    <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
                    <p>RUDOLF V. SLATIN.</p>

                    <head>THE OLYMPIC GAMES.</head>
                    <p>About forty representatives of British sport have now signified their
                        intention to compete for the laurels of the great Olympia meeting to be held
                        at Athens from April 22 to May 2 and to be crowned, if victorious, by the
                        King of the Hellenes, after the fashion of the ancient festival, which is to
                        be reproduced so far as is possible in the revival.</p>
                    <p>The British committee brought their labours to an end last week and
                        considering the difficulties which they have had to overcome they are to be
                        complimented on the exceptionally good contingent they have got together. If
                        it is not so representative nor so strong as it might have been it is not
                        the fault of the committee, but of circumstance, which they could not
                        control. There are athletes who are not included whom one would have liked
                        to see upholding the British colours on the famous field. But Greece is a
                        long way, and several leading amateurs could not give up the necessary time.
                        It is unfortunate, also, that the United Kingdom will have no representative
                        in a number of the competitions. including booting, wrestling, lawn tennis,
                        football, and the tug-of war. The United States is more largely
                        represented-sixty three competitors go forward. But the Uniteł States
                        Government gave a grant of £4,000 and officially encouraged the movement in
                        other ways, whereas the British Government has done nothing.</p>
                    <p>Britain, however has no reason to complain of the men who will represent her
                        in the events which are to be contested. The list, which is complete except
                        that the competitors in the swimming, cycling, and gymnastic sections,
                        although damsd, have not been definitely selected (Mr. John Matthews and Mr.
                        A. Ruskin are certain starters in the bicycle races), is as follows :-</p>

                    <p>There may also be one or two independent competitors. The last day for
                        receiving entries was March 22.</p>
                    <p>Quite a large proportion of the athletes are well-known Oxford or Cambridge
                        men. Although the United States is sending a number of excellent
                        representatives, some at least of the flat races ought to fall to England.
                        Mr. Churchill, Mr. McGough, Mr. Crabbe, Lieutenant Halswell, and Mr.
                        Cornwallis in particular ought to give a good account of themselves. It is
                        fully expected that most of the honours for the athletic sports will be
                        divided between England and America.</p>
                    <p>There ought to be bands playing and colours flying when the contingent sets
                        off. Lord Howard de Walden goes out on his yacht, accompanied by Lord
                        Desborough and Mr. Corke amongst others, but most of the competitors will
                        leave Victoria at 10 a.m. on April 16. They journey by way of Paris,
                        Brindisi, Corfa, and Patras to Athens, which will be reached on the 20th.
                        Special committees have been formed at Cerfa and Patras to tête them on the
                        way. As the athletic events do not begin till the 27th, the majority will
                        have a full week's rest to prepare for the tusale. The contingent is due to
                        leave Athens on the return journey on May 5, reaching London on the evening
                        of the 9th.</p>
                    <p>At Athens King Edward and Queen Alexandra are fully expected to attend the
                        games. Before the death of the Queen's father it was understood to be their
                        Majesties' intention to visit Greece about the end of April, but it was
                        thought that that event might modify the programme. It is significant,
                        however that the second cruiser squadron, under Prince Louis of Battenberg,
                        has been ordered to anchor in Phaleron Bay, near Piræus, from April 20 to
                        May 1. The last time the squadron was there was when the Queen visited
                        Greece. The German Emperor will be cruising in the Mediterranean in the
                        third week of April, and although no official confirmation is forthcoming,
                        it is believed that he too will go to Athens.</p>
                    <p>The historic capital of the Hellenic nation will be a sight for the gods
                        during the ten days the games are in progress. Every nation in Europe, the
                        United States, and many Asiatic peoples will be represented. The event is to
                        be made the occasion of a pilgrimage of Greek from Egypt, the remote parts
                        of Asia Minor and from many more distant lands. Fêtes, galas, and
                        receptions, with gorgeous illuminations, and decorative splendour, will be
                        added to the attractions. The Acropolis by night will be a blaze of light.
                        Special arrangements are being made to allow the visitors to see the "
                        lions" of Greece, and excursions are being promoted to Ægino and
                        Salamine.</p>

                        of execution pending an appeal in the action tried in the King's Bench
                        Division before Mr. Justice Lawrance and a special jury.</p>
                    <p>The action was brought by Dr. Hermann Diamant to recover from the defendant,
                        damages in respect of an alleged breach of contract relating to a turquoise
                        mining concession in the Sinai Peninsula. The jury found for the plaintiff
                        on the claim for £72, and judgment was entered accordingly. Defendants
                        recovered judgment again at the plaintiff on their counterclaim for £100.
                        Mr. Lawrance refused to stay execution with a view to the defendants
                        appealing from the verdict. Hence the present application.</p>
                    <p>Mr. J. R. Atkin, in support of the application, said it had been arranged
                        between himself and his learned friends representing the plaintiff that
                        there should be a stay of execution on the defendants bringing £625 into
                        Court within four days and paying the taxed costs to the plaintiff's
                        solicitors.</p>
                    <p>Order accordingly.</p>

                    <p>OPENING UP THE ANTIQUITIES OF THE SUDAN. </p>
                    <p>To Egyptologists and antiquaries the new Kareima-Abou Hamed line has high
                        claims. It renders accessible a country rich in archæological remains,
                        dating from remote antiquity up to the 14th century of our era, when the
                        Christian kingdom of Dongola was finally swépt away by the Moslems of
                        Sennar. Along the banks of the Nile in the reach skirted by the new railway
                        are many ruined churches; mouas taries, and fortress of the Christian era in
                        Dongola, which will well repay examination. But the place of greatest
                        interest passed by the railway is Jebel Barkal, the Holy Mountain of the
                        ancient Egyptians, a flat topped hill rising abruptly from the desert, and
                        on the opposite bank of the river is the village of Merowe. Here, or close
                        by, was the Ethiopian city of Napata, and in the neighborhood are many
                        pyramids and temples which have never yet been scientifically examined. That
                        reproach the archæological world now proposes to remove.</p>
                    <p>The railway, too, passes Ambukol and Korti places famous in the annals of the
                        ill-fated expedition for the relief of General Gordon, and the place where
                        Colonel Donald Stewart and Mr. Prank Power, the French Correul Herbin, and
                        nineteen Greeks, sent from Khartoum by Enrdon to meet Lord Wolseley, were
                        decoyed ashore and murdered by the Mahdists in September, 1884.</p>

                    <head>THE EGYPTIANS AT HOME.</head>
                    <p>We extract the following from Dr. James Henry Brearted's "History of Egypt
                        from the Earliest Times to the Persian Conquest" (20s. et). The author is
                        Professor of Egyptology and Oriental History in the University of Chicago,
                        and Director of Haskall Oriental Museum. From Book II., which is dévoted to
                        the Old Kingdom, we take this sketch of the Ancient Egyptians in their
                        ordinary home life:</p>
                    <p>The houses of the rich, the noble and official class, were large and
                        commodious. Methen, a great noble of the third dynasty, built a house over
                        three hundred and thirty feet square. The materials were wood and sun-dried
                        brick and the construction was light and airy, as suited the climate. There
                        were many latticed windows, on all sides the walls of the living rooms were
                        largely a mere skeleton like those of many. Japanese houses. Against winds
                        and sand storms they could be closed by dropping gaily coloured hangings.
                        Even the palace of the king, though of course fortified, was of this light
                        construction ; hence the cities of ancient Egypt have disappeared entirely
                        or left but monds containing a few scanty fragments of ruined walls. Beds,
                        chairs, stools, and chests of ebony, inlaid with ivory in the finest
                        workmanship, formed the chief articles of furniture.</p>
                    <p>Little or no use was made of tables, but the rich vessels of alabaster, and
                        other costly stoner, of copper, or sometimes of gold and silver, were placed
                        upon bases and standards which raised them from the floor. The floors were
                        covered with heavy rugs upon which guests, especially ladies, frequently
                        sat, in preference to the chairs and stools. The food was rich and varied ;
                        we find that even the dead desired in the hereafter "ten different kinds of
                        meat, five kinds of poultry, sixteen kinds of bread and cakes, six kinds of
                        wine, four kinds of beer, eleven kinds of fruit, besides all sorts of sweet
                        and many other things." The costume of the ancient lords was simple in the
                        extreme; it consisted merely of a white linen kilt, secured above the hips
                        with a girdle or band, and hanging often hardly to the knees, or again in
                        another style to the calf of the leg. The head was commonly shaven, and two
                        styles of wig, one short and curly the other with long straight Iocks parted
                        in the middle, were worn on all state occasions. A broad collar, often
                        inlaid with costly stones, generally hung from the neck but otherwise the
                        body was bare from the waist up. With long staff in hand, the gentlemen of
                        the day was ready to receive his visitors, or to make a tour of inspection
                        about his estate. His lady and her daughters all appeared in costumes even
                        more simple. They were clothed in a thin, close-fitting, sleeveless, white
                        linen garment hanging from the breast to the ankles, and supported by two
                        bands Parking over the shoulders. The skirt, as a modern modiste would say,
                        "lacked fullness," and there was barely freedom to walk. A long wig, a
                        cullar and necklace, and a pair of bracelets completed the lady's costume.
                        Neither she nor her lord was fond of sandals ; although they now and then
                        wore them.</p>

                    <p>Le taux de l'escompte à Londres vient d'être élevé de 1/8 à 3 5/8.</p>
                    <p>Hier, au Stock Exchange, le Consolidé anglais a baissé de 1/8 à 90 1/2.
                        L'Unifiée a également réactionné de 1/8 &amp; 105 7/8, ainsi que la National

                        Banque d'Athènes a gagné 1 freno à 152.</p>
                    <p>Notre marché des valeurs a été, ce matin encore, calme et sans affaires, avec
                        des cours stationnaires ou faibles sur toutes les valeurs, à très peu
                        d'exceptions près.</p>
                    <p>La National Bank a cloturé à 28 l'action ancienne, et 27 1/8 la nouvelle ;
                        l'Agricole à 9 15/16. La Cassa di Sconto a fléchi à 215-216. Le Comptoir
                        Financier s'est inscrit à 71/8.</p>
                    <p>L'action Crédit Foncier est revenue à 796. La Daïra, assez animée, a fait 18
                        1/3. La Béhérá a faibli à 37 1/2; l'Agricole da Nile a 284. La part de
                        fondateur Immobilière est descendue à 615. L'action Enterprise and
                        Development est remontée à 11 15/16.</p>
                    <p>La part de fondateur Land Allotment a haussé jusqu'à 175 pour clôturer à
                        165.</p>
                    <p>L'action Entreprises Immobilières et Travaux a avancé à 4 1/4; la part de
                        fondateur est restée à LE. 15.</p>
                    <p>L'action Menzaleh a fait 4 3/4 ; la part de fondateur est revenge à 125. Le

                        les Egyptian Constructions à 1 9/16.</p>
                    <p>Le mouvement qui tend à se dessiner sur les Land Allotment serait dû à des
                        informations très favorables reçues de Chypre, ou Sir William Willoooks est

                    <p>Suivant ces informations, Sir William Willcocks aurait obtenu pour la

                        perçues sur les prêts en termes échus et non recouvrés des exercices
                        précédents, n'at tiendraient pas la somme nécessaire 1. pour couvrir les
                        dépenses et le montant des prêts en termes échus et non recouvrés ; 2. pour
                        laisser un bénéfice net représentant le 4 % da capital engagé en prêts aux
                        cultivateurs, le gouvernement de Chypre versera à la Banque, à titre de
                        subvention, le solde de la somme nécessaire, en cas d'insuffisance de fonds
                        de résеrvе.</p>
                    <p>On sait que l'Agricultural Bank of Egypt jouit ici du même privilège, à cette
                        différence notable près que le gouvernement égyptien garantit indirectement
                        un bénéfice net représentant le 8 % da capital engagé en prêts aux
                        fellabe.</p>
                    <p>On s'attendait que les pourparlers engagés depuis quelque temps entre l'Est
                        et la Société des Eaux du Caire relativement aux terrains avoisinant les
                        filtres de l'Abbassieh abou. tissent dans un bref délai.</p>
                    <p>Le gouvernement serait, assure-t-on, disposé accorder à la Société
                        l'autorisation de vendre 088 terrains (one cinquantaine de feddans) aux
                        mêmes conditions que ceux du Vieux Cai re, soit 8/3 pour la Compagnie et 1/3
                        pour l'Etat.</p>
                    <p>Le bruit court depuis hier soir que l'Ibrabimieh Plongbing Co. serait amenée
                        à déposer Bon bilan par suite de la faillite des Sucreries.</p>
                    <p>Nous ne saurions dire à quel point cette rumour est exacte. Un fait certain,
                        c'est que les actions Ploughing ne sont plus cotées à la Bourse. Le prix de
                        £3, indiqué jusqu'à 088 derniers temps, était parement nominal; 088 titres
                        ne trouvaient pas preneurs même a £1. </p>
                    <p>Suivant des informations d'Alexandrie, les recettes da New Khedivial,
                        appartenant à la Splendid Hotels Co., vont toujours augmentant dans les
                        proportions les plus promettantes. Ainsi les recettes de la 2ème décade du
                        mois courant accusent une augmentation d'environ L.E. 350 sur la période
                        correspondante de l'année dernière.</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>Ce surplus important est appelé encore à s'accroître considérablement, étant
                        donné, comme nous l'avons déjà fait observer, que les travaux
                        d'agrandissement de l'Hôtel viennent d'être terminés et qu'on est aux
                        approches de la saison d'été.</p>
                    <p>Il est officiellement annoncé que les actionnaires du Comptoir Financier et
                        Commercial sont convoqués en Assemblée générale extraordinaire le 7 avril
                        prochain, au siège social à Alexandrie, pour délibérer sur la proposition
                        d'augmentation du capital, la distribution d'un dividende intérimaire, des
                        modifications aux Statuts et la nomination d'un administrateur.</p>

                    <head>A BROKEN-DOWN SYSTEM.</head>
                    <p>This is a condition (or disease) to which doctors give many names, but which
                        few of them really understand. It it simply weakness—a break-down, as it
                        were, of the vital forces that sustain the system. No matter what may be its
                        causes (for they are almost numberless), its symptoms are much the same; the
                        more prominent being sleeplessness, sense of prostration or weariness,
                        depression of spirits and want of energy for all the ordinary affairs of
                        life. Now, what alone is absolutely essential in all such cases is increased
                        vitality—vigour--</p>
                    <p>VITAL STRENGTH &amp; ENERGY</p>
                    <p>to throw off these morbid feelings, and experience proves that as night
                        succeeds the day this may be more certainly secured by a course of the
                        celebrated life-reviving tonic</p>
                    <p>THERAPION No.3</p>
                    <p>than by any other known combination. So surely as it is taken in accordance

                        "used up," and valueless. This wonderful medicament is purely vegetable and
                        innocuous, is agreeable to the taste —suitable for all constitutions and
                        conditions, in either sex; and it is difficult to imagine a case of disease
                        or derangement, whose main features are those of debility, that will not be
                        speedily and permanently benefited by this never-failing recuperative
                        essence, which is destined to cast into oblivion everything that had
                        preceded it for this wide-spread and numerous class of human ailments.</p>
