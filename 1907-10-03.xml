                    <p>Trains run alongside the steamers on the quay, and passengers can be conveyed
                        to Famagusta, Nicosia, Morphou and intermediate stations. Good hotel
                        accommodation for tourists is provided at Famagusta, at the Savoy Hotel (Mr.
                        Najem Houry proprietor). Olympus Hotel, Mount Troodos, 6000 ft. above the
                        sea. Magnificent Scenery. Perfect climate. Season May to end of October. For
                        information apply to Mr. Najem Houry, Managing Director of Cyprus Hotel Co.,
                        Army Contractor, Limassol, Cyprus. There is a good carriage road from Kopia
                        (on Railway) to Troodos. At Famagusta may be seen the fine old Latin
                        Cathedral (now a mosque) begun in 1300 and finished in 1312, together with
                        other ancient ruins and the Venetian fortifications, the finest in the
                        world. Also the tower or palace, the scene of "Othello'' and of Ford's
                        "Lover's Melancholy.'' The climate of Cyprus in the winter months is
                        delightful and the Island will well repay a visit.</p>

                    <head> FRIENDSHIP WITH TURKEY. </head>
                    <p> Those British politicians who promised great things of the Pesce Congress at
                        The Hague can scarcely have foreseen one of the advantages which this
                        apparently futile meeting is said to have brought to their country. This
                        advantage, a direct consequence of the Congress, is the greater friendship
                        with Turkey. Those who think to understand the Balkan question by reading
                        blue books will no doubt deplore any improvement of diplomatic relations,
                        and the improvement of British commerce with Turkey is scarcely likely to
                        sugar their pill. But it is worth while noting that several French
                        authorities on the Macedonian question have stated that the English
                        enthusiasts could never have their relorms carried out unless the British
                        Ambasador were able to go before the Sultan Armed with a strong friendship
                        and un challenged prestige Unfortunately it cannot be said that British
                        prestige at Constantinople I ha been unchallenged of late. </p>
                    <p>An indefatigable and subtle diplomatist, Baron Marshall von Bieberstein has
                        contrived that Germany should receive many sugar plums in the way of orders
                        for guns, railway concessions, and what not, and British traders have itcbed
                        at setog their profits stationary or declining. However, if we are to
                        believe a writer in the Siècle,"fit is Great Britain now that leads the
                        dance. Before leaving Constantinople for The Hague, Baron Marshall von
                        Bieberstein omitted to see to it that a great bort to Turkish pride-her
                        inclusion among the secondary Powers convoked to the congress-was removed.
                        This, coming after a deception by Germany-withdrawing her sopport in the
                        Tabah affair when things became serions-sufficed to change the Sultan's
                        attitnde. Admiral Sir Charles Drury and the officers of the Mediterranean
                        Fleet were recently received by the Sultan in a way which clearly signalised
                        the bange. All precedents in the matter of etiquette were set aside, and the
                        party were received with the opretnonial beretofore reserved to Princes of
                        the Blood; And, in spite of the activity of the German Charge d'Affaires, a
                        much better time for British merebants and financiers is promised. </p>

                    <p>"At a time when public attention in the United States has been recalled to
                        the transfer of the Atlantic Pleet to the Pacific by Mr. Hearst once more
                        raising the cry of the danger from Japan,' a very interesting suggestion bas
                        been made by an American admiral, whose words will carry weight," says the
                        "Evening Standard." "Rear-Admiral Clark is the cap tain of the famous
                        battleship Oregon,' which steamed from the Pacific coast to Cuba, via the
                        Straits of Magellan, at the outset of the war with Spain. He is strongly in
                        favour of sending the Atlantic Pleet to the Pacific by way of the Suez
                        Canal, owing to the dangers attending the passage of the Magellan Straits,
                        the lack of good anchorage, and the tortuous run of 200 miles between Sandy
                        Point and Port Pamine, 'where Vessels might encounter serious danger when
                        proceeding in squadron formation. The admiral's objections are backed ap by
                        statisticians, who prove that if the fleet proceeds via Sue to the
                        Philippines it will bave 4364 fewer miles to cover, will conse quently take
                        forty days over the voyage, as against fifty-six, and will save £80,000 over
                        ita coal." </p>

                            Parliament, but also on the platform. And, furthermore, I am able to say
                            that so far as the fiscal question is concerned he will be found an

                        <p>An antisemitic incident has recently engag. ed the attention of the Cairo
                            summary native court. The defendants were a band of natives, who were
                            charged with having attacked and maltrented a number of Jews attending a
                            burial. The Court sentenced 8 of the accused to one month's imprisonment
                            a piece, and another to 15 days' imprisonment. One of the alvocates for
                            the defence pleaded that the "Lewa" declared the affair exaggerated and
                            therefore asked for the acquittal of the accuser. A French contemporary
                            comments as follows on the incident: ''Si dans la classe élevée et

                        <p>Mr. Gerald Massey, a poet of much honour among the ardent youth of the
                            Victorian era, has been silent so long that the announcement of a new
                            book from bis pen sounds strangely. It has engaged him for more than
                            twenty years. "Ancient Egypt, the Light of the World," is its title, and
                            in its two large volumes Mr. Massey develops the thesis that much Jewish
                            and Christian doctrine has its source in Egypt, that, in fact, ortbodox
                            Christianity largely arose from a literal misinterpretation of Egyptian
                            myth and theosophy. Mr. Massey sees in Fgypt the birthplace of language
                            and civiline tion, and his book has many chapters on my thology, on the

                    <p>CONTINUED INCREASE </p>
                    <p>There appears to be no prospect of the enor mous house renta at present
                        obtaining in Cairo falling during the present year. Indeed there is every
                        indication of prices increasing rather than diminishing, despite the
                        desperate state of financial depression through which we have been passing.
                        In almost any street through which one passer, the hand of the builder is in
                        evidence, new buildings are springing up on hitherto barren land, or rising
                        to replace their more old fashioned predecessors which have fallen to meet
                        the demand for more sanitary and commodious residences </p>
                    <p>The demolition of so many of these older buildings has naturally thrust a
                        large number of house hunters upon the town, but this is in no manner a
                        sufficient senson for the extra ordinary way in which a house or flat in
                        shapi ped up at almost fabulous rental the moment it falls vacant. The
                        following use is a good example of the existing state of aftairs. The lease
                        of a fat which had been let for a term of years at LB. 60 expired this
                        summer. Upon the landlord expressing his intention of raising the rent to LE
                        80 upon yearly agreement, the tenant left, and the flat was advertised to
                        let--for three days, when it was relet for a term of three years at a rental
                        of LE 120 per annum </p>
                    <p>One beats much grumbling at what is termed "exorbitant" rentals, and while
                        they are undoubtedly hard upon those people whose salaries are not large, it
                        is nevertheless true that a house - like other things-is worth what it will
                        bring, that if the rentals were in reality too high for the people to
                        support, they would of necessity cease to exist, and in the meanwhile it is
                        comforting to know, that even in these days of financial depression there is
                        at least one portion of the community which is prospering. </p>

                        complete solitude, and one by one dropped all his friends. His morbid
                        sensitiveness was such that in the one house where he used to go he took
                        offence because one evening the mistres appeared in ball dress, and to his
                        distorted taney did so to mock him, and he never set foot in that place
                        again. Hin one consolation was collecting. He bought rare bindings, and
                        leaves a library worth opwards of £16,000. Among the pictures he bought are
                        Fragonards, Wattents, and Bouchers, some of the finest extant. His end was a
                        pathetic as his life. He was advised to move to a warm climate, and went to
                        Cairo, making up his mind to die. He shut himself up there some years ago in
                        one room, which he never left. Doctors told him that he was virtually
                        committing suicide, and he died without having been out of his one room. He
                        was the son of a wealthy banker, who was also an art amateur, and who gave a

                        to the museum, which he obtained in original excavations in Egypt. </p>
                    <p>Professor MacIver said that he was highly gratified with the results of his

                        now. We also found what might be call ed a fort, built in the eighteenth
                        dynasty, the time of Thothmes II., which was about 1450 B.C. </p>
                    <p>"One of the most interesting things, however, was the Anibeh excavation. We
                        came upon nine brick pyramids there, dating back to the twentieth dynasty.
                        They are the only brick pyramids known of by a 'stele.' It is covered with

                    <p>The soorn of Dr. R. Porrer, a German Egypt ologist, is excited by the
                        accounts which have appeared in various European newspapers of the
                        fabrication of fake mummies which are sold to simple collectors as the

                        to say that there isn't a word of truth in the story and that the periodical
                        revival of stories of mummy factories in Paris and elsewhere must be placed
                        in the same category with the sen serpent yarns. </p>

                    <head>MONEY AND SHARE MARKET. </head>
                    <p>(PROM OUR PISANOIAL CORRESPONDENT </p>
                    <p>London, September 27th. </p>
                    <p>The Money Market. </p>
                    <p>There has been a decidedly firmer tone prevalent in the money market this
                        week, and rates show substantial appreciation. Yesterday 37 per cent. was
                        the general quota tion for short loans, and in few case, as muok as 41 per
                        cent was demanded. As there is no immediate pressure for money, it is
                        assumed that the present hardening tendency is due to the fact that Lombard
                        Street is husbending its resources in anticipation of the autumn demands for
                        Egypt and other quarters. </p>
                    <p>- This week another £280,000 in sovereigns has been withdrawn for Egypt,
                        making a total of £480,000 to date. </p>
                    <p>The Bank retum is not quite so satisfactory. A small sum was returned from
                        the provinces, but against this has to be set the withdrawal of £426,000 for
                        export, so that the stock of coin and bullion is lower by £866, ono. The
                        note cuculation also increased by £361,000, so that the reserve shows a
                        shrinkage of £717,000 to £98,089,000. This, however, compares very
                        favourably with last year, when the total at this period was only
                        £23,881,416. </p>
                    <p>The proportion of reserve to liabilities is slightly lower on the week, being
                        now 61-80 per cent. as against 51.67 per cent. </p>
                    <p>There has been a renewal of the Continental demand for bar gold, but the
                        price was about a below last week's high level, at 77/10d. The Bank of
                        England secured £200,000 of the £600,000 arriving. In addition to the
                        £280,000 withdrawn for Egypt, £100,000 has left the Bank for Constantinople,
                        and smaller sums, amounting in all to £116,000, have been taken for
                        Ronmania, Italy, and Gibraltar </p>

                    <p>Whatever may be said regarding their business methods, members of the Stock
                        Exchange are nothing if not up-to-date in the matter of their amusements.
                        The latest importation from France, the "Diabolo" game, has already found
                        its way into the "House," and in the early part of this week the time not
                        taken up with the arrangement of the settlement has been largely docupied in
                        acquiring proficiency in the new game. </p>
                    <p>Only a small open account was revealed by the settlement, hence there was
                        little difficulty in completing this. </p>
                    <p>During the past two or three days the tone has been much more satisfactory.
                        The business done has not been on a large sole, it is true, but there has
                        been an appreciable increase in investment orders, which is a very welcome
                        sign. The confidence of brokers has been much strengthened by the
                        publication of the terms of the new Anglo-Russian convention, which has been
                        a strong ball point for international securities. It is rightly recognised
                        that the new arrangement with Great Britain will do much to restore Rassian
                        prestige in Europe, and from the financial standpoint this can bring nothing
                        but good results. Another satisfactory point is the improved out look
                        regarding the railway crisis. It is now believed that a strike is but a
                        remote possibility, and one newspaper announce with the show of authority,
                        that it has good reason to believe the dispute will be settler without
                        recourse to a strike. The joumal add that a section of the directors are
                        inclined to recognise the Amalgamated Society on the lines conceded by the
                        Postmaster General to the Associations of Post Office servants last year. Of
                        course nothing definite can be known until a reply bas been received from
                        the Railway Companies Association to the invita tion to meet the men's
                        representatives in conference, but it is hoped that the decision will be
                        such as will lead to an amicable settle ment of the pointe in question. </p>
                    <p>To-day the market has been quiet, and the tone is good. </p>

                        there has been an improvement of 1/16 in the cash quotation to-day, at 82

                        and Japanese showed a slight set-back after the advance last week, they have
                        for the greater part of the week been in strong request. Yesterday Russian

                    <p>On the whole the tone of the home railway market has been much firmer this
                        week. The conciliatory tone adopted by Mr. Bell in his speech at Cardiff on
                        Sunday produced an op timistic feeling on Monday, and shares were quite
                        buoyant, repurchases by bears anxious to cover sales before the

                        Khedive's army trom 1888 to 1898, and raised and commanded that very smart
                        corps, the 10th Sudanese Battalion. How a lot of service in Reypt including

                        "Jackey's Pet" from Sir John Fisher's inordinate fondDess of her ms flagship
                        in many waters being refitted, and it is believed that she is der tined for
                        another pleasure cruise. Since the "Renown" was fitted out to convey the
                        Prince of Wales to India she has been without most of her armament, and has
                        retained many of the characteristics of a Royal yacht. The fact that her
                        guns are not being restored to her has given rise to the rumour that she
                        will be used to carry the Duke of Connaught to Malta in December, when he
                        takes up the new post of Commander of the Mediterranean Garrison early in

                    <p>The two Dreadnoughts which will be laid down at Portsmouth and Devonport
                        respeetively next month, will be improvements on the existing battleships of
                        that type. Their displace ments will be increased to 19,800 tons each as
                        compared with the 18,300 tons of the Belle rophon and her consorts, and the
                        big gun armament will be more powerful, and the se condary batteries will be
                        mounted with heavier guns. These improvements are the natural out come of
                        experience in building these monsters Some years ago, the trend of Daval
                        opinion was largely in favour of small battleships, with powerful guns, and
                        complete protectionon the prisciple that it is dangerous to place all one's
                        eggs in one basket-but latterly Bri tain led the way in big ships and other
                        nations must needs follow. Indications are not want ing that other nations,
                        with the exception, perhaps of Germany, are getting tired following out this
                        bopless contest the two new Dreadnoughts are to be finisbed inside two
                        years. </p>
                    <p>One consequence of the motor bas baving come to stay is giving the Army
                        Council some concern. In the South African War, the London bus home covered
                        himself with honour in competing against horsee brought from all points of
                        the compass. Whether tagging guns, drawing stores, or even as a genuine
                        cavalry. man's mount, he showed a stamina and speed that were simply
                        surprising. Bat the advent of the petrol driven motor bus threatens his very
                        existence, and the War Office in naturally alarmed at the possible
                        disappearance of a valuable and reliable source of supply in war time. Many
                        of the big companies and bus proprietons enjoy small annual subsidy in
                        return for the right of purchase in time seed, and it is understood that
                        this subsidy will now be increased and extended to other horse owners. The
                        borsed bas is dying hard, and even yet it is doubtful if the mechanically
                        driven bus can compete financially with the older vehicle as y dividend
                        coming concern. </p>
