                        <p>The weather has now become more settled and warmer, though yesterday
                            evening was still unusually cold. The sea is now calm, and the wind has
                            changed fromW. to N.E. A light N.E breeze is blowing this morning and
                            the barometer is rising.</p>

                    <head>THE MAHMOUDIEH CANAL</head>
                    <p>Our readers will no doubt have read with interest the correspondent that has
                        been published in our columns on the subject of the Mahmoudieh Canal,
                        criticising the projected creation of a new arm of the Canal to relieve the
                        congestion which obtains at Minet el Bassal and also to carry away the
                        traffic which will be created when the new harbour improvements in the
                        direction of Gabbari are completed. The point of departure of the new arm
                        would be situated at about a kilometre's distance south of the railway line
                        which crosses the Mahmou- dieh Canal, opposite the Nousha Gardens, and its
                        mouth in the sea, out of the line of the quays, between Fort Eamarieh and
                        the slaughter-house. The present bed of the Mahmoudieh would naturally be
                        preserved, but its dis- charge would be reduced in such a way as to prevent
                        the incessant silting up of the port. In this way the obstacles to the
                        circulation of trains, tramways, and vehicles, stopped owing to the opening
                        of the bridges for the passage of boats, would be done away with. The
                        ma-noeuvring of the swing-bridges at the Mah- moudieh sluices would likewise
                        be done away with and, finally, it would be possible to double the railway
                        line, on which trains would run without interruption along the quays. </p>
                    <p>We are inclined to agree with our contempo- rary, "La Reforme," which warmly
                        advocates the scheme, that the new arm of the Mahmoudieh would be of
                        considerable importance in dealing with merchandise. With its development
                        all boats would be able to approach the canal banks opposite shoonahs and
                        stores which would in time spring up, and in a short space of time the
                        import and export trade would be rid of the thousand and one shackles which
                        at present hamper it. The economy gained by the merchants would be
                        considerable, and the heavy losses which they incur through the
                        impossibi-lity of any surveillance, the thieving which is becoming general
                        and systematic, and the increasing and insupportable tyranny of the carters
                        and porters, would be things of the past. Boats coming from the Interior
                        would not be the only ones to benefit by the new canal; those which would
                        bring the imported goods from the quays would enter with the - same
                        facilities and proceed to the depots where they are to be stored. </p>
                    <p>Of course, in the execution of this vast project difficulties of various
                        sorts are likely to " crop up, but there is no doubt that these will be
                        overcome by the competent authorities. The financial difficulty will be one
                        of the greatest. A work of this nature is certain to involve a large
                        expenditure. But, as "La Reforme" says, supposing that the credit allowed
                        amounted to £200,000 what is such a sum compared to the immense advantages
                        to be gained by the city of Alexandria and the whole country by the rscheme?
                        The Government, we have been assured, is prepared to make the necessary
                        sacrifices to place the port of Alexandria in a position to fulfill all the
                        requirements of the country's commerce, and it is only right that it should
                        do so in this case. It would be a source of prosperity which would extend to
                        the whole country. </p>

                    <head>AN EXHIBITION OF PHOTOGRAPHY</head>
                    <p>A Cairo correspondent writes:—Would it not be possible to organise a
                        photographic exhibition next season ? Amateur photogra- phers are numerous
                        among the European resi-dents in Egypt and many of them are pos-.sessed of
                        remarkable skill and artistic taste. </p>
                    <p>As for interesting subjects, they abound.</p>
                    <p>Photographs of Bedouins of the Pyramid clan of water-sellers and of mosques
                        are somewhat hackneyed, but the many interesting views of village life and
                        country scenery, of the unfre- quented byways of Cairo, of the gorges and
                        peaks of the Sinai, and of the little known , cases of the Western Desert
                        that we have seen, deserve to be exhibited not only on account of the skill
                        with which they have been taken but on account of their value as records. </p>
                    <p>There are many good photographers, too, among our winter visitors, and we
                        should like to see them exhibiting their best work. A really good photograph
                        of some characteristic Egyptian scene or incident of the people's life
                        deserves a wider fame than any it can win r in the pages of an album,
                        however appreciative the friends of the photographer. </p>

                            high standard of skill shown by the various terms was most marked and
                            evidenced that great care and trouble must have been expended OD their
                            training. His Excellency the Sirdar desires to convey his special thanks
                            to the officer commanding the district, the members of the committee,

                        <p>A Tragedy of the Pilgrimage. </p>
                        <p>Zein el Aabideen and his wife, two Egyptians of Karamous Hehya Markas,
                            went on the pilgrimage to the Holy Places and when returning from Mecca
                            a few days ago with the other Egyptian pilgrims, the husband
                            deliberately shot his wife to death. The murderer was caught and handed
                            over to the Emir el Hag to be taken to Egypt to be tried. It is stated
                            by the fellow pilgrims that the wife fell in love with a "muttawif" at
                            Kaaba. A "muttawif," we may explain, is a sort of guide, whose functions
                            consist in explaining to the pilgrims the interesting sights in the
                            Kaaba. The husband heard of his wife's in-fidelity but refrained from
                            killing her while they were at Mecca. As soon, however, as they had left
                            the Holy City he shot her. </p>

                    <byline>(FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT).</byline>
                    <dateline>Port Said, Thursday.</dateline>
                    <p>Suppressed excitement was the order of the day here amongst the natives and
                        foreign population in anticipation of the arrival of the Prince and Princess
                        of Wales. The railway station authorities had been busy since yesterday
                        erecting Venetian masts and flagstaffs all along the platform, and the few
                        residences along the line of route from the station to the Canal Company's
                        offices had their quota of bunting hung out at an early hour. Towards the
                        afternoon, as the weather cleared up—after a spell of rain and hail which we
                        have hid for two days now—men were seen sanding the roads and drying up the
                        pools and puddles which are a characteristic of Port Said streets after the
                        smallest of showers. </p>
                    <p>Police, both mounted and foot, gradually congregated and lined the roadways,
                        while coast- guardsmen, in their striking uniform, formed the greater part
                        of those engaged in keeping order along the station approaches. Inside the
                        Canal Company's domain, military police held sway under the direct orders of
                        Commandant Schalck and Major Bonelli, together with Captains Moore and
                        Williams. </p>
                    <p>Without an order of admission none were allowed within the company's
                        enclosure wherein were to be seen be few notabilities which Port Said

                        a few introductions and presentations, the Royal party walked to their
                        carriages, and proceeded direct to the jetty escorted by mounted military
                        police. </p>
                    <p>The Prince and Princess both looked exceedingly well, his Royal Highness
                        being much bronzed. He was dressed in a dark suit, whereas the Princess was
                        attired in a pearl grey costume and wore a floral toque. </p>
                    <p>Arriving at the Canal Company's offices where 'hey were attended by the

                        the Judge of the Mixed Tribunals, etc. </p>
                    <p>The presentations lasted about a quarter of an hour after which, amidst signs
                        of the greatest respect from the crowd assembled, the party embarked on the
                        Royal steam barge in attendance at the steps of the jetty, and to the

                    <p>At last we have some news about the doings of the Alexandria Tenants'
                        Commission, which many believed was moribund, owing to so little news of the
                        progress it is achieving having reached the ears of the public. </p>
                    <p>Yesterday the special committee appointed * by the Alexandria Municipality to
                        enquire into the feasibility of the programme of the Commission held its
                        second meeting at the Municipality. The committee is composed of Chataway
                        Bey, Mr. G. Zervndachi, Mr. Paul Fenderl Ibrahim Mansour Bey, Cavaliere L.
                        Ronci, and Dietrich Bey. </p>
                    <p>After a careful examination of the amended plans of the proposed model
                        dwellings, it was decided to pass the plans and to approve of 1 the general
                        scheme. A fine plot of land on the left of the main road just outside Bab
                        el- Ghedid has been chosen for the site of the new model dwellings The
                        Administrator of the Alexandria Municipality was requested to put forward
                        the scheme at the beginning of the "ordre du jour" at the next plenary
                        meeting of the Municipal Commission. </p>
                    <p>The Chairman of the Tenants' Commission, Cavaliere Ronci, who was officially
                        invited to attend the meeting. and the members of the Municipality who have
                        backed up the scheme, are to be congratulated on having at last come to a
                        decision, and it is to be hoped that these new dwellings will be the
                        beginning of a new era in the social conditions of Alexandria. </p>
                    <p>According to the scheme of Dietrich Bey, there will be in each block one
                        hundred flits. The smallest type of flit will contain three living rooms, a
                        kitchen, and a bathroom, at a monthly rental of about £1. The largest flats
                        will contain six rooms, kitchen, and bathroom, and will cost about £40 a
                        year. Application for site of sixteen thousand square metres will be made by
                        the Municipality to the Government for constructing tour blocks containing
                        four hundred flats. </p>

                    <head>ZIZINIA THEATRE.</head>
                    <p>On Wednesday last a special performance of Massenet's Monon was given for the
                        benefit of the Jewish Hospital. It is seldom that one sees a more finished
                        performance at his theatre than the one give on Wednesday night, not only
                        from the point of view of the singing and acting but from the point of view
                        of general stage effect. The ball-room scene in the second part of Act III
                        was especially effective. Signa. Bellincioni possesses the rare combination
                        of exceptional vocal talent and genuine histrionic genius, and it would be
                        difficult to say whether her singing or her acting gave most pleasure. Her
                        rendering of the pathetic" 'Or via, Manon non piu chimere" in the 1st act
                        and her genuine appreciation of the humorous touches throughout the piece,
                        were ample testimony to the versatility of her talent, and it is only to be
                        regretted that in her duet with Sig Palet, e g., "Il nome vostro io so," she
                        was not associated with a voice that possessed rather more of the sympathy
                        that characterised her own. Sig Palet's singing of "Chiudo gli ocohi," was a
                        fine, and spirited performance, but it always seems a pity that a beautiful
                        artistic climax should be spoilt by the demand for its repetition. The
                        almost inevitable "religions" element was, musically speaking, well
                        introduced by bringing the "Magnificat," song in the convent chapel into the
                        recitative "Oh ciel I quale equallor," but it is doubtful if sufficient
                        effect is ever gained to justify this somewhat cheap and inartistic
                        expedient, especially where Light opera is concerned. Sig Polese's Lesoaut
                        was excellent and the other parts amply contributed their share towards the
                        general excellence of the performance. </p>

                        Many robberies were lately perpe-trated at the station in question. The
                        Mar-seilles police have now arrested a black man named J Louis who is
                        believed to have been the leader or most active member of the band of
                        railway station robbers. At his lodgings were found some large traveling
                        trunks, broken open, and books and letters contain- ing the names of M.
                        Rochegrosse, the painter, Madame de Banville, the Comtease de May and many
                        more persons living in Paris and other cities. French, German, Spanish, and
                        Swiss. The negro was arrested just as he was boldly carrying away a big box
                        from a heap of luggage at the Marseilles station. This is a warning to the
                        numerous English traveller who use that station when coming from or going to
                        Egypt. The greatest care should be directed to luggage at the Marseilles
                        station. At the same time, the local police are doing their best to find the
                        black-moor's accomplices, who have within the past few months carried off a
                        good deal of luggage from the station. </p>

                    <head>THE GREAT PROBLEM OF THE EMPIRE.</head>
                    <p>ENGLAND AND SOUTH AFRICA.</p>
                    <p>LORD MILNER'S VIEWS.</p>
                    <p>In the "National Review" for April Viscount Milner writes an article on
                        "Great Britain and South Africa,'' in which he renews the warning which he
                        lately addressed to the House of Lords as to the consequence of con-tinuance
                        of the misunderstanding by many politicians of the South African problem.
                        The question, he points out, has now got into the rots of party, the worst
                        thing that could have befallen South Africa or Great Britain. Dealing with
                        the present critical period he says : </p>
                    <p>"A great deal will depend upon the action of the British Government during
                        the next two or three critical years. But e en more, far more, depends, not
                        only during these years, but in the future, upon the attitude of the British
                        people, upon the amount of sympathy which they extend to those of their
                        fellow countrymen in South Africa who have in the past along, through
                        infinite discourage-ment and under manifold temptations to let go, to the
                        great ideal of a united Empire, and who will, I believe, continue to cling
                        to it unless the thing becomes utterly hopeless. And it can only become
                        hopeless through the fault of the British people at home." </p>
                    <p>The feeling of the majority, writes Lord Milner, is a desire to make friends
                        with the Dutch at any price short of estrangement from the Mother Country
                        and from the Empire They want to be South Africans, bat do not want to cease
                        to be "Britishers": </p>
                    <p>"Let ns in the old country take care to do nothing to weaken that sentiment.
                        We can be absolutely fair, we can even be friendly to the Dutch, without
                        falling foul of the British. But there are well-defined limits alike of
                        policy and of honour to what we can do in the director of conning the favour
                        of the former. We can not afford to make friends with the Dutch at the
                        expense of the British. Neither can we afford, even in order to please the
                        Dutch, to discourage or restrain any of those influences such as immigration
                        or the spread of the English language, which tend to increase the numbers or
                        strengthen the position of the British element in South Africa. The forces
                        of expansion and development are on that side, and it would be the most
                        futile folly not to avail ourselves of them to the fall." </p>
                    <p>It is the attitude to the Mother Country and the Empire, he points out, that
                        d vides the South African British from their Dutch neigh-bours. With regard
                        to Downing Street he writes: </p>
                    <p>"True it is, and most true, that when once self-government is granted it
                        would be vain it would even be detrimental to the British case in South
                        Africa - to interfere in the local political struggle, however deeply we may
                        be interested in it. Such interference would only be justified in some
                        moment of supreme crisis when it was manifest to all men that the unity of
                        the Empire was at stake. But a crisis is, humanly speaking, oat of the
                        question in the early future. A long, long sapping process would have to
                        precede any attack on the Imperial position such as might bring the Home
                        Government into the field. What we have to realise is that, however deep the
                        underlying issue, the everyday fight will be over questions of detail
                        —questions each as the disposal of a tract of Government land, the
                        composition of school committees, the qualifications for the Civil Service,
                        &amp;c. In such a case, let Downing Street only raise a finger—not that I
                        think it will dream of doing so —and a strong current of local feeling will
                        immediately be set flowing against the party which has Downing Street for an
                        ally." </p>
                    <p>But he pleads for the British encouragement of the South African British, and
                        asks whether we can expect them to continue to f«el attachment to ns if we
                        seem to set no store by that attachment. </p>
                    <p>Lord Milner dispels the "false and, indeed, preposterous" ideas that the
                        capitalists made the war or that they have any big influence, and that
                        British policy since the war has been indicated by the mine-owners, but he
                        says that the mischief which such misconceptions do is very far-reaching : </p>
                    <p>"We could hardly have a more striking instance of it than has been afforded
                        by the events of the last few months. What impresses me most about the
                        raging controversy over Chinese labour is not so much the misunderstanding
                        of the economic aspects of the problem as the extraordinary disregard of its
                        social and political importance. Speaker after speaker dwells upon the
                        inquiries of the woes of mine owners or shareholders. But how about the man
                        in the street ? How about the bulk of our fellow-countrymen in South Africa!
                        Yon may reckon by thousands the people whose very 1ivelihood is at stake.
                        You may reckon by hundreds of thousands those who prosperity is materially
                        affected. Nothing could possibly produce a worst effect upon South Africa,
                        nothing could do more to alienate our friends and give new courage to our
                        enemies than the levity with which such vital interests are tossed about and
                        decisions of profound importance taken and changed and changed again in
                        obedience to the shifting winds of British party polities." </p>
                    <p>In conclusion Lord Milner writes:</p>
                    <p>' At present things are in a very topsy-turvy state as regards information
                        about South Africa. It is the accused, the abased, who are courting and
                        clamouring for inquiry. It is the accusers who are withholding it. As a
                        humble member of the former class I look forward with confi- dence to the
                        ultimate verdict of history. But I own that I 1ook forward with alarm to the
                        irreparable mischief which may be done before that verdict is recorded."

                    <p>The vacant company in the King's Royal Rifle Corps has been filled by the
                        promotion of the senior subaltern of the 1st Battalion in Egypt—Lieutenant
                        T.G. Dalby—to the rank of captain. Captain Dalby joined the 'Greet jackets"
                        in April, 1899, aud he served with the Mounted Infantry in the South African
                        War, 1901-02, including the operations in the Trans-vaal, in the course of
                        which he was severely wounded (Queen's medal with three clasps and he saw
                        further service in the fighting in Somaliland in 1904 (medal with clasp). </p>
                    <p>Lieutenant E. S. Stephenson, D.S.0, 2m Battalion Gloucester Regiment, has
                        been silenced for service with the Khedive's Arm and joins forthwith. This
                        officer has serve with the gallant "Slashers" since May 190 and was with the
                        2nd Battalion in the in rations in the Transvaal, Cape Colony. Orange Free
                        State, including the defence of Wepner ; operations in Orange River Colony
                        and along Zululand borders, and he had a turn of service with the Mounted
                        Infantry and Brabant's Horse (mentioned in despatches, D. S. O., Queen's
                        medal with four clasps, King's medal with two clasps). </p>
                    <p>Captain Henry du B. O'Neil, Bedfordshire Regiment, has been given the
                        temporary rank of major whilst in command of the Camel Company of the King's
                        African Rifles. </p>
                    <p>It having been decided that the "Centenary Cup" shall be no longer competed
                        for by the Royal Garrison Artillery, No. 49 Company, Cork, by which the cup
                        was won last year, will retain it in possession until the 1st November next,
                        after which date it will be handed over to the Commandant, School of
                        Gunnery, and will be deposited in the officers' mess of the Royal Artillery
                        at Shoeburyness. </p>
                    <p>With reference to a resolution passed by the Council of the British Empire
                        League urging the Admiralty to place no unnecessary limit on the numbers to
                        be enrolled in the Colonial naval reserves, either in Newfoundland
                        Australia, and to afford adequate provision all cases for their services at
                        sea with a war, Lord Tweedmouth has addressed a letter the secretary of the
                        I.eigion calling attention to the statement explanatory of the navel
                        estimates of 1906-7. From that it would seen that as far as the numbers were
                        concern no change of policy has taken place. The letter proceeds: "The
                        original agreement was that this country should only pay for limited number
                        of Colonial Royal reservist and it would be dearly, impossible when the
                        seamen of the Royal Naval Reserve at home being reduced to go beyond the
                        stipulate number. With reference to service in meso war, advocated by Lord
                        Goschen, I may point out that a certain number of Newfoundland reserve men
                        are serving in Commodore Paget's squadron which will arrive in this country
                        early in April." </p>
                    <p>The six new French cruisers which are to be laid down this year will,
                        according to the "Temps," have a displacement of 18,000 tons. Their length
                        will be 578 ft., their beam 48 ft. and their maximum draught 28 ft. The
                        engines are to be of 22,500 horse-power, giving a speed of 19 knots. The
                        radios of activity with normal supply of coal will be 4,000 miles a ten
                        knots, or 925 at the maximum rate of speed, while with the extra supply
                        which will be possible to carry these distances will be 8,500 miles and
                        1,900 miles respectively. The armament will consist of four guns of 1 in ,12
                        of 9 ½ in., l6 of 3 in. and eight of 1 ¾ in. It will further include two
                        under-water discharge tubes for torpedo. The complement will comprise 31
                        officers and 690 men. The cruisers are to be finished in four years. </p>

                    <p>AN AIDE DE CAMP'S TALE.</p>
                    <p>When the Imam's Arabs arrived at Sana (and they were twenty thousand in
                        number) (gap) Mutessarif Tewfik Bey was consoling him- self with a
                        gramaphone. But Feizi soon put an end to this music, and Tewfik Bey ceased
                        to the Governor of Sana." 1 </p>
                    <p>Thus quoth to me a Turkish officer who, together with a party of others, had
                        escaped from the Yemen, and by the kindness of the governor of Aden had made
                        his way to Cairo. The officer was formerly an Aide-de-Camp of the Sultan,
                        a»d was a general favourite in the Mabein. But this was before the days of
                        Fehmi Pasha. When that illustrious spy came on to the arena the officer's
                        fortunes underwent a change, and the result was that he was transited," two
                        years ago, to the citadel of Kou-bul, an outpost of Sana. This practically
                        speaking, was exile pure and simple, but transfer looks much better in the
                        "'Askerl- eridieh," or " Military Gazette." </p>
                    <p>What the reason of his banishment was, one can say ; possibly he stood in
                        Fehnui's way, and he was therefore removed. The tale (gap) had to tell of
                        his escape from Koufoul and (gap) desert flight, is interesting in that it
                        throws (gap) even stronger relief the real state of affairs the Yemen, which
                        has more than once been betrayed by correspondents. Bribery, corrupt-tion,
                        desertion are things common in Turkey, especially so in the Arabian
                        vilayets, whose peculiar system of government is incentive of (gap) far more
                        than in the case of the provin-ce (nearer the capital At the bottom of all
                        the mischief is Izzet Pacha the Arabian, and until (gap) system is remedied
                        matters will go on from (gap) to worse. The joyful news was bruited (gap)
                        Constantinople not to long ago that (gap) Pacha had fallen, and that the
                        Govern-ment Party, with Ferid Pacha at their head, (gap) in the ascendant.
                        In the interests of (gap) it is earnestly to be honed that this is (gap)
                        than a bazaar rumour. On the contrary, (gap) is various evidences to show
                        that the (gap) is true. </p>
                    <p>(Gap) come now to the tale told by the fugitive au-de-camp. According to him,
                        one of the (gap) causes that led to the Arab revolt was (gap) extortion
                        practised by Shukri Pacha, the (gap) of the Taaz Levi, or district, in
                        (gap), by the bye, this citadel stands. Shukri Pacha was a placeman of
                        Izzet, and was a most profitable servant. For instance, by a surtax on (gap)
                        he sent off five thousand liras to his benefactor, and there is no
                        gainsaying the fact (gap) this sum can have been only part of the (gap) that
                        he illegally wrung from the unhappy (gap). At length the people rose, and
                        Sana (gap) surrounded by a brave and numerous army, (gap), with their keen
                        edged swords, guarded the (gap). The citadel of Koufoul, being isolated
                        (gap) an outpost, was hard pressed. To defend it there were three battalions
                        of infantry and (gap) Broadfeldt cannon with no more than (gap) teen shot
                        apiece, although five hundred was (gap) regulation amount; these were soon
                        fired. (Gap) the garrison was at length dependent (gap) alone to keep off
                        the rebels. The men were in a most pitiable state ; they had not received
                        their wages for two years; their uni- forms were in rags, and patched with
                        sacking ; they were barefoot; and such was the commi- sariat, that they had
                        to fasten on their bayonets with rope. Without food and but a scanty supply
                        of brackish water their situation was desperate. </p>
                    <p>To cut a long story short, the Colonel, Ibrahim Bey, sent a secret letter to
                        the Imam, asking to know what terms he would offer if the place capitulated.
                        This disgraceful affair was entirely unknown to the other officers of the
                        garrison, and it was only until then reached the coast that they learned the
                        truth. A breach was made in the wall of the citadel and after a clandestine
                        conference between the Imam and the Miralai, the post was handed over to the
                        Arabs. </p>
                    <p>What was the fate of the privates the officer would not say; he and his
                        mess-mates were conducted to Aden by an Arab escort, which left them on the
                        border. On their arrival they implored the Governor's protection, declaring
                        that they had escaped out of the rebels' hands and on that account they were
                        sent on board a British steamer to Port Said. Shukri Pacha is now at
                        Stamboul. </p>

                        the public, as well as newspaper cuttings, photographs of the ex-hibits,
                        etc., have been carefully kept, and the committee believes that it may be of
                        interest to the members that a short recapitulation should be made of the
                        work that has been me during the last ten years. </p>
                    <p>Prior to the formation of the Alexandria agricultural Society two flower
                        shows had already been held at the Soldiers and Sailors' Institute, and
                        these were followed by the first exhibition at San Stefano which was held in
                        1896. The success of the San Stefano show was such that it was decided to
                        form a society with the object of improving the cul-ture of flowers, fruit
                        and vegetables, and of holding exhibitions in order to stimulate an interest
                        in horticulture amongst its members. </p>
                    <p>H.H. the Khedive was graciously pleased to accord his patronage to the
                        society and has never faded to show an interest in its welfare by coming
                        every year specially from Cairo to inaugurate its spring exhibitions. H.H.
                        Prince Hussein Pacha Kamel, who consented to become president of the
                        society, has on three at 'Ca.-ions rent fine exhibits of pot plants, out at
                        wars, and vegetables to San Stefano, and has lately been pleased to offer a
                        yearly prize of a handsome objet d'art to be competed for by the members. H.
                        H. Prince Omar Pacha Toussoun, who accepted the position of vice-president,
                        has been a constant exhibitor and has thereby greatly aided the society in
                        making a success of its shows. </p>
                    <p>Since 1897 the society has been affiliated with the Royal Horticultural
                        Society of London an and has had the right of awarding its medals. In 1898
                        the Khedivial Horticultural Society of Cairo sent four medals to be given as
                        prizes by the Alexandria Horticultural Society. </p>
                    <p>The proof of the success of the society has en clearly shown by the fact that
                        the ball at San Stefano was large enough in 189(gap) to hold all the
                        exhibits of pot plants and cut flowers, whereas in 1905 not only was this
                        room occupied, but it was also found necessary to erect three enormous
                        tents, occupying space of 1292 square metres, for the first divisions of the
                        schedule, as well as a fourth tent of 360 square metres for staging the
                        vegetables. </p>
                    <p>A pleasing feature of »he use of the society has been the increase of the
                        vegetable exhibits, the attendance of the natives during the first few years
                        was poor and unsatisfactory, but lately the natives have not only come in
                        large ambers to San Stefano but have also traveled to Cairo and have carried
                        off many of the vegetable prizes offered by the Khedivial Agricultural
                        Society. Mention should also be made of the interest that the native
                        gardeners have always taken in the arrangement of vases of our flowers. No
                        class is more popular at San Stefano, and in none is the competition keener
                        than in the one that is reserved exclu-sively for them. / </p>
                    <p>The Chrysanthemum shows, which originally „ attracted little attention and
                        which were a loss to the society, have now become so popular that for the
                        past two years, the exhi-bition has been left open for a second day and he
                        gave money has been more than sufficient to pay for all the expenses. </p>
                    <p>For eight years the Committee had the plea-sure of receiving at Son Stefano
                        the children from the schools of Alexandra, and their visit has only been
                        discontinued because it was bund impossible to control the large number who
                        availed themselves of the opportunity of seeing the exhibitions. Through the
                        kindness of Mrs. P. W. Carver and other ladies of Ramleh as many as 1200 to
                        1500 bouquets were annually prepared and every child used to return to town
                        with flowers in its hand. </p>
                    <p>It must not be supposed that the work of the Committee has been limited to
                        managing the annual flower shows. The Committee has been in communication
                        with Horticultural societies in other countries on such subjects as the
                        banana disease, the importation of new plants, etc., and it has to thank its
                        respon-dents for the valuable advice that they have been able to offer, and
                        especially the Agri-cultural Department of the United States of America fur
                        two valuable collections of fruit trees. </p>
                    <p>The committee has published an important work of 185 pages compiled from the
                        notes of Rear-Admiral Sir Massie Blomfield, giving the names of plants
                        cultivated in Egyptian gardens. It has also issued a pamphlet with a series
                        of articles on horticultural matters, besides two notes on the culture of
                        chrysanthemums and at other showing the best varieties of sweet peas to be
                        grown for exhibition purposes. </p>
                    <p>During 1905, there were, besides two Princes of the Khedivial Family. 120
                        members, being an increase of 6 on the number in 1904. </p>
