                 <div type="item"><head>THE MAHMOUDIEH CANAL</head>
                    <p> Our readers will no doubt have read with interest the correspondent that has been published in our columns on the subject of the Mahmoudieh Canal, criticising the projected creation of a new arm of the Canal to relieve the congestion which obtains at Minet el Bassal and also to carry away the traffic which will be created when the new harbour improvements in the direction of Gabbari are completed. The point of departure of the new arm would be situated at about a kilometre’s distance south of the railway line which crosses the Mahmou- dieh Canal, opposite the Nousha Gardens, and its mouth in the sea, out of the line of the quays, between Fort Eamarieh and the slaugh¬ter-house. The present bed of the Mahmoudieh would naturally be preserved, but its dis- charge would be reduced in such a way as to prevent the incessant silting up of the port. In this way the obstacles to the circulation of trains, tramways, and vehicles, stopped owing to the opening of the bridges for the passage of boats, would be done away with. The ma-noeuvring of the swing-bridges at the Mah- moudieh sluices would likewise be done away with and, finally, it would be possible to double the railway line, on which trains would run without interruption along the quays.
                    </p><p> We are inclined to agree with our contempo- rary, "La Reforme," which warmly advocates the scheme, that the new arm of the Mahmoudieh would be of considerable importance in dealing with merchandise. With its development all boats would be able to approach the canal banks opposite shoonahs and stores which would in time spring up, and in a short space of time the import and export trade would be rid of the thousand and one shackles which at present hamper it. The economy gained by the merchants would be considerable, and the heavy losses which they incur through the impossibi-lity of any surveillance, the thieving which is becoming general and systematic, and the increasing and insupportable tyranny of the carters and porters, would be things of the past. Boats coming from the Interior would not be the only ones to benefit by the new canal; those which would bring the imported goods from the quays would enter with the - same facilities and proceed to the depots where they are to be stored.
                    </p><p>Of course, in the execution of this vast project difficulties of various sorts are likely to “ crop up, but there is no doubt that these will be overcome by the competent authorities. The financial difficulty will be one of the greatest. A work of this nature is certain to involve a large expenditure. But, as "La Reforme” says, supposing that the credit allowed amounted to £200,000 what is such a sum compared to the immense advantages to be gained by the city of Alexandria and the whole country by the rscheme? The Government, we have been assured, is prepared to make the necessary sacrifices to place the port of Alexandria in a position to fulfill all the requirements of the country’s commerce, and it is only right that it should do so in this case. It would be a source of prosperity which would extend to the whole country.

                     <p>A Cairo correspondent writes:—Would it not be possible to organise a photographic exhibition next season ? Amateur photogra- phers are numerous among the European resi-dents in Egypt and many of them are pos-.sessed of remarkable skill and artistic taste.
                    </p><p> As for interesting subjects, they abound.</p>
                     <p>Photographs of Bedouins of the Pyramid clan of water-sellers and of mosques are somewhat hackneyed, but the many interesting views of village life and country scenery, of the unfre- quented byways of Cairo, of the gorges and peaks of the Sinai, and of the little known , cases of the Western Desert that we have seen, deserve to be exhibited not only on account of the skill with which they have been taken but on account of their value as records.
                    </p><p> There are many good photographers, too, among our winter visitors, and we should like to see them exhibiting their best work. A really good photograph of some characteristic  Egyptian scene or incident of the people’s life deserves a wider fame than any it can win r in the pages of an album, however appreciative the friends of the photographer.

The murderer was caught and handed over to the Emir el Hag to be taken to Egypt to be tried. It is stated by the fellow pilgrims that the wife fell in love with a “muttawif” at Kaaba. A “muttawif,” we may explain, is a sort of guide, whose functions consist in explaining to the pilgrims the interesting sights in the Kaaba. The husband heard of his wife’s in-fidelity but refrained from killing her while they were at Mecca. As soon, however, as they had left the Holy City he shot her.

                    <p>DEPARTURE OF H M S RENOWN
                    FROM PORT SAID.</p>
                    <p>(FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT).</p>
                    <p>Port Said, Thursday.</p>
                    <p>Suppressed excitement was the order of the day here amongst the natives and foreign population in anticipation of the arrival of the Prince and Princess of Wales. The railway station authorities had been busy since yester¬day erecting Venetian masts and flagstaffs all along the platform, and the few residences along the line of route from the station to the Canal Company’s offices had their quota of bunting hung out at an early hour. Towards the after¬noon, as the weather cleared up—after a spell of rain and hail which we have hid for two days now—men were seen sanding the roads and drying up the pools and puddles which are a characteristic of Port Said streets after the smallest of showers.
                   </p><p> Police, both mounted and foot, gradually congregated and lined the roadways, while coast- guardsmen, in their striking uniform, formed the greater part of those engaged in keeping order along the station approaches. Inside the Canal Company’s domain, military police held sway under the direct orders of Commandant Schalck and Major Bonelli, together with Captains Moore and Williams.
                   </p><p>Without an order of admission none were allowed within the company’s enclosure wherein were to be seen be few notabilities which Port Said possesses. Amongst others I noticed the Sub-Governor, the magistracy, Mr and Mrs. Guy, with their daughters, the Rev. Canon Stranze, Mrs. Broatch and many others of the resident British population.
                   </p> <p> Consul General Cameron, together with the Governor, met the Royal special train at the station the train arriving there punctually at 4 o’clock. After a few introductions and presen¬tations, the Royal party walked to their carriages, and proceeded direct to the jetty escorted by mounted military police.
                  </p><p>  The Prince and Princess both looked exceed¬ingly well, his Royal Highness being much bronzed. He was dressed in a dark suit, whereas the Princess was attired in a pearl grey costume and wore a floral toque.
                  </p><p>  Arriving at the Canal Company’s offices where 'hey were attended by the entire staff of the company as represented by the various heads of departments. Mr. Cameron presented the following amongst others to his Royal Highness: Comte de Serionne (Agent Supe- rieure, Cairo) M. Doyen. M Dumont the Judge of the Mixed Tribunals, etc.
                  </p><p>  The presentations lasted about a quarter of an hour after which, amidst signs of the greatest respect from the crowd assembled, the party embarked on the Royal steam barge in attend¬ance at the steps of the jetty, and to the hoisting of the Royal Standard at the Canal office flagstaff and the manning of the sides of the Renown and Terrible, the steamboat slowly worked her way, commanded by a superior officer of the Renown, to that ship’s gangway, where were assembled the officers and suite.
                </p><p>    As their Royal Highnesses reached the ladder the Royal Standard was hoisted to the mainmast head of the Renown and the crew stood at the salute.
                  </p><p>  (FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT).</p>
                    <p>Port Said Friday.</p>
                    <p>H. M. S. Renown and Terrible left this port at 6 o’clock this morning, the customary Royal salutes being fired as the vessels de¬parted.
                   </p><p> THE PRINCE’S THANKS.</p>
                    <p>The Prince and Princess of Wales, previous to their departure from Cairo held a usual reception at Abdeen Palace, and thanked the following amongst others for the excellent way in which everything had been carried out daring their stay, at the same time presenting suitable souvenirs to each : H.E. the Sirdar. Major-General Bullock, El Lowa Manfield Pasha. Brewster Bey, Bimbashi Vernon -Jarvis, Mr. Allan Joseph, and Bimbashi Franklin.
                   </p><p> THE PRINCE AND THE BEDOUINS. </p>
                   <p> H.R H. the Prince of Wales has charged the Adviser to the Ministry of the Interior form the Bedouin chiefs who took part in Tuesday’s “Bergass” that he was deeply in-terested and pleased by their display. On Wednesday the K.S G. gave a dinner to some 50 Bedouins at Ghezireh in a huge marquee. We understand that the representatives of the various tribes who came up to Cairo for the fantasia are delighted with their treatment and their experiences. Their conduct was certainly irreproachable from the beginning to the end of their stay.

                   <p> MODEL DWELLINGS FOR ALEXANDRIA.	</p>
                   <p>TENANTS COMMISSION’S SCHEME.</p> 
                  <p>  At last we have some news about the doings of the Alexandria Tenants’ Commission, which many believed was moribund, owing to so little news of the progress it is achieving having reached the ears of the public.
                 </p><p>   Yesterday the special committee appointed * by the Alexandria Municipality to enquire into the feasibility of the programme of the Com¬mission held its second meeting at the Municipality. The committee is composed of Chataway Bey, Mr. G. Zervndachi, Mr. Paul Fenderl Ibrahim Mansour Bey, Cavaliere L. Ronci, and Dietrich Bey.
                   </p><p>After a careful examination of the amended plans of the proposed model dwellings, it was decided to pass the plans and to approve of 1 the general scheme. A fine plot of land on the left of the main road just outside Bab el- Ghedid has been chosen for the site of the new model dwellings The Administrator of the Alexandria Municipality was requested to put forward the scheme at the beginning of the “ordre du jour” at the next plenary meeting of the Municipal Commission.	
                   </p> <p>The Chairman of the Tenants’ Commission, Cavaliere Ronci, who was officially invited to attend the meeting. and the members of the Municipality who have backed up the scheme, are to be congratulated on having at last come to a decision, and it is to be hoped that these new dwellings will be the beginning of a new era in the social conditions of Alex- andria.		
                  </p> <p>  According to the scheme of Dietrich Bey, there will be in each block one hundred flits. The smallest type of flit will contain three living rooms, a kitchen, and a bathroom, at a monthly rental of about £1. The largest flats will contain six rooms, kitchen, and bathroom, and 
                    will cost about £40 a year. Application for site of sixteen thousand square metres will be made by the Municipality to the Government for constructing tour blocks con¬taining four hundred flats.
                    </p><p>THE SUCRERIES.</p>
                    <p>The Hon. A. J. Davey, M. Barois, and Mr. Arbib spent the greater part of this morning at the office of the Procureur General at the Alexandria Mixed Courts, giving information as to various points in connection with the Sucreries.
                   </p><p> DRAINAGE OF CAIRO.</p>
                    <p>We hear that the Council of Ministers, at its next meeting, will appoint Mr. James, the well-known Indian sanitary expert, to enquire into the project for the drainage of Cairo drawn by a mixed commission of experts. Mr. James will concern himself with the details of the project and the best method of carrying them into effect and will draw up the necessary plans, etc. His salary during his mission, which will be of at least two years’ duration, will amount to L.E. 2,000 per annum.
                    </p><p>THE PLAGUE.</p>
                   <p> One fresh case of plague and a death are repotted from Keneh to-day.
                 </p><p>   An Egyptian Army Order has been issued to the effect that until further orders no further leave is to be granted to non-commiss-ioned officers and men proceeding to Keneh province. All men returning from that province are met at the railway station and conditioned to the general hospital to undergo seven days’ isolation. 
                  </p><p>  Similar arrangements are made by the officer commanding Assuoan man sub-district for all men returning off leave from Keneh pro- vince to rejoin their units in the Sudan.
                    </p><p>THE KHEDIVE.</p>
                   <p> H. H. the Khedive gave audience this morning to M. Siefried. general manager of Messrs. Orenstein and Koppel.
                  </p><p>  H.H. the Khedive attended midday prayer at the Koubeh Mosque to day.	
                  </p><p>  Hi Highness comes down to Alexandria on Saturday, 21st inst., to open the Flower Show, and not next Saturday, as announced.
                    </p>
                    <p>BALL ON BOARD.</p>
                   <p> The ball given last right on board the cruiser St. George by Admiral von Jeduna and the officers of the Austro-Hungarian squadron was a brilliant success. As the guests stepped on board, they most have thought they bad been transported to Fairyland. The ship, closed in with awnings, was magnificently lit up with electric lights, most of them in quaint designs, revolving wheels in coloured lights, whilst two fountains threw up sprays of cooling water.
                  </p><p>  Two orchestras played alternately the latest waltzes, end supper was served at eight different buffets. Over 1,000 guests must have been present, and it is needless to give names as everybody who is anybody was there.
                   </p><p> STEAMER MOVEMENTS.</p>
                  <p>  The Moss liner Seti sailed this morning for Liverpool via Malta with passengers, mails and general cargo, including 883 bales cotton and 80,754 bags onions.

                    <p>EMIR EL HAG’S REPORT</p>
                   <p> The Emir El Hag, Mahmoud Bev Husni has reported the results of his mission to the Ministry of the Interior. From all accounts the pilgrimage has been highly successful this year the Bedouins having been completely cowed by Ali Pacha’s severity and the increase of the Turkish garrisons in the Hedjaz.
                 </p><p>   The health of the Egyptian pilgrims was decidedly good, but to make assurance doubly sure the Ministry of the Interior has addressed a circular to the various governors and Moudirs ordering the omdehs, sheikhs, ghaffirs, and all local authorities to report to the Depart¬ment of Public Health any suspocious illness or death among pilgrims returning from the Hedjaz.
                    </p><p>The necessary instructions have already been forwarded by the Department of Public Health to its inspectors in the provinces.
                  </p><p> ZIZINIA THEATRE.</p> 
                 <p>   On Wednesday last a special performance of Massenet's Monon was given for the benefit of the Jewish Hospital. It is seldom that one sees a more finished performance at his theatre than the one give on Wednesday night, not only from the point of view of the singing and acting but from the point of view of general stage effect. The ball-room scene in the second part of Act III was especially effective. Signa. Bellincioni possesses the rare combination of exceptional vocal talent and genuine histrionic genius, and it would be difficult to say whether her singing or her acting gave most pleasure. Her rendering of the pathetic” ‘Or via, Manon non piu chimere” in the 1st act and her genuine appreciation of the humorous touches throughout the piece, were ample testimony to the versatility of her talent, and it is only to be regretted that in her duet with Sig Palet, e g., "Il nome vostro io so,” she was not asso¬ciated with a voice that possessed rather more of the sympathy that characterised her own. Sig Palet’s singing of "Chiudo gli ocohi,” was a fine, and spirited performance, but it always seems a pity that a beautiful artistic climax should be spoilt by the demand for its repeti¬tion. The almost inevitable "religions” element was, musically speaking, well introduced by bringing the “Magnificat,” song in the convent chapel into the recitative “Oh ciel I quale equallor," but it is doubtful if sufficient effect is ever gained to justify this somewhat cheap and inartistic expedient, especially where Light opera is concerned. Sig Polese’s Lesoaut was excellent and the other parts amply contribu¬ted their share towards the general excellence of the performance.
                    </p><p>MARSEILLES STATION.</p>
                  <p>  A WARNING TO TRAVELLERS</p>
                    
                   <p> Recently a Paris painter, Georges Roche grosse of the Avenue des Ternes and Madame de Banville, of the Rue Hennequin. had the misfortune, while in the south, to lose boxes and travelling cases at the Marseilles railway station. Many robberies were lately perpe-trated at the station in question. The Mar-seilles police have now arrested a black man named J Louis who is believed to have been the leader or most active member of the band of railway station robbers. At his lodgings were found some large traveling trunks, broken open, and books and letters contain- ing the names of M. Rochegrosse, the painter, Madame de Banville, the Comtease de May and many more persons living in Paris and other cities. French, German, Spanish, and Swiss. The negro was arrested just as he was boldly carrying away a big box from a heap of luggage at the Marseilles station. This is a warning to the numerous English tra¬veller who use that station when coming from or going to Egypt. The greatest care should be directed to luggage at the Mar¬seilles station. At the same time, the local police are doing their best to find the black-moor’s accomplices, who have within the past few months carried off a good deal of luggage from the station.

            <div type="item"><head>THE GREAT PROBLEM OF THE
                EMPIRE.</head>
                <p>ENGLAND AND SOUTH AFRICA.</p>
               <p> LORD MILNER’S VIEWS.</p>
                <p>In the “National Review” for April Viscount Milner writes an article on “Great Britain and South Africa,’’ in which he renews the warning which he lately addressed to the House of Lords as to the consequence of con-¬tinuance of the misunderstanding by many  politicians of the South African problem. The question, he points out, has now got into the rots of party, the worst thing that could have befallen South Africa or Great Britain. Dealing with the present critical period he says :
               </p><p> “A great deal will depend upon the action of the British Government during the next two or three critical years. But e en more, far more, depends, not only during these years, but in the future, upon the attitude of the British people, upon the amount of sympathy which they extend to those of their fellow countrymen in South Africa who have in the past along, through infinite discourage-ment and under manifold temptations to let go, to the great ideal of a united Empire, and who will, I believe, continue to cling to it unless the thing becomes utterly hopeless. And it can only become hopeless through the fault of the British people at home.”
                </p><p>The feeling of the majority, writes Lord Milner, is a desire to make friends with the Dutch at any price short of estrangement from the Mother Country and from the Empire They want to be South Africans, bat do not want to cease to be “Britishers”:
               </p><p> "Let ns in the old country take care to do nothing to weaken that sentiment. We can be absolutely fair, we can even be friendly to the Dutch, without falling foul of the British. But there are well-defined limits alike of policy and of honour to what we can do in the director of conning the favour of the former. We can not afford to make friends with the Dutch at the expense of the British. Neither can we afford, even in order to please the Dutch, to discourage or restrain any of those influences such as immigration or the spread of the English language, which tend to increase the numbers or strengthen the position of the British element in South Africa. The forces of expansion and development are on that side, and it would be the most futile folly not to avail ourselves of them to the fall.”
               </p><p> It is the attitude to the Mother Country and the Empire, he points out, that d vides the South African British from their Dutch neigh-bours. With regard to Downing Street he writes:
               </p><p> “True it is, and most true, that when once self-government is granted it would be vain it would even be detrimental to the British case in South Africa - to interfere in the local political struggle, however deeply we may be interested in it. Such interference would only be justified in some moment of supreme crisis when it was manifest to all men that the unity of the Empire was at stake. But a crisis is, humanly speaking, oat of the question in the early future. A long, long sapping process would have to precede any attack on the Imperial position such as might bring the Home Govern¬ment into the field. What we have to realise is that, however deep the underlying issue, the everyday fight will be over questions of detail —questions each as the disposal of a tract of Government land, the composition of school committees, the qualifications for the Civil Service, &amp;c. In such a case, let Downing Street only raise a finger—not that I think it will dream of doing so —and a strong current of local feeling will immediately be set flowing against the party which has Downing Street for an ally.”
               </p><p> But he pleads for the British encouragement of the South African British, and asks whether we can expect them to continue to f«el attach¬ment to ns if we seem to set no store by that attachment.
               </p><p> Lord Milner dispels the "false and, indeed, preposterous” ideas that the capitalists made the war or that they have any big influence, and that British policy since the war has been indicated by the mine-owners, but he says that the mischief which such misconceptions do is very far-reaching :
               </p><p> "We could hardly have a more striking instance of it than has been afforded by the events of the last few months. What impresses me most about the raging controversy over Chinese labour is not so much the misunderstanding of the economic aspects of the problem as the extraordinary disregard of its social and political importance. Speaker after speaker dwells upon the inquiries of the woes of mine owners or shareholders. But how about the man in the street ? How about the bulk of our fellow-countrymen in South Africa! Yon may reckon by thousands the people whose very 1ivelihood is at stake. You may reckon by hundreds of thousands those who prosperity is materially affected. Nothing could possibly produce a worst effect upon South Africa, nothing could do more to alienate our friends and give new courage to our enemies than the levity with which such vital interests are tossed about and decisions of profound importance taken and changed and changed again in obedience to the shifting winds of British party polities.”
               </p><p> In conclusion Lord Milner writes:</p>
               <p> ‘ At present things are in a very topsy-turvy state as regards information about South Africa. It is the accused, the abased, who are courting and clamouring for inquiry. It is the accusers who are withholding it. As a humble member of the former class I look forward with confi- dence to the ultimate verdict of history. But I own that I 1ook forward with alarm to the irreparable mischief which may be done before that verdict is recorded."

                <p>(FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT.)</p>
                <p>London, March 28.</p>
               <p> The vacant company in the King’s Royal Rifle Corps has been filled by the promotion of the senior subaltern of the 1st Battalion in Egypt—Lieutenant T.G. Dalby—to the rank of captain. Captain Dalby joined the ‘Greet jackets" in April, 1899, aud he served with the Mounted Infantry in the South African War, 1901-02, including the operations in the Trans-vaal, in the course of which he was severely wounded (Queen’s medal with three clasps and he saw further service in the fighting in Somaliland in 1904 (medal with clasp).
               </p><p> Lieutenant E. S. Stephenson, D.S.0, 2m Battalion Gloucester Regiment, has been silenced for service with the Khedive’s Arm and joins forthwith. This  officer has serve with the gallant “Slashers” since May 190 and was with the 2nd Battalion in the in rations in the Transvaal, Cape Colony. Orange Free State, including the defence of Wepner ; operations in Orange River Colony and along Zululand borders, and he had a turn of service with the Mounted Infantry and Brabant’s Horse (mentioned in despatches, D. S. O., Queen’s medal with four clasps, King’s medal with two clasps).
                </p><p>Captain Henry du B. O’Neil, Bedfordshire Regiment, has been given the temporary rank of major whilst in command of the Camel Company of the King’s African Rifles.
              </p><p>  It having been decided that the “Centenary Cup” shall be no longer competed for by the Royal Garrison Artillery, No. 49 Company, Cork, by which the cup was won last year, will retain it in possession until the 1st November next, after which date it will be handed over to the Commandant, School of Gunnery, and will be deposited in the officers’ mess of the Royal Artillery at Shoeburyness.
               </p><p> With reference to a resolution passed by the Council of the British Empire League urging the Admiralty to place no unnecessary limit on the numbers to be enrolled in the Colonial naval reserves, either in Newfoundland Australia, and to afford adequate provision all cases for their services at sea with a war, Lord Tweedmouth has addressed a letter the secretary of the I.eigion calling attention to the statement explanatory of the navel estimates of 1906-7. From that it would seen that as far as the numbers were concern no change of policy has taken place. The letter proceeds: “The original agreement was that this country should only pay for limited number of Colonial Royal reservist and it would be dearly, impossible when the seamen of the Royal Naval Reserve at home being reduced to go beyond the stipulate number. With reference to service in meso war, advocated by Lord Goschen, I may point out that a certain number of Newfoundland reserve men are serving in Commodore Paget’s squadron which will arrive in this country early in April.”
              </p><p>  The six new French cruisers which are to be laid down this year will, according to the "Temps,” have a displacement of 18,000 tons. Their length will be 578 ft., their beam 48 ft. and their maximum draught 28 ft. The engines are to be of 22,500 horse-power, giving a speed of 19 knots. The radios of activity with normal supply of coal will be 4,000 miles a ten knots, or 925 at the maximum rate of speed, while with the extra supply which will be possible to carry these distances will be 8,500 miles and 1,900 miles respectively. The armament will consist of four guns of 1 in ,12 of 9 ½ in., l6 of 3 in. and eight of 1 ¾ in. It will further include two under-water discharge tubes for torpedo. The complement will comprise 31 officers and 690 men. The cruisers are to be finished in four years.

                <p>Icilma Fluor Cream is the only cream that contains no grease nor oil. Deliciously
                    scented it cleanses the pores of the skin as nothing else can do, makes it
                    pearly white, gives life to the tissues, elasticity to the muscles, and a
                    deliciously cool feeling to the skin.</p>
                <p>Its unique properties are due to Icilma Natural Water so that it may well be
                    called <hi>Nature’s Skin Food </hi> and the skin requires nothing else to give
                    it the necessary vitality, to preserve it from sunburn, heat, cold or the
                    effects of hard water, to prevent and cure the minor irritations due to
                    overheated blood, and to preserve the youthful fresh look to which hot climates
                    are so fatal.</p>

                   <p> AN AIDE DE CAMP’S TALE.</p>
                    <p>When the Imam’s Arabs arrived at Sana (and they were twenty thousand in number) (gap) Mutessarif Tewfik Bey was consoling him- self with a gramaphone. But Feizi soon put an end to this music, and Tewfik Bey ceased to the Governor of Sana."	1
                 </p><p>   Thus quoth to me a Turkish officer who, together with a party of others, had escaped from the Yemen, and by the kindness of the governor of Aden had made his way to Cairo. The officer was formerly an Aide-de-Camp of the Sultan, a»d was a general favourite in the Mabein. But this was before the days of Fehmi Pasha. When that illustrious spy came on to the arena the officer’s fortunes underwent a change, and the result was that he was trans¬ited,” two years ago, to the citadel of Kou-bul, an outpost of Sana. This practically speaking, was exile pure and simple, but transfer looks much better in the "‘Askerl- eridieh," or " Military Gazette.”
                   </p><p> What the reason of his banishment was, one can say ; possibly he stood in Fehnui’s way, and he was therefore removed. The tale (gap) had to tell of his escape from Koufoul and (gap) desert flight, is interesting in that it throws (gap) even stronger relief the real state of affairs the Yemen, which has more than once been betrayed by correspondents. Bribery, corrupt-tion, desertion are things common in Turkey, especially so in the Arabian vilayets, whose peculiar system of government is incentive of (gap) far more than in the case of the provin-ce (nearer the capital At the bottom of all the mischief is Izzet Pacha the Arabian, and until (gap) system is remedied matters will go on from (gap) to worse. The joyful news was bruited (gap) Constantinople not to long ago that (gap) Pacha had fallen, and that the Govern-ment Party, with Ferid Pacha at their head, (gap) in the ascendant. In the interests of (gap) it is earnestly to be honed that this is  (gap) than a bazaar rumour. On the contrary, (gap) is various evidences to show that the (gap) is true.
                  </p><p>  (Gap) come now to the tale told by the fugitive au-de-camp. According to him, one of the (gap) causes that led to the Arab revolt was (gap) extortion practised by Shukri Pacha, the (gap) of the Taaz Levi, or district, in (gap), by the bye, this citadel stands. Shukri Pacha was a placeman of Izzet, and was a most profitable servant. For instance, by a surtax on (gap) he sent off five thousand liras to his benefactor, and there is no gainsaying the fact (gap) this sum can have been only part of the (gap) that he illegally wrung from the unhappy (gap). At length the people rose, and Sana (gap) surrounded by a brave and numerous army, (gap), with their keen edged swords, guarded the (gap). The citadel of Koufoul, being isolated (gap) an outpost, was hard pressed. To defend it there were three battalions of infantry and (gap) Broadfeldt cannon with no more than (gap) teen shot apiece, although five hundred was (gap) regulation amount; these were soon fired. (Gap) the garrison was at length dependent (gap) alone to keep off the rebels. The men were in a most pitiable state ; they had not received their wages for two years; their uni- forms were in rags, and patched with sacking ; they were barefoot; and such was the commi- sariat, that they had to fasten on their bayonets with rope. Without food and but a scanty supply of brackish water their situation was desperate.
                    </p><p>To cut a long story short, the Colonel, Ibrahim Bey, sent a secret letter to the Imam, asking to know what terms he would offer if the place capitulated. This disgraceful affair was entirely unknown to the other officers of the garrison, and it was only until then reached the coast that they learned the truth. A breach was made in the wall of the citadel and after a clandestine conference between the Imam and the Miralai, the post was handed over to the Arabs.
                    </p><p>What was the fate of the privates the officer would not say; he and his mess-mates were conducted to Aden by an Arab escort, which left them on the border. On their arrival they implored the Governor’s protection, declaring that they had escaped out of the rebels’ hands and on that account they were sent on board a British steamer to Port Said. Shukri Pacha is now at Stamboul.

                    SOCIETY.</head>
                    <p>REPORT FOR 1905.</p>
                    
                 <p>   In their report for 1905 the committee of the A. H. S. state that since the starting of the society copies of every notion and every programme issued to the public, as well as  newspaper cuttings, photographs of the ex-hibits, etc., have been carefully kept, and the committee believes that it may be of interest to the members that a short recapitulation should be made of the work that has been me during the last ten years.
                   </p><p> Prior to the formation of the Alexandria agricultural Society two flower shows had already been held at the Soldiers and Sailors’ Institute, and these were followed by the first exhibition at San Stefano which was held in 1896. The success of the San Stefano show was such that it was decided to form a society with the object of improving the cul-ture of flowers, fruit and vegetables, and of holding exhibitions in order to stimulate an interest in horticulture amongst its members.
                  </p><p>  H.H. the Khedive was graciously pleased to accord his patronage to the society and has never faded to show an interest in its welfare by coming every year specially from Cairo to inaugurate its spring exhibitions. H.H. Prince Hussein Pacha Kamel, who consented to become president of the society, has on three at ‘Ca.-ions rent fine exhibits of pot plants, out at wars, and vegetables to San Stefano, and has lately been pleased to offer a yearly prize of a handsome objet d'art to be competed for by the members. H. H. Prince Omar Pacha Toussoun, who accepted the position of vice-president, has been a constant exhibitor and has thereby greatly aided the society in making a success of its shows.	
                    
                   </p><p> Since 1897 the society has been affiliated with the Royal Horticultural Society of London an and has had the right of awarding its medals. In 1898 the Khedivial Horticultural  Society of Cairo sent four medals to be given as prizes by the Alexandria Horticultural Society.	
                    </p><p>The proof of the success of the society has en clearly shown by the fact that the ball at San Stefano was large enough in 189(gap) to hold all the exhibits of pot plants and cut flowers, whereas in 1905 not only was this room occupied, but it was also found necessary to erect three enormous tents, occupying space of 1292 square metres, for the first divisions of the schedule, as well as a fourth tent of 360 square metres for staging the vegetables. 
                   </p><p> A pleasing feature of »he use of the society has been the increase of the vegetable exhibits, the attendance of the natives during the first few years was poor and unsatisfactory, but lately the natives have not only come in large ambers to San Stefano but have also traveled to Cairo and have carried off many of the vegetable prizes offered by the Khedivial Agricultural Society. Mention should also be made of the interest that the native gardeners have always taken in the arrangement of vases of our flowers. No class is more popular at San Stefano, and in none is the competition keener than in the one that is reserved exclu-sively for them.	/
                   </p><p>The Chrysanthemum shows, which originally „ attracted little attention and which were a loss  to the society, have now become so popular that for the past two years, the exhi-bition has been left open for a second day and he gave money has been more than sufficient to pay for all the expenses.	 
                   </p> <p> For eight years the Committee had the plea-sure of receiving at Son Stefano the children from the schools of Alexandra, and their visit has only been discontinued because it was bund impossible to control the large number who availed themselves of the opportunity of seeing the exhibitions. Through the kindness of Mrs. P. W. Carver and other ladies of Ramleh as many as 1200 to 1500 bouquets were  annually prepared and every child used to return to town with flowers in its hand.
                   </p><p> It must not be supposed that the work of the Committee has been limited to managing the annual flower shows. The Committee has been in communication with Horticultural societies in other countries on such subjects as the banana disease, the importation of new plants, etc., and it has to thank its respon-¬dents for the valuable advice that they have been able to offer, and especially the Agri-cultural Department of the United States of America fur two valuable collections of fruit trees.
                  </p><p>  The committee has published an important work of 185 pages compiled from the notes of Rear-Admiral Sir Massie Blomfield, giving the names of plants cultivated in Egyptian gardens. It has also issued a pamphlet with a series of articles on horticultural matters, besides two notes on the culture of chrysan¬themums and at other showing the best varieties of sweet peas to be grown for exhibi¬tion purposes.
                    </p><p>During 1905, there were, besides two Princes ot the Khedivial Family. 120 members, being an increase of 6 on the number in 1904.
