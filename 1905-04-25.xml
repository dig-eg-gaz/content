                    <head>TUESDAY. APRIL 25. 1905. THE NAVAL POSITION.</head>
                    <p>The violent cannonading, which yesterday’s telegrams stated had been heard
                        off Kamaranh Bay only a few hours after the departure of the Russians,
                        appears to have been the figment of some Frenchman's imagination, for this
                        morning’s news shows that the Baltic Fleet is evidently well on its way
                        towards the north, as a glance at the map shows that the Russians are
                        following a course which would take them past Hong Kong into the channel
                        known as the Formosa Straits, which divides the island of Formosa from the
                        mainland of China. They are thus steering direct for the Japanese flying
                        base in the Pescadores Islands, at which a portion of Togo’s fleet,
                        including probably a considerable amount of torpedo craft, is almost
                        certainly concentrated, and possibly his main fighting strength.</p>
                    <p>The chances of evasion are very small, and three warships, believed to be
                        Japanese vessels, are reported off the Corregidor Islands in the
                        Philippines. Whether Togo’s main body is off the Pescadores, or at one of
                        the naval bases of Southern Japan, he will be able to act on interior lines
                        against Rodjestvensky should the latter make for the open waters of the
                        Pacific, and thence attempt to penetrate into the Japan Sea by running the
                        gauntlet of the Korean Straits, or trying the Tsugari or Perouse Straits
                        further to the north. There is therefore every reason to anticipate that,
                        even if Rodjestvensky should so desire, it will be impracticable for him to
                        avoid a general action at a very early date. If he continues his course
                        direct on the Formosa Channel and if Togo’s fleet is concentrated at the
                        Pescadores, the action will probably be fought is a very short time.</p>

                            reciprocated, but her parents looked coldly on the young man's suit. The

                            of poison to which she succumbed. She was about 20 years of age and of

                    <p>As the Egyptian Market was sorely in need of a pick-me-up, the first results
                        of crushing operations on the Um Rus were doubly welcome in London last
                        week. Certainly for a beginner the mine makes a very creditable showing. In
                        fact, market anticipations have been well exceeded, as, instead of a 10-dwt.
                        average as expected, the total yield of 351 ozs. from the 445 tons of ore
                        put through the mill gives an average value of 15 dwis. to the ton, besides
                        which, it is stated, there are an extra 3 dwts. in the tailings. As a good 6
                        dwts. may be reckoned to have been lost over the new plates, under proper
                        working conditions there is every justification for the belief that the Um
                        Rus will turn out a 1-oz. proposition.</p>

                        truly remarkable. Deposits (including current accounts) are £66,500,000,
                        comparing with £54,800,000 in December, 1903 ; acceptances £3,700,000, as
                        against £3,000,000; cash in hand and at banks £5,500,000 against
                        £4,600,000;bills recievable, £41.000,000 against £33,400,000 ; current
                        accounts, £19,100,000 against £14,100,000; and loans against securities and
                        contangoes, £21,400,000 against £21,000,000. The net profits for this year
                        amount to the exceedingly comfortable sum of £1,285,000. The Credit Lyonnais
                        is, of course, a French institution, pure and simple, but the London agency
                        is a greater factor in our own markets than most people suppose. The report
                        states that London has made no less a contribution to the success of the
                        bank during the past year than during former financial periods. The figures
                        we have quoted are a certain indication of sustained progress and capable

                    <p>The Suez Canal Company's dredger "Pharoh II," which was lying in the entrance
                        of the Cherit Basin, was taking in coal on Saturday night preparatory to
                        starting work this morning, and by some strange oversight all her sluices
                        and side-scuttles were left open, with the natural result that as she got
                        lower in the water owing to the extra weight, she began to fill on all
                        sides, and before anything could be done to save her, she sank bodily. As
                        she sank her superior top-weight caused her to roll over on her sides, and
                        her mast, funnel, and upper works wore broken away, so that she does not
                        appear above water-line. She is an almost new dredger, worth some £35,000,
                        and was only brought out to Port Said last summer to be used in connection

                    <p>El Lewa F. J. Nason Pasha, D.S.O., has been struck off the strength of the
                        Egyptian Army. The Sirdar, in a Special Army Order, express his great regret
                        at the retirement from the Army of Nason Pasha, who has served with his
                        Highness’s troops for nearly eleven years, during which time he has taken a
                        prominent part in the following campaigns and actions in which the Egyptian
                        Army has been engaged: —Sudan 1889, action of Arguin (wounded); expedition
                        to Dougola, 1896, Nile expedition, 1897 ; Nile expedition, 1898, battle of
                        Atbara and Khartoum aud defeat of Ahmed Fedil's army, Nile expedition, 1899.
                        El Lewa Nason Pasha has held the appointment of Brigade Major, Dongola

                        General Sudan Government. in each of these appointments the excellence of
                        his work has been most conspicuous. The Sirdar feels sure that he is
                        expressing the feelings of the whole Egyptian Army in wishing Nason Pasha
                        every success in the future.</p>
                    <p>El Lewa the Hon. M. G. Talbot Pasha has also been struck off the Egyptian
                        Army. The Sirdar likewise expresses his great regret at the retirement of
                        Talbot Pasha from the Army of his Highness the Khedive, with which he has
                        served for over eight years. During this period he waa Direotor of Military
                        Intelligence, E.A., Director of Surveys, Sudan Government, and in the first
                        instance Special Servioe officer. The Boundary Commission, the

                        Talbot Pasha, are a lasting testimony of the excellence and thoroughness of
                        his work. The Sirdar desires, in the name of the Egyptian Army, to wish
                        Talbot Pasha every success in his future career.</p>

                    <head>SUCCESSFUL CAIRO INSTITUTE BRITISH RECREATION CLUB.</head>
                    <p>The second annual general meeting of the club was held in the club premises
                        in the Tewfikieh quarter, on Saturday at 6 p.m., under the presidency of
                        Crookshank, Pasha. In spite of the hot weather a large number of members
                        were present: several members, including the Very Rev. Dean Butcher, sent
                        their regrets for non-attendance, and a telegram was received from Assouan
                        from Mr. E. A. Harrison, the late president, wishing the club a prosperous
                        new year. The audited balance sheet for the year ending 31st March, showing
                        a balance in hand of £179, was then read by the secretary and passed
                        unanimously. Crookshank Pasha then gave an interesting review of the past
                        year’s work, which was listened to with great attention and frequently
                        interrupted by enthuastic cheers. When his Excellency undertook the
                        presidency of the club last April, its financial condition was bad, the club
                        being over $706 in debt, whilst the petty jealousies, quarrelling and bad
                        feeling among various members of the club, very nearly wrecked the
                        institution. A new committee, consisting principally of buisness members of
                        the club, ably presided over by Dr. Madden, was elected, and thanks to the
                        pecuniary support of personal friends of the president, and the
                        determination of the members of the club to work unitedly and harmoniously
                        together in the interests of inch a much-needed British institution in
                        Cairo, the year has proved a great success, and the general tone of the club
                        leaves nothing to be desired. There are now 800 subscribing members (P.T.
                        120 per annum) and 129 of than are new members since April 1904. The profits
                        from all sources for the last six months amounted to over £300, so that the
                        club may now be considered a good going and paying concern. During the year
                        a second tennis court, a miniature rifle range, and a bowling alley have
                        been built. Several tennis tournaments were held, for which the prizes
                        presented by the members, and the competition, being open to ladies, was
                        thoroughly appreciated by all those who were able take part. The main hall
                        of the club was wooden floored during the summer, and the fortnightly dances
                        which took place through the winter were well patronised and proved very
                        succeessful. Several river excursions got up during the warm weather and
                        were thoroughly enjoyed by all those who were able to join in them. A change
                        was made in the internal administration of the club. An hon. secretary (Mr.
                        Holmes) and a resident steward were appointed, who managed the affairs of
                        the club under the direction of the committee, and a hearty vote of thanks
                        was given to the hon. treasurer, Mr. A. V. Thomson, the hon. secretary, Mr.
                        Holmes, the chairman, Dr. Madden, and the members of the committee for their
                        excellent services during the past year. The rules and bye laws of the club
                        have been printed and distributed to every member of the club. Several very
                        successfull concerts, got up entirely by members of the club, and two
                        entertainments, given by Mr. Scott Leslie, were held during the winter and
                        drew good audience on every oocasion. The Christmas festivities induded an
                        excellent tea, followed up by a huge ’Xmas Tree and a liberal distribution
                        of toys suitable for all ages, from the baby in arms to the young boys and
                        girls of 13 years, and was a great success. Nearly 400 people were present.
                        Lord and Lady Cromer graciously favored the club with their presence, and
                        after taking tea with the members, remained to witness the distribution of
                        the presents to the young people, and the club owes a debt of gratitude to
                        Lord and Lady Cromer for thus showing their personal interest in its
                        wellfare. Wednesday, the "ladies' day," was by far the most successful of
                        the week,and a large number of the wives and children of members avail
                        themselves of the privileges of the club during the afternoon and evening.
                        The sale of teas during these afternoons is undertaken by two lady members
                        in turn, with excellent results financially and otherwise. Taking into
                        consideration the number of families living in flats and small rooms,
                        without a garden open space for children to play in, the president hoped the
                        committee would see their way to have two ladies’ days a week instead of
                        Wednesday only, especially during the long, hot summer months. Two very well
                        attended classes, one for ladies and the other for gentlemen, for
                        instruction in first aid to the sick and injured, under the auspices of the
                        8t John of Jerusalem Ambulance Association, were held by Dr. Madden. The
                        president at the close of his address presented the successful candidates of
                        the class, 10 ladies and 8 gentlemen, with the certificates for passing the
                        final examination. He also presented Dr. Madden with 6 handsome volumes of
                        the “Arabian Nights,” subscribed for by the members of the gentlemen’s
                        class, for his voluntary services as their lecturer.</p>
                    <p>In accordance with Art. 14 the president and four members of committee
                        resigned. Dr. Madden then proposed that Crooksbank Pasha be reelected
                        president for the ensuing year, which was carried unanimously, with loud
                        cheers. Several new members for the vacancies on the committee having been
                        duly proposed and seconded, a ballot was taken and the following members
                        were elected to fill the four vacancies caused by the retiring members. Dr.
                        Madden, Messrs. Blake, Curtis and Ratcliffe. The president after thanking
                        the members for reelecting him for another year, accepted the position the
                        more willingly as, having already steered the club over troublous waters, he
                        was anxious to see her in a safe harbour where she would be permanently
                        moored. They had recently received a notification from the Egyptian
                        Government authorities that the premises they at present occupied would be
                        required in the near future for services of public utility. When they
                        started the club two years ago they knew that their possession of the land
                        they occupiad was only temporary, and they now had to face the fact that, in
                        about 12 months time they would have to go elsewhere. "The Egyptian
                        Government, on whom we had no claims whatever for compensation in the
                        removal of the club, had very generously come forwars and offered the club a
                        piece of ground in perpetuity on the opposite side of the canal in the main
                        Boulac road, covering the same area as the club at present occupied and
                        valued at £10,000 to £l2,000-which would remain as a valuable asset to the
                        club. It is true we have sunk, about £1,700 capital in the building of the
                        present club, and that a portion of this, such as price of labour, etc., is
                        absolutely lost. We have, however, no claim for damages or loss against the
                        Egyptian Government, and the generous valuable asset of which they make us a
                        gift in the new premises, obliges us to look for other methods in raising
                        the necessary funds for the transfer and building of the new Recreation
                        Club. I am authorised to state that if every other method fails Mr. Maohell,

                            Saturday last, and notwithstanding the vigour of the khamseen, were very
                            successful. There was a large and fashionable gathering of Europeans,
                            including a number of visitors from Alexandria, Cairo, and Tantah. The
                            sports were held on the company’s grounds and were enlivened by the band
                            of the Royal Berkshire Regiment, kindly lent by the O. C. The sports
                            began at 2 P.M. and continued without interruption until 7 pm. The
                            championship was won by Mr. R. M. Ross. Mr. Spencer Whiteman
                            unfortunately broke his collar bone in the sack race, After winning

                    <p>To The Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                    <p>Sir, -The Article which you print below was, as you are aware, prepared for
                        the press in December of last year. The reasons which led me to withhold it
                        from publication at that time no longer exist; void in view of recent
                        contributions on the subject, containing information some of which is
                        accurate and much of which is not, I think its publication at the present
                        time may be of interest. To have brought the article up to date wouid have
                        involved rewriting it; a task for which I have neither the time nor the
                        inclination, and I must therefore ask your readers to accept this letter as
                        an apology for the article in its present form and as far as may be possible
                        explanatory of it. The views which I ventured to put forward as to the
                        desirability of a fresh share capital issue have been confirmend by events,
                        but the decision to make the new issue at par is an excellent illustration,
                        if one were needed, of the dangers of prophecy in matters of finance. The
                        motive of this decision can only be explained by a desire on the part of the
                        Government to restrict the accumulation of the reserve fund and, though I am
                        far trom wishing to put an uncharitable interpretation on their motives, an
                        increase of value, which they might possibly consider as unearned increment,
                        in the Deferred shares. On the other hand, the accumulation of the of the
                        reserve fund is up to a certain point desirable in the Government interest,
                        as long as the guarantee remains in its present form. The difficulty can
                        only be resolved by abolishing the indirect guarantee as it now exists and
                        by substituting for it a direct guarantee of the bonds. The share capital
                        would then become security for the Government in place of the reserve land,
                        which would no longer be required. The value and price of the Ordinary and
                        Deferred have reached a point at which a three per cent, guarantee can have
                        no very real interest for holders of these shares, and they could hardly
                        complain at its disappearance. The proportion between the share capital and
                        the bonds in its altered form, which has been the subject of some rather
                        unintelligent criticism, has been, as any one can reckon for themselves, a
                        matter of exact calculation, and is equally well adapted to meet the
                        requirements of the Government guarantee, either in its present form, or in
                        some other, similar to that suggested.</p>

                    <p>The Agricultural Bank of Egypt was formed in May, 1902, to take over and
                        develop the business of loans to the fellaheen, which until then had been
                        carried on by the National Bank of Egypt. Started as an experiment by the
                        Government, and handed over to the National Bank soon after its creation in
                        1898, this brauch of the business had grown so rapidly as to call for the
                        formation of a special department to deal with it; and when in 1902 the
                        loans granted had reached the sum of £400,000 and applications for further
                        sums were reaching the Bank from all parts of the country, it was felt that
                        the business had emerged from experimental beginnings, and had emerged a
                        stage which warranted the creation of a separate establishment with special
                        powers to give shape aud expansion to the work which lay before it.</p>
                    <p>As originally constituted by the decree of May 17th, the capital of the bank
                        was fixed at £2,500,000 of which £1,250,000 was at once issued in the shape
                        of 248,000 Ordinary and 2.000 Deterred shares of £5 each. The National bank
                        received 80,000 Ordinary shares in repayment of the £400,000 which
                        represented the amount of its advances to the fellaheen outstanding at the
                        time;—110,000 shares were subscribed by Sir Ernest Cassel, and the remainder
                        by a group of local financiers. Power was taken to issue the balance of the
                        authorised capital in such form as might be subsequently approved by the
                        Board, and in the summer ot 1903, 62,500 cumulative 4% Preference shares of
                        £10 each were issued and subscribed.</p>
                    <p>In February, 1904, the scope of the Bank was still further enlarged, and its
                        powers extended, by a series of amendments to the original statures, which
                        have subsequently been incorporated with them. Their immediate effect, in so
                        far as the capital of the Bank was concerned, was to raise it to five
                        millions by the addition of two and half million of bonds, discretion, as
                        before, being left to the Board as to the time and manner of their issue.
                        £1,875,000 of bonds have already been subscribed, bringing the paid-up
                        capital of the Bank to £3,750,000 out of an authorised total of £6,000,000.
                        Very soon after operations had begun, an arrangement was entered into by
                        which the National Bank agreed to make advances to the Agricultural Bank at
                        a moderate rate of interest in proportion as the demand for loans arose.
                        This arrangement has given the Bank an elasticity which it would not
                        otherwise have possessed, and at the same time has avoided the raising of
                        large sums of money until the employment of them became a certainty.</p>
                    <p>Such in outline is a sketch of the Bank as it exists today. A larger interest
                        lies in ascertaining its aims, its powers, and restrictions, the methods by
                        which its vast capital employed and repaid, and the relations in which it
                        stands to the Government and its own shareholders on one side and the
                        fellaheen of the country on the other. The aims of the Bank are defined in
                        the statutes in no uncertain language; it is the single purpose of the Bank,
                        it is declared, to make advances to the population of small means whose
                        occupation is the tilling of the soil. Two classes of loans are provided
                        for, the first not to exceed L.E. 500 amount and repayable in 10 1/2 years,
                        the second not to exceed L.E. 20 and repayable in fifteen months, in both
                        cases the rare of interest is fixed at 9 %, or such limit as may be fixed by
                        law ; 9 % being the rate which has always been prescribed by the Code Law of
                        the country as the maximum which the Tribunals may allow in all claims which
                        involve any question of interest. In other respects the two classes of loan
                        differ widely, the fisrt being secured by a mortgage on the property which
                        may not exceed 50 % of the ascertained value of the land ; the second being
                        an advance not secured by any specific cession of property, but safeguarded
                        by the shortness of the period allowed for repayment. The first is no doubt
                        designed to provide capital for the purchase of plant and machinery, while
                        the second is limiited to the provision of seed the value of which the
                        harvesting of his crop will enable the small termer to repay within the
                        limit of fifteen months allowed.</p>
                    <p>Apait from these limitations the granting of loans is left entirely in the
                        hands of the manager and the bank agents in the interior. The influence of
                        the Government is first felt in the way in which the interest and principal
                        ot the loans are recovered. The Sarraf or Government tax-gatherer in each
                        district is authorised to receive repayment of_amounts due, in the same way
                        that he recieves every year the payments of land tax, the largest item of
                        Government revenue in this country, and the collection of which requires a
                        permenant staff of these officials. There can be no doubt that the presence
                        of these men, whose comings are known and expected among the fellaheen as
                        those of the seasons, in their dual capacity as Government tax-gatherers and
                        agents for the Bank, ensures a regularity of repayment which it wouid
                        otherwise be idle to expect. The machinery of Government is applied at the
                        veiy point where it is most required, and where the leverage it affords to
                        the Bank can be most widely exerted.</p>
                    <p>Fears have been expressed as to the use which the fellah is likely to make of
                        his newfound facility in obtaining loans. We are inclined to think that the
                        use which he is likely to make of borrowed money will at all times be
                        largely; determined by the urgency, or rather the insistency, with which the
                        need of repayment is kept before his eyes. Without in any way detracting
                        from the honesty of the Oriental character, it is no exaggeration to say
                        that under ordinary circumstances no Oriental enters into any commitment,
                        least of all any commitment in which he acts the part of borrower, without
                        some mental reservation as to the possibility of shifting or evading his
                        obligation.</p>
                    <p>Therefore the position of the lender and his reputed ability or inability to
                        enforce repayment, becomes an essential factor in determining the employment
                        of the money loaned from him. It is the Government, as has already been
                        shown, who steps in to take repayment, and it is therefore the Government
                        who is in the eyes of the fellah the real lender,—a lender of whose ability
                        to enforce repayment, experience has taught him to have no doubts.</p>
                    <p>Enough has been said to show that the Bank has nothing in common with the
                        Agricultural Cooperative Banks which in some cases have succeeded so well in
                        Europe. The coordination of interests which they involve, and the altruism
                        of spirit which they call for, are altogether alien to Oriental life and
                        character. The altruism of the Oriental is only conceivable in a negative
                        sense as the difference between the greater or lesser degree of suspicion
                        with which be regards his neighbour's motives. It is far trom being a
                        standard to which an appeal for cooperation oould successfully be made. Any
                        such scheme as that attributed to the late Menshawi Pasha of an Agricultural
                        Bank working without the earning or payment of interest, though in itself a
                        bold attempt to give practical shape to Mohamedan tenets, would be doomed to
                        failure though the same cause. The Agricultural Bank as it exists to-day
                        imposes individually on the fellah a moral financial obligation the nature
                        of which he fully understands and discharges, without the doubts and
                        questionings which any other form of Bank would inevitably arouse in
                        him.</p>
                    <p>Hardly less important than the relations of the Government and the Bank
                        towards the fellah are their relations towards one another. These are
                        regulated by Articles 40 and 41 of the statutes, on which it is not too much
                        to say that the whole constitution of the Bank is hinged.</p>
                    <p>A reserve fund is to be built up from a yearly deduction of five per cent
                        from the interest annually collected, to the amount of £225,000; a deduction
                        which is to be increased to 7 % on interest collected over and above the
                        sum. On the basis of interest @ 9 %, this yearly assignment to tho reserve
                        fund will amount to £27,000, to which must be added any difference between
                        the rate of 4 % and that actual rate of interest, including redemption, at
                        which the £2,500,000 of bonds may be raised.</p>
                    <p>The reserve fund will be invested in Government securities, and is only to be
                        drawn on in the event of the interest collected in any given year, plus such
                        sums as may be also recovered as overdue from previous years, proving
                        inadequate to cover the expenses of the Bank, the arrears of indebtedness,
                        and an interast of three per cent on the capital engaged. Should the reserve
                        fund be still inadequate to meet these calls, the Government agrees to make
                        good the deficit.</p>
                    <p>It will thus be seen that the Government guarantee, though indirect in the
                        method of its application, is none the less real and substantial in its
                        nature. It should go far towards making the bonds attractive to investors
                        who, while in search of Egyptian Government guaranteed securities, are
                        deterred from investing in Preference and Unified by the prospects of
                        conversion and a diminished yield at no distant date.</p>
                    <p>The bonds as a first charge, followed by the Preference shares as a second,
                        have a claim to the Government guarantee which ranks above that of the
                        Ordinary shares. In this way the guarantee of three per cent on the whole
                        capital is sufficient to cover the interest of four per cent not only on the
                        bonds but also on the Preference issue; leaving of course a very handsome
                        margin for the former. It has not perhaps been fully appreciated that the
                        guarantee is two fold in its nature, and secures the bondholder not only as
                        to his interest, but also as to his principal, the latter being doubly
                        secured by the express application of mortgages made under 'B' loans, which
                        in themselves postulate a land value double the amount of every
                        mortgage.</p>
                    <p>Turning to the result of the first eighteen months, working as shown in the
                        balance-sheet to Dec. 1902, the dividend at the rate of four per cent might
                        be considered disappointing, but for a special cause explained in the
                        president’s report which may be allowed to speak for itself.</p>
                    <p>In accordance with the statutes of the Bank, only the interest actually
                        recovered during any financial year can be taken into, account in making up
                        the balance sheet. Thus only the interest actually collected, viz.,
                        £154,582.19.7, has been carried, to profit and loss amount, whereas the
                        interest accrued amounted to £39,286.19. 11 more. This large difference will
                        disappear in future years and a similar difference will only arise when in
                        any current year fresh capital has been employed the interest on which is
                        recoverable in the following year.</p>
                    <p>In other words, the real results would but for statutory restrictions have
                        permitted the distribution of a dividend of about 5 1/2 instead of 4 % with
                        a distribution to the Deferred shares corresponding to the 1/2 on the
                        Ordinary.</p>
                    <p>Though this difference, as explained in the report, will diminish in future
                        years, it will not disappear altogether until-such time as the capital of
                        the Bank becomes definitely fixed. For the present this is limited to five
                        millions, and if unlikely to remain at that, it would nevertheless be
                        impossible to take any other figure for the purposes of calculation without
                        taking a flight into the realm of prophecy.</p>
                    <p>Up to five millions sufficient data are available to calculate with tolerable
                        aoouracy the return to shareholders. After making allowances for a sum of
                        £65,000 for annual expenses, inclusive of commissions payable to the Sarrafs
                        ; for a deduction of £27,000 for the Reserve Fund ; and for a charge of 5 %
                        on net profits payable to the National Bank, we find that the results will
                        be such as to admit of a dividend of 10 % on the Ordinary and a distribution
                        of £31 each to the Deferred shares. In a country where economic changes
                        occur as rapidly as they do in Egypt, we hesitate to name the rate at which
                        this should be capitalised, but taking into consideration the movement of
                        capital into the country, and the high class of the security, we are
                        inclined to place it at 4 %, which will give an ultimate value of £12.10 to
                        the Ordinary and £775 to the Deferred shares.</p>

                    <p>It is impossible to forecast what increases of capital may take place in the
                        future, or their probable effect on the share capital. Power has been
                        reserved to issue any further bonds ranking pari passu with the original two
                        and a half millions, provided that the Egyptian Government assent to such
                        issue, and extend the guarantees in respect of the new capital. Even with
                        this extension it seems unlikely that bonds will be issued beyond the sum of
                        three and three quarter millions, without a corresponding increases of the
                        share capital. The guarantee of three per cent, on five millions will be
                        absorbed by an interest of four per cent on three and three-quarters; to
                        issue bonds alone beyond that amount would therefore be equivalent to
                        exposing the bondholder to a deficiency in his guarantee, which, however
                        unlikely to materialise, would none the less affect to some extent the
                        theoretical value of his security.</p>
                    <p>To the investor therefore who looks rather to the future and its
                        possibilities, than to an immediate return, the Deferred shares offer a
                        mater attraction than the Ordinary as limited by statute to the original
                        number, whereas it may be found neoeesary for reasons already given to add
                        to the existing issue of Ordinary shares. Holders ot both classes may not be
                        satisfied with the oonviotion that their interests are in safe keeping.</p>

                        cannot but be beneficial both to the shareholder and to the fellah, to
                        promote whose welfare it was created. It stands to-day an undertaking of the
                        first magnitude, designed and destined to take irs plaoe among the
