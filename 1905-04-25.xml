                    THE NAVAL POSITION.</head>
                    <p>The violent cannonading, which yesterday’s telegrams stated had been heard off Kamaranh Bay only a few hours after the departure of the Russians, appears to have been the figment of some Frenchman's imagination, for this morning’s news shows that the Baltic Fleet is evidently well on its way towards the north, as a glance at the map shows that the Russians are following a course which would take them past Hong Kong into the channel known as the Formosa Straits, which divides the island of Formosa from the mainland of China. They are thus steering direct for the Japanese flying base in the Pescadores Islands, at which a portion of Togo’s fleet, including probably a considerable amount of torpedo craft, is almost certainly concentrated, and possibly his main fighting strength.</p>
                    <p>The chances of evasion are very small, and three warships, believed to be Japanese vessels, are reported off the Corregidor Islands in the Philippines. Whether Togo’s main body is off the Pescadores, or at one of the naval bases of Southern Japan, he will be able to act on interior lines against Rodjestvensky should the latter make for the open waters of the Pacific, and thence attempt to penetrate into the Japan Sea by running the gauntlet of the Korean Straits, or trying the Tsugari or Perouse Straits further to the north. There is therefore every reason to anticipate that, even if Rodjestvensky should so desire, it will be impracticable for him to avoid a general action at a very early date. If he continues his course direct on the Formosa Channel and if Togo’s fleet is concentrated at the Pescadores, the action will probably be fought is a very short time.</p></div>

<head>EGYPTIAN MINING.
THE UM RUS CRUSHING.</head>
<p>As the Egyptian Market was sorely in need of a pick-me-up, the first results of crushing operations on the Um Rus were doubly welcome in London last week. Certainly for a beginner the mine makes a very creditable showing. In fact, market anticipations have been well exceeded, as, instead of a 10-dwt. average as expected, the total yield of 351 ozs. from the 445 tons of ore put through the mill gives an average value of 15 dwis. to the ton, besides which, it is stated, there are an extra 3 dwts. in the tailings. As a good 6 dwts. may be reckoned to have been lost over the new plates, under proper working conditions there is every justification for the belief that the Um Rus will turn out a 1-oz. proposition.</p></div>

<head>CREDIT LYONNAIS</head>
<p>The report of the Credit Lyonnais for the past year, recently presented to the shareholders at the general meeting, introduces us to figures which are truly remarkable. Deposits (including current accounts) are £66,500,000, comparing with £54,800,000 in December, 1903 ; acceptances £3,700,000, as against £3,000,000; cash in hand and at banks £5,500,000 against £4,600,000;bills recievable, £41.000,000 against £33,400,000 ; current accounts, £19,100,000 against £14,100,000; and loans against securities and contangoes, £21,400,000 against £21,000,000. The net profits for this year amount to the exceedingly comfortable sum of £1,285,000. The Credit Lyonnais is, of course, a French institution, pure and simple, but the London agency is a greater factor in our own markets than most people suppose. The report states that London has made no less a contribution to the success of the bank during the past year than during former financial periods. The figures we have quoted are a certain indication of sustained progress and capable direction.</p></div>

CANAL CO.’S DREDGER SINKS.
(From our Correspondent).</head>
<p>Port Said, Monday.</p>
<p>The Suez Canal Company's dredger "Pharoh II," which was lying in the entrance of the Cherit Basin, was taking in coal on Saturday night preparatory to starting work this morning, and by some strange oversight all her sluices and side-scuttles were left open, with the natural result that as she got lower in the water owing to the extra weight, she began to fill on all sides, and before anything could be done to save her, she sank bodily. As she sank her superior top-weight caused her to roll over on her sides, and her mast, funnel, and upper works wore broken away, so that she does not appear above water-line. She is an almost new dredger, worth some £35,000, and was only brought out to Port Said last summer to be used in connection with harbour alterations. Salvage operations have been commeuced by the Canal Company.</p></div>

<head>SUCCESSFUL CAIRO INSTITUTE
BRITISH RECREATION CLUB.</head>
<p>The second annual general meeting of the club was held in the club premises in the Tewfikieh quarter, on Saturday at 6 p.m., under the presidency of Crookshank, Pasha. In spite of the hot weather a large number of members were present: several members, including the Very Rev. Dean Butcher, sent their regrets for non-attendance, and a telegram was received from Assouan from Mr. E. A. Harrison, the late president, wishing the club a prosperous new year. The audited balance sheet for the year ending 31st March, showing a balance in hand of £179, was then read by the secretary and passed unanimously. Crookshank Pasha then gave an interesting review of the past year’s work, which was listened to with great attention and frequently interrupted by enthuastic cheers. When his Excellency undertook the presidency of the club last April, its financial condition was bad, the club being over $706 in debt, whilst the petty jealousies, quarrelling and bad feeling among various members of the club, very nearly wrecked the institution. A new committee, consisting principally of buisness members of the club, ably presided over by Dr. Madden, was elected, and thanks to the pecuniary support of personal friends of the president, and the determination of the members of the club to work unitedly and harmoniously together in the interests of inch a much-needed British institution in Cairo, the year has proved a great suooess, and the general tone of the club leaves nothing to be desired. There are now 800 subscribing members (P.T. 120 per annum) and 129 of than are new members since April 1904. The profits from all sources for the last six months amounted to over £300, so that the club may now be considered a good going and paying concern. During the year a second tennis court, a miniature rifle range, and a bowling alley have been built. Several tennis tournaments were held, for which the prizes presented by the members, and the competition, being open to ladies, was thoroughly appreciated by all those who were able take part. The main hall of the club was wooden floored during the summer, and the fortnightly dances which took place through the winter were well patronised and proved very succeessful. Several river excursions got up during the warm weather and were thoroughly enjoyed by all those who were able to join in them. A change was made in the internal administration of the club. An hon. secretary (Mr. Holmes) and a resident steward were appointed, who managed the affairs of the club under the direction of the committee, and a hearty vote of thanks was given to the hon. treasurer, Mr. A. V. Thomson, the hon. secretary, Mr. Holmes, the chairman, Dr. Madden, and the members of the committee for their excellent services during the past year. The rules and bye laws of the club have been printed and distributed to every member of the club. Several very successfull concerts, got up entirely by members of the club, and two entertainments, given by Mr. Scott Leslie, were held during the winter and drew good audience on every oocasion. The Christmas festivities induded an excellent tea, followed up by a huge ’Xmas Tree and a liberal distribution of toys suitable for all ages, from the baby in arms to the young boys and girls of 13 years, and was a great success. Nearly 400 people were present. Lord and Lady Cromer graciously favored the club with their presence, and after taking tea with the members, remained to witness the distribution of the presents to the young people, and the club owes a debt of gratitude to Lord and Lady Cromer for thus showing their personal interest in its wellfare. Wednesday, the "ladies' day," was by far the most successful of the week,and a large number of the wives and children of members avail themselves of the privileges of the club during the afternoon and evening. The sale of teas during these afternoons is undertaken by two lady members in turn, with excellent results financially and otherwise. Taking into consideration the number of families living in flats and small rooms, without a garden open space for children to play in, the president hoped the committee would see their way to have two ladies’ days a week instead of Wednesday only, especially during the long, hot summer months. Two very well attended classes, one for ladies and the other for gentlemen, for instruction in first aid to the sick and injured, under the auspices of the 8t John of Jerusalem Ambulance Association, were held by Dr. Madden. The president at the close of his address presented the successful candidates of the class, 10 ladies and 8 gentlemen, with the certificates for passing the final examination. He also presented Dr. Madden with 6 handsome volumes of the “Arabian Nights,” subscribed for by the members of the gentlemen’s class, for his voluntary services as their lecturer.</p>
<p>In accordance with Art. 14 the president and four members of committee resigned. Dr. Madden then proposed that Crooksbank Pasha be reelected president for the ensuing year, which was carried unanimously, with loud cheers. Several new members for the vacancies on the committee having been duly proposed and seconded, a ballot was taken and the following members were elected to fill the four vacancies caused by the retiring members. Dr. Madden, Messrs. Blake, Curtis and Ratcliffe. The president after thanking the members for reelecting him for another year, accepted the position the more willingly as, having already steered the club over troublous waters, he was anxious to see her in a safe harbour where she would be permanently moored. They had recently received a notification from the Egyptian Government authorities that the premises they at present occupied would be required in the near future for services of public utility.
When they started the club two years ago they knew that their possession of the land they occupiad was only temporary, and they now had to face the fact that, in about 12 months time they would have to go elsewhere. "The Egyptian Government, on whom we had no claims whatever for compensation in the removal
of the club, had very generously come forwars and offered the club a piece of ground in perpetuity on the opposite side of the canal in the main Boulac road, covering the same area as the club at present occupied and valued at £10,000 to £l2,000-which would remain as a valuable asset to the club. It is true we have sunk, about £1,700 capital in the building of the present club, and that a portion of this, such as price of labour, etc., is absolutely lost. We have, however, no claim for damages or loss against the Egyptian Government, and the generous valuable asset of which they make us a gift in the new premises, obliges us to look for other methods in raising the necessary funds for the transfer and building of the new Recreation Club. I am authorised to state that if every other method fails Mr. Maohell, whose interest in the club is unflagging, and myself will find the money required.”</p></div>

                    <p>To The Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                    <p>Sir, -The Article which you print below was, as you are aware, prepared for the press in December of last year. The reasons which led me to withhold it from publication at that time no longer exist; void in view of recent contributions on the subject, containing information some of which is accurate and much of which is not, I think its publication at the present time may be of interest. To have brought the article up to date wouid have involved rewriting it; a task for which I have neither the time nor the inclination, and I must therefore ask your readers to accept this letter as an apology for the article in its present form and as far as may be possible explanatory of it. The views which I ventured to put forward as to the desirability of a fresh share capital issue have been confirmend by events, but the decision to make the new issue at par is an excellent illustration, if one were needed, of the dangers of prophecy in matters of finance. The motive of this decision can only be explained by a desire on the part of the Government to restrict the accumulation of the reserve fund and, though I am far trom wishing to put an uncharitable interpretation on their motives, an increase of value, which they might possibly consider as unearned increment, in the Deferred shares. On the other hand, the accumulation of the of the reserve fund is up to a certain point desirable in the Government interest, as long as the guarantee remains in its present form. The difficulty can only be resolved by abolishing the indirect guarantee as it now exists and by substituting for it a direct guarantee of the bonds. The share capital would then become security for the Government in place of the reserve land, which would no longer be required. The value and price of the Ordinary and Deferred have reached a point at which a three per cent, guarantee can have no very real interest for holders of these shares, and they could hardly complain at its disappearance. The proportion between the share capital and the bonds in its altered form, which has been the subject of some rather unintelligent criticism, has been, as any one can reckon for themselves, a matter of exact calculation, and is equally well adapted to meet the requirements of the Government guarantee, either in its present form, or in some other, similar to that suggested.</p>
                    <p>D.K.R.</p>
                    <p>Cairo.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Agricultural Bank of Egypt was formed in May, 1902, to take over and develop the business of loans to the fellaheen, which until then had been carried on by the National Bank of Egypt. Started as an experiment by the Government, and handed over to the National Bank soon after its creation in 1898, this brauch of the business had grown so rapidly as to call for the formation of a special department to deal with it; and when in 1902 the loans granted had reached the sum of £400,000 and applications for further sums were reaching the Bank from all parts of the country, it was felt that the business had emerged from experimental beginnings, and had emerged a stage which warranted the creation of a separate establishment with special powers to give shape aud expansion to the work which lay before it.</p>
                    <p>As originally constituted by the decree of May 17th, the capital of the bank was fixed at £2,500,000 of which £1,250,000 was at once issued in the shape of 248,000 Ordinary and 2.000 Deterred shares of £5 each. The National bank received 80,000 Ordinary shares in repayment of the £400,000 which represented the amount of its advances to the fellaheen outstanding at the time;—110,000 shares were subscribed by Sir Ernest Cassel, and the remainder by a group of local financiers. Power was taken to issue the balance of the authorised capital in such form as might be subsequently approved by the Board, and in the summer ot 1903, 62,500 cumulative 4% Preference shares of £10 each were issued and subscribed.</p>
                    <p>In February, 1904, the scope of the Bank was still further enlarged, and its powers extended, by a series of amendments to the original statures, which have subsequently been incorporated with them. Their immediate effect, in so far as the capital of the Bank was concerned, was to raise it to five millions by the addition of two and half million of bonds, discretion, as before, being left to the Board as to the time and manner of their issue. £1,875,000 of bonds have already been subscribed, bringing the paid-up capital of the Bank to £3,750,000 out of an authorised total of £6,000,000. Very soon after operations had begun, an arrangement was entered into by which the National Bank agreed to make advances to the Agricultural Bank at a moderate rate of interest in proportion as the demand for loans arose. This arrangement has given the Bank an elasticity which it would not otherwise have possessed, and at the same time has avoided the raising of large sums of money until the employment of them became a certainty.</p>
                    <p>Such in outline is a sketch of the Bank as it exists today. A larger interest lies in ascertaining its aims, its powers, and restrictions, the methods by which its vast capital employed and repaid, and the relations in which it stands to the Government and its own shareholders on one side and the fellaheen of the country on the other. The aims of the Bank are defined in the statutes in no uncertain language; it is the single purpose of the Bank, it is declared, to make advances to the population of small means whose occupation is the tilling of the soil. Two classes of loans are provided for, the first not to exceed L.E. 500 amount and repayable in 10 1/2 years, the second not to exceed L.E. 20 and repayable in fifteen months, in both cases the rare of interest is fixed at 9 %, or such limit as may be fixed by law ; 9 % being the rate which has always been prescribed by the Code Law of the country as the maximum which the Tribunals may allow in all claims which involve any question of interest. In other respects the two classes of loan differ widely, the fisrt being secured by a mortgage on the property which may not exceed 50 % of the ascertained value of the land ; the second being an advance not secured by any specific cession of property, but safeguarded by the shortness of the period allowed for repayment. The first is no doubt designed to provide capital for tbe purchase of plant and machinery, while the second is limiited to the provision of seed the value of which the harvesting of his crop will enable the small termer to repay within the limit of fifteen months allowed.</p>
                    <p>Apait from these limitations the granting of loans is left entirely in the hands of the manager and the bank agents in the interior. The influence of the Government is first felt in the way in which the interest and principal ot the loans are recovered. The Sarraf or Government tax-gatherer in each district is authorised to receive repayment of_amounts due, in the same way that he recieves every year the payments of land tax, the largest item of Government revenue in this country, and the collection of which requires a permenant staff of these officials. There can be no doubt that the presence of these men, whose comings are known and expected among the fellaheen as those of the seasons, in their dual capacity as Government tax-gatherers and agents for the Bank, ensures a regularity of repayment which it wouid otherwise be idle to expect. The machinery of Government is applied at the veiy point where it is most required, and where the leverage it affords to the Bank can be most widely exerted.</p>
                    <p>Fears have been expressed as to the use which the fellah is likely to make of his newfound facility in obtaining loans. We are inclined to think that the use which he is likely to make of borrowed money will at all times be largely; determined by the urgency, or rather the insistency, with which the need of repayment is kept before his eyes. Without in any way detracting from the honesty of the Oriental character, it is no exaggeration to say that under ordinary circumstances no Oriental enters into any commitment, least of all any commitment in which he acts the part of borrower, without some mental reservation as to the possibility of shifting or evading his obligation.</p>
                    <p>Therefore the position of the lender and his reputed ability or inability to enforce repayment, becomes an essential factor in determining the employment of the money loaned from him. It is the Government, as has already been shown, who steps in to take repayment, and it is therefore the Government who is in the eyes of the fellah the real lender,—a lender of whose ability to enforce repayment, experience has taught him to have no doubts.</p>
                    <p>Enough has been said to show that the Bank has nothing in common with the Agricultural Cooperative Banks which in some cases have succeeded so well in Europe. The coordination of interests which they involve, and the altruism of spirit which they call for, are altogether alien to Oriental life and character. The altruism of the Oriental is only conceivable in a negative sense as the difference between the greater or lesser degree of suspicion with which be regards his neighbour's motives. It is far trom being a standard to which an appeal for cooperation oould successfully be made. Any such scheme as that attributed to the late Menshawi Pasha of an Agricultural Bank working without the earning or payment of interest, though in itself a bold attempt to give practical shape to Mohamedan tenets, would be doomed to failure though the same cause. The Agricultural Bank as it exists to-day imposes individually on the fellah a moral financial obligation the nature of which he fully understands and discharges, without the doubts and questionings which any other form of Bank would inevitably arouse in him.</p>
                    <p>Hardly less important than the relations of the Government and the Bank towards the fellah are their relations towards one another. These are regulated by Articles 40 and 41 of the statutes, on which it is not too much to say that the whole constitution of the Bank is hinged.</p>
                    <p>A reserve fund is to be built up from a yearly deduction of five per cent from the interest annually collected, to the amount of £225,000; a deduction which is to be increased to 7 % on interest collected over and above the sum. On the basis of interest @ 9 %, this
                        yearly assignment to tho reserve fund will amount to £27,000, to which must be added any difference between the rate of 4 % and that actual rate of interest, including redemption, at which the £2,500,000 of bonds may be raised.</p>
                    <p>The reserve fund will be invested in Government securities, and is only to be drawn on in the event of the interest collected in any given year, plus such sums as may be also recovered as overdue from previous years, proving inadequate to cover the expenses of the Bank, the arrears of indebtedness, and an interast of three per cent on the capital engaged. Should the reserve fund be still inadequate to meet these calls, the Government agrees to make good the deficit.</p>
                    <p>It will thus be seen that the Government guarantee, though indirect in the method of its application, is none the less real and substantial in its nature. It should go far towards making the bonds attractive to investors who, while in search of Egyptian Government guaranteed securities, are deterred from investing in Preference and Unified by the prospects of conversion and a diminished yield at no distant date.</p>
                    <p>The bonds as a first charge, followed by the Preference shares as a second, have a claim to the Government guarantee which ranks above that of the Ordinary shares. In this way the guarantee of three per cent on the whole capital is sufficient to cover the interest of four per cent not only on the bonds but also on the Preference issue; leaving of course a very handsome margin for the former. It has not perhaps been fully appreciated that the guarantee is two fold in its nature, and secures the bondholder not only as to his interest, but also as to his principal, the latter being doubly secured by the express application of mortgages made under 'B' loans, which in themselves postulate a land value double the amount of every mortgage.</p>
                    <p>Turning to the result of the first eighteen months, working as shown in the balance-sheet to Dec. 1902, the dividend at the rate of four per cent might be considered disappointing, but for a special cause explained in the president’s report which may be allowed to speak for itself.</p>
                    <p>In accordance with the statutes of the Bank, only the interest actually recovered during any financial year can be taken into, account in making up the balance sheet. Thus only the interest actually collected, viz., £154,582.19.7, has been carried, to profit and loss amount, whereas the interest accrued amounted to £39,286.19. 11 more. This large difference will disappear in future years and a similar difference will only arise when in any current year fresh capital has been employed the interest on which is recoverable in the following year.</p>
                    <p>In other words, the real results would but for statutory restrictions have permitted the distribution of a dividend of about 5 1/2 instead of 4 % with a distribution to the Deferred shares corresponding to the 1/2 on the Ordinary.</p>
                    <p>Though this difference, as explained in the report, will diminish in future years, it will not disappear altogether until-such time as the capital of the Bank becomes definitely fixed. For the present this is limited to five millions, and if unlikely to remain at that, it would nevertheless be impossible to take any other figure for the purposes of calculation without taking a flight into the realm of prophecy.</p>
                    <p>Up to five millions sufficient data are available to calculate with tolerable aoouracy the return to shareholders. After making allowances for a sum of £65,000 for annual expenses, inclusive of commissions payable to the Sarrafs ; for a deduction of £27,000 for the Reserve Fund ; and for a charge of 5 % on net profits payable to the National Bank, we find that the results will be such as to admit of a dividend of 10 % on the Ordinary and a distribution of £31 each to the Deferred shares. In a country where economic changes occur as rapidly as they do in Egypt, we hesitate to name the rate at which this should be capitalised, but taking into consideration the movement of capital into tbe country, and the high class of the security, we are inclined to place it at 4 %, which will give an ultimate value of £12.10 to the Ordinary and £775 to the Deferred shares.</p>
                    
                    <p>It is impossible to forecast what increases of capital may take place in the future, or their probable effect on the share capital. Power has been reserved to issue any further bonds ranking pari passu with the original two and a half millions, provided that the Egyptian Government assent to such issue, and extend the guarantees in respect of the new capital. Even with this extension it seems unlikely that bonds will be issued beyond the sum of three and three quarter millions, without a corresponding increases of the share capital. The guarantee of three per cent, on five millions will be absorbed by an interest of four per cent on three and three-quarters; to issue bonds alone beyond that amount would therefore be equivalent to exposing the bondholder to a deficiency in his guarantee, which, however unlikely to materialise, would none the less affect to some extent the theoretical value of his security.</p>
                    <p>To the investor therefore who looks rather to the future and its possibilities, than to an immediate return, the Deferred shares offer a mater attraction than the Ordinary as limited by statute to the original number, whereas it may be found neoeesary for reasons already given to add to the existing issue of Ordinary shares. Holders ot both classes may not be satisfied with the oonviotion that their interests are in safe keeping.</p>
                    <p>The financial foundations of the Agricultural Bank as laid by Sir Ernest Cassel and Sir Elwin Palmer are so sure that any extension of its business cannot but be beneficial both to the shareholder and to the fellah, to promote whose welfare it was created. It stands to-day an undertaking of the first magnitude, designed and destined to take irs plaoe among the institutions of the country, as a motive power of progress and civilisation.</p></div>
