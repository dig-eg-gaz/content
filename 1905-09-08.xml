                            <p>The resentment in Japan regarding the treaty is unquestionably very strong. Certain newspapers and a party of politicians are condemning the humiliation and the inade-quacy of the safeguards for future peace, but the strong conservative element urges the folly of continuing the war for the sake of money, when the chief objects have been obtained.</p>
                            <p>The mob burned and destroyed 10 Christian churches and one mission house and school during the night of the 6th inst.</p>

A fairly large audience assisted, and the play met with much langhter and applause. The short operetta, La Rose de St. Flour, was also given and was very well received. Mlle Smyiane Val immediately established herself as a favorite, and M. Millet and M. Laurent Roland greatly delighted the audience with their singing and acting alike.</p>
                        
                        <p>British Chamber of Commerce.—We would draw the attention of manufacturers and merchants to the work of the British Chamber of Commerce of Egypt, which was formed in 1896 with the sole object of assisting British trade in this country. The services of the Chamber are always at the disposal of any member desiring information on trade matters generally, including the question of appointing suitable agents. As no fee is charged for such advice, it is obviously in the interests of all British traders here to become members, especially when it is remembered that the annual subscription is merely the nominal one of £l. The latter payment also includes a copy of the monthly Journal issued by the Chamber. Home enquirers can obtain further particulars from our London office, 36, New Broad-street, which acts as agents to the Chamber.</p>

The personnel of this mission has been carefully selected by Moha-med el Helon, the Sultan's agent in Egypt, and oonsists of two celebrated dancing girls named Badia and Zeinab, with two less distinguished but accomplished under-studies and three native musicians. The dancing girls are engaged for four months at L.E. 80 per month, with all their travelling expenses paid. Such is the first use made by his Sherifian Majesty of the loan so obligingly provided by the thrifty Teuton at the ridiculously low rate of one per cent.</p>

The facade of the new premises has been brought three metres forward on the broad pavement in front of that part of the hotel. The roofs of the new row have been so built that they will serve as balconies or promenades to the occupants of the rooms above them. The work was only began on the 1st July, and has thus been finished in an incredibly short time for this country.</p>
                        <p>At the Continental many improvements and additions have been carried out daring the past three months, the most important being the erection of a Largo electric lift which will accommodate eight or ten persons, and the enlargement of the hall next to the bar and billiard room, where the evening concerts, so much appreciated daring the winter, take place. Mr. Klingler, the manager, will return from Europe in the first week of next month, when Mr. Braun will take a short holiday previous to taking up the management of the Hotel d’Angleterre in November.</p>

                            <p>Judging from present appearances the com-ing winter season promisee to be quite as brilliant, if not more so, than its predecessor, which was a record one. Already applications for rooms are being received by each mail and both Mena House and the Hotel d’An-gleterre will re-open in November. In Cairo two new hotels, the National and the Khedivial, are also opening their doors for the first time, so that there will not be the same crash this winter, as was experienced the last, when numbers of tourists were kept up the Nile for weeks for want of accommodation. From New York the news comes to the Anglo-American Nile Steamer Co., that it is expected that the number of American visitors to Egypt next winter will be greater than that of any previous season. Even at this early date thousands of tourists from all parts of the United States have made arrangements for the journey. Clark’s famous cruises, inaugurated four or five years ago, have already been organised for the coming winter and most of the berths have already been booked for the first trip of the well-known ocean leviathan Arabic, one of the steamers chartered for the annual cruises to the Mediterranean and Egypt The river steamer Viotoria, of the Anglo-American line, has already been engaged to run between Cairo, Luxor, and Assouan in connection with the above cruises. The above should prove good news to the hotel proprietors and many others in the capital who profit so largely from the ever-increasing tourist traffic from Europe and America.</p>
                            <p>A local contemporary has, however, been drawing upon bis imagination, in stating, two or three days back that in consequences of the unusually heavy demand upon the passenger accommodation of the P. &amp; O. and Orient-Pacific liners daring the winter months caused, by bookings for Egypt and India in connection with the forthcoming royal visit to the latter country, both these companies were going to doable their sailings from next month. Neither the P. &amp; O. agents nor Messrs. Thos. Cook &amp; Son have received advice of any such intention.</p>

                            <head>THE KASR EL ALY PROPERTY.</head>
                                <p>A correspondent writes:— The history of this property is an interesting and forcible illustration of the almost phenomenal rise in the price of land for building purposes that has been going on in the best parts of Cairo within the past year or two. The Kasr el Aly property formerly belonged to the mother of the Khedive Ismail and consists of 200,000 square metres of land, having frontages on the river and the fine road leading to the Kasr-el-Aini hospital and Old Cairo, and is situated in close proximity to Kasr-el-Donbara, the most aristocratic quarter of the city. Some five years ago a group of American financiers were in treaty, through the Bank of Egypt, for the purchase of the estate at £85,000, but on hearing of it Prince Ahmed Kamel got a relative to exercise his right of pre-emption, and the Tribunals having found the claim valid, the property was bought by the Prince at the above figure. Two years ago a Belgian syndicate made an offer of £150,000, which was refused, the owner asking only £10,000 more, which the syndicate declined to give. Now the property is in the market once more, the enormous sum of £400,000, or £2 per square metre, being demanded. The estate will no doubt gain by the erection of the new Nile bridges from Old Cairo to Rodah Island and Ghizeh and, compared with the prices some lots are fetching in the vicinity, even this sum does not seem exorbitant, for suitable building sites in the favorite localities are becoming rarer every day, in consequence of the extraordinary extension the metropolis is taking in the westward direction.</p>

                            <head>THE BOULEVARD ABBAS.</head>
                                <p>The new boulevard that is to run the whole length from Kasr-el-Nil to Gamrah Bridge, a distance of about three kilometres, will be one of the finest drives in Cairo when completed, and will cost £25,000. The work, which was begun in April has been finished as far as Pont Limoun station and the other and more important part will be commenced in November, when several of the clubs established on the right bank of the canal will be pulled down and removed to the left bank, the British Recreation Club being the last to go. From the new museum to the railway station, the boulevard will have a width of no lees than 120 metres, and there will be on the left side separate tracks for cyclists, carriages, and pedestrians, and a garden, whilst the portion from Pont Limoun to Gamrah bridge will be narrower, so as to provide room for the new electric railway that is to join the Abbasaieh Oasis with the city, and which will termina'e at the Daira Khassa buildings in the Avenue Bonlao.</p>

                                <p>In enference to our correspondent C. A.’s letter, which we published in our issue of the 6th inst, we are requested to state that the remarks therein contained are incorrect, that C. A’s telegraphic application for a reserved 2nd class compartment on the 7-9 a.m. train only arrived five minutes before the departure of the train in question, and that such applica-tions mast be made at least an hoar before the train leaves. Secondly, that the statement that the Alexandria station authorities wired back confirming the reservation of a compartment is not correct, and thirdly, in answer to the statement that no compartment was reserved for ladies on the 3.45 train on the 6th inst., that a whole carriage was reserved for Sidi Gabor where an empty ladies compartment might have been found by the author of the letter with little difficulty, had he troubled to look about him or addressed himself to the proper authorities at Sidi Gaber station.</p>

                        <head>THE SULTANS’ ACCESSION.</head>
                            <head>CELEBRATIONS AT BEYROUT.</head>
                                <p>An Egyptian eye-witness gives us the following interesting description of the fetes held at Beyrout in honor of the anniversary of the Sultans’ accession : - This morning Beyrout emerged in festive attire to celebrate the anniversary of its Sovereign's accession to the throne. Everywhere in the highways and even in the narrow bazaars of the old town you could see childish, unpretentious attempts at decoration, in the form of primitive triumphal arches, and festoons of flowers and verdure, palm and laurel branches, and whole pine-trees stuck into the ground along the roads, while,crowning all this, waved the Turkish flag with the Crescent and the Star staring out of the background of blood-red. Apart from the illuminations at night and the usual abundant flying of flags, there was no offical display properly so-called, and it is perhaps this that brought out into stronger relief the charming and simple spontaneity of the town’s festive expression of joy. The gaiety of the populace is very shallow and very easy to stir. I have seen this fete celebrated in Beyrout several times, and what used to mar the beauty of it was the insolent arrogance of the teeming crowds of the lower Moslem classes in the streets and the squares. This year the feeling did not seem to me to exist, with the odious obtrusiveness of former times. Is a sane spirit of brotherhood at last developing between Christians and Moslems : If I am no visionary, and this spirit does now exist even though in a germinal form, a great measure of credit is, I think, due to the present Vali. On the whole he exercises an influence for good. He shows the spirit of benevolence on his face, but he has also shown it in his acts, by the way in which he has been stamping out the spirit of fanatical intolerance and savagery of the mob. I will give an instance. But lately two Christians were fighting with each other, when a Moslem riding by recognized in one of the youths an old acquaintance of his, and, prompted by friendly feelings, dismounted to part the hot-headed fighters. But these were so obstinate that he had to use a little violence to separate them, when the ungrateful youth, in whose interest the Moslem had intervened, —at least this is the Moslem version-turned round and dealt the latter a few fatal stabs. This immediately determined a demonstration on the part of the Moslem rabble, who gathered in reckless bands bent on vio-lence. The scene of the murder was the jewellers’ bazaar, and fearing, as on former occasions, the failure of the force of the law, the jewellers immediately  closed their shops. But this fanatical outbreak was forthwith quelled, thanks to the energetic and timely measures taken by the Vali. On the succeeding nights clandestine attempts at vengeance were made by some bad spirits, and one of the notables of the town, while driving with his wife at night along the barracks thoroughfare was shot at several times, by a man armed with a revolver but happily without effect From that oft-trodden highway, the barrack road two steep, crooked, and dark lanes lead down to the bazaar that bisects the old town from north to south, and these dark lanes have always served as hiding places and safe retreats for nocturnal miscreants, besides being very convenient short outs for the inhabitants of the neighbourhood, which is exclusively Moslem. Well, the Vali with admirable cour-age had both these issues of crime blocked up by walls of masonry. One wall has since been palled down, bat the credit for the initiation of such a fearless act on the part of the Vali remains, and if measures prompted by an enlightened and equitable spirit are carried out, but not maintained it is because this is unfortunately  in the order of things in Turkey. Was it not also due to the enlightened spirit and sincere concern in the town’s welfare on the part of the Governor, that the arrangement was finally  made between the Municipality and the Beyrout Water Company. The latter now undertakes the watering of the streets, and does the work with English thoroughness and punctuality. The work is of course, still susceptible of much improvement, but, as the director has remarked, unless the municipality be prepared to pay for a high standard of efficient work, matters will be maintained at the present mediocre state. As it is however, the service done to sanitation is very great The people of Beyrout now breathe air instead of air and dust, and as one remarked “the days of Just are happily over for Beyrout."</p>
                                <p>This is a long digression, and I must now return to the fete. The Vali received in the vast reception hall of the Seraglio between tad 10 am., all the military, civil and ecclesiatical dignitaries, as well as the members of the different consular corps, and the affability and easy grace with which he per-formed the function was admirable. The Commandant of the barracks and the Mushir of Damascus, who happened to be here on the day of the fete, received in state, at the same time, at the reception hall of the barracks. At the Seraglio, the military hand played martial airs and waltzes all the while, adding a note of gaiety to the festive occasion. At about a Quarter to ten in the morning the Vali re-paired to the barrack, to return the congratulations of the Commandant and dignitaries, and by all the high the spot where	founded in com-memoration municipal hospital anniversary. The memoration of the laying of foundation a very solemn one, and was attend-ed by a very distinguished crowd, including the different consular corps. After refreshments were served—and they were very welcome at that hour of the day, rendered doubly hot by the glare of the burning sand that stretched inimitably away on three sides—and the performance of the traditional ceremony of the immolation of sheep and the distribution of their flesh to the poor, followed by invocation for the preservation of tbe sacred person of his august Majesty, the Vali stood up, and on the foundation stone gave the three traditional hammer- beats, when a huge huzza from the crowd burst out accompanied by the loud notes of the band.</p>
                                <p>At the barracks during the reception an aged officer entered, and, after a humble salaam, tendered the Mushir Hakki Pasha an imposing looking document, which the Mushir reverently kissed and touched his forehead therewith, in token of extreme respect and gratitude, and then delivered it back to the grey-bearded officer. The document apparently contained an announcement of the Saltan’s pleasure in conferring further honors on a distinguished and loyal servant  of the throne, possibly by the promotion of his grade.</p>
                                <p>At the further end of the hall at the barracks stands a lifesized portrait of the German Emperor in imperial costume and full insignia, said to have been presented by his Majesty on the occasion of his last visit to Syria. At both receptions one could not help noticing the marked attention and cordiality with which the German Consul was received, and the fact is fall of political significance. German influence is insinuating itself into the political life of Turkey with systematic and studied assiduity. The German Consul converses with the Mushir in Turkish with apparent ease and fluency, and this alone flatters the Turk's amour-propre, and establishes a sort of fraternity between him and the German, who in the meantime does not confine himself to the domain of platonic sentiment, but exploits his generous host with consummate skill and the fatal scientific thoroughness of the Teuton.</p>
                                <p>At night the Seraglio and other public buildings, including mosques and some of the churches, were lit with gas and oil-light decorations while bumbler illuminations on private buildings and the highways, also lent their share to the general brightness. These, with a crowd of men, women, and children in Arab gar, formed occasional glimpses of picturesque effect. What a superb sight Beyront would present with her queenly position,—the classic Mediterranean at her feet and the, stately Lebanon as a solemn imperial guard around her—what a superb sight, I say, she would present beneath the magic touch of the artist and decorator, lavishly patronised. Perhaps, however, her narrow, tortuous, and filthy streets give her a peculiar exotic charm, which appeals so strangely to the distant dreamer and artist who would selishly denounces the intruduction of modern methods with all their benefits and blessings into a classis land, because they jar on his dream of the mystic path. </p>

                        <head>NOTES FROM PORT SAID,</head>
                            <head>THE CHATHAM FLOODED</head>
                                <p>(From our Correspondent).</p>
                                <p>Port Said, Thursday</p>
                                <p>The S.S. Clan Cumming which collided with the Chatham close to Raz-el-E h arrived here this morning from the canal, and appears very slightly damaged.</p>
                                <p>The latest news which I have been able to gather about the latter ship is that the Canal company’s huge pumps have succeeded in completely flooding the holds of the vessel thus rendering the enormous quantity of explosives on board her quite harmless. The vessel is now practically awash, I understand, at least round her forward decks, and she is to be secured with heavy chains so that she may not slide into the navigable channel</p>
                                <p>There is a passage on one side of the ship which up to the present has been utilised solely for daylight navigation. Ships peas the vessel either way, it appears, tad have done so since yesterday evening. </p>
                                <p>The real cause of the accident is a matter of doubt, conflicting rumours are heard everywhere and apparently it will not be discov-ered for some time.</p>
                                <p>One cannot say too much about the way the matter has been taken in hand bv the Canal company, the chiefs and men all working as they have done with a complete disregard of danger, and it is undoubtedly owing to this real pluck and bravery on all hands that the danger of a great disaster has been averted. Had the vessel not been flooded it once there is no question but that falling spars and timbers would have causes an explosion, which for the seriousness of its results would have been unparalled, for the entire commerce of the world through the Canal would have been interrupted for an unknown length of time.</p>

                            <p>The streets of Port Said are once more becoming thronged with passengers bound eastward and for Egypt. By every mail numbers arrive, Who leave as rapidly by the trains for Cairo and elsewhere.</p>
                            <p>The much improved service of trains which we now have; since the taking over of the line by the government, in a measure does a certain amount of harm to the local business, for whereas in the days of the steam tramway a couple of years ago, passengers remained here frequently some time, they now depart for other towns, possessing greater attractions, in as short a time as possible.</p>
