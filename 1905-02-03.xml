                    <p><placeName>LONDON</placeName>February 2. The “Daily Telegraph” learns from
                        St. Petersburg that as a result of an interview on Monday with the Minister
                        Yermoloff, and on his earliest representations, the Tsar signed a case
                        demonstrated a Russian Magna Chart. This directs M. Witte, as President of
                        the Committee of Ministers, to further extend the reform laid down in the
                        Ukase of the 27th December last. It orders that the people shall be invited
                        to co-operate with the Government, leaving M. Witte to determine the manner
                        of such co-operation. It commands the restoration of order throughout the
                        Empire by peaceful methods, and the' pensioning of those who were made
                        orphans or cripples on the 22nd ult. The Council of Ministers afterwards die
                        caused the new situation, M. Witte throwing the whole weight of his
                        influence on the popular side. It was decided to release the captives’
                        to-day, and to free the Press. General Trepoff is to be sent to Manchuria
                        later. A representative council is to be created in a fortnight.

                        and to adopt measures in order to prevent their recurrence. M. Witte, whose

                    <p>The Italian Consular Court at Alexandria was crowded this morning on the
                        occasion of the demand of M. Attilio Ninci, commercial director of the
                        Societe des Sucreries et de la Raffinerie at Alexandria, for a separation
                        from his wife Olga, nee Constaufiaides, on the grounds of her adultery with
                        Judge Constantine Dimaras. President of the Hellenic Consular Court at
                        Alexandria. M. Ninci was represented by Maitre Colucci and his wife by
                        Maitre Colucci. M. Ninci sat by the side of his counsel but the lady did not
                        put in an appearance. He went on and endeavoured to show that, if the Court
                        should grant a separation, it should be pronounced on the grounds of the
                        misconduct of both husband and wife. Counsel then argued that no such
                        separation should be accorded, as M. Ninci had condoned the offence by
                        agreeing to be reconciled with his wife after he had ascertained that she
                        had committed adultery. Counsel cited an article of the Code applicable to
                        such a case. He insisted that in any case should be granted, and then
                        proceeded to read further correspondence from M. Ninci to his wife from
                        which he deduced the conclusions : That the husband was a man of utterly
                        depraved tastes, that he had maltreated his wife, that he had neglected her
                        when ill and in every way had by his callous conduct to the sin of his wife,
                        who had only succumbed to the Judge alter having been grossly neglected
                        during her illness by her husband. After the reconciliation at Helouan
                        marital intercourse had been resumed, M. Ninci returned here, but as soon os
                        be knew that the Judge had come back to Alexandria, on accident occurred in
                        consequence of which M.Niuci returned to Helonan aggressively maltreated his
                        wife. Reconciliation was now impossible and counsel concluded that both
                        husband and wife were equally to blame and said that it was the wife who
                        made a complaint to the Consulate and asked for better treatment or judicial
                        separation. It was only that M. Ninci brought the present case. Maltre
                        Colucci rose to reply at 12.30 p.m., but the further hearing of the case was
                        postponed until 4 o’clock this afternoon.</p>

                    <p>The outward Egyptian pilgrimage this year ended practically yesterday with
                        the departure of the Khedival Mail Line's S.S. “Fayoum” from Suez. The
                        Khedival Mail Line has this year instituted the plan of shipping the
                        Egyptians separately from the foreign pilgrims. This system has received the
                        approval of the Government. A correspondent writes on the subject of the
                        Mahmal theft:—Thirty thousand pounds is rather a Urge sum to send to Mecca
                        and Medina. Does it all go with the Mahmal? If so the thieves at Abbassich
                        were merciful the amount is so considerable that I should think it might be
                        made the basis of a bargain whereby in consideration of its continued
                        payment annually the Bedouins should cease from massacring and pillaging
                        unoffending pilgrims. Surely some such terms might be arranged with a view
                        to putting on end to present and prospective perils. Under existing
                        circumstances we are putting a premium on crime and outrage.</p>

                        eleventh dynasty, one of whom possessed the hawk-name Ra neb bapef-t (t),
                        and the other that of Ra a., betep. The last-named, at any rate, is a
                        Mentohotep, as is probably the first. Both are, perhaps, to be identified
                        with names found in the tablet of Kamak; but in any case the final t in the
                        first name requires explanation.</p>

                        1892, attracted much attention, and was recognized not only as a profoundly
                        interesting book but as an admirable treatise on one of the most vital
                        subjects of our foreign policy. The “Business of Travel," a book in which he
                        displayed tho rise of Cook, was an excellent exposition of the modem

                            Wednesday last. The R.M.A. soon got down to work, scoring two goals in
                            the first two minutes of the game. After this, however, the R. Berks
                            carried all before them, scoring three goals in rapid succession and
                            adding another in the second half was of a very even character, and both
                            side played a good game. Result: R Berks, 4 goals, R.M.A. 2 goals.</p>
                        <p>R. Berks Regimental Team vs. St. Andrew’s. These teams met on Saturday at
                            Mustapha. Saint Andrew’s won the toss, and elected to kick up the field.
                            The opening stages of the game were confined to midfield, but the
                            superior combination of the regimental platers soon brought them into
                            the “Saint” Andrew’s territory, and the defence had some anxious moments
                            in consequences. Play was again transferred to midfield, and
                            occasionally the visiting forwards would get away, but were always weak
                            at finishing. A series of corners looked dangerous for the Saints, but
                            they eventually cleared. A little later, however, Hutton got through the
                            defence, and put his team one up. The Saints tried hard to draw level,
                            but at half-time the score remained:Regiment 1- Saint Andrew’s O.
                            Playing downhill in the second half, but with the sun against them, the
                            Saint hoped to reduce the lead, but everyone seemed to fall away in
                            disappointing fashion. The game throughout this half was really only a
                            case of shooting for goal on the part of the Berks, who were all over
                            their opponents, Jossy scored the second goal shortly after the restart
                            and a third came from the foot of Hill a few minutes later. Still the
                            Saints were unable to find their bearings, and it was not until late in
                            the second half that they managed to get within range of Adam. Cowie
                            tested him but he saved well, and it was no surprise when Haber and
                            Josey got well away, and the last named finished by scoring a fourth
                            goal for his side. Saint Andrew’s could do nothing after this, and
                            retired defeated by four goals to nil.</p>

                    <head>INFANT MORTALITY IN EGYPT</head>
                    <p>To the editor of the Egyptian Gazette. Sir, Your leader entitled “What is
                        needed” is a brilliant and vigorous defence of the Government’s non pass
                        policy, but I scarely think that it finally disposes of the questions
                        discussed. To me it is neither conclusive nor convincing. I cannot pretend
                        to view with the writer in dialectical skill, through it is easy to point
                        out several factors which his argument fails to notice. In the first place,
                        he leaves out of account the climatic conditions here, which are infinitely
                        more favorable to life than those existing in England, for instance, where
                        we have eight months of winter and the rest not infrequently of rain.
                        Statistics show that the death rate there amongst infants is largely due to
                        diseases occasioned by the inclemency of our climate. There is another point
                        which he leaves out of consideration, and that is overcrowding in our great
                        cities. The evil of overcrowding in Cairo and Alexandria cannot be compared
                        in extent to that of London and Liverpool. Furthermore, the English mother-I
                        speak of her because she is best known to me-is quite as careless, if not
                        more careless, of her infant than the Egyptian in the matter of feeding. It
                        is a common thing amongst the poorer classes in England for infants to be
                        reared upon fried fish washed down. Whatever the native mother’s faults may
                        be, she does not give her infant to quiet its fractions moments. Yet,
                        despite inclement climate, overcrowding, and gin, the rats of infant
                        mortality is considerably lower in England than in Egypt. I therefore
                        maintain that something can be done and should be done to arrest the
                        excessive mortality amongst infants in this country. I am not very sanguine,
                        I confess, that my words will meet with any response from the authorities,
                        who seem far too engrossed in farming brilliant budgets to give heed to the
                        warnings. I am etc. Humanity</p>
