                        dying, but the schoolmaster (the quack and the honest man) is still
                        “abroad." The dangers of quack drugs and of quack doctors are so glaing, we
                        feel " the smart so nearly, that their day is short They stand condemned by
                        the very loudness of their voioe; but the pretended schoolmaster pipes in

                        For the philoso phy of education we liave in these harried days no time, but
                        the secoud annual report of that interesting educational experiment, the
                        Viotoria College at Alexandria, deserves some consideration aud we have
                        published the report in full in to-day’s issue. A perusal the report brings
                        to mind a recent article in the Paris “Figaro” entitled “L’Usine britan-
                        nique," frem the pen of the Baron Pierre de Coubertin. “The British Factory”
                        is a title which Daturally suggests a discussion of labour questions; bnt
                        the iugenuous reader who may have begun his perusal of this parti­cular
                        article under the influence of that sug­gestion will speedily have found
                        himself mis­taken. M. de Coubertin, a Frenchman who evidently has something
                        of the likiug tor, aud knowledge of, KugUnd that Mr. J. B. C. Bodley has
                        with regard to Franoe, meant something quite different His “British Faotory”
                        is the English public school, and the preoise cause of his artiole in the
                        “Figaro" was a recent pnblio utteranoe of Dr. Peroral, Bishop of
                        Hanford,</p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p>and sometime Headmaster, successively, of Clifton aud Rugby. Not to many men
                        is it given to preside over two of our great public schools, aud that reason
                        alone would suffice to command very special attention to what Dr. Percival
                        may have to say. The ex-Headmaster com­plained of the poverty of the
                        intellectual results attained by the English public schools, and declared
                        himself convinced of the necessity ol a total reform of the system of
                        instruction which at present prevails in them. To put tbs case shortly, Dr.
                        Percival thinks that too much attention is paid to the development of brawn,
                        and too little to that of brain. Now, here comes in, precisely, the peculiar
                        interest of the views of M. de Coubertin. A French writer, imbued,
                        presumably, with the theories embodied in the dreary educational system of
                        the French “Ly- c,” might have been expected to adopt with enthusiasm the
                        “flannelled fool" and “muddied oaf’ theory, and to have but scant sympathy
                        with a system which makes the "games master ’ an important factor in public
                        school life. But not at all. M. de Coubertin has the root of the matter in
                        him, and he sees clearly that Tho­mas Arnold, to whom he pays au eloquent
                        tribute of admiration, was right in regarding the supreme end of publio
                        school life to be, as the Prenoh would put it, not Cinstruction, but /
                        education. Arnold, says M. de Coubertin, evolved out of a state of chaos
                        “uno usine de force sooiale"— a factory of social energy, which energy was
                        to be used in the service of the nation and the Empire.</p>
                    <p>If we are not much mistaken, this French­man has “touched the spot." In a
                        masterly passage he describes how the “graud peda­gogue” “created school in
                        the image of society, and made school life the first chapter in social
                        life.” M. de Coubertin sees clearly tho great gulf which divides the
                        English* from the Con­tinental school. The English public school is a-
                        microcosm—the Contiuental school is merely a cramming shop. Why I What is
                        the difference! The difference is that the English system teaches
                        responsibility—the other does not. An English pnblio school, with its
                        various out­lets for energy, its games, its debating society and other
                        societies, its school magaxiue, and its large liberty within reasonable
                        limits, gives a lad a foretaste of the part he will play on the larger stage
                        of life, and teaches him to play it. Above all, there is that pecnliarly
                        English institutiou, the prefecional, or monitorial, system which, in return
                        lor oertain privileges, makes the head boys of proved authority aud
                        charaoter answerable tor the good conduct and the wellare of their juniors.
                        “I should bo very sorry," says M. de Coubertin, "for the Englishman who
                        “should be blind enough not to perceive that "such institutions are not ouly
                        the glory^l his “school system, but form one ol toe founds- “tions of his
                        prosperity.” Such au education, when applied to those capable of receiving
                        it— and to those who are incapable of receptivity all education must be
                        useless—is, as he ad­mirably puts it, "un apprentissage de la liberty.” That
                        is not to say that no improve­ment is possible in matters of detail ; mdeed,
                        it is obvious that headmasters must be con­stantly on the watch for weak
                        spots in the system, as revealed to them iu the ever-shift­ing light ol
                        social and intellectual progress. But, broadly speaking, the public school
                        sys­tem is absolutely healthy, inasmuch as it coincides with, and expresses,
                        that political and social system ol ordered freedom under which Englishmen
                        live, and inculcates those lessons of responsibility which give English­men
                        their unique capacity for ruling.</p>
                    <p>Whatever changes Dr. Percival would like to see, we caunot believe that he
                        would desire any essential alteration of the publio school system. “Nobody
                        in England—among those whose opinion oounts’’—says M. de Coubertin, "seeks
                        to destroy that. Nobody wants to borrow from the Coiitiueut its scholastic
                        prisons, iu arbitrary discipline, iu meihoti-- of distrust aud elpionnage."
                        Tba^ is so; but we esteem it a high Vsompliment to\hear it from a foreigner.
                        The public school system has, no doubt, the defects of its1 qualities; but
                        iu qual­ities are a national asset of which to be proud. We ought,
                        therefore, to be gmleiul to a foreign publicist who pays spontaneous tribute
                        to a peculiarly English institution.</p>

                        <p>London, 7th January.</p>
                        <p>Port Arthur has fallen, and so have Russian Stocks—had it not been for
                            the efforts of in­terested parties Russian fours would now be below 90.
                            There were reports on ’Change this morning to the effect that the coming
                            loan of £25,000,000, mentioned in our last, is to be postponed ; there
                            is no doubt that the financial strain is making itself severely felt,
                            and if the struggle in the Far East is continued much longer, the
                            resources of more than one of the Powers will be required to prevent a
                            serious falling away from present prices. The latest news as to the
                            coming issue is to the effect that Russian financial authorities have
                            decided to reduce the amount asked for in Germany to £16,000,000 — no
                            doubt at the instigation of those who have undertaken the burden of
                            finding the money. The bait to the under­writers is a substantial one,
                            namely 4 1/2% com­mission, in other words, they get the stock, which it
                            will be remembered carries interest at 4 1/2%, at 90 1/2, the issue
                            price being 95. As regards the prospects of peace, we are assured that
                            these are better to-day than they have been for some weeks past. The
                            Russian people want an honorable peace and are beginning to make
                            themselves heard in earnest. France is moving heaven and earth to help
                            them to this end, and all the other great Powers are ready to lend a
                            helping hand, so if the various Russian factions can only settle their
                            differences it will not be long before the last gun in Manchuria is
                            fired. The markets since the New Year have been somewhat disappointing.
                            Dealers had one and all made up their minds we were to see a good
                            recovery all round, and a large number had backed their opinions by
                            buying stock dur­ing the last account of the year. This professional
                            speculative buying is in itself a weak factor when outside business is
                            on so small a scale as it has been of late. Another point tending to
                            check any upward movement is the fact that Germany was a heavy seller
                            during the early part of the week of speculative stocks in gene­ral and
                            Kaffirs in particular. This may be accounted for by the feeling in
                            Berlin as to the forthcoming issue of Russian stock referred to above.
                            Egyptian stocks have kept clear of the general dull tone and there has
                            been a sharp recovery in price under the lead of National Banks, which
                            were as high as 24 bid early in the week, and are now 4 $ buyers.
                            Agriculturals are firm again at 9 7/8 buyers, and Daira shares are
                            almost up to 22. Salt and Soda took a fresh start yesterday at 2, and
                            look strong again at that figure. Delta Lands have recov­ered to 3 1/2
                            premium The buying comes from your side and it looks as if Egypt were
                            trying force prices against London, but there is no to open Bear account
                            here although there is not much stock about. The shares of the
                            Corpora­tion of Western Egypt—dealings in which have commenced since our
                            last — have been in fair demand at 5/8 @ 3/4 premium, but the market is
                            only a nominal one involving negotiations if it is a question of more
                            than a few shares. Egyptian mining shares are dull again with Kaffirs.
                            Their definite recovery depends for the present on the activity of the
                            mining section generally. Nile Valley close at 2 1/4 buyers and United
                            Africans at 1 3/4, with not much doing in either.</p>

                    <head type="sub">THE INQUEST ON MR. BENSILUM.</head>
                    <p>The inquest on the late Mr. A. Bensilum was continued yesterday morning at
                        the British Consulate, Cairo.</p>
                    <p>Herz Bey, called as a witness, took the oath and stated that the deceased was
                        employed in his office from early in 1897 to November 29, 1904. Deceased was
                        an architect working under the Bureau du Comite des Monuments Arabes.
                        Witness had been ill, and alter returning from Helouan on the 26th November
                        last, found a letter from deceased tendering his resignation. He knew of no
                        reason for this. He had received two letters from the deceased in which he
                        excused himself for non attendance at the of­fice, giving various excuses,
                        followed by a formal letter of resignation. He saw the de­ceased, who gave
                        no reason and merely said that he was going to Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>Questioned by the jury, witness stated that he bad not been altogether
                        satisfied with de­ceased's work, and quoted several cases in which he had
                        been forced to reprimand him for omissions and negligence of orders. On the
                        last occasion deceased said he would comply with the spirit if not the
                        letter of his in­structions. He had previously written to Dr. Sierra, an
                        uncle of the deceased, more than once. On this occasion, when he returned to
                        the office, which had been in deceased’s charge during absence of witness,
                        certain things had not been done, and the clerks said they would resign if
                        deceased was put in charge again. After bringing deceased’s conduct before
                        the committee he wrote to Dr. Sierra, saying that he wished to speak to him
                        about a relation. In reply to the question as to who it was, contained in
                        Dr. Siena’s answering letter, be wrote and put the facts before him, but on
                        receiving deceased’s letter tendering his re­signation he wired to Dr.
                        Sierra to consider witness’s second letter as null. His report to the
                        committee and complaints to Dr. Sierra could not have been known to deceased
                        before be gave his resignation. Deceased’s salary was L.E. 22 ; he began at
                        L.E. 13.</p>
                    <p>The jury brought in a verdict of suicide from despair, on which Mr. Alban,
                        who was presiding over the inquest, asked them to consider whether deceased
                        was compos mentis or not when he committed suicide.</p>
                    <p>The jury retired for consideration and gave a verdict of “suicide while
                        deceased was not responsible for his actions, owing to despair at his
                        non-success in his profession.”</p>

                        there is every prospect of a successful future before the company.</p>

                        <p>The Sirdar, Sir P.R. Wingate, K.C.B.,D.S.O., has just completed five
                            years in command of the Khedive's troops, but it has been ruled that his
                            case does not come under the provi­sions of the Royal Warrant. Be that
                            as it may, it is certain that his removal from the head of the Egyptian
                            Army would be a great mistake, and the Army Council was well advised in
                            sanctioning his continuance in command.</p>

                            regret by all ranks, for he has ever been popular with his subordinates
                            and superiors, anno domino being his only enemy. His field services, we

                            So far as is practicable the officers will be transferred to other
                            regiments. On the other hand, the establishments of the King's Royal

                        <p>Yesterday's races deserved a better attendance, for though the weather
                            was rather raw | in the morning, in the afternoon the wind fell and the
                            weather remained quite warm till about 5 p.m., when a little rain fell.
                            Lord and Lady Cromer and Lady Beatrice Thynne were present at the races
                            and among the other spectators were Major-General Slade, C.B., Coles
                            Pasha, Mr. Webb, C.M.G., Lady Rogers, Mme. Adolphe Cattani, Hon. and
                            Mrs. Davey, Mr. Rumbold, Mr. Higgins, Col. Aylmer Johnson Pasha, Mr. P.
                            Machell, Mr. P. de Martino, Ishak Bey Hussein, Omar Bey Sultan, and many
                            other well-known residents. Visitors were curiously scarce.</p>
                        <p>The racing gave some very good finishes, especially in the 4th and 5th
                            races, which were excellently fought. In the 4th race Fitz only just
                            beat Mizzaud, while in the 5th Starboard Light showed remarkable staying
                            powers, just getting home past such good horses as Sir Visto and Latiff.
                            A very unfortunate accident happened in the 2nd race, Saleh Bey Cherif's
                            new horse, Sans Pretention, stumbling and breaking its off foreleg while
                            rounding the turn. Khalil Pasha Khayat again did well and got two
                            firsts, while Mr. Tueni’s Voyageur, though he, as usual, failed to win;
                            ran quite well and was 2nd in the Novices’ Stakes. Mr. Sursock and Mr.

                            the corner Latiff was ahead, fol­lowed cloeely by Aeolus, Miasr, and
                            St-Frusquin. In the straight Latiff increased his lead and won by 2
                            lengths. Aeolus was second, Miasr just getting in third ahead of St

                            dispossessed by Chinaman. Near the corner Voyageur, who had been lying
                            back, came on strongly but could not catch Kawkab, who won by a good
                            length, Chinaman just beating Rais for third place.</p>

                    <p>'.Tho material progress made in Egypt (lyr iugtbo lost twenty years, bus
                        certainly been remarkable.” So wrote lord Croiuer to the Martinis of

                        condition if Egypt and the Sudan. And the accuracy of the statement-will, I
                        think* l>o amply b .me out by the far-seeing financiers whose uauic- and
                        reputation* are so closely identified with the advance of this highly
                        favored territory. wLioh may now be regarded as within the coniines of the
                        British Empire. But satisfied »> Lord Crouier undoubtedly is with the past,
                        he looks forward to still more ambitious develop meals, and does not
                        hesitate to tell its thnt "a far greater degree of prosperity is attainable
                        in. the future.” Naturally, however, with so vain able a possession very
                        special core must betaken nottio launch out too quickly or without due
                        consideration. A false step at this stage might mean, if not disaster, at
                        any rate-a set-back. Accordingly we find Lord Cromer insisting on the utmost
                        care being taken not to embark on auy schema involving heavy expenditure
                        until all the facts connected with tile matter are fully examined anddi
                        cusa-'.d. N»one acquaint-, ed with Egjpt is likely to find fault with this

                        country, there is no intention of allowing things, to stagnate, aud as soon
                        as Lord Cromer is convinced of the neces­sity and the feasibility of any
                        project} he does not hesitate to advise the Egyptian Govern1 meat to adopt a
                        policy of financial baldness in the direction of spending capital. This was
                        the coofse pursued iu the construction of the Nile reservoirs, aud the same
                        plan was! followed, with respect to the Suakin-Bexber Railway.. A similar
                        policy has ..Vky*'ien adopted with regard to the many, demands' yor mi*ing

                        ThatLotUCromer has experienced no small difficulty in attain­ing both these
                        objects will be easily understood, And that be has done sods a further proof
                        of his great power as art administrator. Not only have the interests of the

                        handicaps profits. For instance, he fully recognises that so highly a

                    <p>lugoldsby.</p>
                    <p>In the tint number of the new publication, •Urieut and Occident," a short
                        notice of which appeared in the “Ga/etto’’a tew days ago, there was printed
                        an abstract of an address given on “The Drink Question in Egypt.”</p>
                    <p>Now 1 have been thinking, since.living in Egypt, that the country is
                        fortunate in having no serious problem in. that direction to grapple with.
                        That it is not, so far, an urgent question is admitted in the address
                        referred to, for the speaker expressly stated that crime resulting from
                        drunkenness is so infrequent as not to be separately tabulated in criminal
                        statistics,—a very satisfactory state of affairs indeed. Why then bring the
                        question into prominence at the present time 1</p>
                    <p>The answer to this was that one should take warning by Murthero Europe, and,
                        by the adoption of preventive measures, guard against a similar state of
                        things in Egypt coming abotft. Methods to insure this were suggested, and
                        here it is that important considerations present themselves.</p>
                    <p>It needs but a short residence in Egypt to convince the most casual observer
                        that excess in drinking here and in England are two quite different things,
                        aud that while in Ureat Britain the evil is one with which it is difficult
                        to cope, in Egypt, if you could eliminate one or two drinking sections aud
                        the immoral classes, there would be little ground for the temperance
                        reformer to work on.</p>
                    <p>This, 1 think, is mainly to bo attributed to the lar greater facilities that
                        pemde in this country possess for purubas^ getfa liquor, either m 'mail or
                        large qtyjbttties anfthe almost total absence of tbjl public-lion^ bar,
                        where a false appetite aud^raving is Educed by the sale ot inferior aud
                        hdulUya^SI liquor.</p>
                    <p>No doubt inferior liquor is very often sold in Egypt, but the opportunities
                        for purchasing smalt quantities of, say, the best Scotch whiskies and
                        Coutipenta! brandies at respectable grocery aud provision stores, aud of
                        consuming wine, beer, aud spirits under reasonable conditions, must greatly
                        teud to keep down the drunkenness that would, I ieel sure, ensue if English
                        licensing laws and brewers’ control of me trade took the place of — the
                        freedom given in this country, aud public houses replaced the open-air
                        cates.</p>
                    <p>It somewhat amused me to notice in passing the wiudow ot a lngti-class
                        stationer's shop a group ol bottles ol brandy marked “Occasion, B.T. 1»,
                        "although it is as good au illustration ot the liicilitles ottered tor tlic
                        purchase of alcoholic liquors as oue'could wish to hud. Vet one seldom,
                        iHiver, sees a drunken mau in the streets of Alexandria '</p>
                    <p>So in the advocacy ot temperate habits out here, there does not appear to be
                        the need ot enforcing the prim^ple of total abstineuce that is, in so many
                        casts in England, the ouly real cure for thet^nl ot intemperance. Nor should
                        the tempera'*) man who is not a total abstaiuer bo the mark tor the
                        temperance relurmer.</p>
                    <p>For by the evidence he gives that it is possible to use what he, at least,
                        considers to be; the good things ot life without abusing them, lie enforces
                        the lesson ol moderation in a manner that would carry much greater weight
                        with many people than if he placed himself under restriction "fur the sake
                        of example.'</p>
                    <p>In saying this I am dealing with the question t’r uii an abstract aud
                        general, rather than an individual point ot view, entirely omitting the very
                        moot point as to whether a moderate consumption of alcohol is. or is not,
                        harmful to the constitution. 1’ossibly it is harmful to some,</p>
                    <cb n="1"/>
                    <p>but at tho same time it may be beneficial to others, and it mast be left to
                        the individual to be guided by his own experiences. My own go to show that
                        after beiqg a total abstaiuer for some 8 or 9 years, I tiud that now a
                        little light wi::o daily is good.ibr me.</p>
                    <p>But that doesriiot hinder me from advocating teiuppwncifpnnciples, or in any
                        way lessen my seiise of tho evils of excess. Seeing, therefore, that in
                        Egypt we have no workhouses, prisons, and lunatic asyliims^half-filled with
                        victims of drink, and (that no symptoms of national decadence from that
                        cause are as yet apparent, 1 am iuclincd to the opiuion that tv total
                        abstinence crusade, or even the dissemination of teetotal literature just
                        mow, would do little if any. real good.</p>
                    <p>As regards the natives, the question stands on an entirely ditfeVent footing.
                        While such a powerful bjdy a» the ChurcB of England Temperance Society
                        upholds the strictly moderate use of alcoholic liquors, the Koran, on the
                        other hand, positively torbids their Nuse by all Mobawedaiis, aut^ it should

                        sauction tho drinking o. wines, beer, or spirits.</p>
                    <p>But good . people who seek to proselytise should bear in mind that if they
                        win over the Moslems to the Christiau faith, they will place in their hands
                        a' book that contains the words- “Take a little wine for thy stomach’ sake,”
                        an(^they*might find themselves "on the Boms of adnamii^:'’</p>
                    <p>Like all griat questions, what is known as the temperance one wauts lookiug
                        at from more than one point of view, and not only as regurds drink is
                        temperance necessary, but equally in respect to eating, smoking, and other
                        things that are carried to excess by many people who arc immaculate on oue
                        given point. Sometimes a tendency is shown to</p>

                        Cauai Company-, at its annual meeting in June, will be informed of a new
                        tariff, reducing the dues by 3d. a ton.:</p>
                    <p>Whether made voluntarily, or thrown as a sop to shipowners, the Reduction
                        will be very welcome ; aud wo hope it may bo followed by frmhef/oues. it is
                        true that a rate of 8s. 9d., charged when the Canal was opened, will, it the
                        news be accurate, have fallen alter June 16 6s. 8d. ; but there is a
                        widespread and very reasonable tceling that the Canal has too much the
                        aspect of au international convenience to be made a source of great profit
                        to shareholders. Certainly cheap rates would be of mure advantage to British
                        trade than any other ; and soon tho opening up of the Far East may make the
                        matter urgeut. The leading malcontents point out that at the conference ol
                        British shippers convened by the late M. de Lesscps iu 1833, the Company
                        pledged themselves to a live-penny reduction of dues for every lucrease of
                        dividend by 1 per cent.; and the reduction now contemplated lias been
                        delayed a year. That is a smalt matter. The Canal should be wider and
                        cheaper; and whether the shipowners’ project of a duplicate channel be
                        carried out in rivalry or otherwise, something bold must soon be done.</p>

                        1904, makes the following remarks on Egyptian cotton:—. The variations in
                        the price of Egyfcjian cotton have been, of course, determined in iome
                        measure by the course of prices in Amfepcan cotton, and we havo seen that

                        differences in the relation of >fie to the other have been nevertheless,

                        good fair Egyptian was a trifle more than l£d. Daring the summer months the

                        to produce Hue count* of American turned in some cases to Egyptian col on.
                        During tbo last mouth or two, howeypr. he difference widened again, and is
                        now ab it 3d. per lb. Tho Egyptian crop of 1904-3 peem i likely to be
                        something of a disappointment. The previous crop was 6,508,947 cantors, Aid
                        with a itook in Alexandria on August 31 f 409,000 cantors and good acoounts
                        ot the ne’ crop low prices seemed probable. The estimi tee, how-r, have

                        Egyptian speculator* has be in assigned in some quarters as the chief ca se
                        of the high prices, and a further resdft to s mrt time, by spinners is
                        suggested. The'ftBe of Egyptian cotton has naturally decreased, and w ire it
                        not that some of the spinners of the c immoner counts of Egyptian have been
                        able I > turn to American counts' the particular brar ;h of the iudustry
                        would have been in a ver difficult position. Prices of Egyptian cotton!
                        have, or course, fallen id Correspondence with American, and though during

                        demaid. And while, on tho «ne hand, Egyptian coiton has sometimes the effect
                        ot casing thl higher grades of American, Surats are more closely related to
                        the lower grades. ’ It seems hrobuble, however, that with a full supply of
                        American cotton the East Indian crop will nof seem '*a matter of first-rate
                        interest to Lancashire'spinners, but reports of both quantity an| quality
                        seem fairly good. The Continental demand is expected to be ouly moderate
                        this season, and most indications point to low prices. The year’s experience
                        seems to show, howeVer, that Indian cotton may be a valuable auxiliary,
                        especially to a short American crop, ahd those who are interested in it
                        believe thai -Indian cotton has a great future before it. There is not

                        year, of course, various small subsidiary supplies due to the energy of the

                    <head type="sub">MR. COOKSON’S POEMS.</head>
                    <p>Egypt has inspired the best of the hoe ms in I, this little book, and our
                        readers will'not, we hope, blame us if we confine ourselves |u far as
                        possible, in this review, to verses that deal with . things which we all
                        havo seen and kndw. The 8phinx, the Nile, the sights afid bounds of Egypt,
                        are all familiar to us, and vdrse that makes them its subject has a more
                        gcheral interest. And soma of Mr. Cookson’si verse is very good, though
                        there is a certain 'timidity in handling metres ap(>arent in parti of the
                        Egyptian section and in much of thd rest or the book. To begin with
                        criticism of the manner -well, to our thinking, there is not enotagh variety
                        of metre; in the first section all but two of the poems are written in tljO
                        sonnet form or in the short 8 : 6 quatrain,/which always seems to us to be
                        suitable only foetbe simplest possible descriptive verse. But for the last
                        verse with ita neediest/ classical commentary—which woald have hien bottler
                        there, if there at all, as a prose footnpte—the 'Egyptian Pastoral1 is a
                        most successful example Oi the sort of picture which be described in this
                        metrical form ; there la no complexity about it, and no action, merely a
                        group by the water side, a glimpse of / still life' in the silence and
                        warmth of a /calm day. But the •Kite above the City/thoogh itoontains one nr
                        two right good lines, seems to us to fail in ! description. We have/a series
                        of pictures of the street life of Cairo but they lack connection. Each verse
                        contains one' feature of Cairene life, perhaps Wo, and the result is not I a
                        picture but a series of cinematoscopio views: the sliort;lined quatrain does
                        not lend itself to enumeration. Homer and AHlton wrote catalogues, but the
                        one used the hexameter and the . other stately decasyllabics.</p>
                    <p>‘Sails on the Nile’ and ‘The Mwerrin’ arc in blank verse and the latter shows
                        v, great deal of power, although tho constany use of the dash gives an
                        impression of jetwinoss at the first reading, which one modifies at tbo
                        second time. 'Sails on the Nile’ develops a pretty thought skilfully and
                        gracefully, but a metrical error, almost-in the middle to?,, inclines tho
                        reader who has an ear towardWwjustice.</p>

                    <p>Now for the other verse/; the three lyrics for music are well written, and
                        '8leep, sleep, my darling, sleep’ with / 'Roses, roses, red and white’ are
                        really graceful aongs,</p>

                    <p>but the verses in the short quatrain all through | the book are not strong,
                        and reveal the fact I that if you choose this metre you must be almost
                        timorously careful in your choice of j subject and your phrasing; otherwise

                        afraid of letting himself go, and to describe n yon must dare—if your
                        descriptions are to i impress. There is abundance of descriptive I ( power
                        here, but it lias not been called out to its j last reserves,andtho
                        impression that these poemi | ( might give is that of an elegiac talent
                        unwilling _ to borrow anything from narrative or cpio, ( and so just foiling
                        in the vigour which the ( best descriptive verse or prose never lacks.</p>
                    <p>Wo have insisted too strongly perhaps on some of the weak points in Mr.
                        Cookson’s volume. We have felt much pleasure in read- : ing it, and we hope
                        that the author will soon give us another series of verses on things
                        Bgyptihn. If we have devoted a good I deal of spaoe to criticism—well, are

                    <p>Bien que lo marché de* valeur* n'ait juta présenté cette semaine la même
                        animation quo la semaine dernière, cependant le nombre des affaires a été
                        fort satisfaisant eu égard à la saison des fêtes que nous traversons.
                        Certaines valeurs, outre autres la Sait &amp; Soda, les Nun- govich Hotels
                        la Daïra et la Banque d’Athènes ont mémo donné lieu il d'importantes
                        transac­tions. Les petits spéculateurs ont beaucoup contribué fi refroidir
                        le marché : ayant pour la plujjçY* réuasi, lors de la récente débâcle, à
                        consàrver leurs titres, ils n’attendaient qu'une Occasion pour s'en
                        débarrasser. Aussi, en re­voyant les anciens prisai sw*^l empressés de
                        réaliser. D'autre part^ rie mateAÇ, de Londres a été plutôt calme en ÿi qui
                        concerne les valeurs égyptiennes, ce qu'i* faut attribuer au manque d'ordres
                        d'achat pro pliant d'Éiÿpte. De plus, les cotons, qui restent ' '* * niveau
                        très bas, commencent à influencer quelque peu les titres fonoiers, bien que
                        d'une manière générale, ainsi que nous l'avons dit précédemmeut, la
                        corbeille des valeurs soit désormais à peu près indépendante de celle
                        des'cotons. Tout cela, réuni aux fêtes du premier do l’an, est peu fait, on
                        en conviendra, pour donner de l’entrain à la corbeille Uue constatation des
                        plus intéres­santes à faire o’est que les opérations &amp; terme, qui, il y
                        a un mois environ, avaient atteint d'énormes proportions, ont presque
                        totalemeut disparu de notre place Le mouvement en a bien souffert quelque
                        peu, mais encore faut-il se féliciter de cet heu roux changement On se
                        rappelle, en effet, que, grâce à co. opérations à terme, on assistait fi la
                        fin de chaque quinzaine et de chaque mois à des liquidations très
                        laborieuses, se terminant le plus souvent en ventes forcées, aussi
                        nuisi­bles â la place qu'aux spéculateurs eux-mêmes- La BSnque Nationale a
                        débuté ferme à Jlj, mais n’a pu, en raison de fortes ventes, se main­tenir
                        àce prix. Elle fléchit le 12 â 24 l 1 G,pour reprendre en clôture à 24 1/8
                        acheteurs. La demande est excellente. Ou fait circuler dans le public
                        dytferses rumeurs de distribution d’ bon dividende, mais oelui ci ne peut
                        être connu d'une^açon précise et officielle avant la pro­chaine assemblée
                        générale. On a remarque cette semaine que la demande se portait
                        spéciale­ment sur la Nouvelle Emission qui reste tou­jours de 7 8 au dessouâ
                        de l'ancienne. L'Agricole a été très ferme durant toute la semaine entre H*
                        1 10 et Ut I S. Les transac­tions ont été nombreuse^. En Delta Light on a
                        fluctué de 14 1 2 à 14 5/8 pour clôturer il 14 9 16 acliet» Deferred a

                        D'importantes transactions ont eu lieu. La hausse de cette valeur a été
                        déterminée par une demande de Londres qui a soudainement cessé. Le cours a
                        aussitôt réactionné. ( >n attend des détails sur la prochaine émission pour
                        savoir k quoi s'en tenir. la Daira Banieh a été en grande faveur pendant
                        toute la semaine. Elle débute à 22 1/16, atteint 22 5/16 et clôture il 22 1
                        8 ache leurs. On a échangé 5 à 6,000 titres. Après avoir ouvert très ferme

                        auquel elle est excessive­ment ferme. La distribution prochaine d'un bon
                        dividende contribue k retenir le prix. Le cours de la Cassa di Scouto et di
                        Rispar mio monte de 243 &amp; 250 pour clôturer à 248. Cette hausse est le
                        résultat de la prochaine émission qui doit avoir lieu le 6 février prochain.
                        Délaissée au début il 49 1/2, LBehera at­teint graduellement 50 1/2 et 51
                        acheteurs en clôture. On s'attend d'ici peu il un mouvement ' sur cette
                        valeur. En attendanl les affaires res tent clairsemées. La Wardan Estate
                        monte de 7 1/2 à 7 3/4 acheteurs. Les Tramways d'Alexandrie ont aussi été en
                        faveur durant cette semaine. Ils fluctuent de 143 1/2 k 145 les Privilégiées
                        ot de 370 il 381 les Dividendes et clôturant respectivement li 144 et 370.
                        Les recettes sont do plus en plut florissantes. La semaine finissant le 7
                        janvier montre une augmentation de 17,548 P.T. sur la semaine correspondante
                        de 1904. Très soutenue également la Ramleli Railway à 8 1/4, avec toutefois
                        peu do transactions. Ici l'augmentation des recettes est plus sensible
                        encore que sur les Tramways ; elles atteignent 81,894 P.T. contre 65,729
                        P.T. Tannée dernière pour la semaiue finissant le 7 janvier. Les Markets
                        débutent k 23/6, atteignent 24, pour retomber en clôture il 23/9. Les
                        recettes pour les 9 jours finissant le 31 décembre sont de 625 LE. seulement
                        oontre 1,065 L.R. l'an­née dernière. La différence entre les 2 exercices est
                        maintenant de plus de 12,000 LE. à l'avan­tage de l'année passée. Lot Kanx
                        Alexandrie et celles du Caire ont.</p>
                    <p>été plutôt délaissées, les premières £ 15 ï)8 et les secondes entre 1,105 et
                        1,115. Elles clôtu­rent respectivement &amp; 15 15/16 et 1,110. La Spinning
                        and Weaving Ço. a donné liea à d'importantes transactions. Plus do 10,000
                        titres ont été échangés. Le oours est monté de i27/32 à 31/32 pour clôturer
                        à 29/32 en excel- Mills restent calmes à 7/3 ache- Les mnigovicli Hotels
                        aocusent une forte hausse sur la Semaine dernière. A 9 3/8 à l’ou­verture,
                        ils atteignent 10 1/16 et clôturent à 10 acheteurs. On attribue cette
                        amélioration à deux causes principales, d’abord à la saison des touristes
                        qui est très brillante cette année et ensuite à la rumeur de la fusion des
                        Nungo- vich Hotels avec les hôtels Baehler, (Shepheard et Ghezireli Palace).
                        L’Anglo American Nile a suivi la hausse des Nungovich. Elle passe de 4 13/16
                        à 5 1/16 pour finir demandée il 5. Elle montera encore si nous nous eu
                        rapportons aux bénéfioes crois­sants d’une saison excessivement brillante.
                        Lus actions privilégiées Khédivial Mail ont donné lieu à une petite demande
                        à 3 3/4. Les Ordinary Shares sont à 11, cours purement .nominal. Los Ciments
                        d’Egypte sont demandés à 109. Par suite de réalisations los actions des
                        bras­series fléchissent, celle de la Crown Browery de 220 k 216 et celles de
                        la .Brasserie des Pyra­mides de 133i k 126. Très forte demande sur les

                        fermes à 300J. La Nile Cold Storage est demandée à lj. La Corporation of
                        Western Egypt a donné lieu il de fortes transactions entre 1 7/16 et TÜ 16.
                        On s’attend à ce que cette valeur qui n’a pas encore été sérieusement lancée
                        sur le marché d'Alexaudrie y soit bien accueillie. La Sait and Soda a été la
                        valeur la plus eu vue cette semai uq. Elle a débuté il 43/6, fléchi .le U à

                        42.9 vendeurs. Le cours avait atteint hier dans la matinée 43 1" 1 2 à la
                        suite des nouvelles de LondreB. Malheureusement la plupart dos spéculateurs
                        qui avaient attendu de connaître le résultat de l'assemblée pour se
                        débarrasser de leurs t:ti - ont profite de l occasiou et la valeur a
                        réaction- ne de 43, lu 1 2 il 42 9. On s’attend, aussitôt cette liquidation

                        additional privilege of provoking the attention of watchful critics. it may
                        be assumed that it is alive and doing »..rk in the world. .In the full

                            as the earliest day on which the school could, be re-opened. As that

                            the year must be brief. The work continued on the lines already- laid
                            down. A fourth form was constituted, and it should here be stated for

                            the word “form” or bench corresponds to the expression “year” in use at

                            first form is accordingly the lowest, euid not the .highest in the

                            t attempt a somewhat more ambitious programme. The difference in
                            knowledge between boys in the first and fourth form will best be grasped
                            by a reference to the scheme (p. 23) which presents in tabular form a
                            conspectus of the work done throughout the school. From a very humble
                            beginning in the first form, (in which h»w-ver it is claimed thut solid
                            foundations are laid, and in which boys should if possible begin their
                            school life) the work reaches u quite respectable level in the fourth
                            form. The subjects taught included all those of last year with the

                            to the boys before the school broke up. Especial mention must be made of
                            the excellent work of G. Valassopoulo, M. Antonius, G. Antonius and E.
                            Harle in the IV. Form, of A. Nimr, F. Stent, R. Tuby in the HI. Form,
                            and of J. Lascaridis in the II. Form. Solid work was also done by some
                            who were not so fortunate as to win prize*; among these may- bo
                            mentioned in the fourth form form S. Checri and U. Prangi ; and in the
                            third form J. Tuby, A. G. I’saltis and E. Cordahi, all of whom</p>
                        <cb n="2"/>
                        <p>worked steadily throughout the year. On the whole the results obtained
                            were ver^ encouraging to the masters. In French the boys did
                            particularly well under M. Dumont whose methods and discipline have won
                            the approval of those most competent to judge. In English the progress
                            of almost all the boys was (it is no exaggeration to say) astonishing.

                        <p>the headmaster is not yet qualified to speak. It is therefore with all
                            the more satisfaction that he is able to report that in the opinion of
                            Sheikh Abdul Aziz Shawiah, who is now assisting the Professors of Arabic
                            at Oxford, the standard reached in Arabic is remarkably good, especially
                            in consideration of the fact that to so many of the boys Arabic is a
                            foreign tongue. The headmaster wishes to take this opportunity of
                            thanking Sheikh Mohammed Hamed, who has succeeded not only in teaching
                            those to whom Arabic is their mother tongue but also in inspiring
                            others, to whom it is an exceedingly difficult aqd at first even a
                            repellent language, with a desire to advance beyond the threshhold. The
                            thanks of the Committee are also due in an especial degree to Sheikh
                            Abdul Aziz Shawish for his kindness in putting the boys of the third

                        <p>As supplementary \to work in school, which is necessarily restricted in
                            its scope, everything |(ossible has been done to encourage the private
                            reading of the ptipil.s. However much a master may help a boy by his
                            teaching, the boy, ifv’properly directed, can. Jo much more for himself.
                            But in order to read profitable books it is necessary to have access to
                            a library. Victoria College is still in .its infancy, and a school
                            library does not yet exist. Something however in the way of creating one
                            has been done by the boys themselves and something has been done by
                            their friends. In last year's report mention was made of lending
                            library, rendered possible in the first instance by grfta from the
                            National Bank and Mr. Alderson. This year the headmaster has the
                            pleasure to record further gifts and donations. The Earl’ of Meath, to
                            whom the school is also indebted for a Howard Vincent Map and a dummy
                            rifle, very kindly presented a copy of 'Milner'* England in Egypt, and
                            among other gifts there were £5 from, an anonymous donor and £10 from
                            Dr. Morrison, who in this and in other ways has proved a very generous
                            friend to the school. The lending library now numbers over 200 volumes
                            and possesses many useful books of reference. It is pleAsant to be able
                            to state that the' latter arc in constant requisition, and it is to be

                        <p>Out of school the boys had their time well occupied with games and
                            drill—too much time it has been complained by some. But in the opinion
                            of the headmaster, who on this subject errs, if error it bo, in good
                            company, long school hours defeat their own object. Boys, discouraged
                            bj/tho teaching of lessons which seem to have no ejtd, allow their
                            attention to wander in school, while (out of doors they lose their
                            natural aptitude for play and exercise. It has been said of the Japanese
                            soldier, that when ho is not energetically and cheerfully at work, he is
                            energetically and cheerfully at/play. This is an ideal which with some
                            other manly virtues wo may well borrow from that gallant People. The
                            very important work of supervision again fell principally upon Mr.
                            Mustard and Mr. I/owjck, who once more undertook the duties of drill
                            instructors, entering very heartily into a difficult, and sometimes
                            discouraging work. In this they were materially assisted by two of the
                            senior bdys, T. Checri,</p>
                        <cb n="4"/>
                        <p>and A. Vorny, who developed into two smart corporals. The two companies,
                            as last year, had the honour of lysing inspected by the Earl of Meath,
                            who with Iauly Meath visited the school in the Spring, It .was
                            encouraging /to the instructors to bo informed that since the last
                            inspection there had been a very marked" improvement. The thanks of the
                            Committee are due to Mr. Mustard and Mr. Lowick not only for acting as
                            drill instructors, but also for undertaking again the supervision of the
                            playground and the omnibus, duties which, entailing no little sacrifice
                            of personal comfort, have contributed very much to the efficiency of the
                            school.</p>

                        <p>The games, that important department of a boy’s life, have grown into a
                            serious institution. Hockey found its proper place in tho season which
                            intervenes between football and cricket, though these two games, as in
                            England had the larger number of partisans. At football the school XI.,
                            not flying at the highest game, escaped defeat, and at cricket a new
                            departure was made. Thanks to the kindness of the Alexandria C. C.
                            represented by its captain Mr. T. H. Marsden, and its Hon. Secretary Mr.
                            F. G. Freeman, the boys were able to play once a fortnight on the
                            excellent ground belonging to the Club—a privilege which they thoroughly
                            appreciated. Mr. Marsden and Mr. Freeman did so much to make the cricket
                            of the school a success that the warmest thanks of all are due to them
                            and also to another enthusiastic member of the Club, Mr. F. W. Carver,
                            who presented the school with £20 to be devoted to games. The money has
                            been spent on two asphalt pitches, which it will be possible to use all
                            the year round. The balanco which remains will also be laid out on
                            improvements in the playground, possibly in the purchase of iron
                            stanchions and a rope to enclose the football ground and mark out a
                            running track.</p>

                        <p>Although it has not been thought necessary to describe at length the
                            routine of the school year, it would not bo right to pasx oyer without
                            mention the incidents which most strike the imagination of the boys. To
                            the visit of Lord and Lad.v Meath allusion has already been made. The
                            school was also honoured on April 28th by the visit of Lord and Lady
                            Cromer, aocompanied on this occasion by Mr. and Mrs. Gould, and received
                            on behalf > of the Committee by Mr. Alderson, Mr. Kingham and Mr.
                            Preston. The visit was especially interesting to everyone as this was
                            the first occasion on which Lady Cromer had had the opportunity of
                            seeing the school, since the foundation stone was laid. Lord Cromer as
                            usual made a very close inspection of the boys and of the buildings. His
                            criticisms were brief and to the- point. “The boys," he said, “looked
                            happy and the playground bare.” The headmaster has reason to believe
                            that Lord Cromer was pleased witja the intelligence as well as the
                            'appearance of the boys and ho may perhaps be allowed to repeat that the
                            Committee has good reason to be grateful for the interest which Lord
                            Cromer has constantly shown in the school. Again and again ho has been
                            assured by pareuts that to them there is no Jbetter guarantee of the
                            usefulness of the school than the visits of Lord Cromer and his
                            reference to the school in his annual Reports.</p>

                        <p>It must not be supposed that the headmaster in speaking of the success of
                            the school so far is unaware of the weaknesses which exist. But with the
                            means at tho disposal of the Committee everything possible has been
                            done. The Kindergarten recommended last year has been built and the
                            circular announcing its' proposed establishment has had a most
                            encourag­ing response. It is ndt, however, yet certain whether it will
                            be possible to open the Kindergarten at all, and that for two reasons:
                            first, because among the applicants are many little girls (the question
                            immediately arises to what school can they go when they have passed/the
                            Kindergarten age 1), and secondly because Victoria College itself is
                            full. The entries this year number 54 and tho building intended for the
                            Kindergarten provides tho only classroom into which it is possible to
                            overflow. To what has this success been due 1 Partly to the
                            enoouragement and Bupjwrt to which reference has already been made,
                            partly to the admir­able position of the school by the sea, to the well
                            arranged classrooms and spacious playground (which the Committee has so
                            wisely enclosed), and partly to the fact that English education for boys
                            and girls is called for throughout the country with no uncertain voice.
                            For two years the masters have worked hard and cheerfully for the good
                            of the school. The future is not in their hands. In tho brief sketch
                            which follows an attempt has been made to show where in the opiuion of
                            the headmaster this future lies.</p>

                        <p>An Englishman, if he were asked what he thought uost characteristics of
                            tho institution peculiar to his ountry, would perhaps reply that it was
                            their power to stand the test of time; and if he were further esked to
                            give a reason for this vitality his answer might be that English
                            institutions based upon the bed­rock of experience and susceptible of
                            modifications as the nature of the case required, had possibly not yet
                            attained the limits of their natural growth. The truth is that profiting
