                    <head>England's Cotton Industry</head>
                    <p>It is comforting to learn that one of the two</p>
                    <p>great dangers which have been assailing the cotton-industry of England and
                        placing it in such a critical situation has, for the moment at any rate,
                        been averted. We refer to the strike which was threatened by the workmen’s
                        demand for a five per cent increase of wages and by the masters’ refusal to
                        accede to their request A Reuter’s telegram received last night from
                        Manchester, however, informs us that the conference which was convened by
                        the Lord Mayor has effected a compromise, by which the operatives are
                        conceded a bonus of five per cent for twelve weeks, and neither side is to
                        take any action before March of next year. The question therefore remains
                        un-decided and is only temporarily shelved, but it is to be hoped that when
                        the alloted time has expired, the two interested parties will be able to
                        establish a more effective and more lasting agreement An open rupture
                        between the cotton-spinners and the operatives would entail an enormous
                        disaster, for not only would it render millions of spindles idle, and
                        necessitate the loss of employment to thousands of workmen, but thousands
                        would suffer along with them, and the bread would be taken out of the mouths
                        of their wives and children, who have no share in the decision of those upon
                        whom their lives depend. A strike of such magnitude would of necessity cause
                        acute suffering and immense loss, especially in the great industrial and
                        thickly populated centres of Lancashire, while it could not fail to have, in
                        a somewhat lesser degree, a disastrous effect in many other centres not
                        directly connected with the cotton trade. The temporary settlement cf the
                        difficulty is therefore a great blessing and gives one ground for sub-</p>

                        permanent ly removed. </p>
                    <p>Unscrupulous speculators constitute the other great danger to the
                        cotton-industry of England. How grave is this outside danger from
                        speculative rings, is made clear by the anxiety of the International
                        Federation of Master Cotton Spinners and Manufacturers’ Associations, which
                        hurriedly convened a meeting at the end of lost month, feeling that common
                        and immediate action was necessary "to counteract the pernicious effeot on
                        the trade, brought about by the late enormous enhancement of the price of
                        raw material” by speculative syndicates. These rings are now paralysing the
                        industry in almost as pro-nounoed and as complete a fashion as was the case
                        a few years ago. We are inclined to think that the only way in which English
                        spinners can free themselves from the ever-tightening grip of these
                        unscrupulous gamblers and “cor-nermen” is to give a greater support to all
                        projects for cultivating cotton in various parts of the British dominions,
                        and so become independent of American grown material. Such a scheme would,
                        however, have to receive far greater support than is at present being
                        accorded it, as under no other conditions could an British scheme
                        successfully compete with the growers of the Southern States America. Here,
                        however, Egypt comes to the help of England, for the cotton grown in this
                        country is steadily increasing in bulk, and it holds a foremost position as
                        regards quality. The European cotton industry is now, it transpires, engaged
                        on the average for a period of three to four months ahead, ample supplies
                        being available—sufficient, in fact, to more than meet demands. It is
                        therefore evident, that spinners can as a rule hold aloof from the markets
                        for that period, and in the majority of cases they certainly need not do any
                        buying before the end of October, by which time the new crop will be coming
                        to hand. For two months, therefore, gamblers may be left to “stew in their
                        juice” and “deal as best they can with the conditions to which they have
                        reduced the market.” Such an expedient is at the same time simple and
                        effective.</p>
                    <p>If the policy of “suspension” thus advocated be loyally and widely adopted by
                        cotton-spinners in Europe and America, it will at any rate obviate, as the
                        associations pointed out at their meeting, the danger of the next cotton
                        season commencing with the raw material at the abnormally high prices which
                        now prevail. Should the supply prove less than the demand, there will still
                        be opportunity and time to meet the conditions caused by a shortage. The
                        latest available figures are from the last number of the New York “Journal
                        of Commerce,” which on past prophetic efforts may be credited with
                        foreshadowing the true state of cotton affairs in the United States with
                        remarkable accuracy. The latest synopsis of that Journal makes out the
                        average conditions to be 75.4 percent, against its own estimate of 81.2 for
                        June and 84.4 last year. These figures contrast with the official estimate
                        for Jane, vis. 77 per cent and 84.4 per cent last year, and against 76 per
                        cent. on August 1, 1900, which was the lowest on record during the last 20
                        years on the same date. States covering half the total acreage provide the
                        lowest average, so that a general shortage is probable, though that hardly
                        implies a supply insufficient for the demand, inasmuch as the official
                        report published by the associations' meeting confidently states that the
                        surplus of last year's crop will guarantee a full supply, even in the event
                        of the next crop being small. The danger therefore which is to be feared
                        from the unscrupulous gamblers who form the speculative rings is not,
                        perhaps, so serious as it would appear on the surface, but at the same the
                        situation is sufficiently grave to cause considerable anxiety, and
                        thoroughly justifies any notion which may tend to safeguard the interests of
                        the industry generally from the pernicious influences of those who do not
                        hesitate to create “corners.” Let the cotton spinners therefore judiciously
                        refrain from making purchases before the arrival of the new crop, and by so
                        doing reduce to harmlessness the more acute symptoms which now threaten the
                        vitality of the trade.</p>

                        <p>St. Petersburg, August 18. The Tsar is to issue a manifesto to-morrow</p>
                        <p>which will be read in all the churches, granting a Constitution. He hopes
                            that the new Assembly will meet not later than the middle of January
                            next The manifesto confers on the Assembly a certain amount of
                            legislative power and financial control, but there are many
                            restrictions. The Autocratie power remains unchanged, and the Council of
                            the Empire will practically exercise the functions of a Senate.

                        further use of a well sunk beneath his establishment. Other wells will
                        probably be closed and filled by the authorities should their use be

                        by a large gathering of young people. The chief feature of the ball was a
                        Massinet pavan, which was danced by the children, who were led by the
                        inventor of the dance, M. Longhi. It was extremely effective and pretty, and

                    <p>The Ramleh Season.—From all accounts the present season at this favorite
                        summer resort promises to be an excellent one. Not only has the Casino Hotel
                        at San Stefano been almost continuously full up daring the past month or
                        two,but the Carlton, at Bulkeley, the Beau Rivage and the other hotels have
                        had a large share of patronage. Indeed, we believe that during the past
                        fortnight or so it has been difficult to obtain accommodation for large
                        parties at any of these hostelries. This satisfactory state of affairs is
                        doubtless due, partly to the abnormally hot weather experienced at Cairo and
                        throughout the country generally this summer, and in a great measure to the
                        new and frequent tram service inaugurated last year between Alexandria and
                        our favorite suburb. The unprecedentedly high receipts of the Alexandria and
                        Ramleh Railway Co. of late testify to the popularity of the new mode of
                        traction, which has been a great boon to both residents and visitors.</p>
                    <p>Shocking Murder.—A woman from a village in the Ghizeh province recently
                        brought an action before the Mehkemeh Sharieh demanding alimony from her
                        husband. The omdeh of the village, who was a friend of the husband,
                        prevented a legal seizure of part of his property. Nothing daunted, the
                        woman complained to the Markez authorities with the result that the Husband
                        and wife and the omdeh were summoned to appear there. The first two
                        returned, the woman did not reappear, and her mother and brother hastened to
                        send information of her disappearance to the Markaz. A search resulted in
                        the discovery of the women's body in a cotton field near Bimba in the Ayat
                        Markaz. A medical examination proved that she had been strangled. The Mamour
                        and the Substitute of the Parquet, who conducted the judicial investigation,
                        had no difficolty in discovering that the husband had murdered his wife, and
                        that the omdeh had acted as his accomplice.</p>

                        Italian Diplomatic Agencies at the corner of the Sharia Madabergh and the
                        Sharia El Manakh, two main thoroughfares of Cairo, for the sum of £48,000.
                        We are now informed that the property consists of 4816| square metres, so
                        that the price paid is as nearly as possible £10 for the square metre,
                        inclusive of the four residences on it which is considered a fairly moderate
                        price for the locality. The conditions of payment are £10,000 on the signing
                        of the contract, which was registered at the Mixed Tribute's on the 9th
                        inst, and the balance on the company obtaining possession of the property in

                        replacing them by a huge block of residential flats of the latest and most
                        approved style. It is interesting to note that this same ground was bought
                        some 28 years back by Mr. Raphael Suares from Barraud Bey, a former
                        secretary of the Khedive Ismail, for 36,000 francs, and the four residences
                        that were subsequently erected on it are said to have oust £6,000 more. The

                    <head>Notes from Suez</head>
                    <p>DETAILS OF FIRE ON BOARD SHIP.</p>
                    <p>(From our Correspondent.)</p>
                    <p>Suez, Friday.</p>
                    <p>As I wired you last night, the British steamer Gibraltar, laden with sugar,
                        was sighted from Suez at about 4 p.m. flying the signals N H (Fire, want
                        immediate assistance). By 5 o’clock she was in the bay and clouds of smoke
                        and flames were visible.</p>
                    <p>The vessel anchored before reaching her anchorage, owing to the engineers and
                        firemen being unable to remain in the engine room. Very shortly the raging
                        fiâmes completely destroyed the deck amidships, including saloon, cabins,
                        bridge, and part of the engine room. On the arrival of the Gibraltar,
                        several steam launches and steam water tanks went immediately alongside, and
                        the latter rendered valuable servîtes.</p>
                    <p>Great credit must be given to the chief officer and six men of the German
                        mail steamer, Prins Regent, which at once proceeded on board, and assisted,
                        at great risk to their lives, to put out the fire, the flames of which were
                        almost reaching the tops of the masts.</p>
                    <p>The ship’s crew after lowering the lifeboats did their utmost to save their
                        vessel, and finally, with the assistance of the Canal Company’s launch,
                        which possesses a powerful pump, extinguished the fire by 9 p.m. The damages
                        are apparently considerable, but it is not yet ascertained whether the cargo
                        is damaged or not</p>
                    <p>Later- The fire on board the S.S. Gibraltar has been completely extinguished
                        by now. The cause of the outbreak is attributed to the fermentation of the
                        sugar, part of which in the 'tween decks amidships has been destroyed by
                        fire and water.</p>
                    <p>The vessel before proceeding homewards, will have to be overhauled and to
                        have accommodation for the captain and officers fitted.</p>
                    <p>The fire broke out shortly before the arrival of the ship at Suez, and
                        suddenly the captain with the steward and a seaman were separated from the
                        rest of the crew, which was aft, by the flames amidships, and no
                        communication was possible.</p>
                    <p>A REMNANT OF BALTIC FLEET.</p>
                    <p>The Russian transport Kitai arrived at Suez yesterday from the Far East, and
                        entered the Canal in the afternoon bound to Liban. This vessel passed
                        through the Canal with the first division of the Baltic fleet, and
                        accompayed Admiral Rodjesvronsky's squadron until the beginning of the great
                        naval battle, when she managed to escape.</p>

                    <head>New Buildings in Cairo</head>
                    <p>Our Cairo correspondent writes.— "Building operations are proceeding in every
                        direction in the Ismaï ieh, Thewfikieb, Kasr-el-Nil, and other favorite
                        residential quarters of the metropolis, and the leading firms of contractors
                        and builders are, and have been for some months, fully occupied in erecting
                        new buildings in those localities. In the Ismailieh quarter, principally,
                        new houses are rising on every side, and the district opposite the Savoy
                        Hotel, formerly belonging to the illfated Banque Industrielle, and which a
                        few years back was a large open space, is now very nearly covered with huge
                        residential buildings. For the few sites left as much as £8 to £12 per
                        square metre is being asked, and the prices demanded in other choice
                        quarters are constantly tending upwards, so that soon the cost of land for
                        building purposes will become almost prohibitive. Amongst the new large
                        blocks of buildings now approaching completion are those belonging to the
                        Standard Life Assurance Co., the National Hotel, Daira Khassa in the Sharia
                        Boulso, and many others too numerous to mention in detail.</p>
                    <p>A Cairo contemporary pointed out, in a leading article a few days ago, that,
                        the craze for building in that city was being overdone, and said that the
                        probability is that, if not checked, it will eventually lead to something in
                        the nature of a crisis. I hardly agree with this opinion, inasmuch as I find
                        on enquiry that although numbers of new houses are being erected in the
                        favorite quarters, the supply has not yet quite overtaken the demand ;
                        since, in the majority of case, most of the apart ments in these houses seem
                        to let long before the buildings are even completed, and what is still
                        perhaps a better test whether the building craze is likely to overrun the
                        mark, is the fact that rents are still rising instead of falling. A case in
                        point is the new large block now under erection nearly opposite the National
                        Bank in the Sharia El Madabergb, belonging to the Coronel family, every
                        floor of which is already let, although the building, which was formerly
                        Intended for a hotel, will not he ready for occupation under three months or
                        so. The annual rents asked here were £180 to £220. according to floor
                        position, for apartments of 9 rooms, and at those prices no difficulty was
                        found in finding tenants."</p>

                    <p>the TRANSPORT Kitai.</p>
                    <p>(From our Correspondent).</p>
                    <p>Port Said, Friday.</p>
                    <p>The Russian transport Kitai arrived here from the Canal last night and now
                        awaits orders. It will be remembered that she was one of the fleet of
                        twenty-three vessels which formed the second squadron, and was also one of
                        those which flew the merchant flag, which fact accounts for her stay of over
                        three months in Laigoo. She, I hear, left the main squadron when it lay in
                        Kamran Bay. in company with a number of the colliers which are passing
                        through here daily bound for Russian parts.</p>
                    <p>THE TR00PS FOR THE YEMEN.</p>
                    <p>The total number of Turkish soliders who</p>
                    <p>have passed through here (bound for various parts in connection with the
                        rebellion in the Yemen) since 17th January last is 30,309, of which 2.300
                        have returned invalided. I understand that it is officially stated that
                        17.000 are yet to come, which will bring the total up to 47,809. These men
                        were carried by Turkish, Russian, and French vessels.</p>
                    <p>THE DREDGER PHARAON II.</p>
                    <p>The work of refloating the sunken dredger has received a check. Something
                        appears to have gone wrong with one of the lighters, which will probably
                        delay the work for a few days longer.</p>

                    <p>Lady Blomfield gave a very enjoyable "At Home” on H.H.S. Aida yesterday,
                        which was largely attended. Owing to the roughness of the sea outside the
                        harbour, the projected visit to the new Admiralty dredger, St Laurance, had
                        to be abandoned, the dredger coming into the port early in the afternoon,
                        but many of Lady Blomfield’s guests visited the dock and inner harbour in
                        the steam launch, and were greatly interested in all that they saw. The Aida
                        had been decorated for the occassion, the Customs Band played numerous
                        European and Turkish pieces with great vigour, and we need not say that Sir
                        Massie and Lady Blomfield did all in their power to implant a very pleasant
                        recollection of the afternoon in the memory of their guests. Among those who
                        were present were Graf vonWedeLM. Scottidis, Baron and Baroness Aotou, Mr.

                    <p>Yesterday Vice-Admiral Caillard and hii officers, the guests whom the nation
                        delight to honor, came to London in glorious sun shine, passed in
                        triumphant, if informal, pro cession to Guildhall, received a magnificent
                        and absolutely spontaneous welcome along a route of considerable length,
                        partook of the traditional hospitality of the City, drank of the loving cap,
                        participated in important toasts, and listened to appropriate speeches.</p>
                    <p>The keynotes of the day may be said to have been spontaneity, eagerness, and
                        inform ality : nor was it without its striking and significant moments, the
                        greatest of them, in the open air at any rate, being that at which Admiral
                        Caillard and his companions, gravely and without preliminary parade, mindful
                        of gallantry on both sides a century since and forgetful of bitterness in
                        the past, saluted, as the representatives of Republican France, the statue
                        of that Horatio Nelson who, with the Iron Duke, whose statue they had passed
                        a mile or so further back, had crippled the power of the First Empire of
                        France. That graceful act, which the crowd did not fail to notice, would
                        serve, even if it stood alone, to stamp the day as more than commonly
                        memorable. "Daily Telegraph.”</p>
                    <p>London's welcome is worth having, though we say it who, perhaps, should not.
                        With all her faults, and they are many, she still holds unique position
                        among the cities of the world, She is by far the greatest in size and
                        population, the greatest in riches and in commerce, if not in light, and
                        though not the greatest in historical tradition—that distinction must al
                        ways belong to Rome so long as history lasts yet still the greatest in her
                        sublime record of freedom and ordered liberty. If Admiral Cail lard and his
                        friends resemble almost all Frenchmen in possessing the historic sense, they
                        must have been charmed with the ancient ceremonies and observances of the
                        Guildhall, and charmed, too, with the noble building itself, which never
                        looks so regal, and splendid, and inspiring as when the well-filled tables
                        are set for civio hospitality. If they noted the monuments on the walls, and
                        asked whose valour or virtue they recorded, it assuredly did not pain their
                        ears to hear the names of Chatham, Pitt, Nelson, and Wellington. The walls
                        of the Guildhall pay eloquent tribute to the French wars of other days, and
                        to the achievements of the illustrious men who won great glory for Bug land.
                        The rivalry was prolonged and severe, but it was honorable throughout, and
                        the nps and downs of skill and fortune on both sides confirmed each nation
                        in its sincere respect for the courage and endurance of the other.</p>

                    <p>It is the desire of the English people to be really friendly with the French.
                        How such a revulsion in public opinion has been brought about is not quite
                        easy to explain. It is not only that the bad memories of the Napoleonic wars
                        have died down, but that the attitude of estrangement, which had survived
                        since the Crimean War, seems utterly to have disappeared One might almost
                        have thought yesterday that the English nation was quite content to forget
                        the thronging memories of Trafalgar and to drape the Nelson Column from
                        view, were it not for the singularly graceful compliment which the French
                        Admiral and his colleagues paid us on that historic spot. One by one they
                        rose from their seats and saluted the memorial of Nelson and his victories.
                        No more graceful international courtesy has ever been paid than this. It is
                        of a piece with that serenity of manners and perfection of taste which are
                        native to the now friendly people across the Channel. They partook of the
                        historic hospitality of the Lord Mayor, surrounded by a thoroughly
                        representative gathering, at the Guildhall. They saw the British nation
                        unbend, and that in circumstances which, as Admiral Caillard said, will make
                        the festivities unforgettable, and their recollection of them
                        ineffaceable.</p>

                    <p>This fact seems to us to stamp the festivities of the present week with a
                        note of peculiar significance. It is no mere form of words to say that the
                        French Fleet has come to Portsmouth as a messenger of peace. France happens
                        to have given hostages for peace by cutting down her naval expenditure,
                        while every other sea Power has been squandering millions on new
                        battleships. It is easy enough to talk about peace. France has done more.
                        She has ven tured something for it. Her statesmen, at any rate, cannot be
                        accused of adding to the burden of hypocrisies which weighs upon the
                        conscience of the world, by professing a desire for peace, and giving the
                        lie to such professions by incitements to militarism and aggression or by
                        joining in the wasting and futile com petition of armaments. In her resolute
                        avoid ance of causes of offence and her insistencies on retrenchment, France
                        has advised the world that her policy is dictated not by ambition or by
                        motives of vengeance, but in the interests of her own people and of the
                        cause of civilasation.</p>

                    <p>"The Times”</p>
                    <p>The Japanese have shown that, as we anti cipated, they are determined to
                        bring the negotiations promptly to an issue. No diffculties have been raised
                        as to the credentials of either side. No lengthy discussions have arisen on
                        points of form. When the repre sentatives of the two Powers met yesterday
                        morning the Japanese immediately opened the all-important business of their
                        mission. They had the peace terms which they are willing to accept, ready
                        drawn up in writing ; they laid the momentous document on the table of the
                        Conference, and Baron Komura proposed to consider the articles one by one. </p>
                    <p>When it has been presented we shall have some solid grounds on which to judge
                        the prospects of a settlement. It will reveal whether Russia is or is not
                        ready to accept the only conditions which Japan can safely and prudently
                        offer her. We believe that in essentials those conditions are irrevocably
                        fixed, though the Japanese representatives have neither stated nor implied
                        that their proposals must be accepted as a whole, and certain details may be
                        open to discussion. The terms of a peace acceptable to Japan are, in truth,
                        dictated by the situation itself. They must assure her immunity from Russian
                        aggression for a long period to come, so far as human foreeight can attain
                        this end. Upon this general principle she can admit no compromise. It is
                        better for her to resume and to prosecute the war in her present position of
                        advantage than to be exposed to the necessity of renewing the struggle some
                        years hence, when Russia will have had time to recover from the crushing
                        blows under which she staggers, and to organise her vast resources in men
                        and in material wealth for a fresh contest.</p>

                    <p>One of the most remarkable signs of the times is the simple fact that the
                        Pleni potentiaries who are discussing terms of peace can find no common
                        language which they can all understand. The Russian diplomatists speak their
                        own language and French, while the Japanese diplomatists have only learnt
                        English. The decision to conduct the negotiations both in French and in
                        English is therefore inevitable, but it presents obvions in conveniences. At
                        every stage the most accurate and delicate interpretations will be
                        necessary, and this will render the proceedings both cumbrous and liable to
                        misunderstanding. Hitherto, French has been accepted as the acknowledged
                        diplomatic language of the world. A French sentence can only mean one thing,
                        and its structure is so simple and direct that it lends itself admirably to
                        a lucid definition of a treaty or agreement.</p>

                    <p>The Tsar and his Ministers refuse to face of the situation, and employ
                        themselves in spinning fancies. We cannot help thinking that this method of
                        procedure has been exemplified all through the preliminary negotiations at
                        Portsmouth. Apparently the Russian action was all fair and above board. They
                        prodaoed their credentials at once, and seem to have made a grievance of the
                        fact that the Japanese held theirs back at the first meeting. As a matter of
                        fact the probability has been, all along that the Japanese delegates were
                        armed with greater powers, and were much more ready to talk business than
                        the Russians. The latter were conduit-pipes to convey the Japanese terms to
                        St Petersburg for the consideration of the Tsar and his advisers. Now M.
                        Witte states publicly that he is armed with full powers. But all these
                        public utterances of the chief Kasdan representative are to be received with
                        caution. They are all put forward with an object, just as M. Witte, by such
                        theatrical episodes as the kissing of the railway guard the other day, is
                        playing a part. He desires to impress on the American public the idea that
                        he is a simple, good-natured person of bucolic propensities. In reality he
                        is like a famous character in Dickens, “devilish sly.” All these apparently
                        innocent communications about Russia's intentions are merely so many kites
                        flown to see how the wind lies. It is a little unfortunate that M. Witte
                        should have succeeded so well with the American public. The Japanese are
                        much more reticent and repellent in their manner, although at the same time
                        more keen and businesslike.</p>

                    <p>It is not at all likely that either the Japanese or the Russian Government
                        would have gone so far as to send plenipotentiaries to a conference without
                        a clear idea of the results to be obtained on both sides.</p>

                    <p>The seems to be great danger that the conference between the representatives
                        of Japan and Russia will break down, through the incurable incapacity of the
                        Russians to look at facts as they really are. The popular idea that among
                        the terms demanded by Japan will be the cession of Saghalien and the payment
                        of an indemnity is probably correct, and if Russia goes into the conference
                        with the intention of "bluffing" her resolute foe out of her demands the
                        negotians might as well be broken off at once.</p>

                        from the humiliation of confessing defeat. Never was there a more mistaken
                        notion. If Russia were a con tended country with a population as loyal as
                        the Japanese, she might indeed hope to wear down her adversary, in time. But
                        she is not. She is seething with rebellion, and if the war goes on it will
                        not be a question of how long Japan can stand the strain, but of when
                        Tsardom will fall.</p>

                    <p>THE END OF THE SESSION, 1905. "The Times."</p>
                    <p>If Mr. Balfour’s tactical skill was less re markable than in previous years,
                        the dialectical ingenuity and persuasive oratory were as con spicuous as
                        ever, in no case more so than in his striking speech, in May last, on
                        Imperial de fence. It must be said that not all his own party agree with the
                        Prime Minister in the pro position, which is the keystone of a policy too
                        elaborate to be discussed in detail here, that a successful invasion of
                        these islands was " not an eventuality to be seriously considered. In the
                        Upper House there was an interesting debate on this subject, and Lord
                        Roberts has struck a warning note about our land defences which has
                        profoundly impressed the country. These searchings of heart were intensified
                        by the somewhat anarchical state of Army organisation, the numerous changes
                        introduced or announced! by Mr. Arnold-Forster, whether désirable or not,
                        having as yet entirely failed to crystallise into a coherent and effective
                        whole. The report of the commitee on South African Stores caused even more
                        disquietude. The naval policy of Lord Selbome and his successor was less
                        criticised, the redaction in the Estimates of three-and-a-half millions
                        being in part due to the removal from the "first line” of obsolete ships
                        with a view to increased mobility. Some uneasiness was produced by the
                        apparent indifference of the Government to the acquisition by a German
                        syndicate of a Welsh steam-coal field, the vaine of which is disputed.</p>

                    <p>Some of those members of the Party whose opinion most weight is attached were
                        anxious that the Prime Minister should treat the adverse vote as one of
                        confidence, and place his resignation in the King’s hands. This course would
                        undoubtedly have been followed by Mr. Balfonr if he had simply consulted his
                        own inclinations. Bat, as we have already explained, it would have been
                        exaggerating a very unimportant affair to treat it as a matter on which the
                        fate of a Government should turn. Moreover, the advanced stage which had
                        been reached in our negotiations with the Japanese Government, and the
                        somewhat anxious condition of our diplomacy in certain other respects,
                        rendered it highly inexpedience either to impose on the Crown the necessity
                        of changing its advisers, or to plunge the country] into the excitements of
                        a general election. In these circumstances, Mr. Balfonr decided, and Mr.
                        Chamberlain supported the decision, that Ministers should disregard what was
                        in itself an insignificant accident, and remain at their posts, in the hope
                        that they would receive a more diligent and continuous support from the
                        Party. This expectation has been generously fulfilled, and a Session which
                        many shrewd judges had believed mast be cut short by sudden disaster has
                        been conducted to its normal termination.</p>

                    <p>Does not the unanimity with which Germany fails to denounce the acts of her
                        Envoy, although they are opposed to the policy which she pre tends to
                        defend, indicate that Count von Tattenbach has only defenders beyond the
                        Rhine ? We do not, however, wish to express any doubt that the German
                        Government itself is foreign to the policy pursued at Fez. To imagine that
                        it does not disapprove of it would be to cast suspicion upon its good faith
                        and sincerity. But in this case it is an easy matter for it to bring the
                        activity of its Envoy to a close. The policy of Count von Tattenbach is
                        contrary to the clearly recognised interests of the Shereefian Empire, it
                        violates the truce implied in the agreement of July 8, it constitutes a
                        denial of the intentions loudly professed by Germany since the voyage to
                        Tangier, and, since it is in contradiction with the orders which the German
                        Government says it has given to its Envoy, it seems to us impossible that
                        the measures necessary to put a stop to it should not be taken in
                        Berlin.</p>

                    <p>"As I laye a-thinkynge."</p>
                    <p>Ingoldsby.</p>
                    <p>The hot, moist atmosphere of August in Alexandria is hardly calculated to
                        stimulate thought, and it was my intention to postpone for a few weeks
                        longer the writing of these notes ; but a very sad event which occurred a
                        few days ago seems to me to call for more notice than it has received, and I
                        should like to say a few words about it</p>
                    <p>I allude to the unfortunate occurrence by which the lives of two young and
                        promising officers of the British army of occupation were sacrificed, and
                        the death roll of drowning fatalities on the Alexandria coast increased to
                        10— all Europeans—within the last two months.</p>
                    <p>Captains Stokes and Carey, who only arrived from Cairo on the morning of the
                        day that proved to be their last on earth, after lunching at the Beau Rivage
                        hotel went down to the beach to enjoy a swim. An hour or two later their
                        lifeless bodies were recovered from the water after a gallant, but
                        ineffectual effort to save one of them. The following day, after an enquiry
                        which seems to have elicited very little as to the actual facts of the case,
                        they were buried with the usual military honors, an army order appeared
                        expressive of official acknowledgment of past services, coupled with regret
                        at their untimely decease, and as far as the public is concerned no further
                        notice was taken of the sad event.</p>
                    <p>Is this as it should be? I think not. Two young lives should not be lost in
                        this way without a searching enquiry, and an attempt on the part of the
                        governing authorities to ascertain if a want of efficient public measures
                        for the safety of bathers exists.</p>
                    <p>It is well known that strong currents prevail a little way from the shore, on
                        the coast be tween Alexandria and Ramleh. It is equally certain that no
                        notice boards warning the public, or indicating in any way the spots where
                        bathing may be carried on in safety, are to be found, and it would be well
                        it before next year's bathing season commences, steps can be taken not only
                        for the safety but for the comfort of those seeking to refresh themselves by
                        a bath during the hot weather.</p>
                    <p/>
                    <p>Europeans residing in Alexandria and its suburbs have every right to
                        consideration, contributing so largely as they do to the prosperity of the
                        city ; and although natives have every right to a free use of the sea-shore,
                        no injustice would be inflicted by the setting apart of a few suitable
                        places for family bathing, and enforcing regulations in such places, so that
                        it may be possible for ladies to frequent them without being subjected to
                        the sights and smells at present so prevalent.</p>
                    <p>I have spoken of next season, but surely it should be possible for something
                        to be done at once, as quite two months remain of the summer of the present
                        year. This, however, is perhaps too much to expect in happy-go-lucky Egypt,
                        which so far seems to be sadly indifferent on the question of the sanctity
                        of human life.</p>
                    <p/>
                    <p>In common with a large body of my country I hold very strong views on this
                        matter, and consider that the State has responsibilities only second to
                        those of the individual, in the endeavour to preserve life and health in
                        order that our existence on earth may come to a natural termination.</p>
                    <p>So if immediate action can be taken either by the Ministry of the Interior or
                        the Municipality, (or both if the responsibility is a divided one) and
                        measures be sat on foot at once, even if only simple ones such as the
                        erection of boards warning of danger where strong cur-rents are to be
                        expected, something will have been effected towards inducing feeling of
                        confidence on the part of bathers that they are not running risks that might
                        be avoided.</p>
                    <p>I am told that there are few, if any, currents on our coast setting seawards,
                        but that they run from east to west, (or vice versa), so that if a swimmer
                        is caught in one of these, instead of fighting it, all he has to do is to
                        swim. with it, and gradually work his way shorewards.</p>
                    <p>If this be so the fact cannot be too widely known, for all that is necessary
                        is presence of mind, and this is a quality that all swimmers should possess,
                        current or no current.</p>
                    <p/>
                    <p>There are always venturesome spirits, whom no danger notices will deter from
                        crossing the safety line, and strong swimmers would no doubt often disregard
                        them, but, just as skaters ignore similar warnings at their own risk and
                        come to grief, so the responsibility</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>for neglect of warning would rest on the in-dividual swimmer, who could not
                        plead, he can now, ignorance of the risk he was running.</p>
                    <p>Sacrifice is often the means of saving life, by the attention it draws to
                        much needed reforms. It is sincerely to be hoped that the death of these two
                        young officers will not be unproductive of like result, and that the
                        necessity the sad event emphasises of precautionary measures for the safety
                        of the many who enjoy a bath in hot weather, will not be lost sight of.</p>
                    <p>I cannot leave the subject without mentioning the gallant conduct of Capt
                        Crawley, who, without a moment’s hesitation, rushed to the shore and swam to
                        the assistance of Capt Carey. Doubtless he, himself, would say that he was
                        simply doing his duty to a brother officer,—and rightly so, but all the
                        same, such actions deserve the fullest recognition, and the day should be
                        far distant when full and free acknowledgment of them is wanting.</p>
                    <p>It seems strange to read of the occurrence being watched by something like
                        100 persons on the shore, and the efforts at rescue being confined to one
                        man. It is unpleasantly like the accounts we occasionally read of a crowd
                        watching the struggles of a drown-ing person, sometimes a child, without
                        stirring themselves to save life. Apparently no boats were available at
                        Ramleh. The necessity for one or more at every bathing place is so obvious
                        that they would, as a matter of course, be provided shuold such places be
                        established.</p>
                    <p>Here I will leave the subject for the present, but it will only be to return
                        to it in a few months’ time when heads of departments and local magnates
                        have returned from their holidays. But what a chance presents itself for the
                        colleagues acting in their absence to take the initiative under the plea
                        both of humanity and urgency. </p>
                    <p/>
                    <p>And they have on the spot experienced and capable administrators who would, I
                        am sure, render them, all the assistance and advice they could need.</p>

                    <p>OLD AND YOUNG.</p>
                    <p>ARE CURED OF DISEASE, BY DOAN’S BACKACHE KIDNEY PILLS.</p>
                    <p>Mr. John Day, 29, Gravel Walk, Tewkesbury, England, says :—"I am 85 years
                        old, but I’ve been so well sonce Doan's Backache Kidney Pills cored my
                        kidney complaint that I don’t feel anything like 85, and I fully believe I
                        shall live to be a hundred. Many a time before I used Doan's Pills I was
                        doubled up with the agonizing pain in my back, and I used to think that it
                        was all up with me. At nights I couldn't turn in bed, and I was weak and
                        nervous. The water was very bad, thick and scalding, sometimes I lost
                        control of it, and at other times it had to be drawn from me by an
                        instrument</p>
                    <p>"I very soon found that Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills were just what I needed
                        ; they did me good from the first, and soon cured me. I can see well and
                        hear well now, and get about splendidly, and I've kept well like this ever
                        since my cure, in January of 1902. Only this morning I have been ont for a
                        nice walk. What I like about Doan's Backache Kidney Pills is, they don't
                        claim to cure everything, but state plainly and honestly that they are a
                        medicine for kidney aud bladder troubles only.”</p>
                    <p>Mrs. C. Lewis, living at 72, Rathmore Terrace, Cork, Ireland, says "Jack, my
                        little boy, is nine years old, and all his life he has had bladder weakness.
                        At night-times he always wetted the bed, but not only did he lose control of
                        the water at night—every time he came home from school he was soaking wet. I
                        took him to a doctor, but despite his best efforts, little Jack got no
                        better.</p>
                    <p>"Now, however, I have been trying Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, and I cannot
                        tell yon how thankful I am to be able to say that they have cured Jack. They
                        did him good from the first, and soon strengthened the urinary system that
                        he had none of his old troubles. It was two months ago he was cured, but he
                        has</p>
                    <p>never wetted the bed since, and has now com plete control of the organs. Yon

                    <p>EGYPT’S PROBABLE CALL ON GOLD, 1905-6.</p>
                    <p>Mr. R. C. Abdy remarks in the Journal of the British Chamber of Commerce,
                        that at about this period of the commercial year the leading banks in London
                        begin to forecast the financial requirements of the principal winter trade
                        movements, and to estimate the extent to which each producing country will
                        be entitled to withdraw bullion for its raw material.</p>
                    <p>Never before has the prospect been so good for large drafts on the part of
                        Egypt. At the time of writing—18th July 1905—cotton is roughly 15 dollars or
                        £2 per cantar, with seed firm, the crop prospects being decidedly favorable
                        in view of the bad reports regarding</p>
                    <p>the American cotton and the Indian oil-seed crops. We may fairly expect a
                        crop ot 7,000,000 cantars, valued at say £20,000,000, and taking 4,000,000
                        ardebs of seed etc. for sale abroad at a value of £3,000,000, the total sum
                        needed to turn over the principal crop will thus be some £22,000.000. ("Turn
                        over” does not, of course, represent probable amount of importation, as some
                        coin circulates two or three times in the season, and we have our floating
                        supply).</p>
                    <p>We believe at 11 dollars the cultivator makes both ends meet—the land owning
                        Fellah at any rate—whilst at 12 dollars the indebted gr wer is remunerated.
                        Above this latter price the surplus remains in the country, probably in gold
                        coin, and thus on cotton alone we shall possibly be able to retain say
                        £5—7,000,000</p>
                    <p>In addition to the above, several financial operations are in view, which,
                        apart from the commercial call on European gold, will add to Egypt’s right
                        to draw.</p>
                    <p>The Daira Sanieh Company liquidation, giving cash, or its equivalent, to
                        118,000 ordinary shares of upwards of £30, will certainly affect our
                        position, as the shares are largely held locally. The Deferred and
                        Debentures, however, are in European hands, and the new resource being of
                        French origin, the country's balance will not be seriously affected thereby.
                        The stream of money, too, now being lent in Paris and London via thé Credit
                        Foncier, the Land Bank, and the Agricultural Bank, is abnormal, and shows no
                        sign of being withdrawn.</p>
                    <p>Against all these sums we have to set the increased imports, and the
                        additional interest payments abroad. The first will not show an increase
                        anywhere near the ratio of the increase in the cotton export values whilst
                        the second cause, which in future years will be distinctly a factor to
                        reckon, with, will not count for much till the repayments and full interest
                        have to be borne.</p>
                    <p>Although we have several new banks to assist the crop, we expect, if the
                        present indications are fulfilled, that all will have to work to their
                        utmost to meet the cash requirements here and in the interior for the season

                    <p>SALE OF LANDS IN THE SUDAN.</p>
                    <p>The following, taken from the Government Gazette for July, is the text of a
                        very import tant proclamation recently published throughout the Sudan, and
                        one which we think may possibly have a tendency to check undue land
                        speculation there.</p>
                    <p>Whereas it is desired to take further measures to prevent the disposal of
                        lands by natives of the Sudan before their rights to the same have been
                        settled, and also to prevent them from being induced to dispose of the same
                        at inadequate prices:"</p>
                    <p>"It is hereby proclaimed and ordered as follows .—</p>
                    <p>“ 1. No native of the Sudan may sell, mortgage, charge, or otherwise dispose
                        of, nor agree to sell, mortgage, charge, or dispose of any land, or any
                        right, or interest in or over the same, unless with the written consent of
                        the Governor of the Province within which such land is situated-provided,
                        however, that such consent shall not be required, to a devise by will, or
                        lease for a period not exceeding three years.”</p>
                    <p>“ 2. Every sale, mortgage, charge, or other disposition by a native of the
                        Sudan of any land, or any right or interest in or over the same, and every
                        agreement for the sale, mortgage, charge, or other disposition of the same
                        (except a devise by will or lease for a period not exceeding three years) to
                        which the consent in writing of the Governor has not been expressed, shall
                        be null and void.”</p>
                    <p>" 3. Money paid after the publication of this proclamation to any native of
                        the Sudan in consideration of any sale, mortgage, charge, or other
                        disposition as aforesaid, or of any agreement for the same (except a lease
                        for a period not exceeding three years) to which the consent in writing of
                        the Governor has not been expressed, shall not be recoverable nor</p>
                    <p>suable for.”</p>
                    <p>It will probably be argued that the Govern ment has no right to interfere
                        with the liberty of the subject as regards the question of the price the
                        latter obtains for his lands. It should, however, be borne in mind that the
                        action of the Authorities must not be judged by European standards, and that
                        a measure which might be looked upon as distinctly unjust if applied to a
                        fully civilised country is not neces-rily so in the case of the Sudan. In
                        our opinion, it is undoubtedly the duty of the Sudan Government to prevent
                        its native free holders from signing away their lands at grossly inadequate
                        prices, and a recent lawsuit in British Central Africa emphasises this
                        point. According to the reports of the case in question it appears that in
                        1889, two years before the establishment of the British Protectorate in
                        Central Africa, a native Chief was induced to part with his lands for "a
                        quantity of pieces of</p>
                    <p>cotton, blue quinces, handkerchiefs, beads, gunpowder, and sundries,” there
                        being no doubt that the consideration was absurdly small. The properties so
                        acquired were afte</p>
                    <cb n="4"/>
                    <p>wards sold to English companies the recent litigation arose through the Crown
                        laying claim to the mineral rights, on the grounds that the native did not
                        comprehend the idea of absolute ownership to land, and was, therefore,
                        incapable of conveying such ownership. The Crown won its case in the British
                        Central Africa High Court, but the verdict was upset when taken to the Court
                        of Appeal for Eastern Africa. The latter Court held that the agreement with
                        the Chief‘ constituted a perfectly valid conveyance of the absolute
                        ownership of the lands, including all minerals. It was, of course immaterial
                        to the native which side was, as he had been effectually robbed of his
                        property.</p>
                    <p>Apart from the more or less common sense point of view;' it will be seen from
                        the analogous case above quoted that the Government is distinctly justified
                        in endeavouring to protect the natives—and incidentally also itself under
                        certain conditions—from the sharp practices of a would-be buyer,</p>
                    <p>The danger mentioned in the first part of the preamble to the Act is so
                        obvious that no. </p>
                    <p>comment is needed. Examples of the same have been by no means uncommon in
                        Egypt, and we venture to think it would have been none the worse for this
                        country had such a-law been in force here during, say, the past 10
                        years.</p>
                    <p>We welcome this proclamation of the Sudan Government, and only trust that it
                        will be given a reasonable trial before being repealed.</p>

                    <p>London,. August 10th.</p>
                    <p>Although the announcement of Sir Reginald Pole-Carew’s resignation of the
                        Cork command is a bit "previous” there is but one opinion as to the want of
                        recognition of his great services in the Boer War by the War Office. Sir
                        Reginald’s service in the field was singularly free from "regrettable
                        incidents.’’ In more than one case these "incidents” seemed to have weighed
                        little in promotion, or militated against select employment, particularly in
                        one glaring cue, which it is unnecessary to farther specify.</p>
                    <p>Major J. L. Armitage, Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, second in command of the
                        1st Bat-tallion at Derry, will retire in a few months on retired pay under
                        the operation of the age role. He has served with the Innishkillings since
                        October, 1879, reached his present rank in. December, 1899, and was with the
                        1st battalion in the closing stages of the Boer War, including the
                        operations in the Transvaal and Orange River Colony. The appointment of
                        second in command will most likely go to Major H.O.D. Hickman of the 2nd
                        battalion in Egypt. The latter officer has the Nile Expedition, 1884-85
                        (medal with clasp, and Khedive’s star), the operations in the Sudan 1888,
                        including the action of Gemaizah (4th class Mejidie, and clasp), and the
                        Boer War, including the actions of Belfast, Lydenburgh, the operations in
                        Natal and west of Pretoria, (medal with two clasps) to his credit</p>

                        head quarters at Tipperary. The new brigade major took part in the defence
                        of Ladysmith, in which he earned the D.S.O.</p>

                        selected for the appointment of adjutant of the Queen’s Westminster Rifles.
                        Captain Portez, who has served fourteen years in the Rifles, was with the
                        2nd battalion in the actions which preceded the siege of Ladysmith, and the
                        defence of that garrison, and the action of Laing’s Nek.</p>

                        in 1857, and was present at the bombardment and capture of the forts of

                        clasp. He was also engaged in the pursuit of the rebel army under Tantia
                        Topee in 1858. He also served with a Field Force against the Bheels and
                        Mekraines in the Rewa Kanta in 1859, when he was commended by the Governor
                        of Bombay.</p>

                    <p>REVUE COMMERCIALE</p>
                    <p>Cotons. —La semaine qui vient de finir avait commencé calme et, sous
                        l’influence des avis de New-York, les cours avaient baissé, eu trois jours,
                        de près d’un demi-tallari, quand une reprise soudaine de J de tallari eut
                        lieu peu dant la matinée de Mercredi. Ce changement avait été produit, non
                        pas par la clôture de New-York qui n’aunorçtit qu’une dizaine de points de
                        hausse, mais bien par les dépêches plus ou moins sensationnelles reçues le
                        jour même de ce côté-là ainsi que par les bruits répandas sur notre place
                        que de forts brouil lards avaient été sigualés dans l'intérieur. Seulement,
                        l’Amérique étant venue le lendemain eu baisse marquée et les mauvaises
                        nouvelles locales quant à la récolte n’ayant pas été ooufirméae, l’opinion
                        de la spéculation se modifia de nouveau et pendant toute la séance de Jeudi
                        nous assistâmes à une véritable course au clocher à qui vendrait le premier
                        et le plus, ce qui nous valot la perte de 5/16 sur la clôture de la veille.
                        Toutefois, les idées noires ne pouvant avoir lougue durée sur une place de
                        nature aussi optimiste que la nôtre, les 13 tallari s eu vue à bref délai
                        d’hier se sont changés aujourd’hui en 16 tallaris d’ici quelques jours et
                        pour provoquer ce revirement dans l’opinion de nos boursiers il a suffi que
                        New-York clôturât avec 25 points de hausse.</p>
                    <p>En résumé, nous finissons la semaine sur la cote de 14 5/8 pour le Novembre,
                        soit une perte de 1/4 pepuis vendredi dernier, et avec un marché qui ne sait
                        quelle voie prendre. Quant aux affaires, elles n’ont eu de l’importance que
                        par moments, oe qui n’est nullement surprenant avec l’indécision
                        régnante.</p>
                    <p>Pour l’Août les choses out marché autrement La faiblesse a été constante et
                        le résultat de la semaine est représenté par une baisse de 25/32 ! ! Les
                        détenteurs de cette échéance montrent du découragement et tout naturellement
                        le découvert profite de ces dispositions pour se racheter dans de bien
                        meilleures conditions que oe qu’il aurait pu espérer il y a nue semaine ou
                        deux. Une circonstance, quelque peu inattendue, qui l’a sidé, eit peut-être
                        la cessation presque complète de la demande de l’Europe pour la vieil’e
                        marchandise Dam tous les cas, dans quatre jours nous eu aurons fini avec la
                        vieille récolte et très probablement ce ne seront pas les derniers
                        retardataire* parmi les détenteurs qui auront le plus à te réjouir.</p>
                    <p>Comparativement à l’année dernière, les ex porterions ont été bonnes, mais le
                        surplus de la huitaine n’a été que de 2000 balles au profit de la
                        consommation continentale. En dehors de ce point, il n’y a que la diminution
                        dans le stock à signaler, diminution qui est aujourd’hui de cantars 91.000.
                        Quaud on est aux tout derniers jours d’une campagne, ces choses-là n’ont
                        plus qu’an iu’érê; relatif.</p>
                    <p>Comme noos l’avons dit plus haut, la demande de la part de l’exportation est
                        tombée et, comme conséquence, le marché du disponible a été d’un calma plat
                        avec des affaires absolument insignifiantes Quant aux prix, ils ont
                        nécessairement dû être modifiés suivant les cours des contrats en subissant
                        une réduction de 5/8 à 7/8 pour les Mit Afifi, mais ri, an moment où les
                        prix ont été établis, an lieu de 14 15/16 l’Août avait été à 14 8/4 oomme à
                        la clôture, le fully good fair n’aurait certainement pas été coté au-dessus
                        de 15 1/8. Les provenances Haute Egypte ont été notées à 3/8 audessoos de
                        vendredi dernier.</p>
                    <p>Liverpool n’a pas été très chaud pour nos cotons, les ventes ayant été
                        faibles et les cours plutôt en baisse pour les futurs.</p>
                    <p>L’Amérique continue “à nom bombarder de nouvelles de toutes les couleurs,
                        mais notre place ne semble pas avoir profité de tous les conseils des
                        haussiers et des baisriers de New York! Aujourd’hui on noos met en avant la
                        sécheresse au Texas, l’excès de plaies dans le Etats de l’Atlantique, le
                        rapport de Miss Giles à 73 3/10 et la formation d'un Syndicat à New Orleans
                        pour soutenir les prix, tandis que de l’antre côté on prétend qne Price
                        persiste à prêcher la baisse. Pourvu qu’il ne toit pee sur le point de

                    <p>EGYPTIAN SHARE MARKET.</p>
                    <p>(From our Financial Correspondent).</p>
                    <p>London, August 11.</p>
                    <p>Markets during the past week have really offered no point of interest worth
                        mentioning. Nearly every body is holiday making and business is practically
                        at a standstill. The actual opening of the Peace Conferece has caused
                        occassional small flutters in Japanese stocks the balance of the tendency
                        being upwards, for in spite of rumours to the contrary, there is a general
                        feeling that things have made a good start on the road towards peace, and
                        though there may, and doubtless will, be halts or threats of turning back,
                        it is believed that the present negotiations will be successful in the long
                        run. In the meantime we will get the usual crop of contradictory rumours,
                        and the consequent uncertainty in market movements.</p>
                    <p>The quiet but steady enquiry for Investment Stocks goes on, and must be a
                        sign of the general public beginning to take heart again, and as such, the
                        forerunner of a renewal of activity.</p>
                    <p>With the exception of a few realisations to square up the account there is
                        not a bargain doing in the South African market, and though the crushings to
                        hand appear favorable, it does not look as if any large advance would be
                        made on last months record. Generally, the disposition is to wait and see
                        how the peace negotiations progress, and it is too early yet to be able to
                        make any guess as to whether a satisfactory solution will be found.</p>
                    <p>There is nothing of special interest in Egyptian Stocks. Land Shares are
                        practically unchanged, and Bank Shares keep very firm. The Khédivial Mail
                        Steamship and Graving Dock Ltd. Shares have had a sharp rise of nearly 10/-
                        per Share. They were recently quoted 10/- to 12/- per share, and are now
                        20/-, with sellers at 31/-. The baying appears to have come entirely from
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As the market knows no reason for this, but last year the Company paid 4%, it
                        is surmised that the dividend now due, will shew a considerable improvement
                        on that, as the Company has been doing well.</p>
                    <p>In the Mining section prices sagg away from want of business, and the new
                        issue of Nile Valley Shares does not seem to have been well timed, and has
                        brought the price down to 3/4, which has of course told to a certain extent
                        on other Egyptian Mining properties. Those who hold Nile Valley’s at much
                        higher prices might well turn their attention to this chance of averaging
                        their holding at present levels ; at the same time the returns for July,
                        apart from the specimen stone, averaged about 7 dwts. per ton, or aboat half
                        that shewn by the June returns of under 14 dwts. The markets are somewhat
                        disappointed at this.</p>

                    <p>Liverpool, August 10.</p>
                    <p>The Market this week has been very quiet, and in consequence of the holidays
                        the amount of Cotton sold has been small; quotations are unchanged. Only a
                        limited business has been done in Futures, and the following are the latest
                        values:</p>
                    <p>Aug. 7.47 Oct. 7.42 Dec. 7.35 Sep. 7.45 Nov. 7.38 Jan. 7.32 American Futures.
                        -The Market this week has again experienced sharp fluctuation, an initial
                        decline of about 8 points was followed by a sharp rise of 17 points, which
                        has again been succeeded by a fall of 14 points. To-day's closing values are
                        6 @ 3 below those of last Thursday. The unsettled, nervous state of the
                        Market reflects the uncertain and feverish speculative conditions. Crop
                        reports are variable from day to day although generally we think the
                        conditions show some amelioration. A disturbing element is the threatened
                        strike in Lancashire, and it is even to-day quite impossible to forecast
                        whether it can be arranged or not. All circumstances considered, and with
                        the New Crop just commencing to move, we must again express our view that 5
                        3/4 @ 6d. per lb. seems to us to discount the adverse Crop conditions.</p>

                    <p>OUR LONDON LETTER.</p>
                    <p>(From OUR Correspondent.)</p>
                    <p>London, August 11.</p>
                    <p>The visit of the French Squadron, in 1844 —then the first since 1815—was, it
                        is interesting to recall, also a “burying of the hatchet.” It followed, in
                        fact, immediately upon the adjustment of the Tahiti difficulty, in which Mr
                        Pritchard, a missionary, who was British Consul besides, had played a
                        prominent part Somewhat in advance of public opinion at home, Louis Philippe
                        and Guizot desired to prove the sincerity of their good feeling towards us
                        by their presence in this country. The feeling was quite reciprocated.
                        Prince Albert and ibe Duke of Wellington met the visitors at Southampton,
                        and took them to Windsor. “At two o’clock,” says Lady Lyttel ton, They
                        arrived, this curious King, worth seeing, if ever anybody was. Down flew the
                        Queen, and we after her, just in time to see the escort clattering up, and
                        the carriage close behind.” His Majesty, she thought, was much moved : “His
                        hand shook ; his hat was quite off, and his grey hair seen. His embrace of
                        the Queen was very paternal and nice,” though he, probably, did not say :
                        “Combien de plaiser j'ai de vous embraseer!"</p>
                    <p>That was on October 8. On the 9th the visitor was made K.G. “Albert placed
                        the Garter round the King’s leg, and I pulled it through.” Then, he said,
                        “Je voudrais embrasser cette main,” which he did. The visit lasted a week,
                        and the French ships had a very pleasant time. A gale of wind sent the King
                        home the short way, by Dover and Calais, but the Queen went specially to
                        Portsmouth, and honored Admiral de la Sasse with her pre sence at luncheon
                        aboard the Gomer.</p>
                    <p>The entry of a French fleet into the inner harbour at Portsmouth has had no
                        parallel. A small American squadrou, it is recorded, was once accorded the
                        same hospitality ; but that hospitality has been extended to the warships of
                        no other nation until now. Never till Wednesday last was the tricolor
                        hoisted on the Victory to salute the passing alongside of a French Admiral
                        and an Escadre du Nord.</p>
                    <p>London in August is nominally empty. The hollowness of the formal phrase Was
                        never more amply demonstrated than on Thursday, with its enthusiastic crowds
                        filling the great thoroughfares to watch the passage of our visitors from
                        France But, even had the ad jective been more nearly literal, we believe
                        that the muster of spectators would still have been a remarkable ode. For
                        they were there not only to watch but to welcome. This visit from our now
                        allies has taken hold of the public mind, and London, which with some reason
                        claims to lead public opinion, means to show in no uncertain manner how the
                        heart of England feels towards the naval representative of France. London
                        has had an opportunity and at the end of the week, there is but one
                        verdict—that she has used it in a manner not unworthy of a novel and
                        exceptional occasion.</p>
                    <p>Another outstanding difficulty between England and France will vanish, we may
                        hope as the result of the award of the Tribunal of the Hague in the matter
                        of Muscat. The French have insisted upon giving the protection of their flag
                        to a number of native dhows engaged in trade, which are strongly</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>suspected either of slavery, or of the</p>
                    <p>of the smuggling of arms along the coast, for the ben-fit of the</p>
                    <p>inland tribee in chronic revolt against the</p>
                    <p>Sultan, and of the outlaws of all sorts on both sides of the Persian Gulf. Is
                        is now decided that natives may not fly the French flag unless they were
                        under French protection before 1863 and such protection is not trans-</p>
                    <p>ferable to other natives or vessels, or even to vessels belonging to the same
                        proprietor. With these restrictions, however, native craft under French
                        protection shall have the right of inviolability within the territorial
                        waters of Muscat.</p>
                    <p>This decision would seem to reduce</p>
                    <p>the opportunities for the abuse of French protection by slave-traders and
                        gun-runners to a minimum; and, now that the policy of pin-pricks has been
                        definitely put an end to be-</p>
                    <p>tween France and England, we may, reasonably expect to hear no more of this
                        trouble some matter.</p>
                    <p>Sir James Kitson’s Committee have reported</p>
                    <p>the great Electric Power Bill to the House of Commons, but they are just
                        about one day too late to get it passed this Session. This will bo another
                        grievance for the House of Lords, which had carefully examined and approved
                        the provisions of the bill long before it reached the House of Commons. The
                        real opposition to it comes from the two or three Liberal organs that have
                        made of municipalism a fetish. But the height of their foolish resistance is
                        reached today by the "Daily News.” which put Sir James Kitson in the pillory
                        because he ex-pressed in a letter, written long before he joined the Select
                        Committee on the bill, an opinion “strongly in its favor before hearing the
                        evidence for or against” An examination of the letter will show that all Sir
                        James said was: “The bill has had very careful consideration from a
                        Committee of the Lords. I think it only right to give the opportunity for
                        the same consideration to be given in Committee of the Commons." Which is
                        what any</p>
                    <p>who understand Parliamentary procedure would say. But the “Daily News" is not
                        in these days endowed with either wisdom or knowledge.</p>
                    <p>The House of Commons showed a becoming restraint in discussing the partition
                        of Bengal, and the agitation which it has brought about the ears of the
                        Indian Government. It received an excellent lead in this respect from Sir M.
                        Bhownagree, who observed, with some force that the policy was to be judged
                        on its administrative merits, rather than on the excitement which it had
                        evoked in Bengal. That excitement has all the marks of a straw fire. “Local
                        patriotism" is easy to inflame for a fleeting moment, even by the most
                        trivial interference with ancient boundaries, and Gov-</p>
                    <p>ernments in England as well as in India have </p>
                    <p>frequently to override the shallow sentiment</p>
                    <p>of the hour.</p>
                    <p> The ruling fact is that Bengal has grown too unwieldy to administer on
                        the</p>
                    <p>existing bases, and the presumption is that the</p>
                    <p>Indian Government has adopted the best form of change.</p>
                    <p>In the next Session of Parliament a great</p>
                    <p>scheme for ensuring the purity of the water</p>
                    <p>supplied from the river Lee will be submitted for legislative approval. This,
                        fi carried, will, with the work about to be undertaken during next winter,
                        involve a capital expenditure of a million sterling. During the past
                        half-century a number of schemes have been brought forward with the object
                        of ensuring the purity of the </p>
                    <p>Lee water above the intakes, the Lee Water Company having in 1852 proposed to
                        remove the intake further up the river, and to dispose of the purified
                        sewage of Hertford which finds</p>
                    <cb n="3"/>
                    <p>collected, and stored in the reservoirs of the East London district. By
                        several Acts of Parliament, the latest of which was that creating the Water
                        Board that body is now charged with the responsibility for treating the
                        sewage of Hertford, which pays the Board £700 a year for the work, and
                        receives £600 a year-from the Board under the Lea Conservancy Act for
                        abstracting the water of the river. The result is that the town pays the
                        Board £100 a year, while the Board itself is obliged to spend £1,400 a year
                        in the treatment of the sewage. To ensure the parity of the river the Board
                        pays the Lea Conservancy £2,C00 a year, bat efforts (in this direction have
                        led to little result owing to the reluctance of the magistrates to punish
                        the offending parties. Matters have now come to a head. The local
                        authorities, governing some 46,000 people, declare that they will not spend
                        any more money in purifying the effluents from their sewage farms, as such
                        expenditure is beyond their means, and would be unnecessary if the waters of
                        the Lea were not taken for drinking purposes.</p>
                    <p>The Water Board propose to collect the sewage from 31 towns and villages, and
                        after purification to pour the efflaent into the river below a new intake,
                        which they propose to construct some nine miles up the river, carrying the
                        water in a new aqueduct to the old aqueduct and so on to the reservoirs at
                        Tottenham. The new intake, which would take the form of a reservoir, will
                        cost £290,0 and the nine mile aqueduct £383,000. The sewage collection
                        scheme is expected to cost £'95,000, the new main drains accounting for
                        £125,000. The Works and Stores Committee of the Board have been instructed
                        to negotiat with the authorities with a view to their acceptance of the
                        scheme, and the amount which they are prepared to contribute towards the
                        cost. It was at first proposed that the Board should pay the whole of the
                        cost of the great sewers, but the Board were averse to doing this, although
                        at present it pays the whole of the cost of disposing of the drainage of
                        Hertford. With the new proposals adopted, a controversy of half a century
                        would be ended, and the Board in possession of a more adequate supply of
                        water for London. The consumption of water in the London water area is
                        enormous, and it is growing at a rate which makes new sources of supply
                        imperative. The following official figures of the growth of this daily
                        consumption at varions periods are interest-</p>

                    <p>Since the first commission sat the population has increased from 5,360,000 to
                        6,730,000, but it appears that during the past twelve years Londoners have
                        become more economical in their ideas, and now use 3 1/2 gallons per head
                        per day instead of 38. This little economy saves the Board no less than
                        26,920,000 gallons per day, which, putting the usual price of 9d. per 1,000
                        gallons upon it, is equivalent to a very large money saving.</p>
                    <p>By this now scheme the Board hope to be able to arrest and purify the flood
                        water, as it is now doing at Staines and Tottenham. At present on a dry day
                        the Board is unable to take its statutory quantity from the Lea, its
                        stagnant condition after abstraction being a source of great danger. It has
                        been found that filtered sewage is finding its way into the river,</p>
                    <p>even when there is no direct outflow from the farm to the river, but more
                        dangerous of all is the effluent from the Government powder factory at
                        Waltham. This the Board feel must at once be stopped.</p>
                    <p> The authorities on the banks of the Thames do not, however, approve the
                        proposal for the ratepayers paying for sewage purification of towns and
                        villages far away from London. Some 117 authorities, representing 527 towns
                        and villages on the Thames and its tributaries, have been compelled by the
                        Thames Conservancy to spend £2,000,000 in stopping all sewage inflow to the
                        Thames, and it is argued that all that is wanted is the same firmness in the
                        case of the Lea Conservancy.</p>
                    <p>Lord Welby is among the leaders of those who would compel the authorities at
                        their own expense to cease polluting the river. The question now remaining
                        for settlement is : What action will the Local Government Board take ?</p>
                    <p>The Court of Appeal had recently to give an opinion on the question whether a
                        well-conducted boxing contest, similar in all respect tq a prize-ring battle
                        with fight gloves, may be properly called “a high-class exhibition of
                        physical culture." The plaintiff had hired for this latter purpose the
                        Atherseum Hall— not the Athenmam in Pail Mall, but the Athenaeum Hall in
                        Camden-road—and the proprietors of the hall had stopped his entertainment ;
                        whereupon he had sued in vain for damages before Mr. Jastice Darling and a
                        common jury. He was not content ; he seems to have thought his boxing “high
                        class.” Well, everybody knows that 4 oz. gloves are a fraud. As Lord Justice
                        Romer said, they punish as much as the naked fist ; some people say more.
                        The Lords Justices had no hesitation in dismissing the action, on the ground
                        that the plaintiff had violated his contract. A good deal has been done by
                        the National, Sporting Club and other people—not without. misadventures—to
                        confer respectability upon that form of “the noble art” which cultivates the
                        knock-out blow ; but it is not generally understood to come within the
                        category of high-class physical culture. Their Lordships of Appeal may have

                    <p>they should learn that they are not entirely free to abuse a free country.
                        The Bow-street prosecution may or may not establish a case in point. It
                        serves, however, to advertise the existence of a law which, however its
                        application may call for discriminate and even jealous care, meets the
                        emergency of an Anarchist propaganda.</p>
                    <p>The match at Bramall-lane, Sheffield, between</p>
                    <p>Lancashire and Yorkshire, which ended in a win for the latter by 44 runs, was
                        one of the most extraordinary games on record, fortunes varied throughout,
                        first one side and then the other appearing likely to win. Lancashire failed
                        at the crisis of the game, however, and York-shire once more demonstrated
                        their ability to play an uphill game Yet, when all is said, there can be no
                        question that Lancashire lost through the falling-off in the quality of
                        their bowling. This falling off has been in evidence since the end of May,
                        and constitutes the great difference between the Lancashire eleven of 1904
                        and the Lancashire eleven of 1905. An appeal to figure, show, that Brearley
                        is at present the most dependable bowler. Hallows, Cuttell. and Sharp have
                        all failed to maintain their form of 1904. At the start of the season, up,
                        say to the end of May, this, falling off was not at all decided. Since then,
                        however, not one of the three has done anything with the ball, which serves
                        to show not only why Lancashire lost a game which they appeared to have won
                        on Tuesday forenoon, but also accounts for their lack of success all through
                        the season compared with 1904.</p>
                    <p>The success of the Yorkshire team over their old opponent, has left the
                        competition for county championship honors in a most in-teresting state. Too
                        often the latter part of the reason has been spoiled by one county gaining
                        each a big advantage over its opponents that the result has been almost a
                        foregone conclu cion two months before the end. Had York shire suffered
                        defeat yesterday instead of gaining . brilliant victory, Lancashire would
                        have been looked upon as the champions of the 1905 season. But instead, the
                        competition is as open now, at least so far as Yorkshire and Lancashire are
                        concerned, as it was, two months ago. Lancastrian, may be excused for
                        sorrowing the defeat of their champions, but the result of that one game has
                        undoubt-edly added largely to the interest taken in the competition.
                        Lancashire are, of course. still at the head of affairs, but very little
                        separates them from their rivals.</p>
                    <p>Once more Mr. Bargeu, of Yorkshire, has tried to swim across the Channel, and
                        once more he has failed. But though beaten so far he is the reverse of
                        disgraced. It was less than a fornight ago that he made hie last attempt.
                        Undaunted, he tries again, and gets to within four mile, of France before he
                        has to acknowledge defeat. The prospect of Captain Webb’s achievement being
                        equalled looks as far away as ever. But by all means let attempts continue
                        to be made upon his record. We are not all of the same mind with those who
                        decry these long swims as profitless and foolish. Swimming is one of the
                        finest exercises, as well as one of the most useful accomplishments there
                        is. And the incentive of a definite goal server to stimulate not only to the
                        highest efforts but to a care-fulness of living which is beneficial rather
                        than the reverse to those who continue so pluckily to strain after its
                        attainment.</p>

                        clothes-line on a nail in her bedroom, and has left, in ten lines of verse
                        upon a piece of sugar paper, her calm farewell to a world too arduous. It is
                        a document not to be read with vulgar amusement. She was tired enough to
                        die, and that is more tired than any of us wish to be —</p>
                    <p>Her last words on earth were: "Dear friends, I am going where washing ain't
                        done, nor sweeping, nor sewing. But everything there is exact to my wishes.
                        For where they don't eat there's no washing of dishes, I'll be where loud
                        anthems will always be ringing. But, having no voice, I'll be clear of the
                        singing. Don't mourn for me now, don't mourn for me never. I'm going to do
                        nothing for ever and ever!" </p>

                    <p>The jury mocked her yesterday with the customary verdict of "Suicide during
                        temporary insanity,” Her rapture seems most reasonably prophetic. May the
