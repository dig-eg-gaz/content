                    <p>It is comforting to learn that one of the two</p>
                    <p>great dangers which have been assailing the cotton-industry of England and
                        placing it in such a critical situation has, for the moment at any rate,
                        been averted. We refer to the strike which was threatened by the workmen’s
                        demand for a five per cent increase of wages and by the masters’ refusal to
                        accede to their request A Reuter’s telegram received last night from
                        Manchester, however, informs us that the conference which was convened by
                        the Lord Mayor has effected a compromise, by which the operatives are
                        conceded a bonus of five per cent for twelve weeks, and neither side is to
                        take any action before March of next year. The question therefore remains
                        un-decided and is only temporarily shelved, but it is to be hoped that when
                        the alloted time has expired, the two interested parties will be able to
                        establish a more effective and more lasting agreement An open rupture
                        between the cotton-spinners and the operatives would entail an enormous
                        disaster, for not only would it render millions of spindles idle, and
                        necessitate the loss of employment to thousands of workmen, but thousands
                        would suffer along with them, and the bread would be taken out of the mouths
                        of their wives and children, who have no share in the decision of those upon
                        whom their lives depend. A strike of such magnitude would of necessity cause
                        acute suffering and immense loss, especially in the great industrial and
                        thickly populated centres of Lancashire, while it could not fail to have, in
                        a somewhat lesser degree, a disastrous effect in many other centres not
                        directly connected with the cotton trade. The temporary settlement cf the
                        difficulty is therefore a great blessing and gives one ground for sub-</p>

                        permanent ly removed. </p>
                    <p>Unscrupulous speculators constitute the other great danger to the
                        cotton-industry of England. How grave is this outside danger from
                        speculative rings, is made clear by the anxiety of the International
                        Federation of Master Cotton Spinners and Manufacturers’ Associations, which
                        hurriedly convened a meeting at the end of lost month, feeling that common
                        and immediate action was necessary "to counteract the pernicious effeot on
                        the trade, brought about by the late enormous enhancement of the price of
                        raw material” by speculative syndicates. These rings are now paralysing the
                        industry in almost as pro-nounoed and as complete a fashion as was the case
                        a few years ago. We are inclined to think that the only way in which English
                        spinners can free themselves from the ever-tightening grip of these
                        unscrupulous gamblers and “cor-nermen” is to give a greater support to all
                        projects for cultivating cotton in various parts of the British dominions,
                        and so become independent of American grown material. Such a scheme would,
                        however, have to receive far greater support than is at present being
                        accorded it, as under no other conditions could an British scheme
                        successfully compete with the growers of the Southern States America. Here,
                        however, Egypt comes to the help of England, for the cotton grown in this
                        country is steadily increasing in bulk, and it holds a foremost position as
                        regards quality. The European cotton industry is now, it transpires, engaged
                        on the average for a period of three to four months ahead, ample supplies
                        being available—sufficient, in fact, to more than meet demands. It is
                        therefore evident, that spinners can as a rule hold aloof from the markets
                        for that period, and in the majority of cases they certainly need not do any
                        buying before the end of October, by which time the new crop will be coming
                        to hand. For two months, therefore, gamblers may be left to “stew in their
                        juice” and “deal as best they can with the conditions to which they have
                        reduced the market.” Such an expedient is at the same time simple and
                        effective.</p>
                    <p>If the policy of “suspension” thus advocated be loyally and widely adopted by
                        cotton-spinners in Europe and America, it will at any rate obviate, as the
                        associations pointed out at their meeting, the danger of the next cotton
                        season commencing with the raw material at the abnormally high prices which
                        now prevail. Should the supply prove less than the demand, there will still
                        be opportunity and time to meet the conditions caused by a shortage. The
                        latest available figures are from the last number of the New York “Journal
                        of Commerce,” which on past prophetic efforts may be credited with
                        foreshadowing the true state of cotton affairs in the United States with
                        remarkable accuracy. The latest synopsis of that Journal makes out the
                        average conditions to be 75.4 percent, against its own estimate of 81.2 for
                        June and 84.4 last year. These figures contrast with the official estimate
                        for Jane, vis. 77 per cent and 84.4 per cent last year, and against 76 per
                        cent. on August 1, 1900, which was the lowest on record during the last 20
                        years on the same date. States covering half the total acreage provide the
                        lowest average, so that a general shortage is probable, though that hardly
                        implies a supply insufficient for the demand, inasmuch as the official
                        report published by the associations' meeting confidently states that the
                        surplus of last year's crop will guarantee a full supply, even in the event
                        of the next crop being small. The danger therefore which is to be feared
                        from the unscrupulous gamblers who form the speculative rings is not,
                        perhaps, so serious as it would appear on the surface, but at the same the
                        situation is sufficiently grave to cause considerable anxiety, and
                        thoroughly justifies any notion which may tend to safeguard the interests of
                        the industry generally from the pernicious influences of those who do not
                        hesitate to create “corners.” Let the cotton spinners therefore judiciously
                        refrain from making purchases before the arrival of the new crop, and by so
                        doing reduce to harmlessness the more acute symptoms which now threaten the
                        vitality of the trade.</p>

                            ball was a Massinet pavan, which was danced by the children, who were
                            led by the inventor of the dance, M. Longhi. It was extremely effective

                        <p>The Ramleh Season.—From all accounts the present season at this favorite
                            summer resort promises to be an excellent one. Not only has the Casino
                            Hotel at San Stefano been almost continuously full up daring the past
                            month or two,but the Carlton, at Bulkeley, the Beau Rivage and the other
                            hotels have had a large share of patronage. Indeed, we believe that
                            during the past fortnight or so it has been difficult to obtain
                            accommodation for large parties at any of these hostelries. This
                            satisfactory state of affairs is doubtless due, partly to the abnormally
                            hot weather experienced at Cairo and throughout the country generally
                            this summer, and in a great measure to the new and frequent tram service
                            inaugurated last year between Alexandria and our favorite suburb. The
                            unprecedentedly high receipts of the Alexandria and Ramleh Railway Co.
                            of late testify to the popularity of the new mode of traction, which has
                            been a great boon to both residents and visitors.</p>
                        <p>Shocking Murder.—A woman from a village in the Ghizeh province recently
                            brought an action before the Mehkemeh Sharieh demanding alimony from her
                            husband. The omdeh of the village, who was a friend of the husband,
                            prevented a legal seizure of part of his property. Nothing daunted, the
                            woman complained to the Markez authorities with the result that the
                            Husband and wife and the omdeh were summoned to appear there. The first
                            two returned, the woman did not reappear, and her mother and brother
                            hastened to send information of her disappearance to the Markaz. A
                            search resulted in the discovery of the women's body in a cotton field
                            near Bimba in the Ayat Markaz. A medical examination proved that she had
                            been strangled. The Mamour and the Substitute of the Parquet, who
                            conducted the judicial investigation, had no difficolty in discovering
                            that the husband had murdered his wife, and that the omdeh had acted as
                            his accomplice.</p>

                        <p>We mentioned a few days ago the purchase from Mr. Raphael Soares by the

                            and Italian Diplomatic Agencies at the corner of the Sharia Madabergh
                            and the Sharia El Manakh, two main thoroughfares of Cairo, for the sum
                            of £48,000. We are now informed that the property consists of 4816|
                            square metres, so that the price paid is as nearly as possible £10 for
                            the square metre, inclusive of the four residences on it which is
                            considered a fairly moderate price for the locality. The conditions of
                            payment are £10,000 on the signing of the contract, which was registered
                            at the Mixed Tribute's on the 9th inst, and the balance on the company
                            obtaining possession of the property in November, when they intend to
                            commence the demolishing of the houses on it, replacing them by a huge
                            block of residential flats of the latest and most approved style. It is
                            interesting to note that this same ground was bought some 28 years back
                            by Mr. Raphael Suares from Barraud Bey, a former secretary of the
                            Khedive Ismail, for 36,000 francs, and the four residences that were
                            subsequently erected on it are said to have oust £6,000 more. The
                            brokers who conducted the sale are Messrs. Elie M. Barnok &amp; Co. of

                        <p>DETAILS OF FIRE ON BOARD SHIP.</p>
                        <p>(From our Correspondent.)</p>
                        <p>Suez, Friday.</p>
                        <p>As I wired you last night, the British steamer Gibraltar, laden with
                            sugar, was sighted from Suez at about 4 p.m. flying the signals N H
                            (Fire, want immediate assistance). By 5 o’clock she was in the bay and
                            clouds of smoke and flames were visible.</p>
                        <p>The vessel anchored before reaching her anchorage, owing to the engineers
                            and firemen being unable to remain in the engine room. Very shortly the
                            raging fiâmes completely destroyed the deck amidships, including saloon,
                            cabins, bridge, and part of the engine room. On the arrival of the
                            Gibraltar, several steam launches and steam water tanks went immediately
                            alongside, and the latter rendered valuable servîtes.</p>
                        <p>Great credit must be given to the chief officer and six men of the German
                            mail steamer, Prins Regent, which at once proceeded on board, and
                            assisted, at great risk to their lives, to put out the fire, the flames
                            of which were almost reaching the tops of the masts.</p>
                        <p>The ship’s crew after lowering the lifeboats did their utmost to save
                            their vessel, and finally, with the assistance of the Canal Company’s
                            launch, which possesses a powerful pump, extinguished the fire by 9 p.m.
                            The damages are apparently considerable, but it is not yet ascertained
                            whether the cargo is damaged or not</p>
                        <p>Later- The fire on board the S.S. Gibraltar has been completely
                            extinguished by now. The cause of the outbreak is attributed to the
                            fermentation of the sugar, part of which in the 'tween decks amidships
                            has been destroyed by fire and water.</p>
                        <p>The vessel before proceeding homewards, will have to be overhauled and to
                            have accommodation for the captain and officers fitted.</p>
                        <p>The fire broke out shortly before the arrival of the ship at Suez, and
                            suddenly the captain with the steward and a seaman were separated from
                            the rest of the crew, which was aft, by the flames amidships, and no
                            communication was possible.</p>
                        <p>A REMNANT OF BALTIC FLEET.</p>
                        <p>The Russian transport Kitai arrived at Suez yesterday from the Far East,
                            and entered the Canal in the afternoon bound to Liban. This vessel
                            passed through the Canal with the first division of the Baltic fleet,
                            and accompayed Admiral Rodjesvronsky's squadron until the beginning of
                            the great naval battle, when she managed to escape.</p>

                        <head>New Buildings in Cairo</head>
                        <p>Our Cairo correspondent writes.— "Building operations are proceeding in
                            every direction in the Ismaï ieh, Thewfikieb, Kasr-el-Nil, and other
                            favorite residential quarters of the metropolis, and the leading firms
                            of contractors and builders are, and have been for some months, fully
                            occupied in erecting new buildings in those localities. In the Ismailieh
                            quarter, principally, new houses are rising on every side, and the
                            district opposite the Savoy Hotel, formerly belonging to the illfated
                            Banque Industrielle, and which a few years back was a large open space,
                            is now very nearly covered with huge residential buildings. For the few
                            sites left as much as £8 to £12 per square metre is being asked, and the
                            prices demanded in other choice quarters are constantly tending upwards,
                            so that soon the cost of land for building purposes will become almost
                            prohibitive. Amongst the new large blocks of buildings now approaching
                            completion are those belonging to the Standard Life Assurance Co., the
                            National Hotel, Daira Khassa in the Sharia Boulso, and many others too
                            numerous to mention in detail.</p>
                        <p>A Cairo contemporary pointed out, in a leading article a few days ago,
                            that, the craze for building in that city was being overdone, and said
                            that the probability is that, if not checked, it will eventually lead to
                            something in the nature of a crisis. I hardly agree with this opinion,
                            inasmuch as I find on enquiry that although numbers of new houses are
                            being erected in the favorite quarters, the supply has not yet quite
                            overtaken the demand ; since, in the majority of case, most of the apart
                            ments in these houses seem to let long before the buildings are even
                            completed, and what is still perhaps a better test whether the building
                            craze is likely to overrun the mark, is the fact that rents are still
                            rising instead of falling. A case in point is the new large block now
                            under erection nearly opposite the National Bank in the Sharia El
                            Madabergb, belonging to the Coronel family, every floor of which is
                            already let, although the building, which was formerly Intended for a
                            hotel, will not he ready for occupation under three months or so. The
                            annual rents asked here were £180 to £220. according to floor position,
                            for apartments of 9 rooms, and at those prices no difficulty was found
                            in finding tenants."</p>

                        <p>(From our Correspondent).</p>
                        <p>Port Said, Friday.</p>
                        <p>The Russian transport Kitai arrived here from the Canal last night and
                            now awaits orders. It will be remembered that she was one of the fleet
                            of twenty-three vessels which formed the second squadron, and was also
                            one of those which flew the merchant flag, which fact accounts for her
                            stay of over three months in Laigoo. She, I hear, left the main squadron
                            when it lay in Kamran Bay. in company with a number of the colliers
                            which are passing through here daily bound for Russian parts.</p>
                        <p>THE TR00PS FOR THE YEMEN.</p>
                        <p>The total number of Turkish soliders who</p>
                        <p>have passed through here (bound for various parts in connection with the
                            rebellion in the Yemen) since 17th January last is 30,309, of which
                            2.300 have returned invalided. I understand that it is officially stated
                            that 17.000 are yet to come, which will bring the total up to 47,809.
                            These men were carried by Turkish, Russian, and French vessels.</p>

                        <p>The work of refloating the sunken dredger has received a check. Something
                            appears to have gone wrong with one of the lighters, which will probably
                            delay the work for a few days longer.</p>

                        <p>Lady Blomfield gave a very enjoyable "At Home” on H.H.S. Aida yesterday,
                            which was largely attended. Owing to the roughness of the sea outside
                            the harbour, the projected visit to the new Admiralty dredger, St
                            Laurance, had to be abandoned, the dredger coming into the port early in
                            the afternoon, but many of Lady Blomfield’s guests visited the dock and
                            inner harbour in the steam launch, and were greatly interested in all
                            that they saw. The Aida had been decorated for the occassion, the
                            Customs Band played numerous European and Turkish pieces with great
                            vigour, and we need not say that Sir Massie and Lady Blomfield did all
                            in their power to implant a very pleasant recollection of the afternoon
                            in the memory of their guests. Among those who were present were Graf
                            vonWedeLM. Scottidis, Baron and Baroness Aotou, Mr. and Mrs. Freeman,
