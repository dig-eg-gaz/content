                    <head>THE STATE RAILWAYS.</head>
                    <p>An interesting portion of the Financial Adviser's Report is that which refers
                        to1 the State Railways, and the importance of certain conclusions there in
                        enunciated is only equaled by the satisfaction we must feel in this evidence
                        of the recognition of defects and determination to remove them The important
                        principle is accepted that these railways are to be ran on business lines,
                        and not as a Department of the State, to be squeezed for all it is worth
                        regardless of consequences. Apparently, from the "proposal" to establish a
                        capital account it is not known what their yield has been on their cost, bat
                        it mast have been large and consequently there was small reason for the
                        starvation of the undertaking. Certainly fortune has favoured the railways.
                        To make up or past neglect a great deal of money has now to be spent, bat
                        with the receipts increasing so enormously and the greater facilities and
                        efficiency to be secured in the working, there should not be any in rease in
                        the proportion of expenses to earnings. In any other country the success of
                        our railways might have invited competition, and the consequences, under the
                        circumstances as exist, weald have been serious. Our railways continue
                        practically a monopoly. In this respect fortunately they are in no state of
                        transition. The changes made and contemplated, so far as we know them, are
                        in the direction of efficiency and economy They are based upon the Report of
                        Lord Farrar's Commission. They are being or have been followed up by Sir
                        Charles Scotter, the well- known Chairman, and perhaps better known as late
                        General Manager, of the Loudon and South Western Railway, and by Major Le
                        Breton, whose valuable work is recognized in this report What it his been
                        possible for him to carry out in the Accounts and Audit Departments mast be
                        at least equally s) in the other departments which have been more under the
                        control of English officers, and, for present purposes, we readily accept
                        Sir Charles Scotter's readiness and ability to do it and we hope not only to
                        have Accounts and Audit Departments bat a system of State Railways which
                        will not compare unfavourably with similar concerns -elsewhere. We have
                        ample reason to know that Lord Cromer and his principal Advisers take keen
                        personal interest in the subject with which we are dealing, we are equally
                        bound to recognise the enormous amount of work the high officials have on
                        their hands. We were therefore quite prepared for the adoption by them of
                        the recommendation for the establishment of a Railway Board. We folly
                        appreciate the great advantage of snob officials being members thereof bat
                        we confess to feeling some disappointment in the absence therefrom of
                        railway experience independent of what has to be remedied. It is to be hoped
                        that this want may yet be supplied in the form of a Secretary to the Board.
                        In regard to the "personnel" of the railways we presume that the General
                        Manager will be as responsible and as free hare as elsewhere for bringing
                        and keeping it up to date, and in both of these tasks he mast feel the
                        advantage of Sir Charles Scatter's experience. We have heard him described
                        as the beet general manager ever possessed by the best manage 1 railway in
                        Eiglani from a shore- holder's point of view and as "Scotter" then "Scott",
                        who immediately preceded him and was similarly esteemed. The circumstances
                        here are different to those in England, but a railway is a railway all the
                        world over. Departments are the same and so should the working be as nearly
                        as possible. We do not accept the idea that railways cannot be efficiently
                        worked out of England, for the contrary has been proved. Neither do we
                        believe that efficient servants cannot be made out of the Egyptians. What we
                        do hold is that efficiency is economy though it has to be paid for, and the
                        question for Sir Charles Scotter to decide is whether or not we have the
                        necessary efficiency both in quality and quantity, or whether in either case
                        we adopt the false economy of refusing to pay for it. </p>

                    <head>THE GRAND CADI. RETURN TO CAIRO. MUKHTAR PACHA INTERVIEWED. </head>
                    <p>The Grand Cadi has returned to Cairo, where he arrived at 3 p.m. on Saturday,
                        being met at the station by numerous friends. H. H. the Khedive was
                        represented by Ali Bey Shabia, who welcomed the Grand Cadi in the Ruler's
                        name. </p>
                    <p>Sheikh Yehia afterwards proceeded to Knub- bih Palace, where he was rec lived
                        in private andience by H II. the Khedive. </p>
                    <p>Our contemporary "Al Lewa" published (n Saturday an account of a conversation
                        with Ghazi Ahmed Mukhtar Pasha on the subject of the Grand Cadi's
                        retirement. The Pasha stated that he had never opposed Sheikh Yehia's
                        nomination and had always been on the best of terms with the Grand Cadi,
                        whose character and abilities he greatly admired. He stated that when the
                        Grand Cadi informed him of his sommons and asked him what he thought war the
                        reason, he replied that he had believed that Sheikh Yehia himself had askked
                        to be allowed to leave Egypt. The Ot'oman High Commissioner added tbat he
                        had pointed out to the Porte that the Egyptian Moslems had shown a lively
                        interest in the question, and that on hearing of the restoration of Sheikh
                        Yehia to theGrandCadiship he had addressed a telegram to the Sultan
                        expressing the gratitude of the Egyptian Moslems. </p>
                    <p>On being asked why "Al Moayad" had carried on so vigorous a campaign against
                        the Grand Cadi, the Pasha gave the following answer to his interviewer,
                        Mustapha Pasha Kamel: </p>
                    <p>' The reason is obvious enough ; the owner of 'a1 Moayad' his bi private
                        grudge against the Grand Cadi. It is a subject which I would not have
                        discussed but for your question. I have nothing but contempt for 'Al MoayadV
                        language. However, sensible people know what 'Al Moayad' is worth." This is
                        an admirable puff for the "Lews." and its editor, and the motives for its
                        publication are obvious. In an article in reply to a statement of "Al Shark"
                        that the editor of an Egyptian newspaper hid written to Izzst Pacha a very
                        unfavourable account of the Cadi, "Al Moayad" remarks: "We have not written
                        a word to anybody at Constantinople either agarit Shaikh Yebia or any other
                        person, and Izzat Pacha is far above using his personal influence to harm
                        any one merely for the sake of a friend. The Grand Cadi has arrived in Egypt
                        and he can learn that this story is nothing but a tissue of fi- brications.
                        Sheikh Yehia may perhaps solve the mystery in which the question is
                        shrouded." </p>

                        have been regularly made for the past three years at Cairo, and doctors
                        should have recourse to them to aid their diagnosis in all suspected cases.
                        If any case of diphtheria is diagnosed in any member of a family an

                    <p>The Savoy Hotel was very full again on Saturday night, both at dinner time
                        and after wards, when everyone drifted into the ballroom and danced away
                        till long after midnight. The orchestra was inspired and received many
                        encores and marks of approval from the untiring waltzers. Prince Charles,
                        Duke of Suder- mania, was present accompanied by several of the officers of
                        the Swedish frigate Frega. He appeared thoroughly to enjoy himself and

                        Hemming, who has spent several seasons now at the Hotel d'An- gleterre, was
                        there with Miss Hemming, who never lacks partners. Mrs. Alien Joseph brought
                        her bevy of popular girls, and Mrs. George Roye was there with a large
                        party. Mrs. Maclean was looking very handsome in a love y dress in pink net
                        with black velvet on the decoilatage, and Mrs. Rome was wearing a very smart
                        toilette of black with large sleeves of white lace flounces. Mis. Bailey was

                        many to be the most beautifal dancers in the room. Mrs. Porter was in a very
                        pretty frock of soil grey taffatas showing glimpses of pink through its

                    <p>The natinee given yesterday in aid of the Conservatoire of Music proved a
                        most enjoyable entertainment. Though ostensibly for children, of whom there
                        was a large number, all very cheery and hilarious, it was evidently
                        appreciated no less by the many "grown-ops" who were present. The first item
                        on the bill was Don Pasquale, of which the second act was given, and that
                        right successfully. The old- fashioned but graceful music was well conduct-
                        ed by Sig. G. Setti. Signa. Zeppilli made a charming Norina and sang her
                        role easily and daintily. Sig. F. G. Gianoli was delightful as Don Pasquale.
                        throwing himself energetically into his part and allowing no opportunity of
                        evoking laughter to escape him. Sings. Polefci and BendiLelli, as the doctor
                        Malatesta and Ernesto, respectively, looked and sang exceedingly well. The
                        act was prettily staged and the "make-aps" deserve special notice. </p>
                    <p>The ballet, Pierrot Soldat, then followed and occasioned much merriment and
                        enjoyment It was in fact most attractive, and the corps de ballet is to be
                        congratulated on their performance Sig. Setti's dancing and pantomime were
                        extremely amusing. Signa. Verzanti surpassed herself in her pas seuls, while
                        Sigri. d'Ared, Pelotta, and d'Andrea all did most bravely. The ballet
                        concluded with the over- popular cake-walk, in which Signa. Bruccbi's
                        coon-steps were particularly taking ; and all exerted themselves with such
                        effect that the audience would not be satisfied Until an encore was given. </p>
                    <p>The matinee was brought to a most successful conclusion by a lottery drawn by
                        Sig. F. G. Gianoli, with'the assistance of several notable members of local
                        society. </p>

                        unfair, illegal, and subject to grave criticism. My dissenting opinion from
                        their decision is not restricted to myself, bat is entertained by many
                        others in this City. When medicine is made is of merely as a commercial
                        trade, the practice becomes contrary to the laws of legal medicine and
                        medical etiquette, which every doctor most observe. It then degrades the
                        medical man from his high moral and social position, to that of
                        fortune-seeker or adventurer. Against this every medical man must be on the
                        look out. </p>
                    <p>The idealism of medicine is humanitarianism and not commercialism. The prime
                        duty of a medical man is the relief of human-pay- chophysiological
                        suffering, and not the gain of wealth. If a man's object in medicine be
                        riches, then let him about don his noble calling for something elsewhere,
                        where his glutiny fur wealth would call the just condemnation of the public. </p>
                    <p>Raising these monetary barriers before the public and mass in general is sure
                        to bring about a higher mortality, which is contrary to the laws of nature
                        and man. </p>
                    <p>Why this medical decision if followed by the profession, would bring about a
                        higher death rate, is because many would postpone consulting a physician
                        until the crisis is past; and then the call is too late. Imagine the many
                        who could not afford toe ill a doctor to see them or their young owing to
                        the new regime, if thoroughly adhered to by the whole medical body of the
                        City. </p>
                    <p>This might not apply to the few wealthy families, though they would grudge
                        the fee required, especially if the list is a long roll of calls. </p>
                    <p>Happily the majority of the medical profession, as I was made to understand,
                        do not accede to this decision, bat still cling to their previous humanit
                        irian views. </p>
                    <p>As this decision would affect the public health if followed and might be
                        taken as an example by other parts of the country, most likely the State
                        will see to it, to check its contagion from spreading with malign effect. </p>
                    <p>A doctor is required by law to give a State examination before he is
                        permitted to practise, as his scope of activity is the human physics ; this
                        shows his responsibility to the State. </p>
                    <p>From an individual standpoint of view, every man is free to charge whatever
                        he likes for his services, but when he assumes that phase he is no more a
                        medical practitioner for the latter is directly or indirectly a public
                        servant ; and a public servant more or less under the supervision and
                        contract of the State.</p>
                    <p>Did the Government issue the decree of increased medical fees ? No; the
                        Government spends thousands of pounds every year on public hygiene or
                        sanitation through its energetic Sanitary Department; hence it will not
                        tolerate that which will deteriorate the public health, that the State is
                        striving so hard to improve. The honourable gentlemen who gave the decision
                        initiate themselves as the "Medical Council of Alexandria." This would imply
                        that they are governmental officials, for no other body or persons have the
                        right to concern themselves responsibly with the public affairs of a city or
                        place except the State. Any collective body assuming the name of a place
                        indicates that it is a governmental branch. Is the above mentioned Council a
                        Governmental body ? I doubt it. </p>
                    <p>The Medical Council of Alexandria consists of the Sanitary Inspector with his
                        staff, and the Municipal Kism doctors. These, and these alone, are the ones
                        responsible for the public medical affairs of the City. Did this honourable
                        body decree this decision ? No; far from it, for such a decision cannot be
                        issued by them but with the approval of Headquarters. </p>
                    <p>This decision cannot be enforced by practitioners, for it is h ped that the
                        Government does not recognise it. </p>
                    <p>Every legally authorised doctor is by law obliged to see any person
                        consulting him. If he is obliged to see any person consulting him and the
                        Government does not recognise legally the fee decided upon, a patient
                        consulting a practitioner need not acquiesce with the new regime. </p>
                    <p>The Cairo Press severely criticises the new tariff of the Order of Alexandria
                        Doctors. The "Progres" remarks: — </p>
                    <p>En effet, catte decision n'est justifiable a aucun point de vue, sans compter
                        qu'elle est contraire fc l'esprit hamanitaire qui doit animer lea homme8 de

                            must have been indeed startling to anyone unaccustomed to our custom on
                            this occasion. To have the syrens, whistles, and bells of about a score
                            of steamers and launches interming'ed with the firing of guns and the
                            playing of two or three brass bands, is to have a pardemonium more
                            suggestive of the end of the world than the dawn of another year.</p>

                            Russian officers who had been prisoners in Japan. They are awaiting a
                            ship to carry them to Russia. Yesterday morning the S.S. Vancouver, of
                            the Dominion Line, chartered by the Japanese Government, arrived with
                            987 Japanese who were taken prisoners by the Russians, and are now being
                            repatriated. Among the officers who embarked at Hamburg was Colonel
                            Murshami, taken prisoner at Mokden. Many of the prisoners are just
                            recovering from wounds, and are very delighted to return to Japan. The
                            S.S. Camproman of the Dominion Line is expected shortly with another

                        <p> Football seems to have quite caught on in Port Said. Recently, there
                            seems to have been a match almost every other day The team from H.M.S.
                            Diana defeated the Port Said English team by two goats to one. This
                            match was one of the fastest and best that have ever been played in the
                            town. The naval team include! some first-class players and their
                            combination is very good. Yesterday they played a draw against the Arab
                            school. Although the sailors had the best of the play they were unable
                            to break down the excellent defence of the Arab goal-keeper. They said
                            afterwards that they had never seen a batter performance in goal, and
                            certaiuly the Arab custodian saved the game. On the afternoon of New

                    <head>A History of Egypt. PROF. PETRIE'S NEW VOLUME. </head>
                    <p>This work of Professor Flinders Petrie is the completion of the History of
                        Egypt which he projected years ago. He has supplied the purely Egyptian
                        period, from the dawn before Mena down to the conquest by Alexander. Others
                        have written the three remaining volumes on Greek, Roman, and Saracen Egypt.
                        The learned reader is, therefore at last supplied with a trustworthy history
                        (up to date in 1905) of this wonderful country down to the Middle Ages; in
                        fact to the Turkish conquest in 1516. If the later volumes seek to add some
                        literary graces and not a few conjectures to the bare recital of the known
                        facts, such is not the stern and self-denying method of Prof. Petrie. He
                        tells us that the gathering and sifting of the materials has been his sole
                        object, 60 that he has supplied the diligence and the acuteness of the
                        discoverer and interpreter for some future literary man to whom history is a
                        branch of elequence. May he prove the Tillemont for another Gibbon! The
                        dynasties included in the pre°ent volume are those of whom we had long since
                        some information from Hebrew and from Greek sources. We turn, therefore,
                        naturally to see what light the author's intimate knowledge of Egyptian
                        texts has thrown upon these passages in history—the Exodus of Israel, the
                        reigns of Shishak and Necho, and the Persian domination. 'The corroboration
                        of the historian Herodotus or the Prophet Jeremiah from contemporary
                        documents is a matter of the highest interest, for it not merely confirms
                        the particular facts, but enhances the general credibility of our literary
                        sources. Regarding the Exodus Professor Petrie is not very helpful. He has
                        found texts which imply that in the very reign of the Exodus the Egyptians
                        were laying waste parts of Palestine, and the Children of Israel are even
                        mentioned as dwelling there. He does not solve the difficulty fir us, and
                        tells us that M. E. Naville's account of the wanderings in the Desert is
                        satisfactory, aud has been generally accepted. But surely to those who have
                        not M. Naville's ,,Pithom" at hand he might have afforded a precis of the
                        argument. That Semitic tribes wee continually coming into Egypt, and were
                        encouraged to do so, though they often became troublesome, is a broad fact
                        in the history of the country. The very origin of its greatness arises,
                        according to Professor Stiendorff, from some such prehistoric invasion,
                        which is perpetuated in the proto- Semitic speech of the country. Whether
                        these prehistoric Semites came by way of Suez or by way of Aden teams to ns,
                        though not to Professor Steindorff, doubtful. Of course a large part of this
                        volume is devoted to the famous Ramses II., the Sesostris of Greek fable,
                        whose monuments are as numerous as his children, and this is no small
                        matter. We know from contemporary monuments of seventy-nine sons and
                        fiftynine daughters, which implies, allowing for infant mortality (says Mr.
                        Petrie), at least twice as many births [?]. But, apart from his reign of
                        over sixty years and his enormous family, Mr. Petrie reduces the great
                        events of his reign to the campaigns against the Kheta (Hittites), which we
                        -know, not only from the poetical panegyric of Pentaonr, bat from far more
                        trustworthy copies of treaties, and these show that the Kheta came of! after
                        all on pretty equal terms. This King was a great builder, and covered all
                        the laud from the Delta to Abou Simbel with huge figures and pompous
                        laudations of himself. But the style of the work is not refined, and the
                        mummy of the King, now to be seen at Cairo, is not impressive. He was
                        probably a little great roan—the Louis XIV. of Egypt. Professor Petrie makes
                        an interesting remark on the great temple of Karnak, built by 8eti I., a far
                        greater monarch, and Ramses, his son. He notes that the pillars supporting
                        the roof are too many and too bevvy, being made of soft sandstone, improper
                        for such work. Another very interesting epoch in this history is the
                        assumption of royal power by the Church, the priests of Amon at Thebes
                        ruling like popes in a regular dynasty, while the secular kings (at Tanis)
                        were but puppets under their control. And, as might be expected, during this
                        period the Church endowed herself so enormously that moat of the country
                        belonged to the temples as religions property, just as most of the good land
                        in Ireland once belonged to bishops and monasteries. It required a bold
                        military adventurer, probably hired not from Libya, but from 8osa, to break
                        down this ecclesiastical tyranny and make himself king—the well-known
                        Shishak of the Old Testament. For the priestly usurpation, as is always the
                        case with eclesiastics, wasastutely managed. "When the daughter of the King,
                        who wore the (-) and was heiress of the kingdom, was married to the High
                        Priest the priestly line became the rightful rulers. Not daring to take the
                        kingdom at once, they maintained the long series of the sons oi Ramses III.
                        in power, one after the other, while the real rule belonged to the priestly
                        family Thus, so far from the priests being usurpers, they were tolerating a
                        series of royal princes, while they were ready to step in as soon as the
                        sons of the dynastic founder had parsed away." All this presupposes that the
                        sovereign- • ty really descended in the female lice, which Mr. Petrie
                        strongly maintains. Amid the heartless records of pomp or of cruelly with
                        which the hieroglyphicsabound, itis a pleasantvarietytomeetthesteleof
                        Pankhyl., a king of the Ethiopian dynasty who reigned about 740 B.C.' This
                        document is as valuable for the view of mind as f r its material facts The
                        rage at opposition, which the earlier conquerors;* showed as their single
                        emotion, is here more a literary phrase than a moving power. Of course war

                    <p>pardon with heavy fines. Those who submitted freely were pardoned on giving a
                        voluntary tribute. Even the ringleader was presently pardoned on swearing
                        allegiance and giving tribute. Ali this differs widely from the fury of a
                        Ramses... His Majesty loveth that [the revolting] Memphis be safe and sound,
                        and that even the children weep not. This is not isolated ; there was a
                        general wave of moral sense and individual responsibility in lauds around ;
                        in Isaiah and Ezekiel on the east, with Hesiod on the west, with his
                        preaching of the moral government of the world, and his pare and practical
                        ethics. This phase is quite independent of other points of excellence. Moral
                        sense, knowledge, art, and luxurious wealth may each stand isolated from the
                        other three, as in the\ instances of the Puritans, the Jesuits, early
                        Greece, and decadent Rome." The above passage is highly suggestive, even
                        though it contains doubtful analogies. But we cannot quote further from this
                        book, so full of curious and careful re- search. </p>

                    <p>Professor SteindorfFs interesting lectures are professedly popular in form,
                        though also the outcome of great and special learning. It is easy to collect
                        facts, and detail the of ceremonies of many religions, but to enter into
                        their real spirit is to know national character to the very core, and it is
                        more than doubtful that any such knowledge is now attainable. If, for
                        example, devout Cathelics and Protestants seem often incapable of
                        appreciating each other's standpoints, what shall we say when the problem is
                        the understanding of a religion remote and obscure, purposely hedged about
                        with complicated and unexplained ceremonies? Even the language is which
                        these ceremonies are described, the prayers expressed, the mysteries not
                        explained but suggested, is a language of which our knowledge is only
                        external. Historical facts may now be dearly read in Lieroglyphics or
                        hicratics, but who will venture to say that we know the flavour of the
                        words, or the sentiments conveyed beyond the mere brutal translation? In
                        spite of many able commentaries, tie Book of the Dead, in its many copies,
                        is still devoid of any intelligible sense to the modern decipherer. We may
                        tell the words, but who can tell the spirit behind the words? We may affirm
                        at all events that the Greeks wholly failed to understand this strange
                        creed, though they stood in some ways far nearer to it than we do.
                        ProbablyProfessor Steindorff knows as much about the subject as any living
                        man. But the result is thin, and, so to speak, external. What does it mean
                        to us, that Amenophis IV. caused a great religious Bud social revolution by
                        introducing the worship of the solar disc, instead of the ordinary worship
                        of the Sun-God Ra. long popular in Egypt ? Quite possibly it was in its day
                        as important as the " Filicque " in one Creed which once split asunder the
                        theological world of Europe. But we can only see evidences of a bitter
                        controversy about an idle distinction. Yet these things in themselves have a
                        human interest. "Man shall not live by bread alone." Those who quarrel about
                        metaphysical problems are far removed from the savage, who merely hunts and
                        sleeps. Professor Steindorf's book is, moreover, well and pleasantly
                        written, in such English that we hardly ever perceive a foreign flavour. Its
                        account of the ceremonies and cult of the dead will give a new interest in
                        Egypt even to the ordinary tourist who takes it with him and reads it by the
                        way. As such, as well as for its real learning, we commend it to our
                        readers. The Religion of Ancient Egyptians. By Professor Georg Steindorff.

                    <p>"An Ancient Egyptian" writes In your leading article of the 2nd inst. yon
                        gave an interesting account of some new electric signal* in Cairo, and
                        incidentally you link the name of the great Mohamed Aly with the
                        introduction of electric lighting in Egypt. I quite agree with your
                        statement that Egypt has been well to the fore in the adaptation of
                        electricity, still, as a matter of fact, the first attempt at electric
                        lighting made in this country was in 1874, but it was only on a very small
                        scale. It was done for Ismail Pasha by an electrician still living in
                        Alexandria. The dynamo was not yet invented, or at least, was not in
                        practical use, and the light was produced by batteries made in Cairo, with
                        the aid of a large number of such earthenware vessels as could be obtained
                        but which were neither intended nor well sailed for the purpose. The great
                        Mohamed Aly was, unfortunately, buried in 1848 and although he was in his
                        time the shining light, of Egypt, it was not, as yon say, electrically. The
                        first time a dynamo was worked in this country was in 1880. In was need
                        experimentally for some time in Alexandria, and afterwards, during the
                        events of 1882, when among other uses it served to fight the headquarters of
                        H.R.H. the Duke of Connaught at the Mail on Zizinia, Ramleh; it was
                        afterwards used in Cairo, and I saw a part of it only yesterday. Public
                        electric lighting was only commenced in Paris in 1882 or 1883 and in Berlin
                        in 1884 ; it bas now become a bcon, which is nowhere appreciated more than
                        in hot countries like Egypt, especially by the e who still have a lively
                        recollection of head-aches canted by the heat of gas end tie smell of
                        petroleum. I should have felt it necessary to apologise for correcting your
                        statement, did I not know how desirous you are to be accurately informed.

                        <head>Moral and Social positions of the Egyptians </head>
                        <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette Sir,—We are assured that Egypt is
                            one of the most prosperous and richest countries of modern times, but
                            unfortunately the Egyptian does not share this prosperity with his
                            country, and his social and moral positions are sorely wanting. It
                            cannot be denied that he is moving in the right direction, though in
                            exceptionally slow steps. The Anglo-Egyptian Government who leads us and
                            guides us contributes in many ways to this slow advance, but
                            unfortunately it retards it in others. ' First let ns take the unceasing
                            irrigation works which are making Egypt a worldly paradise. Roughly
                            speaking, our only industry is agriculture and the fellah is getting
                            richer every day, although be is almost the same man socially and
                            morally as he was thirty years ago. The result is that wealth comes
                            rather a disadvantage to him and in most cases he, in his ignorance,
                            abases it with the unavoidable and pitiable results of national
                            demoralization. The bottom of this trouble lies in the fact that the
                            lands of Egypt are getting far more attention than the dwellers upon
                            them. To give less to the former and more to the latter is the only
                            remedy. May we not hope that those who have the reins of the country in
                            their hands will not forget that "It is written, Man shall not live by
                            bread alone." Having dealt with the unreadiness of the fellah for his
                            increasing wealth, we come to the unjustifiable and harmful
                            Capitulations. I shall not attempt to add my feeble voice to what has
                            been said and written by able men about the harm they do, but shall
                            content myself by saying that they contribute in a great measure to the
                            demoralization of the people. Thirdly comes the continuous and cheap
                            bestowal of grade3 and 'titles" on all classes of society. I cannot do
                            better here than to repeat what was written in Lord Cromer's Report of
                            last year under the heading of "Crime." He says: —''The bestowal of
                            grades and decorations causes a very large amount of jealousy in the
                            country districts, and is, I believe, the indirect motive of a good deal
                            of crime." To put this bestowal on sound basis as that of England, the
                            moral and social position of the Egyptians will benefit greatly.
                            Fourthly comes the unfair treatment of the Copts in nearly all the
                            services under the Egyptian Government. I feel very sorry to have to
                            deal with this delicate subject, bat I cannot help touching upon it as I
                            know from personal experience, as a pure Egyptian, that such treatment
                            is demoralizing the country! The Copts, who are the descendants of the
                            ancient Egyptians of the Pharaohs, are on intimate terms with their
                            Moslem neighbours and therefore it is not desirable to deny the former
                            so many Government posts which are solely in the hands of the latter, on
                            the ground that the Copts are Christians and members of one of the most
                            ancient churches. Mach less desirable it is to refuse to give them
                            appointments at all, as some Anglo- Egyptian officials do. Think of it
                            The purest Egyptian is actually refused a post in Egypt. Why is it that
                            in Upper Egypt, where the majority of the educated classes and wealthy
                            land owners are Copts, we do not find one Coptic moudir or sub-moudir,
                            or mamonr or bashmihandis, or even a school headmaster ? Why is it that
                            the Government school which has 70 % Coptic scholars works on Sundays,
                            and daily instructions are given in the Koran and the Principles of
                            Islam ? Why is it that the Commandant of the Police Government school
                            refuses to admit Coptic Cadets saying that he is ordered by his
                            superiors not to "defile" his school by the admittance of such
                            creatures? Why is it that when a well cultured Egyptian applies for a
                            post, the Anglo Egyptian official enquires firstly whether the candidate
                            is a Copt or a Moslem? Why is it that the Khedivial decree, which gives
                            the right of promoting a bashkatib to the post of Wakeel or a Moudir,
                            remains a dead letter? Why is it that in the first half of the
                            nineteenth century we find scores of Copts filling leading Government
                            positions and now we find only one or two? I could go on asking
                            questions of this nature for hours, but what is the answer ? For clearly
                            they most all have one answer and we natives only guess at it, as there
                            is not one Egyptian who knows for certainty what it all means. Last, but
                            not least, comes the shameless position which the Egyptian woman holds.
                            Probably this fact retards the advance of the moral and social position
                            of the Egyptian more than any other. So long as this is the case with
                            Moslem countries, so long will they take back seats among the countries
                            of the whole world. The remedy lies in the removal of the unwarrantable
                            suppression of the Copts and in giving perpetual impulse to female
                            education.—Believe me, Yours faithfully, A Native of Upper Egypt.

                        <p>and Alexandria where values of building sites are higher; the former
                            being a capital like Cairo, the latter a commercial seaport like
                            Alexandria. In Athens last October several sites with new houses in
                            course of construction were pointed out to me and the prices paid for
                            the same stated. My informant, an Englishman holding a position of
                            trust, was well acquainted with the subject, having himself recently
                            purchased a site and built a house thereon. The sites in question were
                            situated in the most fashion, able residential quarter but fully 15
                            minutes drive from the central business part of the town. Prices ranged
                            from 150 to 175 drachmas per sq. pic (exchange 29 drachmas per pound
                            sterling.)Two pics equal within a small fraction one sq metre,
                            consequently the price of building sites in the fashionable residential
                            quarter of Athens is from £10 to £12 per sq. metre. In Cairo the moat
                            expensive residential quarter is that of Kasr-el-Dubarah, where, in
                            spite of what the Financial Adviser calls inflated value?, fine houses
                            with gardens can still be bought at a price equal to about £8 per sq.
                            metre of area covered, with the buildings thrown in for nothing. At
                            Smyrna building sites in the suburbs away from sea frontage and at least
                            2 000 metres distant from the commercial centre of the town sell at from
                            one to one and a half pound sterling per pic, whereas at Alexandria,
                            where land is also measured by the pic, there are many thousands of
                            square pics of land for sale at the present moment within 1,500 metres
                            of the Mohamed Ali-square which can be bought at one pound and under the
                            square pic. Yet rents in Alexandria and Cairo are more than doable what
                            they are in Athens or Smyrna, and the importance of the towns, judging
                            by population, size, volume of commerce, and general wealth and
                            prosperity, can in no way be compared. If "Fair Play" acts op to his
                            "nom de plume" he should take some trouble to verify my statements, and
                            having done so he should give the public the result of his enquiries.
                            Thanking "Anglo-Egyptian" for his abbreviation of the somewhat
                            combersome name I adopted in my first letter, I beg to sub- scribe

                        A Ramleh à domicile Trente francs bien sonnants. Pour le Camp de César C'est
                        an tarif à part ; C'est vingt francs que l'on exige A moins que l'on ne

                    <p>NOTES ET CRITIQUES Caire, 6 janvier. Les cours de Londres nous arrivent
                        encore invariés sur le Cot solidé anglais, qui se maintient à 89 1/2.
                        L'Unifiée égyptienne marque 3/8 de hausse. La National Bank est renseignée
                        en nouvelle hanse de 1/4 de livre à 26. La Daira et l'AgriCole restent
                        stationnaires à leurs cours précedents, 17 5/8 et 9 5/8, ce qui est, sans
                        conteste, au indice de fermeté. La Delta Light a gagné 1/8 à 12. A Paris,
                        l'action Crédit Foncier a clôsuré en reprise de 4 francs à 807. La Banque
                        d'Athènes s'est soutenue à 134. Ici, le marché des valeurs a été ce matin
                        relativement assez ferme, Liais moins animé qae les jours précédents. La
                        National Bank s'est maintenue à son cours d'hier, 25 7/8. L'Agricole, plus
                        soutenue, a ouvert à 9 1/2 pour clôturer à 9 9/16 acheteurs. Le Crédit
                        Foncier, très mouvementé, a gagné 6 francs à 8u5. La Banque d'Athènes est
                        revenue à 132. La Banque d'Abyssinie a fléchi à 6 15/16 vendeurs. Le
                        Comptoir Financier s'est inscrit à 4 7/16. L'Immobilière est offerte à 360.
                        La part de Fondateur Laud Allotment revient à. 100 ; la Delta Light à 11
                        13/16 ; les Ciments d'Egypte à 73, et la dividende à 17. Dans le groupe des
                        Hôtels, les Nungovich sont négligés à 11 13/16 ; les Baehler ouvrent en
                        bonne tendance a 3 3/4 pour clôturer à 3 13/16. Les autres valeurs
                        hôtelières conservent leurs prix précédents. Rien de très particulier à
                        signaler sur les petites valeurs. , On parle de la prochaine distribution
                        d'un dividende de 10 % sur l'action \ Investment (Abdy). La satisfaction que
                        cette nouvelle danserait à première vue aux actionnaires sera néanmoins
                        considérablement mitigés par le fait que ce 10 % ne s'applique en réalité
                        qu'au capital versé. C'est donc, poar l'action complètement libérée, du 2 et
                        1/2 poar cent Toutefois, pour être impartial, U faut noter que ce dividende
                        est distribué pour l'exercice terminé U 31 décembre écouté, c'est-a-dire
                        pour nue période de neuf mois seulement. On s'attendait, tout de même, à
                        mieux. La Société de la Brasserie des Pyramides est eu train d'établir son
                        bilan poor l'exercice 1905, Ou s'attendrait à la distribution d'an dividende
                        de 4 %. Hier, après midi, a en lita 'au Caire l'assemblée générale
                        extraordinaire de l'Auglo-American Nile Steamers and Hotels Company. Le
                        projet de fusion avec la Hamburg Amerika Lime eu ce qui concerne les
                        services de navigation sur le Nu a é.é définitivement adopté. Nous avons
                        exposé dernièrement les clauses essentielles de cet arrangement, il en
                        résultera an accroissement de capital pour la Compagnie, qui augmentera sa
                        flottille et étendra ses services. M. Cari Stanger, de la Hamburg Amerika
                        Linie. été adjoint au conseil d'administration, et la Compagnie prendra, à
                        partir do 1er Mai proobain, la dénomination de " Hamburg and Anglo-American
                        Line Co." Le conseil d'administration de l'Egyptian Enterprise and
                        Development Co. informe que, sur les 21,000 actions nouvelles dont
                        l'émission à été décidée par l'assemblée extraordinaire da 15 décembre
                        dernier, 16,000 ont été réservées aux actionnaires de la Société, à raison
                        de 1 action nouvelle pour 1 action ancienne, au prix de L.E. 11 l'action. Ce
                        droit de préférence est valable jusqu'au 20 janvier courant. Les cours du
                        coton sont de nouveau signalés en petite baisse d'Amérique. Hier, le
                        disponible a perdu 10 points, le Mai autant et l'Octobre 3 points. Le marché
                        de Liverpool est plus on moins stationnaire. La spéculation semble attendre
                        le rapport des "Ginners" (qui sera publié après demain; pour se mettre suit
                        a la hausse, soit a la baisse. Ici, ce matin, le Mars a ouvert à 16 19/32
                        pour clôturer à 15 9/16. A l'occasion de l'anniversaire de l'avènement de

                    <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                        January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so warm as
                        Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm
                        than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in
                        the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest
                        place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                        sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on each of
                        the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="3"/>
                    <p>They are as follows:-</p>
                    <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southhampton,
                        London or Liverpool—occupy about 4 days. The short ones are as follows:—</p>

                    <p>The steamers, of the P.&amp;O. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageriea
                        Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines are
                        also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by travellers to
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made without change
                        in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp;O.
                        Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna
                        express from Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis" to Brindisi. One of these leaves port
                        Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian <cb n="6"
                        />mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                    <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                        attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats" having
                        been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi.
                        If you are going straight through to England you will find the train waiting
                        at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete
                        arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in
                        London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                        history, having been a Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C.
                        413, and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb
                        is to be seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                        about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                        delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The
                        Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S.
                        Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral,
                        Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also worth a
                        visit.</p>

                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                        bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento
                        [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                        City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence itself the churches
                        and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local promenades and
                        excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and
                        fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea
                        level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero,
                        thence by cog-wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks
                        takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; hero there is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                        and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                        house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                        and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                    <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                        the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and deliciously cool
                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                        SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal springs,
                        change trains at Borgo San Donino and in half-an-hour you are at

                    <head>NORTHERN ITALY (Continued) and The ITALIAN LAKES.</head>
                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea port.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                        lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza :</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo, Cadenabbia,
                        and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio opposite. The walk
                        from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio is most enjoyable. A
                        steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake Lugano in three-quarters
                        of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                    <p>LUGANO is some 20 miles from Como and reached by train in one-and-a-half
                        hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated on
                        the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San

                    <p>LOCARNO, may be reached by rail from Bellinzona in forty minutes. This pretty
                        town, situated at the top of lake Maggiore has a mild climate and is an
                        excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated above the
                        town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings, "Entombment,"
                        by Ciseri, and 'Tho Flight into Egypt," by Bramantion.</p>

                        Pilatus, Burgenstock and Sonnenberg needing a special visit each. Other
                        excursions on the lake can be made by steamer, and the ever-changing scenery
                        on the trip from Lucerne, to Fluelen is a source of delight to the lover of
                        nature.</p>
                    <p>BRUNNEN, charmingly situated on the most beautiful part of the Lake of

                        Railway, with delightful scenery en route. The ascent of Titlis, is made
                        from here, and the panoramic view of the Alps is grand; extending from Monte
                        Rosa to the Black Forest, and from the Santis to the Matterhorn.</p>

                        avenue of walnut trees the chief resort of visitors. Interlaken is also not
                        far from the famous waterfalls, Giessbach, Trummelbath and Staubbach. Then
                        also the glaciers of Grindelwald and view from Murren and the Schynige

                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio- R'battino Co.'s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMINA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is he
                        station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful,
                        occupying about one hour. In and around the town is much to interest the
                        visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but restored under the Romans.
                        CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of Etna and here also is a fine
                        Cathedral. The Greek,1 Roman, and Saracenic remains that are fend all over
                        the island, are an endless sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting,
                        history, having been a Greek city which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C.
                        413, and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain - his
                        tomb is to be seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO,
                        with abo t 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                        delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The
                        Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S.t
                        vannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral, Museum,

                        the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and deliciously coot
                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer. The
                        patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces, gardens,
                        and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a constant
                        delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa. Then there
                        are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite marble
                        columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo filled

                        hours by rail. MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the
                        tour of the Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its
                        beautiful windows illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens

                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be soon, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other seaport.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no bills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tope of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon. Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the
                        beautiful Italian lakes. COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is
                        reached in one-and-a-quarter hours by tram by way of Monza : Boats leave
                        Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very beautiful,
                        and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most enchanting.
                        CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo, Cadenabbia, ana Menaggio
                        with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio opposite. The walk from
                        Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio is most enjoyable. A steam
                        tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake Lugano in three-quarters of an
                        hour, then steamer to Lugano in two-and- three-quarter hours. </p>
