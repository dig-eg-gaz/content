                    <p>EGYPT AND THE AMERICAN</p>
                    <p>INSURANCE SCANDALS.</p>
                    <p>The increase of life insurance brainess in Egypt is one of the many signs of
                        the growth in the intelligence and prosperity of the, peo- ple. Not only are
                        the leading insurance com- panies securely established here, but Canadian,
                        Australian, and American insurance enter- prises have lately turned their
                        attention to this country, and we hare every reason to believe that their
                        efforts in looking so far afield have been crowned with success. There is no
                        system of Government supervision of insurance companies in Egypt, and it is,
                        therefore, of great importance to local policy- holders that they should
                        have some assu- rances as to the integrity of the financiers to whom they
                        have entrusted their hard- earned savings. It is true that Govern- mental
                        supervision in England is very slight, the only thing of this and being the
                        filing of statement* by the companies with the Board of Trade. But the
                        Egyptian policy- holder need have no fear as to the sound- ness of the
                        system on which English in. suranoe business is carried on. The foresight
                        and scrupulousness with which these compa- nies are managed have scoured for
                        them a world-wide reputation for soundness and so- lidity in every branch of
                        their business. But we regret to say that some of the Amer- ican companies,
                        whioh are represented in Egypt, are directed by men who are lacking in the
                        high dense of honor required as es- sential to the success of this class of
                        busi- ness, and who have so sinned against the true oode of business
                        morality that it may eventually be found necessary to prosecute some of them
                        criminally. </p>
                    <p>Mr. Jerome, the District Attorney-General of New York, recently announced
                        his intention of presenting to an extraordinary grand jury the recent
                        revelations before the committee in regard to the conduct' of life insurance
                        busi- ness. He stated that the inquiry in regard to the Mutual had shown
                        even greater moral obliquity and obuseness on the part of persons holding
                        important positions in the business world than the shocking revelations
                        respecting the Equitable Company. Besides the Mutual Company above referred
                        to, the Equitable and the New York have been doing a considerable business
                        in Egypt, and have a number of Egyptian policy-holders on their lists. It is
                        most necessary, therefore, that the public should be made aware of the
                        extraordinary revelations which are now being made among to the
                        investigations into what are known as the American insurance scandals. In
                        another column we give a succinct account of the actual state of affairs,
                        and when our readers have gone through the story of the scandals they will
                        be of President Roosevelt's opinion, who characterized them as '‘terrible,"
                        and who poblicly accused the directors of bringing about a "deplorable
                        scandal” which has not only shaken the confidence "of hundreds of thousands
                        of poor people all over the coun- try... in the provision which they made
                        for their families and for their old age ; but also, by causing want of
                        confidence has affected the whole insurance business of the country and
                        weakened that great tecdency for the promotion of thrift and
                        confidence."</p>

                        coarse of the next fortnight through the Hb Anglo- Egyptian Bank, but only
                        shall portion of the capital, as we mentioned a few days Back, will be
                        offered to the public, as the rest has already been privately subscribed. It
                        has not yet been decided who will be the third British member of the board,
                        as the gentleman to whom the post was offered, although authorised to accept
                        it by his directors, has not yet done so. The company has rented the offices
                        formerly occupied by the Daira Sanieh Co. in the Sharia Kasr-el-Nil. </p>
                    <p>Wo have been asked to mention that, in conformity with the Code, the
                        shareholders will be entitled to a dividend of 5 per cent, before any
                        distribution is made to the holders of founders' shares, instead of 4 per
                        cent, as we were informed, and which we stated was tho rate in our previous
                        article. </p>
                    <p>According to the statutes the company is constituted with the object of
                        acquiring land in Egypt and the Sudan, on purchase or on lease, ameliorating
                        the same, and re-selling or letting it to cultivators in small lots and on
                        the most favorable conditions. The company will likewise undertake
                        irrigation or any other works relating to agriculture in this country or in
                        tho Sadan, as well as making advances to the fellaheen on security of land
                        or crops. In fact it will fulfil all the conditions of an enter- prise which
                        Lord Cromer in his last report has strongly urged upon native capitalists to
                        turn their attention to, and we have no doubt that the Anglo-Egyptian
                        Allotment Company will be hailed by the small cultivators as a benefactor. </p>
                    <p>Besides the share capital of LE. 500,000, divided into £195,000 shares of LE.
                        4 each, the board is authorised to raise a like sum on debentures if found
                        necessary, and on condi- tions to be determined later. The company also
                        reserves to itself the right of opening branches or agencies throughout the
                        country whenever it considers this course advissable. </p>
                    <p>The net profits, after deduction of all ex penses, internet on loans, and
                        remuneration of the board of directors, will be apportioned as follows:—five
                        per cent. to a reserve fond, and five per cent to the shareholders ; of the
                        sur- plus, ten per cent, will be allotted to the directors, and of the
                        remaining balanoe 70 per cent will be paid to the shareholders and 30 per
                        cent to the holders of founders' shares. </p>
                    <p>The utmost credit is, we are told, due to Yoassef Bey Sadik, formerly judge
                        of the Native Tribunals, in having brought the first venture of this kind to
                        a successful issue. He proceeded to London and Paris at his own expense
                        during the summer, and there com- pleted the arrangements for bringing out
                        the company. In our issue of the 22nd September we gave the names of the
                        five native members of the board, all of whom are well-known through- out
                        the country. </p>

                    <byline>(From our Correspondent). </byline>
                    <dateline>Port-Said, Sunday. </dateline>
                    <p>The inhabitants of Port Said are already beginning to prepare for the
                        forthcoming visit of the Prince and Princess of Wales, and to all
                        appearances local Britishers are determined to give their Royal Highnesses a
                        fitting wel- come. </p>
                    <p>The arrangements which have so far been made for the Royal trip are as
                        follows. Their Royal Highnesses will leave London on the 19th inst. and
                        proceed to Ganos, where they will embark on the 21st on H.M.S Renown. This
                        warship will be accompanied by H.M S. Terrible, Suffolk, and Lancashire as
                        far as Port Said, where they are expected to arrive at midday on the 26th
                        inst. All four vessels will be moored in the Dutch Basin, which is being
                        specially reserved for them. </p>
                    <p>The Royal party will probably proceed to Cairo on the evening of their
                        arrival, or, at the latest, on the following morning, spending a day or two
                        in the Capital. They will afterwards return to Port Said and re-embark on
                        the Renown, which, on resuming her voyage, will be aocompanied by the
                        Terrible—the other two ships remaining here for station orders. In the Red
                        Sea the two ships will probably be met and escorted by a detachment of the
                        East Indian Squadron to Aden before their final departure for India. </p>

                    <p>As reported in yesterday's issue, the large dredger Pharaon, which was sunk
                        some five months ago in the Dutcb Basin, was success- fully refloated on
                        Friday afternoon, after great efforts by M. Dornoy and his staff. Oa being
                        examined it was found that the vessel was absolutely full of mud and sand,
                        besides being covered with seaweed. She will probably be partially sunk
                        again, when the pumps will be used to try and pump the mud and sand out of
                        her. At present she is so heavy with the accumulation of sand and mud that
                        she cannot be lifted sufficiently high to allow of her entering the floating
                        dock. </p>

                        in a critical condition all the week. This morning however, a slight

                    <p>Tor lighthouse is now in course of construc- tion. One of Bell’s Asia Minor
                        steamers, the Fortuna, has already passed through the Canal with a complete
                        cargo of building material The construction of the lighthouse is in the
                        hands of a French firm, and I understand that the cost of building,exclusive
                        of the cost of the light and lens, is 75,000 frs. There were German
                        competitors tendering, and at a rate which was slightly lower than the
                        accepted oontract The building is to be completed within two years.</p>

                        following ( remarks on Lord Cromer’s return “The comer is one whom Egyptians
                        love, not as the British Diplomatic Agent working, as he must, for his own
                        Government.... but as a gentleman and a man of honor who has spent two
                        thirds of his life in Egypt Had it not been for his diplomatic office Lord
                        Cromer would have won the right to be elected as its minister by the nation.
                        He has studied the Egyptian character, has associated with the Egyptian
                        people, and in his relations with them has a1 ways proved the benevolent
                        European who likes the peasant aids the weak, and opposes a determined
                        resistance to the oppression which he hates. Lord Cromer's policy has two
                        aims : to extend British influence in Egypt and to increase the wealth,
                        commerce, and culture of Egypt and the freedom of every degree and rank of
                        the people...." </p>
                    <p>The writer then discusses the appointment of a successor to the late Sheikh
                        Mohammed Abdou, and is certain that the now Grand Mufti will have the
                        support of Lord Cromer, and confidently hopes that he will "confess no
                        influence above that of the law and no judge- ment above that of God." </p>

                        <p>On Saturday last, the Junior and Senior Championships were swum off at
                            the Gabbari graving dock before a very numerous attend- ance. The hon.
                            secretary, Mr. H. S. Martin, acted as starter, and sent the Juniors off
                            for their 60 yards swim to a good start, the follow- ing competing:
                            Harry Eisworth, H. Mit- chinson, W. H. Talbot, M. L. Delanoy and C. E. L
                            Randall. A very even race ensued but “little" Elsworth was too ambitious
                            and got ahead by himself and was exhausted before he could be recalled
                            to make a fresh start with the other competitors. Randall soon show- ed
                            his superiority, and swimming well throughout won somewhat easily by
                            about 10 yards, Talbot and Delanoy being second and third respect- ively
                            within a yard of each other. The silver challenge cup for this race was
                            presented by Messrs. Borman and Co. and the three prizes by the club.
                            Master Randall has now won the cup two years in succession, and should
                            he be suc- essful next year the cup becomes his own property. </p>
                        <p>After this followed the event of the year, viz, the 110 yards seniors
                            championship for a handsome silver challenge cup presented by Mr. H. P.
                            Kingham. There were 9 starters and but for the absence of the E.T.C.
                            staff at Saez there would have been a far larger entry. The following
                            started, viz, Messrs. J. Bros- comb, A. B. Collier, E. A. Darton. A. A.
                            Boole- stone, G. D. Lovell, N. Lupton, W. 0. Mace, W G. B. Webb and
                            W.Wood. The race was well contested, and until the last 80 yards there
                            was no choice between Collier and Ecclestone who were swimming neck and
                            neck, they both took too much notice of each other, and in the meantime
                            Darton, who had been swimming steadily throughout, gradually overtook
                            them and won a sp'oodid race by a yard and a half, and this in spite of
                            the fact that he had recent- ly undergone an operation for a poisoned
                            foot. Last year he was fifth in the same race, and the present result
                            speaks volumes for the progress he has made. Collier was seoond and
                            Boole- stone third, barely a foot dividing the two. After these events a
                            polo match was p'ayed between the dab and a team from H. H. 8. Alla,
                            represente 1 by the following : A.8.C.— Messrs Darton, Ecclestone,
                            Lovell, Lepton, Randall,Webb andWood.H.H.8. Aida—Messrs Ames, Bright,
                            Haroty, Irvin,8auuders,Winter, and Watt. The olnb at once deserted
                            authority, and before thegame was three miriutesold Darton secured the
                            ball from a neat pass by Lovell and placed the ball into the oorner of
                            the net, ! Winter having no chanoe of getting at the ball. After this
                            reverse Lieut. Watt (captain for the . H.H.8. Alia) would have pat his
                            side on equal terms had Webh(who oaptained the dub seven) not oonoeded a
                            oorner throw. Notwithstanding that the members had swam in the previous
                            contests,the faotmadtno difference to their ex- odlent paseingflpeed and
                            all round play, and their superiority was very apparent from the

                    <byline>(From a Correspondent). </byline>
                    <p>It occurred to Mr. Harisborne, tho popular and energetic agent of the
                        Agricultural Bank of Egypt at Ghirgeb, that the time was come when some
                        effort should be made to aireliorate the lot of the unfortunate beasts of
                        burden in the moadirieh. In this idea he is by no means alone, but his
                        sympathy is of that active cha- racter which is not content with theory, but
                        must find vent in practice.' He, therefore, approached the Society for the
                        Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, which welcomed most cordially the effort
                        which he proposed to make. The next step was to interest the community— a
                        matter of some difficulty, the idea being so far without parallel in the
                        district. To do this it was thought that a gathering of the inha- bitants
                        would afford an excellent opportunity to explain the object in view, and
                        that no method of convencing the people would prove so effective as a
                        gymkhana. The result was that on Sunday last 7,000 people assembled on the
                        course at Ghirgeh. These included a large proportion of the notables of the
                        province, headed by the sub-mundir, who, since the very commencement of the
                        movement, has exhibited a close interest and given his hearty support The
                        programme was carefully arranged to provide interest for the varying tastes
                        of the spectators. Perhaps the most popular item on the programme was the
                        handicap for men over 60, which was won by a hale old veteran of 76 summers,
                        who crossed the line' but little in front of a venerable old gentleman whose
                        com- mand of language elicited unstinted praise and some laughter, when, on
                        being awarded the second prize of P.T. 50, he protested that a sovereign
                        would be little recompense enough for his unwanted exertions. </p>
                    <p>A novel item was the contest between village "champions." Unexpected
                        difficulty was experienced in bringing the competitors to the mark, and it
                        ultimately transpired that a rumour was current that the winners of this
                        event would be required for military service. None the less, representatives
                        of 16 villages started, and after an exciting contest, the village of Owlad
                        Yehia Bahri, represented by Tevrfik, was declared winner; and the omdeh was
                        presented with a silver watch in comme- moration of the event </p>
                    <p>Among those present in the grandstand we noticed the sub-mondir, Hussein Bey
                        Waasif, Director of Irrigation, Fakry Abdel Noor, German Consular Agent
                        Kamil Eff. Butrus, Salim Butrus, Bishai Malach, George Mishrigi, Labib Abdel
                        Noor, Nimr Abdel Malack, mahoun and mulhir of police, the postmaster, the
                        station-master, Dr. Zaki, Mo- hamed Namani Bey, and very many others. At the
                        close of the proceeedings the sub- moudir presented the prizes and set forth
                        the objects of the gathering in a few well-chosen words which were listened
                        to with the greatast interest. </p>

                        consequently reparations, so that some discomfort was unavailable,but was
                        none the less born with imperturbable good humour. </p>

                    <head>THE ECLIPSE OF THE SUN.</head>
                    <head>EYE WITNESS'S ACCOUNT.</head>
                    <p>The following interesting account of the recent eclipse of the son, which
                        appears in the October number of the All Saints Church Magazine, is from the
                        pen of the Rev. J. F. Burns, assistant chaplain at Cairo As I found that I
                        could leave Cairo on Monday night, see tho eclipse from Assouan and return
                        to Cairo by 7.20 on Sunday morn- ing, it recieved a great pity to miss such
                        a splendid opportunity. Thanks to the kindness of the Rev. D.M. Thornton and
                        the Rev. P. I. Anderson, 1 was able to go with an easy con- science. Tho
                        8'o’clock train on Monday was quite an “Eclipse special" as most of the pas-
                        sengers were going to Assouan to see it After travelling through clouds of
                        dost we arrived at Luxor at 9.80. We loft again at 10 o’clock and soon felt
                        ourselves bring baked in what seemed to ba really an oven on wheels, and
                        only called by courtesy a saloon. I am told that the journey from Luxor to
                        Assouan at this time of the year is one of the hottest in the world. I quite
                        believe it true. But all journeys, however hot and dusty, come to an end,
                        and ours ended punctually at 4 30; soon we were in the Savoy Hotel enjoying
                        the luxury of a bath in the red muddy water of the Nile. It did not look
                        inviting, but it was most refreshing. We found the various missions in a
                        consider- able state of excitement. They were going through a final
                        rehearsal; in fact a sort of dress rehearsal of the actual work to he done
                        during the eclipse. These went off without a hitch.</p>
                    <p>The next morning I went to see Philae and the Assouan Dam with two others,
                        re- turning across the desert on donkeys. Near the railway station, in fact
                        almost on the platform, was the big 120 ft reflecting ca- mera, and the
                        ground all round bad just been well flooded by the fire-engine so that no
                        dust might get on to ^e reflectors. One mirror reflects the image of the sun
                        120 ft along a canvas tube on to another mirror, which in turn reflects it
                        back along the same tube to a camera placed beside the first mirror. At the
                        time of the eclipse, just before totality, the afternoon train was seen
                        approaching, but as this vibration would have ruined all the exposures, that
                        is for as long as the train was moving, it bad to be stopped at all costs.
                        lo this they were successful by dint of much shouting, and the train came to
                        a standstill outside the station. After lunch I made a complete tour of all
                        the stations of observation, The island had been practically converted into
                        a big observatory. There was one direct telescopic camera 40 ft long, built
                        up in a screen, with a detached screen all round this, to prevent the
                        slightest movement being caused by a possible wind; but perhaps the most,
                        attractive camera of all was that which was called the cross-eyed lady. It
                        consisted pf four photographic telescopes nearly parallel, to photograph the
                        Leavens in the immediate vicinity of the sun. On seeing this strange
                        combination of telescopes one immediately ap- predates the happy appellation
                        of 'crosseyed." The eclipse began at 3.26 p.m. Near me was a reporter for an
                        Arabic newspaper, and as soon as be saw that the eclipse and commenced he
                        tamed round and spent some considerable time in prayer. As the eclipse
                        progressed one felt as if we were looking at everything through blue glass ;
                        this naturally became more and more marked as the sun was increasingly j'
                        obscured. But all the same it was very remark- able what a great amount of
                        light even the smallest part of the exposed son gave Whether this is
                        noticeable in other parts of the world I cannot say; it may be due to the
                        clear- ness of the atmosphere at Assouan. At any rate it made the change
                        from sunlight to darkness very marked. This change same suddenly at the
                        last. A great black shadow swept down over the opposite bill, across the
                        reverend the sun was in total eclipse. Then it was that One could look with
                        the naked eye. It would be wrong to say that the ooron biased forth, because
                        it was only a pale white glow on a background of black, but it somehow
                        conveyed the impression of biasing firth. The rays cf light stream'd forth
                        from every part of the ink blaco disc of the moon, and tho longest streamers
                        appeared to come from the son spot' area and to be about two diameters of
                        the son in length at the left band top corner there was a small prominence
                        (actually 600 miles high, I be- lieve) projecting beyond the moon's diso;
                        this glowed in the moat brilliant fashion, the colour being that of biasing
                        amethyst. Totality began at 4.83 min. 6 seconds, and after two minutes two
                        other glowing promin- ences appeared at the bottom right hand 1 corner ;
                        these grew brighter and brighter until they were lost in the brightness of
                        the sun itself as it shone forth again. During the 2 i min. 24 seconds
                        totality one saw the planet Mars and several stars, also a faint afterglow
                        on the north and south horison, though, of course, the corona was what
                        chiefly held one’s attention. There was a strange stillness broken only by
                        the sound of distant tom-toms and shooting, from Assouan across the Nile.
                        There was practically no wind, and the temperature only fell from 107° at
                        three o’clock to 97° at 5 o’clook.</p>
                    <p>The natives believed that a serpent was rating up the sun and heat their
                        tom-toms and shouted in order to frighten it away. They also believed that
                        all the scientific instrumints were brought up to Assouan for the same
                        purpose, bat whether the serpent Was frightened off by their tom toms or our
                        increments, is for tom to decide, And I have but little doubt bot that they
                        have already done so, and in favor of their drama Pot have they not
                        succeeded in rimes past alt by themselves without the help of any scientific
                        instrument 7 They were greatly impressed by our fore-knowledge of the
                        approach and time of the eclipse, and this knowledge to an intimacy with inn
                        and Afreets. At dimmer we heard that the eclipse was a complete success, and
                        tour small amount of credit to ourselves in consequence; for from some cause
                        or another we 'll seems to feel that if had not been there the eclipse Of
                        1905 would not have proved the success Which It undoubtedly was. </p>

                    <head>THE AMERICAN INSURANCE SCANDALS.</head>
                    <p>The revelation now being made as to the manner in which the affairs of the
                        great American insurance companies, the Equtiable tho New York Life, and the
                        Mutual are con- duc’ed have astounded the financial world. The trouble began
                        with the Equitable, and its original causes are obscure. The Equitable had
                        in 1904 £84,000,000 of assets and a steadily growing surplos of profi's over
                        and above the liabilities to policy-holders. Until the winter of 1904 it bad
                        the reputation of the Bank of England. It was controlled mainly by two men,
                        its vice-president Mr. Hyde, and its president, Mr. Alexander. Mr. Alexander
                        was the trustee under the will of Mr. Hyde, senior, father of tho
                        vice-president and founder of the company, and was a man of years and high
                        standing in the Now York business world. Mr. Hyde was a young man, 29 years
                        of age, and more notorious than respected. Pro- minent in New York society
                        for his immense and prodigal expenditure, and for. his insanely costly and
                        altogether ridiculous entertain- ments, he seems to have been regarded as a
                        man of pleasure pure and simple, and the suspicion which his follies aroused
                        led one or more of his fellow directors on tho board of the company to
                        devise schemes for eliminating him from its control. </p>
                    <p>THE POWERS BEHIND.</p>
                    <p>The leader in this movement was Mr. Alexander, bot it most not be supposed
                        that , his motives were entirely disinterested, since he has since not
                        scrupled to join hands with the very man whom he attacked. The war between
                        Mr. Hyde and Mr. Alexander opened with an attempt on the part of the latter
                        to give the policy-holders the right to choose the officials who were to
                        manage their property and savings. The con- cern was to be made a mutual
                        one, in the true sense. In November last it became known that Mr. Alexander
                        sought to past Mr. Hyde from the porition of first vice-president of the
                        company, and presently a statement emanating from Mr. Alexander was
                        published, to the effect that Mr. Hyde’s re-election "would be most
                        prejudicial to the welfare and progress of the society. . . . Mr. Hyde's
                        prominence in various ways .and his acts as vice-president are 'such as tend
                        to provoke critisim of the society, to create misgivings as to the con-
                        servatism of its management, and to injure its business as an institution
                        which has been uniformely held oat to tbs publis as conducted solely on the
                        mutual plan.</p>
                    <p>WHEN THIEVES FALL OUT</p>
                    <p>As soon as this information reached the New York Press cynics remarked that
                        "when thieves fall out, honest men come by their own,” and the criticism
                        seems to have alarmed a the combatants. For alter a fierce fight in the
                        board-room a truce was patched up in February. Mr. Hyde was reelected vice
                        president; Mr. Alexander remained president, and his scheme of mutualizing
                        the company was approved. </p>
                    <p>But in the course of tho fight the public had been permitted to learn that a
                        you off man of a 29, of no visible business capacity, controlled nearly
                        £100,000,000 of capital, that he had made numerous unwise investments with
                        that a capital ; that be bad bean involved in the dis- mat fiasco of the
                        United States Shipbuilding Company ; and that he was generally an “un safe”
                        man. </p>
                    <p>A conference of Equitable agents called for Mr. Hyde's retirement from the
                        company, and when the two parties to the dispute, renewing their previous
                        quarrel, admitted that the offi cials and directors of the company,
                        including both the immoral Mr. Hyde and the virtuous Mr. Alexander, bad farm
                        ad syndicates for speculative purposes, and in them employed the fonds of
                        tho society to obtain profit for themselves, the American public demanded
                        someone’s blood. </p>
                    <p>So monumental a scandal required dose at thorough investigation. The wildest
                        reports as to the condition of the company were our rent It was said that it
                        was insolvent though tho allegation was absurd, and there was no heinous
                        crime which was not imputed to its officials. It was quite clear from what
                        the two factions had published about each other that the law of the United
                        States, which forbids any director or insurance official to make per- sonal
                        profit by making sales to his society or loans of its funds, had been
                        continually violat- ed, and to meet the criticism of the Press and policy
                        holders the conduct of the Equitable’s affairs wav investigated by a
                        committee of directors, one of whom was Mr. Friok. The Frick committee. on
                        which figured Mr. Harriman, the famous railway magnate, pre- sented a
                        scratching report to the Equituble board, whereupon Mr Hyde and Mr.
                        Alexander join- ed hands, forced Mr. Friok and Mr. Harriman n off the board,
                        and rejected the report, which Mr. Prick forthwith gave to the American
                        Press. </p>
                    <p>WHOLESALE INDICTMENT. </p>
                    <p>Its, disclosures were of the gravest nature. It was shown that Mr.
                        Alexander, with Mr. Hyde a and certain other persons, had sold bonds to the
                        amount of £2,600.000, indirectly, to the company. Mr. Hyde, the report
                        stated, “habi- tually involved the soceiety In transactions of great
                        magnitude without the previously ob- tained sanction of the executive
                        committee. He carried large amounts of stock belonging a to the society in
                        his own name without having first secured the authority of the society ; he
                        used the funds ot the society to pay for the “Cambon" dinner (one of his
                        entatious and extravagant entertainments given to the French Ambassador in
                        the United States), which be subsequently returned; he conducted and
                        participated in the profits of the syndicates described in his letter of
                        April 27, having frequently as a number of the executive com- mittee voted
                        for the purchase of such securi- <cb n="3"/>ties . . . and be has boon
                        guilty of other irregular acts. . . treating the society and Its affairs
                        largely as if they were his own Personal conoern.”</p>
                    <p>The officials of the company were no better than their muter. "Ai to the
                        other officers of the society, the committee found that a general looseness
                        has prevailed in the administration of the society affairs . . . and that
                        there is a general lacking in the organisation, of that Strong moral fibre
                        so essential for the accom- lishment of satisfactory results."</p>
                    <p>Other and not les serious charges were that the minutes had not been
                        properly kept, that the director* had failed to do their duty, and had
                        exercised purely nominal control over the company, and that their title to
                        office ni in Many cases open to question, since the stock needed to qualify
                        them wu transferred to them from Mr. Hyde by what wu practioclly a nominal
                        sale.</p>
                    <p>There farther disclosures naturally increased the anxiety and indignation of
                        the stockholders who had been plundered by Mr. Hyde, Mr. Alexander, and the
                        host of honored and re- spected names figuring among the directors and
                        Officials of the Equitable, and the demand was formulated that the oulprits
                        should be made to discharge their ill-gotten gains. Thirty Phila- delphian
                        policy holders, representing policies of over £1,000.000, brought an action
                        to secure the appointment of a receiver, on the ground that the Equitable

                    <p>That Mr. Hyde at the age of twenty-four FIXED hie own salary at £6,000, and
                        speedily raised it -to £90,000 ; that not oontent with his £90,COO he took
                        another £4,500 from the subsidary companies controlled by the Equita- ble ;
                        £3. 2O for salaries paid the Equitable to his personal servants - of which

                        proportion to his age, ability or raise of hie service, and caused Those of
                        his immediate friends or favorites to Be unduly advanced. He is mainly
                        responsible or the extravagant salaries allowed many executive officers. He
                        has been accustomed to raw large same; for expenses on his own uniterised
                        vouchers."</p>
                    <p>The same authority reported of Mr. Alex- auder that he participated in Mr.
                        Hyde's syndicate transactions, and accepted his share of the profit, that he
                        executed leases which proved to be detrimental to the society’s in- terests;
                        and that he failed to observe the 1 Obligations imposed on him.</p>
                    <p>It was stated in the two reports that Mrs. Jyde, the widow of the founder of
                        theranit- Ve and the mother of the young gentleman ho helped himself so
                        liberally to the funds of the company, received a pension of 65,000 per
                        annum from the company though her husband had made an immense fortune by the
                        dubious methods in which his son has followed him; that Mr. Alexander
                        received a salary of 20,000; and that his wife, if she survived him, with
                        farther guaranteed an annuity of 3,600; that three vice-preridents of the
                        company received £190,000 per annum between them; and that the salaries of
                        the cheif officials Had been increased 61 per cent in four years. It was
                        asserted that sums of from £4,000 to 7,400,000 belonging to the Equitable
                        were permitted to remain on deposit for a rate of interest much below that
                        prevailing in the open market, in banks and companies in which The officials
                        and directors of the Equitable were personally interested, and that the
                        great fi- Nancial girl of Kuhn, Loeb and Co., whioh had A member on the
                        board of the Equitable, had sold to it £10,000,000 of bonds in a period of
                        Five years.</p>
                    <p>STATE INTERVENTION. </p>
                    <p>In view of these disclosures the State authorities at last took action, and
                        suits have Been filled against forty-nine directors, calling upon them to
                        account for their conduct and to make restitution for moneys illegally
                        recieved And for gains wrongfully acquired.</p>

                        nature. The facts that the books of the company have been doctored and that
                        two Notes by which £e00,0o0 and £300.000 were transferred were signed by a
                        negro messenger In a receipt of a salary of £9 8s per week, is typical of

                    <p>The greatest crime of the Emperor Nero, that man of many and great crimes,
                        was, according to an unsympathetic friend of a collector of curious, that
                        committed when he bought the cloak which had belonged to Cato - for a sum
                        representing £700 of our present currency, and thereby became the father of
                        that multitude of men and women (but chiefly men) who collect curius of any
                        shape or form. Of such men there most at the present moment Be a great army,
                        and a list of the things they collect, together with an account of the
                        manner in which they conduct their purchase, would make a most thrilling
                        document The state- ment would receive additional piquancy if to it were
                        added the comments of the said un- sympathetic friend, especially if that
                        friend is of the collector’s household, and concerned with the housing and
                        preservation of some of the more bulky and sensational objects. More money
                        is said to ba spent—and, if we are to believe the anti-currie oollector,
                        more conning di-played, more envy, hatred, - and malice exhibited—on the
                        purchase and sale of curious of all sorts than on any other form of business
                        transaction, and more for genes are successfully launched in this con-
                        nexion than are dreamt of in the collectors philosophy. As for the perjuries
                        and lies whioh are the direct result of the collector’s mania, these (we are
                        still quoting the anti collector) are as the sand on tbs seashore for
                        numbers and as ink for depth of dye In connexion with personal curios the
                        Black Arts are supposed to be more frequently and Successfully practiced
                        than with any other objeot that excites the cure-hunter’s passi n. This
                        seems hardly surprising, seeing what excellent prices are paid for some of
                        these things. Thus, one of Ronssean's old coats was recently sold in Paris
                        for £30. and his brass watch for £50 while a French medical man , bought
                        Voltaire's walking-stick for £30. The wig of Kant, the philosopher, fetched
                        only £8; which seems a mean price when one recalls the fact that a hat of
                        Starne sold for £1,200 at a London auction, for surely a wig, being a nearer
                        neighbour to a great man's brain than his hat, should be accounted a more
                        valuable possession than a mere beaver .</p>
                    <p>But the fact that there is no balance in the valuation of curlos, and that
                        the whole “busi- ness” is only acrtiy, haphazard pursuit, is said to be
                        brought out by the fact (disseminated in France) that, whereas “an English
                        lord paid 680 for one of Newton’s teeth, the whole of The skull of
                        Descarates changed owners at Stockholm for the miserable pittance of £40!
                        Truly, collectors of curios are a strange com- munity. Bet it most he said
                        for them that, judging from appearances and hearsay, no savage on the
                        war-path and no detective in pursuit of criminals can have a more exciting
                        Career than is theirs as they hunt and scheme and intrigue in order to
                        possess themselves of Some coveted treasure.</p>
