                    <p>minary study, and consequently the interests of the varion* corporations will
                        , not be sufficiently taken intoXxrasideration. This is, however, quite
                        erroneous. The Egyptian Government has always made a point of consulting the
                        import and export trades of Alexandria before taking any measure that might
                        jeopardise thfiir interests. We have no doubt bat that the Government will
                        do so in the present case. As to the position of the Alexandria Municipality
                        in this matter,, we need merely state that the only step that has up to now
                        been taken has been the communication to that body of the project of the new
                        branch of the Canal. This scheme was submitted to the Municipality a few
                        months ago in order to be studied by the members of the Municipal
                        Commission. It was carefully drawn up by the able engineering authority* of
                        the Ports and Lighthouses-Administration, M. Malavel, who' may be called the
                        originator of the idea of the now branch. - The project has not yet been
                        brought officially to the cognizance of the members of the Municipal
                        Commission. One of the first conditions that the Municipality was prepared
                        to insist upon was that in no way should the free flow of the existing canal
                        be impeded lest in any case the purity of the present intake of the
                        Alexandria Water Company should vbe endangered by having a stagnant body of
                        water existing below the site of the intake. Since then the question- has
                        remained in statu quo. The Government has now to give a decision on the
                        matter, and will then doubtless consult the Municipality in order to take
                        its opinion as to the advisability of proceeding with the projeot. An
                        regards the Irrigation Department, trie scheme for a new maritime canal has
                        been brought'to the notice of the Inspector General of Irrigation for Lower
                        Egypt, but as yet no definite steps have been taken. A new branch does not
                        offer any objection from the point of view of irrigation, as it does not
                        entail the Irrigation Department’s giving any more water, which is the main
                        consideration with that department.</p>
                    <p>The actual scheme is the construction of a new salt-water canal running at
                        ses level from Gabbari to Nouxha, where it would step up to the canal level
                        by means of locks. It is obvious that such a scheme has many advantages. It
                        prevents the silting up al the harbour, will improve the railway
                        comniunications, relieve the congestion on the Mahiuoudieh Canal, and
                        improve the sanitary condition of the port During the last four years the
                        number of boats passing through the Menoufieh head lock at ' the barrage has
                        more than quadrupled and the number of boats passing through the tail lock
                        of the Mahmou- dieh Canal shows a similar increase. In 1905 the number of
                        boats passing Kafr Da war up and down stream was 30,438, and annually 20,500
                        boats ply on the Nquxha*Mii«et-el- Bassal reach. The congestion grows worse
                        every day, and the construction of the new branch is imperative, for it is
                        the only solution out of the difficulty. Alexandria is growing rapidly, and
                        will inevitably become not only the great outlet tor Egypt's railway
                        traffic, but tor the greater part of Africa. The Cape-to Cairo Railway
                        scheme may yet be far from being a “fait accompli,” but there is sure to be
                        a complete system of communications between North and South Africa by rail,
                        river, and lake in a few years’ time, and the outlet for this traffic will
                        be at Alexandria. The growth of the town westward will In a few years’ time
                        lead to one uninterrupted mass of buildings stretchingJrora Gabbari to Mex
                        and occupying every available site between sea and lake. Unless, therefore,
                        a decision is arrived at soon the scheme will not be feasible without
                        enormous extra cost for expropriations. At the present time the land-owners
                        interested in the promotion of the project are prepared to cede to the
                        Egyptian Government free of any charge, the land necessary for making the
                        new branch and they are ready to construct the canal under the supervision
                        of the Government. They further offer to give facilities for connecting tie
                        goods station at Gabbari through the Gabbari quarter with the new ways to
                        the west Under such favourable conditions .the new maritime canal could
                        easily be constructed, and it is to be hoped that the Government will not
                        lose the opportunity, for soon, owing to the rise in the value of the land
                        consequence on the development of the ffity westward, the canal will never
                        have a chance to be made without very great expense.</p>
