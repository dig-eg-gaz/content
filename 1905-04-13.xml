                    <head>THE LOTTERY LAW. DISTURBANCES AT CAIRO. MR. CATTAOUI’S HOUSE ATTACKED. </head>
                    <p>The discontent with the enactments of the new lottery law culminated in an
                        extraordi- nary scene which took place at Cairo this morning.</p>
                    <p>The law came into operation on Monday, and since then the police both in the
                        Capital and at Alexandria, have been most energetic in putting a stop to the
                        sale of lottery tickets in the streets. The hawkers of these tickets, who
                        were very numerous, have found that their occupation has come to an end and
                        great discontent has ensued. A con- siderable number of those public vendors
                        of lottery tickets are Jews, and they have been especially annoyed with the
                        leading members of their community at Cairo for not, as they think,
                        protecting them against the rigours of the new law by intervening on their
                        behalf. </p>
                    <p>These men considered that their source of livelihood need not have been
                        sacrificed if their richer brethren had Brought influence to bear on their
                        behalf and their resentment has found a vent in the person of Mr.
                        Cattaoui.</p>
                    <p>This morning a crowd of out-of-Work Jewish lottery ticket hawkers made their
                        way to that gentleman’s house. Their attitude was most menacing and a number
                        of the men forced their way into the house. The police had meanwhile been
                        summoned, and a strong force of mounted and foot police appeared on the
                        scene. Tho mounted policemen succeeded in dispersing the mob, and six of tho
                        ringleaders have been arrested.</p>

                    <head>ZIZINIA THEATRE. THE FOUNDLINGS’ GALA.</head>
                    <p>The success of yesterday evening’s "repre- sentation de gala" at the Zizinia
                        Theatre can only be described as colossal, and the long and varied programme
                        was gone through without a single hitch. The fete had been organised for the
                        benefit of the Alexandria AFoundlings’ Insti- tution, and for many weeks
                        past most elaborate preparations had been made to ensure success. The
                        committee of this worthy charity includes Mme. Pierre Girard, honorary
                        president; Comtesse de Zogheb, president; Mme. Christian Sinano, vice
                        president, and Mesdames Abbat, Charles Bacos, Chataway Bey, Gabriel Debbano,
                        Poilay Bey, Fred. Simond, Socolis, Emmanuel Zervudachi, Georges Zervudachi,
                        and Alex de Zogheb. These ladies are to be congratulated on the success
                        which has attended their efforts for the financial result of last night’s
                        perform- ance should place the charity on a satisfactory and permanent
                        footing. The theatre presented a brilliant aspect, and was filled with a
                        repre- sentative gathering of all sections of society at Alexandria,
                        including the Duke of the Abruzzi, Prince Omar Pasha Toussoun, and Prince
                        Haidar.</p>
                    <p>The first part of the performance consisted of a concert. The vocal items
                        were equisitely rendered by Mme Briend, Miss Claire Ricard, and Miss Verita,
                        while teo musical portion of the programme fell to such well-known local
                        musicians as Messrs. Affendoulis, Suzan, Ca- pozzi, Sheridan and Eurlich. A
                        great feature of this part of the entertainment was the fine recitation by
                        Poilay Bey of Baron Jacques de Menasce’s magnificent poem, "Les Bonnes
                        Euvres.” The concert was followed by that very amusing farce "Monsieur
                        Tranquille.” Here again Poilay Bey was an immense success and his efforts
                        were admirably seconded by Messrs. Rodocanachi and Lumbroso, who succeeded
                        in keeping the audience intensely amused by their vivacious acting.</p>
                    <p>The second part of the evenings entertain- ment was the fairy pautomine,
                        "Cinderella.” For a long time psst tales have been bruited about of the
                        fortunes that had been spent on the dresses, and the superb mounting of the
                        pantomine. But the most extravagant rumours had not been exaggerated, and
                        the gorgeous- ness of the mise en scene and the magnificence of the entire
                        performance beggar description. The story, which was in dumb show, was ar-
                        ranged by Poilay Bey after Perrault, while the music had been skilfully
                        adapted by Mr. Nicholas Sinadino. A clever prologue was composed and recited
                        by Mr. Rodocanachi. The story does not need telling, but it is no
                        exaggeration to say that the mounting of the pantomime could not have been
                        surpassed any- where. All those who took part had spared no expense on their
                        dresses and costumes, and the grouping of the performers and the expert
                        gracefulness of the dancing showed that no pains had been spared on
                        rehearsing. Cinder- ella’s role fell to Mrs. Charles Bacos, who im-
                        personated the heroine with a girlish grace which was as natural as it was
                        charming. Her Two sisters were Mrs. Critchley and Missde Tschudyy, who,
                        quite contrary to the usual pantomime traditions, rivalled the beauty of
                        their neglected sister. One of the most beautiful effects of the pantomime
                        was the make up of the Fairy Godmother, Mme de Planta, whose magnificent
                        costume became her splendid figure to a nicety. Mrs. Chataway looked and
                        acted the part of the Queen and her dress was much admired. Mr. Caravia as
                        Prince Charming and Mr. Constantinides as the King were very good. Poilay
                        Bey was again a tremendous success as the Lord High Chamberlain. It would be
                        invidious to single out any of the lesser parts where all were so good, but
                        among the Dukes the costume of Baron Alfred de Meuasce was especially admir-
                        ed, and he looked very striking in his Vandyck garb. We must reserve full
                        descrip- tive details for another issue, but we must not omit to mention the
                        Cake Walk at the con- clusion, in which Baron Rene de Menasce and Mr. Ramsay
                        brought down the house.</p>

                        held at Winchester House, London, E.C., on the 7th inst., at 12 o’clodk
                        noon. Sir Frederic Fryer, K.G.S.I., chairman of the company, presiding. The
                        Secretary (Mr. Chas. I. Gardiner) having read the notice convening the
                        meeting,</p>
                    <p>The Chairman said :- Gentlemen, —This company was registered on the 9th of
                        January 1905, There was a phenomonal subicription, which amounted to
                        £3,527,678. The prelimin- ary expenses, which were estimated at £2,500,
                        amounted to £3,831.8.11. The excess was due to a larger number of shares
                        being applied for through brokers, and bankers, than was anticipa- ted. One
                        of our directors, Mr. Mack, has resign- ed his seat on the Board, owing to
                        his absence from England, and to the pressure of his other business. Another
                        director, Mr. Sellon, is, I regret to say, too ill to attend. We have a good
                        deal of business in view in Egypt. As yet we have merely realised a small
                        profit in thw shape of dividends and interest in the ordinary course of
                        business. Our managing director in Egypt has, however, ten or twelve
                        promising invest mentsts in view. The situation in regard to them is not
                        sufficiently advanced to go into details regarding them. The flotation of
                        one company by our company is practically complete, and the flotation of
                        another is very near comple- tion. The Board expects that these flotations
                        will show substantial profits when they have been brought to a successful
                        issue. At our next meeting it will be possible to go more into detail, and
                        it may be trusted that our business will by then have developed into a
                        profitable, and paying concern. We have the greatest confidence in Mr. Abdy,
                        who has given every attention to our interests. A representative of the
                        company has spent a little, over a month in Egypt, and has been in
                        consultation with Mr. Abdy. Owing to the distance of Egypt from London, it
                        takes some time for full information of proposed trans- actions to reach
                        London, and therefore, as was stated in the prospectus of the company, wide
                        powers have been given to the local management in Egypt. It will, we
                        confidently expect, soon be amply demonstrated that these powers have been
                        made good use of. As regards the prosperity of Egypt,-it seems to have come
                        to stay, as it is due largely to the fact that, owing to continued security
                        in Egypt, the natives of the country and Levant- ines are producing and
                        using wealth wich, during old troubled days, lay dormant and unknown. This
                        latent wealth has now come to light and a new era of commercial and indus-
                        trial prosperity has opened for Egypt. Our company has been formed
                        concurrently with this new cycle of prosperity, and will, it may be trusted,
                        be of benefit to Egypt in directing the disposal of the accumulated wealth
                        of the country into useful channels.</p>

                    <head>IMPORTANT SALE OF LAND.</head>
                    <p>The Wakfs Administration sold on Thursday last a part of the lands on tho
                        Rhoda Island belonging to the estate of the late Aly Pasha Cherif, which,
                        being situated near the north end of the island, will not fail to benefit
                        large- ly by the opening of the new Nile bridges. As miight have been
                        expected, the price obtain ed at the auction was higher than that lately
                        paid for adjoining land, and we hear that the purchasers, Messrs.
                        Zervudachi, have also bought up a lease that had five years to run on part
                        of the land.</p>

                    <head>THE DUKE OF THE ABRUZZI.</head>
                    <p>A largely attended reception was given yesterday afternoon on board the
                        Italian cruiser "Liguria”.</p>
                    <p>The Duke of the Abruzzi attended the Zizinia Theatre yesterday evening. This
                        morning at 8 o’clock the "Liguria" left Alexandria for Spezzia. </p>
                    <p>The Duke was graciously pleased to accept a copy of the work "Il Signor
                        Marejo" from Signor Marchi Matteo.</p>

                    <head>PRINCE COLIBRI.</head>
                    <p>Through the kindness of the courteous im- presario of this startling
                        exhibition, we were enabled to satisfy our curiosity as to the truth or
                        otherwise of the statement that “His Highness," whose height was given as 23
                        1/2 inches, only weighed 7 lbs. 10 ounces. Upon the suggestion of his
                        manager that we should see for ourselves, we visited the Alhambra Theatre
                        yesterday afternoon about 6 p m. Hero we were formally introduced to "Prince
                        Colibri," who, upon rising from his tiny chair (which might have served for
                        a doll’s house) offered his hand and bade us welcome in excel- lent English.
                        Resuming his seat, he entered upon a lively conversation, during which we
                        had an opportunity of convincing ourselves that we had certainly seen “the
                        smallest man in the world.” His manager was good enough to allow us to take
                        "His Highness" in our arms and place him upon the ground, very much to the
                        amusement of the ladies and gentlemen present, who declared the com- parison
                        to be accurately suggestive of a scene from “Gulliver’s Travels." His
                        Highness ap- peared to appreciate his released position, and strutted
                        lightly across the room with all the dignity of his title. He is a smart
                        little fellow, although 23 years of ago ; and quite distinct from other
                        similar freaks of nature, in being perfectly symmetrical, and even hand-
                        some in appearance. We shall be surprised if the public do not take the
                        opportunity afford- ed them of inspecting this remarkable speci- men of
                        humanity, which should have special interest for the medical faculty. He is
                        on view daily, from 5 till 11 p.m. </p>

                    <head>AMATEUR ATHLETIC SPORTS. THIRTY FIRST ANNUAL MEETING.</head>
                    <p>This great annual sporting event at Alex- andria came off yesterday on the A.
                        S. C. grounds in glorious weather, the heat of the sun being tempered by a
                        deliciously cool breeze. Notwithstanding the fact that the reception held on
                        board the Italian cruiser "Liguria” by the Duke of the Abruzzi drew away a
                        number of people who would otherwise have been present, there was a bumper
                        attend- ance of the public, the grandstand and enclo- sure being crowded,
                        while the usual contingent of carriages lined the other side of the course
                        in a double row. The members of the fair sex turned up in full force, and
                        gave a bright colour to the surroundings. Some of the frocks worn were very
                        smart indeed, and more than one called for especial admiration. Where so
                        many were pretty, however, it would be in- vidiuus to single out any
                        particular ones for special mention, though eo may remark that the pervading
                        colour was white. Children, too, were there in their numbers, and fairly
                        revelled in the sports.</p>
                    <p>The entries for the sports were far ahead o last year's, and taken all round
                        the perform- ances were better, although the adverse wind quite spoiled the
                        times in all the events except the half mile. The handicapping was cer-
                        tainly very good, as exemplified by the close finishes in many events, and
                        by the fact that there were no less than three dead heats for either second
                        or third. Handicapping is a very thankless task, but we think the four
                        gentle- men responsible for yesterday’s starts and penalties are to be
                        congratulated on their work. We also think the revised scale of points for
                        Lord Cromer's Championship Cup is a great improvement, and mediocre
                        performers are now much less likely to be accidentally styled “champion.”
                        Yesterday's champion (J. R. Lees) fully deserved his honor, as he is a good
                        all-round athlete.- He picked up his points all along the programme, and
                        although heonly got one first, that-first marked him as the fastest man on
                        the course. He was deservedly applauded as he came up to get his cup.
                        Callender, as usual, won the shot putting, but by a very small margin from
                        his generously handicapped opponent. (Callender has now won four clocks for
                        1st in this event. If he intends winning it again next year might we suggest
                        a change of rewards). McLean, the veteran athlete, this year has been the
                        unfor- tunate victim of several accidents in training and appeared on the
                        course after two weeks' abstention from the path and well-bandaged. He won
                        the pole jump with 8ft. 3in., no further height being necessary, but his
                        injuries prevent- ed him from doing himself justice in the hurdles and long
                        jump. Byrne’s jump of 18ft. lOin. was a good one. Woodley deserves special
                        mention as the winner of the 150 yards, 220 yards, and quarter-mile
                        handicaps. He has run several times before but has never been so successful.
                        His starts were a bit longer than last year's, but he was well trained and
                        finished his races very strongly. Thurston annexed the high jump and got
                        second in the pole jump. Blyth- man, who was second in the hundred yards,
                        was expected to win the half, and to do well in the quarter, two races in
                        which he occupied the post of honor, but the pace in both was either too
                        hot, or he was off colour and could only get in fourth in each. Peel, who
                        won the half-mile in good time, is the third member of the same family who
                        has won this race.</p>
                    <p>At the conclusion of the sports the prizes were kindly distributed by Mrs, E.
                        B. Gould, to whom the committee presented a handsome bouquet. The course was
                        in excellent condi- tion and reflects great credit on the clerk of the
                        course, Mr. F. C. Haselden, to whom also is due the intricate construction
                        of the obstacles in the obstacle race. The thanks of the com- mittee are due
                        to Admiral Sir Massie Blomfield and to the steamship companies. Prince,
                        Moss, and Khedivial, for the flags, etc., with which the grand-tand and
                        course were profusely decorated. The bands of the R. Berkshire Regiment
                        discoursed a choice selection of music during the afternoon, which was
                        greatly appreciated. Mr. Percy Carver’s absence was greatly felt, and we
                        trust his trip home will thoroughly re-establish him after his recent
                        illness. Mr. S. H. Carver took his place as judge this year and, with Mr. G.
                        C. Stevenson, ably discharged the onerous duties. The referee was seldom
                        requisitioned.</p>
                    <p>The following are the results of the various events:—</p>

                    <p>15 entries. Carmichael looked all over a winner until five yards from the
                        tape, when Woodley passed him and won by half a yard. Third close up. Time,
                        16 3/5 secs.</p>

                    <p>19 entries. Lees, the favorite for this, came away from the start and kept
                        his lead, passing the post a winner by a yard and a half ; a desperate
                        tussle between Blythman and Mc Lean for 2nd place ended in favor of Blythman
                        by inches. Inches again separated McLean rom Byrne. Time 11 3/5 secs.</p>
