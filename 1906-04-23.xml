                <p>AKABA IN ANCIENT TIMES.
                    Political events often bring into prominer.ee tho most out-of- be way places on this earth. Pendji and Fashoda ware little heard of unti they bsoame the scenes of events of serious and important politioal* incidents. Now Aka bah, an out-of-the-way pl town it oan hardly be oalled, for it a duster of houses with an inferior bazaar whioh ’ nestles nndsr the walls of the Turkish fort—becomes the scene cf a politioal episode whioh raisei it importance. The dispute pver the Egyptian- Turkish frontier, whioh is now oxeroising the minds of politicians, is but the latest phase of a problem whioh has existed for thonsahds of years. As the Egyptians and the Turks now dispate over the line of demarcation, so the Assyrians and the Pharaohs disputed over the same matter in the early years of the eighth oentnry before oar era.
                    The neighbourhood of the Wady Bl Arish, the western terminns of the somewhat arbitrarily drawn frontier, has been the soene of two or more battles in anoient times whioh have had considerable influencoon future history. In B o. 714, Sargon, the vV >r of S .maria, defeated the Egyptian, or rather'Ethiopian, Army atRaphia, betwren Gaza and El Ariah; while, twelve years latter,Sennacherib overthrew tbeSyro Egyptian allies in the battle of Eltekeb, followed by the siege c f Jerusalem, and the submiiaion of He zekiah. The frontier line in dispute passe* across the limestone plateau of Bt-Tih, ‘ desert of the wanderings, end terminates which resembles the Sahara in its barrenness, deserted by men and beast The first is the Haj, Pilgrim, road, whioh started from Ismailia, Kentara, “the bridde,” and terminated at Akabah, where the caravans halted prior to continuing their weary jonrney along the ooast of Arabia toJeddah and Meooa. The road is now but litt’.e used, and consequently, the inhabitants of Akabah do not reap the rich harvest they formerly did. A seoond road of much greater importance and antiqnity is the 8yrian road, whioh terminates at Gsza. This is one of the oldest trade roatee in the world, being the channel by which the wealth of Midian Edim and Yemen was conveyed to Syria and Egypt It was in nse long before the time of Solomon, and waa the route by whioh the Midianite merchants oatried Joseph into Bgypt. It was certainly used by traders and others as early as the Twelfth Egyptian Dynasty, and was the ronte by which Sinnit fled to Midian in the reign of Amen-em-hat III. It is frequently referred to in the Mioean iascriptions, and in text of the Persian period there is a reference I the deliverenoe of some merohants from the K ng of Persia beyond the river, probably Cambyses, then advancing on Egypt During the Crusades it waa in their hands, and Rainald du Chatillon was in 1182 Qover- of Akabah. The town of Akabah is also of historical importance, though little remains to it now. Situated at the head ol the gulf to which it give* its name, whioh is to be identified as the Biblioal Gulf of Elsk, it represents the emporium which Solomon founded on the Red Sea for trade with tbs mythical Opbir. Forming ai it does the terminal of the great fault or gorge which runs from the north of Palestine tonth, and in- oladee in its depression the Jordan valley, the Lake of Galilee, the Dead Sea—with the rooky channel of the Wady Akabah—it represents the outlet, no doubt, of some great river bed whioh in far remote ages had its month in the gulf. The surface water which rolls down from the slopes of El Share and the Wady Akabah briDga aufficient nourishment for a fringe of. palm groves and vegetation to clothe the shore, and to form a pleasing variation to the arid desert and glariog rooks which are all around.
                    The prosperity of the part in anoient times has now disappeared, and indeed there ia considerable doubt as to it having existed. Of the travellers who have visited the site Rap- pell, Barkbart, Belle, and later Sir R. Burton and Mr/Wilfrid Blunt, none of them appear to have been able to find any trace of really anoient ruins. The only remains of antiqnity are found on the island of Farnn—Pharaoh’i island, near Waait—bnt this, as now seen, does not appear to be older than Roman times , but oertaiuly oooupied and enlarged in crusading tilhea, and afterwards oooupied by Salad in, who in 1167 a.d. is said to have driven tbs Infidels oat by carrying ships on oamel back - from Cairo. If the rains are not antique, there is a decided evidenoe of raoial antiquity iu tbs inhabitants of this aod the opposite coast They differ entirely from the $edouin, being lighter in oolonr, more aotive, and indeed might be oonsidered to have some Somali affinities. They are found all along the Arabian ooaat north of Jeddah. Their sonroe of livelihood is ostensibly pearl and ooral fishing, bnt many a orew of coasting vessels has fonnd that they make first olase pirates. Only a few months ago a native dhow from Suakin was wrecked on this ooast, stripped of everything valuable, and the orew are still miaeing.
                    Daring recent years Akabah has revived little owing to the completion of the Da- aaoua Maan railway, whioh it is intendod to extend to this town ; and its forerunner, the telegraph, has reached it already. The Turks daring the interminable Yemen rebellion have oonveyed troops to Maan by rail and marched them down to Akabah, taking them thence by sea to the seat of war. The reported 3,000 men at Akabah now ia probably a great exaggeration of nomberi, for they would soon at the inhabitants ont of house and Some. The troops here are probably waiting oouvey- ance to Yemen. Of the fort at Dliaba or Tabah, there appears to have been do knowledge until recently, and it does not appear on any map, not even on the Egyptian official map, and I aminolined to agree with Mr. W.
                    S. Blunt, who regards it as a very modorn oonstrnotioo. One word of warning to thoso who imagine a great future for this region. We hoar oonatantly of gold aud oopper uiinde In these regions, and ol great development*. but in a land whioh lacks all the essential* of oommeroial snooses—water, wood, ooal, and, above all, labour—snob mining operations are impossible, and in addition tho natives sro trne sons of I-hmael, with their hand against every man aud every man’s band against them, ("The Glob*").

                <p>At San Francisco the homeless are enoamp- ed in the parks and open spaces, the wealthy alongside the poorest : all efforts are concentrated on sheltering and rationing : the people are very orderly : gre\t hopes are entertained of saving the snbnrb called Western Addition and northwards to Presidio, bat the fire along the Waterfront is still uncontrolled and fanned by a strong northwest wind which threatens the ferry, the only means of egress from the city. The broken watermains are being restored. Operatio stars, inolnding Signor Caruso and Sembrich, escaned in night attire, one artist barefooted and in pyjamas olutohing his violin.</p>
                <p>President Roosevelt recommended Congress to vote an additional 1,500,000 dollars for the relief of the sufferers at San Francisco, as it appears that the disaster is the most appalling one in the history of the country. All the mails in the Post Office were saved and 11 of the clerks were extricated alive but unconscious, having been foodless and waterless for three days.	(Reuter</p>

                <head>NATIVE PRESS OPINIONS</head>
                <p>Native Press opinions on the increase of the Army of Ocoopation are decidedly interesting. The ‘ Moayad,” after denying the statement that Gbszi Mukhtar Pacha bad claimed for Turkey the right to construct a line to Suez whioh would place Egypt at the mercy of an Ottoman army, continues : ‘ Now that the pilgrim route has been changed, Tabah becomes of no importance to Egypt and the Suzerain Empire, which has alresdy reoccupied all the posts on the E. side of the Golf of Akaba, wishes to come into possession of Tabah for the same purpose, viz., in the interests of the pilgrims. In our opinion it has every right to do so. We fail to see the threats, on which English newspapers have enlarged, in the Ghazi’s answer. After all, his Excellency is not responsible for the deductions of overexcited journalists. What then is the chief object of this augmentation of our Army of Occupation at a moment when all is profoundly peaoefol in the oountry and Egyptians see in the Tabah question nothing that concerns them deeply, and are ready to agree to any solution of the difficulty ! (The italics are ours). The deoision has then been taken against the Ottoman Empire and not
                    against Egypt and its people	The policy
                    is unwise ; it can only draw the attention of Egyptians to something far more important than theactual dispute: The question whether England intends to push the Akaba question to a point where the relations between the two countries would be dangerously strained Is this to England’s advantage ! Can England depend on the Egyptian Government so far in a quarrel over the insignificant post of Tabah ! And can the Egyptian Government follow England to the end !
                    The “Lewa” is briefly indignant. “Great Britain,” says our contemporary, has decided to reinforce her garrison in Egypt, and yet there is nothing in the oountry to oall for such a deci si id, especially a3 Lord Cromer does not need an army to realise his wishes in the Egyptian Government but does so with the assent of the Egyptian authorities, aud by the issue of the necessary decrees. The reason of the increase is attributable to the occupation of Tabah by the Turks. Whom, then, does England want to threaten ! Is it the Egyptians who, if they are interested in this matter, are so out of a natural sentiment that none can question ? Does she desire thereby to threaten the Ottoman Empire! We know that there is not a Tark who allows himself to be influenced by these threats whioh have no effeot on the policy of the Empire.Does she desire to farther annoy the Egyptians 1 We are in a position to assure her that the Egyptians are driven quite wild abo:t the Ocoupation and that she need not employ fresh methods to attain this end.’’
                    Of “Al Ahram” we have already spoken. “A I Watan” has devoted two articles to the subject. In the first it remarks: “This increase, like the Occupation, may be useful to us (i.e., the Copts). But England has a reason for this aotion, especially since the present Government has all along opposed any increase of expenditure on the Empire’s military forces.”
                    The article concludes vaguely with the remark that while the Akaba affair has perpaps been the oause of this aotion by H.B.M.’s Government nothing can be defiaitely known. In any case the sudden inorease will be a good lesson.
                    Id a second article “Al Watan” expresses its couviotiou that Lord Cromer is alone responsible for the increase of the British forces in Egyyt, and, unheard of comment, declares that newspapers ought not to lay down the law on subjects on which they know nothing. We had thought that that was their ‘ raison d’etre.”
                    We heartily agree with “Al Watan” in deprecating all blaster against the Turkish High Commissioner which will very likely have the opposite effeot to that intended. The Government will oertainly not follow any such course.
                    “Al Gawareb el Masrieh” says:—“What signification is to be given to the deoision of the British Cabinet to increase the effective of thq British garrison in Egypt ? Who knows the truth! Simple tolk attribute it to a crisis between the Egyptian and Tarkish Governments. Bat th's hypothesis has been refuted by the declarations of the British Foreign Office. Other and wiser heads consider that it is merely an answer to the increase of the Ottoman force at Akaba. This hypothesis is more probable, and if it be correct no one and nothing are the worse for the change—except the Egyptian Treasury.
                    "Germany may be in the background but we know that her intervention is not dangerous for she has before now given ground at the last moment. We therefore request the Ghazi and our own diplomats not to push matters too far and so avoid all unpleasant consequences of the dispute. The Egyptian nation wishes to see no hindrance to the economic development ct the country, which it considers of far greater importance than Tabah and Akaba. Finally, we hope than none of our clever heads will foment troubles here as they did when the Macedonian question was raised and that diplomats of the two countries will be allowed to settle the dispute in a manner advantageous to both sides.”

                <head>ALEXANDRIA HORTICULTURAL EXHIBITION</head>
                <p>The annual exhibition of the Alexandria Horticultural Society was held at San Stefano on Saturday and yesterday, and was on both days visited by large crowds of people, the attendance, we believe, exceeding that of last year. The show was opened as usual by H. H. the Khedive, wLo arrived at the Casir.o with his accustomed punctuality at 4 p.m. on Saturday, accompanied by H. E. the Governor.
                    His Highness was received at the entrance by H. H. Prince Hussein Pacha Kamel, Ad miral Sir Masrie Blomfield, and the other members of the committee, who accompanied the Khedive on his tour of the buildiDg and tents. His Highness evinced the greatest interest in all he saw and after congratulating the committee on the success of their efforts, departed, as he had arrived, attended by the Governor and snite. Immediately after the Khedive’s departure the general public were admitted to view the exhibits.
                    The two principal features of this year’s show were the great interest that was taken in Prince Hussein’s £30 prize pelargoniums aud the enormous number of exhibits of vegetables. The pelargoniums were sufficient in number 1j fill a large tent aud the exhibits of vegetables were over 600 in number. The committee initiated a new movement this year, which was, that on Sunday morniDg they arranged with M. Monfront, the capable gardener of the Municipality, who had been cne of the vegetable judges, to give an object- lesson to the natives in order that the latter should understand how to stage their exhibits* and how to select their vegetables for the show
                    The large ballroom of the Casino was crowded with valuable plants grown in hothouses. In the middle of the room were three groups of oaladiums, in which olass the competition was extremely keen between M. Zsrvudaohi and M. Kindinico. To the ordinary pablio it seemed as if M. Kindinico, who only obtained the second prizi, had the more beautiful collection, but doabtless the judges were influenced in favour of M. Zervudachi because of the faot that the leaves of his plants were finer, and were perhaps grown more according to the ideis of the present day, whioh, we believe, are to withdraw the smaller leaves to give strength to the larger. The four enormoas groups of orotous had a pleasing effect from the variety of thsir leaves. M. Salvago well deserved the first prizd, as the plants were covered with foliage from the bottom of the stems, and were well-grown plants. The three other groups certainly exceeded those of former years, and amongst them the group of Hassan Bey Raspem showed an extraordinarily beauti- fal variety of tints on the leaves. M. E. C. Zervadachi’s large group had the merit of containing several fine plants which we have seen in former years, thereby showing the attention he must pay to his garden in order to keep such specimens as marautha, theo- riums, et?., which require so much oare to keep them in a healthy condition. The Begonia Rex, which are generally such a feature of the Alexandria Show, were somewhat of a disappointment this year; all the usual competitors seemed to have failed from one oause or another with the exception of M. Kindinico, who staged a good group. There was a remarkable exhibit (not for competition) of orchids, shown by Hissan Bey Rassem, placed on a long table, aud near by were the orchids of M. Zarvad one of which was never known to fl iwer before in Egypt So overcrowded was the ballroom that another room had to be requisitioned for the flue palms of M. Salvago, the autheriums of Bartau Bey, and the two fine specimen plants which were placed close to the entrance.
                    A feature of the Alexandria show has always been the enormous groups of palms and zmal pelargoniums. Th se filled almost the whole of the largest tent and were quite equal to former years. The only other exhibit of importance in this tent was a good oolleotioa of carnations, staged by Mme Debbace. The progress which has been made by the Municipality sinoe the gardens were taken over by M. Monfront was shown by the large collection of nearly every kind of annual whioh he staged. In consequence of Prince Hussein having graciously offered an objet d’art of the value of £30, great interest has been taken in pelargoniums. The prize was won by Mr. L. Sanders with forty good plants oovered with flowers of nearly every shade imaginable. The pelargoniums had been well-grown, were staged with effeot, and merited the priz?. Mme Deb- fane was near enough for the jndges to award her a silver medal. Fine collections were also staged by M. Benaohi, M. Salvago, and others.
                    The silver gilt medal offered by the Royal Horticultural Society of London for the best collection of roses as out flowers was awarded to Mr. Sandars, the silver medal going to M. Kindinico. Mrs. Crafton staged the best rose in the Bhow. Mr. Percy Carver always shows a good oolleotion of sweetpeas and as a true amateur of flowers, never fails to give the proper names. He showed two boxes this year, but we are not sure that they were so good as those we saw three years ago. Mrs. Borohgre- vink’s anemones, iris, and large oolleotion of out flowers all won first prizes, and among the new competitors who distinguished themselves were Mrs Borton and Mrs. Richmond.
                    The table decorations this year were not so numerous as usual. Miss Hewat took first prize with a design in yellow roses and dark folisge, Mrs. Magnus the second with an arrangement of red pelargoniums, and Miss G. T. Atkin was highly commended for a table with salmon coloured roses ; but the feature of the room was certainly Miss E. B. Atkin’s original idea of decorating a table as a reminiscence of the first show held at San Stefano. The flowers were plaoed in little
                </p>
            </div>
            <cb/><!-- column break --><div type="item">
                <p>boxes, similar to the boxes in whioh exhibits are shown in the tent of out flawers. The names of the exhibitors were added and the flowers selected were those generally exhibited by the members who gained the prizes. Miss Atkin had even remembered those who generally stage vegetables and she had grouped probably the smallest potatoes, cabbages, asparagas, that have ever been seen at an exhibition.
                    The prettiest vase of flowers was that shown by Mme Zervudaohi with yellow broom, and Miss Hewat obtained two prizes for flowers which had been most artistically arranged.
                    Amongst the vegetables staged by amateurs, the large group shown by Bartau Bay. for which a silver medal was awarded, aud the collection of Mr. F. Haselden well merited attention. The native exhibits oooupied a large amount of space and were certainly an improvement on former years.
                    The following were the judges
                    Pot Plants and Cut Flowers : Messrs. Ebell, Eggert, Ghyselu, Hassan Rausem Bey, Seffer and Tramontina.
