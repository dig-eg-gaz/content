					<head>OUR CONSULS.</head>
					<p>Mr. Ernest William makes some suggestons in "The Standard" for improving our
						consular system, from the point of view of the commercial world. He would
						have Consuls placed under the control of the Board of Trade as well as of
						the Foreign Office, and he would compel them to pass examinations before
						appointment Consols, he argues, should be mapped out into two
						divisions—those in which owing to the lack of commerce or the preponderating
						character of other matters demanding the Consol’s attention (such, for
						example, as certain of the posts in the Near Bast), the Board of Trade would
						not need to interfere, and the candidate would not need to hold a commercial
						diploma ; and those in which commerce is of importance. To the former class
						the Foreign Office coaid appoint, with or without power of veto in the Board
						of Trade ; to the other the Board of Trade could appoint, with simply power
						of veto in the Foreign Office.</p>
					<p>But the mention of mapping out the world’s British consulates calls to mind
						another reform which is needed. The consular posts themselves need to be
						rearranged and expended. Is it not, for example, ridiculous to have a Consul
						at Florence, where neither trade nor Oriental politics nor shipping demands
						such an officer, and at Milan, one of the chief centres of Italian industry,
						only a Vice-Consul, who need not be an Englishman, and who, we believe, only
						gets something like £60 a year, out of which he buys his own stationery. Of
						course, he can give but a small portion of his time to the important
						interests of British trade, which the Consul in that city might further.
						Why, again, should the Riviera possess numerous Consuls, while some
						important manufacturing towns in the interior of France possess none ? Most
						flagrant discrepancy of a 1, why should Austria-Hungary, a great and
						important commercial country, have but seven British Consuls, while little
						Greece has four teen ? Even in Germany the same thing is seen. The Empire
						contains but twenty-eight British consular officers ; and Spain has forty
						eight. All this must be changed. Of course, the Foreign Office mast be
						allowed to retain its consular representatives in places where here are real
						diplomatic reasons for a British representative, even though there be no
						trade, but there are many posts in which there is neither trade nor
						diplomacy to serve. By striking these off the list the number of commercial
						Consuls can he increased without increasing the total service.</p>
					<p>Even, however, a total increase in the consular service must not be boggled
						at if good cause can be shown for representation in more places that the
						present number of Consuls would serve ; and there is one important direction
						io which a considerable increase in he total number of commercial consular
						officers is necessary. We refer to the Colonie?. With our Colonies we
						already do a third of our total foreign trade, and we expect to do with them
						a large proportion in the future; yet throughout the Daughter States of the
						Empire there is not a single Government official analogous to a Consul. It
						seems absurd ; yet, of course, one hw only to think what a Consul is—the
						representative of Great Britain in a foreign country- to see how it has come
						about that we have no Consuls in the Colonies. Consols so called, and
						fulfilling some of the functions of Consuls, we most continue to do without;
						but that is no reason why we should not have commercial Consuls, and thus is
						every reason why we should have plentiful supply of them. One obvious reason
						is that foreign Powers have their Consols in our Colonies busy furthering
						the trade of their respective nationalities, and as for practical purposes
						of business Australia and Canada are to us as much foreign markets as Japan
						or the United States, our trade suffers so long as the mannfactnrers of the
						Mother-country are not represented by Government officials in the Daughter
						States.</p>
					<p>It is also suggested—and we are quoting now from proposal's made by consular
						officers themselves, who have given study to the question— that an inspector
						of Consuls should be appointed to visit the Consuls periodically and remove
						inefficient officers from their posts. This proposal is, we believe, to be
						embodied in the American reform.</p>
					<p>We must find room in conclusion for one more reform. Consular officers should
						in all cases be in every sense Englishmen. Without casting any reflection
						upon the gentlemen serving as British Consols who are natives of the country
						to which they are appointed, it is obvious that their national ties most
						create some bias in favour of their own country—sufficient to mitigate their
						devotion to British trade; and it is noteworthy that one of the objects
						sought in the present reconstruction of the American consular service is the
						supersession of foreigners by Americans, to be obtained through such
						increase in remuneration as will permit Americans to fill the post It would
						pay us to follow America’s example.</p>

					<p>A Bankers' Bank Wanted.</p>
					<p>Lord Cromer, in the chapter on banking in his report, remarks: “In a oonntry

						obtainable, it must often be a temptation to bank managers to borrow large
						sums from the market on short terms for employment in advances. After
						examining the balance sheets of most of the leading banks, I cannot help
						thinking that it is worth the attention of the Directors to consider whether
						the proportion of their liabilities covered by cash, by money at call on
						short notice, or by first class securities should not be increased. This
						consideration confirms me in the view which I have long held, that it is
						most advisable that an institution should exist in this country which will,
						to a certain extent, be what is termed “the Bankers’ Bank,’’ and which in
						the event of a commercial crisis, would be able to afford assistance to
						institutions which might find themselves in temporary difficulties.”</p>

					<p>DIPLOMATIC VIEWS.</p>
					<p>The “Diplomatic”correspondent of the “Pall Mall Gazette” remarks:—“In certain
						diplomatic circles, notably those where representatives of the smaller
						Powers speak their views, the opinion is being expressed that England is
						wholly in the wrong over the boundary question, and that there is little
						doubt that Germany is of the same way of thinking, however neutrally she may
						outwardly comport herself. The English attitude is regarded as provocative,
						in that it attempts to prevent, or at any rate nullify, the fortification of
						Akaba, since Akaba is practically commanded by Tabah, and who so holds the
						latter may as well (strategically speaking) be possessed of the former
						also.</p>
					<p>“The feeling in London generally seems not so optimistic as foreign
						correspondents report of their respective centres. The Opposition seems to
						consider the Government to be somewhat slow to realise possible
						contingencies in Egypt. Upon these, most undoubtedly, Turkey is relying, and
						for this reason her present action is placed on a totally different footing </p>
					<cb n="3"/>
					<p>from many former exploits of the Sublime Porte. Indeed, not until she has
						lost all hope of a Moslem rising in Egypt will she withdraw. At the same
						time the Ottoman Ambassador has proved more conciliatory in bearing if no
						less firm on the points at issue ”</p>
					<p>Diplomatically speaking, we enjoy the support not only of France but of
						Russia, who has made the strongest representations to the Sultan. This
						proceeding is but part of the new Anglophile policy of Russia—a policy which
						may lead her in certain eventualities to take concerted action with us. For
						this, however, the price asked is something nearly if not quite exorbitant.
						It is well, known to interested onlookers that Russia has been renewing her
						efforts towards a general “understanding” with England on the Near Eastern
						question, and the present crisis is providing her with an opportunity of
						pressing her views upon the British Government. The discussion of these
						views must be at present reserved. It will be sufficient to indicate that
						they embrace the whole subject of the spheres of influence north of
						Afghanistan, and deal with the ultimate fate of Constantinople “ in certain
						eventualities.” Certain diplomats in London declare that the knowledge of
						these Russian overtures has also operated towards precipitating the present
						crisis, the hope being to provoke some show of “Pan-Islamist” feeling as a
						danger signal to Europe. Such are the cross-currents of international
						political</p>
				</div>
				<div type="item">
					<p>AUSTRIAN OPINION.</p>
					<p>The correspondent of the “Daily Telegraph” at Vienna states that the attitude
						of Turkey both towards England and Persia is being followed in authoritative
						quarters there with the greatest attention. No attempt is made to conceal
						the fact that the Egyptian conflict in particular might possibly assume a
						serious character, first of all for the quite comprehensible reason that
						England would under no conditions allow Turkey to remain in possession of
						the point on the Sinai Peninsula recently occupied by her, as this would
						seriously injure British prestige in Arabia.</p>
					<p>The real danger of the situation, however, is seen in the circumstance that
						this Turkish usurpation is connected with the religious and Mohamedan
						question. Turkey wishes to be in possession of the direct road to Mecca, in
						order again to prove to the entire world of Islam that she is the true
						protectress and ruler of Islam.</p>
					<p>Moreover, reasons exist there at the present moment for the belief that
						Turkey is supported in her proceedings against England by a Continental
						Power, and everyone acquainted with the matter knows that this Power can
						only be Germany. Without such support it would be inexplicable that the
						Porte should take up such an offensive attitude against Egypt and England.
						The opinion is also pretty widespread that what Turkey seeks for the
						abandonment of her pretensions to the occupied point is simply compensation
						from England. It is, of course, understood that the Sultan's idea of
						compensation in this matter lies in the 3 per cent, supplementary Customs
						duty so ardently desired by him</p>
					<p>Any complication between Turkey and Egypt would naturally involve a serious
						reaction upon the Balkan Peninsula, for which reason every thing possible
						would be done in Vienna to restrain the Porte from farther aggressive steps.
						It is, however, known there for certain that no Power contemplates
						intervention, as England alone is in a position to undertake any mediation
						with regard to Egypt.</p>

					<p>GOVERNMENT EMPLOYES’ SALARIES.</p>
					<p>The Financial Adviser will submit to-morrow to the Council of Ministers,
						which will meet in Alexandria, under the presidency of H.H. the Khedive,
						that part of the report of Lord Cecil’s Commission which concerns the
						salaries of the petty officials of the Government. The principle established
						in 1901 remains in force, that is to say, that admission to Government
						service will be granted to applicants who have attained the age of 18, and
						have obtained a certificate of primary education. In the matter of salary,
						the following changes are recommended: That the commencing salary of L.E. 4
						be increased to L.E. 5, and that there be a yearly increase of half a pound,
						except in the case of an unfavourable report, until the salary is L.E. 9.
						Candidates provided with “certificats intérimaires” will receive LE. 6, and
						those with a second-class certificate, LE. 7.</p>
					<p>This increase will apply to all branches of the Government, excepting the
						Mixed Courts and Railways, the Railways being subject to a special rule, in
						view of the importance of this department.</p>
					<p>No supernumerary may receive less than LE. 3 per month.</p>
					<p>In the Ministry of Finance admission to the staff will be made without going

					<p>The charge brought against Mr. Teakle, of the Ministry of Public Instruction,
						by the Cairo Police, of assaulting a policeman in the discharge of his duty,
						came before Mr. Alban at the British Consular Court in Cairo yesterday
						morning.</p>
					<p>The witnesses for the prosecution, which was conducted by Captain
						Vernon-Jarvis, of the Cairo Police, were Said Ismail, the assaulted
						policeman, Mr. P. W. Machell, Mohamed Effendi Mahmoud, Mr. Machell’s
						secretary, and Osman Eff. Mahmoud, of the Sanitary Department. Said Ismail,
						the policeman, was first examined. He gave his account of the alleged
						assault in full. According to him, two Europeans whom he identified as Mr.
						Teakle and Mr. Sharp persisted in following the left (N.) side of the
						Kasr-el-Nil Bridge while crossing from the Ghezireh end, in spite of his
						protests. On their refusing to pay any attention he stepped in front of
						them, whereupon Mr. Teakle seized him and pushed him away. Both continued on
						their course and laughed at him. After further details he stated that
						accused, after crossing the bridge to the right (S.) side, turned on him
						while he was standing peaceably in the middle of the bridge and seized him
						by the throat, shaking him vigorously.</p>
					<p>Space does not allow ns to give in full the evidence under examination and
						cross-examination of this witness. His replies to Mr. Le Breton, counsel for
						the defence, were mainly in the negative. He absolutely denied having
						touched accused, declaring that the law forbade the police to lay hands on
						people in such cases. It was true that accused did not understand him, but a
						native acted as interpreterafter the first collision and explained his
						orders. Much more followed in this style— Shawish Said Ismail’s evidence
						differing in no particular from that of the policeman all over the world,
						who, being human, always assumes the role of persecuted angel in similar
						cases.</p>
					<p>Mr. P. W. Machell was then called and made a statement to the effect that on
						April 14, a little after 6 p.m., he was driving with his secretary over the
						Kasr el-Nil Bridge towards Ghezireh. His secretary called his attention to a
						fracas between a European and a policeman some 40 yards from the end.
						Looking round he saw a policeman in the centre of a group which <hi
							rend="bold">contained one </hi>European for certain. The policeman
						appeared to be hustled. He passed the group at a trot, told his secretary to
						tell the coachman to stop, got out of his carriage, and went back towards
						the scene of the dispute. While so doing he saw the shawish wrest him<hi
							rend="bold">self free and move towards the middle </hi>of <hi
							rend="bold">the </hi>road,"where he paused to adjust his tunic and
						collar. A European then rushed at the policeman, who put up his hands as if
						to ward off a blow, seized him by both hands, and turned him round
						violently. He saw then that he was turning him round to read his number. In
						so doing he used the maximum of violence quite unwarrantably and
						unnecessarily. He considered that the shawish behaved with remarkable
						self-restraint. The two Europeans, one being the aggressor, went along the
						right (S.) pavement to the end of the bridge. The policeman followed and
						appeared to make a report to Mr. Roberts, of the Cairo Police, who was
						there. One of the Europeans gave his card to Mr. Roberts. witness also went
						up to him and told him to inform the Commandant of the Cairo Police that he
						had witnessed the assault. He took the card given and read on it the names
						of Mr. R G. Teakle and <hi rend="bold">Mr. </hi>Sharp (the latter in
						pencil), Turf Club. Seeing the words “Turf Club” and recognising that these
						were Englishmen he asked accused whether he was a mem<hi rend="bold"
						>b</hi>er of any Government service. Accused said he belonged to the
						Ministry of Public Instruction and also said, “I hope you saw the policeman
						assault me first.” Witness replied, “No, he could only answer for what he
						had seen. To a question by Capt. Vernon-Jarvis, nothing interposed between
						him and Mr. Teakle at the time of the assault. He was perhaps 8 yards away,
						as near as he could get without being mixed up in the affair.</p>
					<p>Cross examined by Mr. Le Breton as to what he meant by “the maximum of
						violence,” witness stated that he thought accused was using all his fores in
						turning the policeman round. He did not think the policeman was trying to
						hide his number. Asked it he was aware that Mr. Teakle had courted enquiry
						into the incident, witness stated that this was a departmental question not
						bearing directly on the case. The Coart allowing the question, witness
						stated that accused had made no objection, in his knowledge, to an
						enquiry.</p>
					<p>Mohamed Bey Mahmoud was called and sworn. His account of what he had seen
						tallied with that of the previous witness till he reached the point where he
						descended with the Adviser to the Ministry of the Interior from the
						carriage. He here stated that accused walked fast towards the shawish and a
						struggle ensued. He could not see the policeman's hands. Accused appeared to
						be trying to obtain his number. Mr. Machell did not appear to be annoyed
						over the incident.</p>
					<p>Mahmoud Effendi Osman, of the Sanitary Department, was then examined. He
						remembered seeing the incident and that Mr. Teakle laid hands on the
						policeman. He did not remember what the policeman said. He did not remember
						offering to give evidence on behalf of Mr. Teakle. He did not remember
						offering to interpret or interpreting ; in fact, he remembered nothing
						whatever. This was the more remarkable seeing that a few days after the
						incident he had written a letter to Mr. Teakle for the British Consular
						Court in</p>

					<p>which he gave an account of what he had witnessed.</p>
					<p>The first witness called for the defence was the accused. Succinctly
						rendered, his account of the incident ran thus. He was crossing Kasr el-Nil
						Bridge on the left side about 6 p.m. on 14th alt., when he heard a policeman
						shooting. He heard the word “Yaminak,” but knowing little Arabic did not
						imagine the shoots were addressed to him. The policeman then came up from
						behind and getting on the pavement in front of him pushed him back. The
						policeman was talking vigorously. Witness did not understand and said
						“Stanna shweir.” Several people collected and witness tried to pass the
						policeman, who again thrust him back. Learning that the policeman wanted him
						to cross the road witness then crossed diagonally, but before reaching the
						other side turned back to take the policeman’s number. He tried, as he
						thought, to hide it, whereupon witness took him by the hands and tried to
						see his number. The policeman took a half turn to keep only the Arabic
						numbers in his view. He at last forced him to show the European number.</p>
					<p>In reply to questions by the prosecution : It was untrue that he rushed at
						the policeman: In his opinion the policeman was trying to hide the number.
						The policeman would not in his opinion have gone to the Cairo end of the
						bridge to report him had he not taken his number. He never struck the
						policeman.</p>
					<p>Counsel for the prosecution now cross examined witness on his knowledge of
						Arabic and proved himself quite unfamiliar with the regulations of the
						Ministry of Public Instruction, to the amusement of the public, which was
						mainly recruited from that Ministry.</p>
					<p>Ibrahim Zeki was then called. His attention, he said, was first called to the
						incident by the policeman's curses, which he translated The policeman took
						Mr. Teakle first by the arms. Accused neither struck him nor seized him by
						the throat, but pushed him away. The second time the policeman pushed him
						back more vigorously. He heard Mr. Teakle say he had better take the
						shawish’s number. The latter tried to hide it, putting one hand over the
						European number and turning away. He offered himself as witness on behalf of
						accused, whom he had never seen before.</p>
					<p>Cross-examined by prosecution as to why he did not come forward and explain
						matters, he said that it was certainly not his business to interpret to the
						police.</p>
					<p>Mr. J. S. Sharp, of the Ministry of Public Instruction, was then called and
						sworn. He said that while going along on the left side of the bridge he
						heard a policeman shout The policeman then rushed in front of him and caught
						him by the coat. He said “Sibuh” (Drop it) and removed the man’s hands. He
						could not see whether Mr. Teakle was pushed as people interposed. Mahout
						Osman oame to him and said, “You had better move across the road” and “The
						police are always rude like this.” He started, looked back, and saw the
						policeman in the way of accused. Accused then came across. The rest of his
						evidence agreed in the main with accused's, save for his statement that
						accused took the policeman by the shoulders.</p>
					<p>Mr. Le Breton, addressing the Court, stated that the policeman's evidence was
						like that of all policemen in such cases, but he would like to point out
						that the prosecution had brought no other evidence to prove that accused
						first attacked him, while a study of the facts went to prove that the
						policeman only thought of reporting the affair when his number had been
						taken—a sign of a guilty conscience. Mr. Machell's evidence must be regarded
						as prejudiced.</p>
					<p>Capt. Vernon-Jarvis, for the prosecution, was understood to say that it was
						excessively unlikely that a policeman would ever lay hands on an Englishman,
						of whom he stood in great awe. The fact that accused, according to one of
						the witnesses for the defence, had his hands on the shawish’s shoulders was
						important as proving that the latter could not have lifted his hand to cover
						the number.</p>
					<p>This ingenious, if daring, deduction was received with a certain incredulity
						by the Court and counsel for the defense and with manifestations of an ill
						timed hilarity by the public. The Court then summed up. It appeared clear to
						the Judge that accused and Mr. Sharp, who were on the wrong side of the
						bridge, did not understand that the policeman was shouting to them to cross.
						The policeman then took Mr. Sharp by the coat and next pushed Mr. Teakle
						back, and a scuffle ensued in which the policeman was the aggressor.</p>
					<p>Mr. Teakle then crossed, leaving the shawish in the middle of the road but
						rather unfortunately, being no doubt excited, turned back to take the man’s
						number, and being rightly or wrongly under the impression that he wished to
						conceal his number, tried to force him to show it Mr. Machell’s evidence was
						rendered of less importance by the fact that he only saw the concluding and
						not the opening stages of the incident, and had formed an exaggerated
						estimate of the violence employed by accused. Under the circumstances he
						would dismiss the case.</p>
					<p>Proceedings terminated at 1.15 p.m. and Mr. Teakle was the recipient of
						hearty congratulations from the public.</p>

					<p>“A1 Moayad” comments as follows upon that passage in Lord Cromer’s Report
						which deals with the Legislative Council and the General Assembly:—</p>
					<p>' Our readers would infer from Lord Cromer’s remarks that he is feeling how
						dangerous is the unlimited authority which he exercises without restraint in

					<p>After describing his Lordship’s several attributes, the “Moayad” proceeds
						:—“Should any obstacle be placed in his way by the British Cabinet, he
						employs the Khedivial authority to remove it, and <hi rend="italic"
							>vice-versa</hi> in the case of the Egyptian Government. Lord Cromer has
						thus spent years in pitting one against the other ; and would like this
						control to remain for ever. Nothing in this world is without end, however,
						and it is to be feared that the British <hi rend="bold">people themselves,
							who are </hi>unaccustomed to anything but Constitutional rule, would put
						an end to it. They are born enemies of absolutism; and regard the control of
						a whole nation by one man as abnormal, no matter whether that person is a
						well-known and well-intentioned Englishman. It is curious that Lord Cromer
						should pretend to defend the Egyptian nation from the authority of the
						Khedive, whereas the British occupied Egypt to protect the Khedive from the
						nation. The fact is, Lord Cromer desires to place the whole country in the
						hands of the British Consul-General, under the pretext that Egypt is unable
						to govern herself, and that were she left alone the Chief Governor of Egypt
						would restore his absolute influence. In demanding <hi rend="bold">a

					<p>NOTES ET CRITIQUES</p>
					<p>Le Caire, mercredi 9 Mai.</p>
					<p>Le taux de l’escompte libre à Londres vient d’être élevé à 4 pour cent Hier,
						au stock Exchange, le Consolidé anglais est remonté de 1/4, après avoir
						perdu 3/8 la veille. L’Unifiée, la National Bank, l'Agricole et la Daïra
						sont encore restées invariées à leurs cours précédents. La Delta Light a
						regagné 1/8 5 12 3/8</p>
					<p>A Paris, l’action Crédit Foncier Egyptien a clôturé a 779. soit en nouvelle
						hausse de 4 francs. La Banque d’Athènes est demeurée inchangée à 150.</p>
					<p>Notre marché des valeurs a été, ce matin encore, inactif et lourd; avec une
						petite accentuation de la tendance à la dépression. A peu d’exceptions près,
						les titres ont payé, plus ou moins, leur tribut à la réaction.</p>
					<p>Les optimistes prédisent avec assurance la fin de cette série de mauvaises
						séances. Ils se basent, paraît-il, d’un côté sur la conviction que le
						resserrement monétaire a Londres aurait atteint son apogée ; de l’autre côté
						sur l’espoir que le différend turco-anglais serait certainement appelé à
						recevoir une solution pacifique a l’approche de l’expiration de
						l'ultimatum.</p>
					<p>La National Bank est restée délaissée 5 26 9/32. L’Agricole a faibli à 9 7/8.
						Le Comptoir Financier a été inscrit 5 6 1/4, ex-right ; l’action nouvelle a
						été cotée £6. La Cassa di Sconto a rétrogradé a 215 et la nouvelle émission
						5 212 ; la Banque d’Athènes a 148 et la Banque d’Orient à 136. La Banque
						d’Abyssinie s’est réveillée 5 6 1/2.</p>
					<p>L’action Crédit Foncier est restée immobile 5 780. La Nile Land a avancé 5 16
						9/16 pour fléchir en clôture 5 16 3/8 vendeurs. Il se confirme que l’achat
						du restant da domaine de Kasr-el-Doubara rencontre des obstacles
						sérieux.</p>
					<p>L’Immobilière a faibli a 366; la part de fondateur a 615. L’Agricole du Nil
						est également revenue a 273; la part de fondateur a 8 3/8. L’action
						Entreprises Immobilières et Travaux est restée a 4 1/4 ; la part de
						fondateur a 78.</p>
					<p>La Brasserie des Pyramides a fléchi a 133 et la part de dividende 5 63.</p>
					<p>Dans le groupe des Hôtels, les Nungovich ont été traités a 17 7/16 et les
						Baehler a 5 L’Anglo-American s’est raffermi a 5 1/2.</p>
					<p>Parmi les petites valeurs, les Delta ont ete ramenés a 4 3/16 ; les Egyptian
						Constructions: 5 15/16; les Glymenopoulo a 1 1/2 et les Abdy a 1
						5/16-8/8.</p>
					<p>La Société des Exceleior Hotels vient de conclure l’achat des terrains
						contigus a ceux qu’elle possédait déjà au rond-point Soliman-Pacha. Bile
						dispose donc actuellement d'environ 5,500 mètres carrés de terrain, dont une
						partie pourra être revendue dans des conditions très avantageuses.</p>
					<p>M. Dattari, le cédant du premier lot acheté par le syndicat qui a constitué
						la Société, a réclamé le paiement immédiat du solde qui lui était dû sur ce
						terrain. Bien qu’au dire du contentieux de la Société, cette réclamation fût
						mal fondée, on a pris les mesures nécessaires pour le règlement de cette
						somme. Les tribunaux auront a se prononcer sur les dommages que la Société
						estime lui avoir été causés de ce chef.</p>
					<p>Un second versement de L.E. 1 par action sera probablement appelé vers le 15
						Juin proohain.</p>
					<p>On rapporte que l’émission de la Commercial, Industrial and Land Co. of Egypt
						a été largement ouverte.</p>
					<p>On ajoute que la Société serait en négocia­tions pour la conclusion de deux
						ou trois nouvelles affaires très promettantes.</p>
					<p>L’assemblée générale ordinaire des actionnaires de la Nungovich Hotels Co.
						est convoquée pour le jeudi 31 Mai courant, 5 4 h. p.m., au siège social au
						Caire.</p>
					<p>A l’ordre du jour : rapport du conseil; présentation des comptes de
						l’exercice 1905, fixation da dividende, élection d’administrateurs, etc.</p>
					<p>Carnet de l’actionnaire.</p>
					<p>— Les détenteurs d’actions et parts de fondateur de la Land Bank of Egypt
						sont informés que les dividendes de £0.7.6 par action an­cienne, de P.E.
						6,75 par action nouvelle et de £ 1.2 eh. par part de fondateur sont payables
						5 partir du 15 du courant, 5 Alexandrie, contre présentation du coupon No
						1.</p>
					<p>— Un avis de la Nungovieh Hotels Co. porte que le second versement de £ 4 sur
						les actions nouvelles peut être effectué le 30 Mai courant, au lieu de la
						date précédemment</p>
					<p>prescrite du 15 Mai.</p>

					<p>NOTICE,</p>
					<p>Messrs. Haselden and Co., Egyptian Agents for the Royal Insurance Company of
						Liverpool, hereby beg to inform their clients that having regard to the
						widespread uneasiness which the San Francisco disaster has created in the
						minds of the public generally, the Directors of the Royal Insurance Company
						have made the following official announcement:—</p>
					<p>“ The Royal Insurance Company has</p>
					<p>“ learnt by cablegram from its Manager at</p>
					<p>“ San Francisco that the area of the recent</p>
					<p>“ disaster involves a possible liability of</p>
					<p>“ £1,350,000 (6,750,000dols.). Having regard</p>
					<p>“ however to the large balance at the credit</p>
					<p>“ of Profit and Loss at the end of 1904, and</p>
					<p>“ the profitable results of last year's opera-</p>
					<p>" tions, the payments which will have to be</p>
					<p>“ made in connection wit,h this liability will</p>
					<p>" not necessitate any reduction in the Fire</p>
					<p>“ and Reserve Funds of the Compary.”</p>
					<p>It is anticipated that when the Manager of the Company at San Francisco has
						been able to look closely into the position it will transpire that the
						Company's losses will be appreciably less than the figure mentioned.
