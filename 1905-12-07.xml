                    <head>The Sultan and The Powers</head>
                    <p>For the moment the tension that has been existing between the Sultan and the
                        Powers is releived, and the Sublime Porte is state to have accepted the
                        Macedonian financial scheme subjecct to numerous modifications. The crisis,
                        it is hardly needful to point out, is only temporaryily releaved even if we
                        assume that the Sultan's concessions are genuine, ffor the Macedonian
                        problem will never be solved by the peaceful methods of diplomacy or such
                        mild acts of coercion as the seizure of custom houses. The Blue Book issued
                        yesterday week on the situation shows very clearly the disturbed state of
                        the country, and gives information as to the steps taken by the Powers to
                        bring about an improvement. Whether the measures that have been, and are now
                        being taken will improved the position is quite a different matter;
                        unfortunately there is not much room for hope that they will. The fault does
                        not rest with the Sultan, as some agitators would have us believe. It is
                        true, of course, that his honesty of the officials is seldom very
                        conspicious; but the main difficulty is in the dissensions of the Christian.
                        The creeds of the rival sects are still of that sturdy nature which disdains
                        toleration: and accordingly the long list of Macedonian outbreaks contain
                        many outrages and murders committed by one Christian body on the other,
                        while the Turkish Government looks on, only occasionally interfering that it
                        may impartially massacre both. Whille the Churches are strong enough to defy
                        the Government and to play on the fanatic feelings of their followers by
                        egging them on, and while the neighboring States are able to interfere and
                        to stir up racial as well as religious strife, it is safe to predict that
                        the condition of Macedonia will not be greatly ameliorated. The
                        establishment of a strong Administration able to depress disorder severly,
                        whether committed by Christian of Turk, seems to real way out; but at the
                        moment it is not possible; and the other alternative suggested, that the
                        country shall be divided among the disputants, would probably lead to open
                        war. </p>

                    <head>The Situation in Russia</head>
                    <p>The most hopeful eye can discern no improvement as yet in the internal
                        condition of Russia. Unfortunately there are signs that the mutiny in the
                        Army and Navy, which previously was confined to two or three places, is now
                        becoming general, and with it the Government loses all possibility of
                        controlling disorder. When the labour leaders failed recently to forment a
                        second strike, it was expected that industry would resume almost normal
                        conditions: but the telegraphists have struck, in some parts the police
                        also, and the railways may stop working at any moment. Of the peasants less
                        is heard: but agrarian outbreaks show that the spirit of revolt is slowly
                        working its way downwards. It is not, however, known how far they have
                        combined among themselves, if at all: and the isolated action of single
                        villages would have little effect outside their own immediate boundaries.
                        But agitators are doing their best to bring about a rising in the provinces;
                        whether they are able to sap the historic traditions of loyalty to the Tsar
                        remains to be seen. Meanwhile, ugly rumours of dissensions at Court, and the
                        struggle at headquarters is not yet over: and the Administration can take no
                        steps while thus disorganised. The most disappointing symptom is the utter
                        failure of the Moderate Reformers to come forward. Refusing to assist the
                        Government's programme, and apperenty unable to suggest anything better
                        themselves, they are simply playing into the hands of the Extremists. Their
                        timidity is more dangerous for themselves than outspokeness, when revolution
                        is in the air: for their country it may be disastrous. </p>

                    <p>Hunting Fatality</p>
                    <p>We regret to announce the death of Captain Meyricke, who from 1901 to last
                        February served in the Egyptian Army. Captain Edward Gelly Mayricke,
                        R.E.,died in the Cambridge Hospital, Aldershot, last week from injuries
                        received when riding in the Open Military Steeplechase, at the Aldershot
                        Autumn Meeting, on Thursday. He was taking the jump after leaving the
                        cutting when his horse, Wych Elm, stumbled and fell throwing the rider and
                        rolling on him. Captain Meyricke was removed in an unconsious condition- to
                        Cambridge Hospital. His case was regarded from the first as serious and his
                        father was telegraphed for from Cheltenham. Captain Mayricke lingered
                        through the night, but he died the folloring morning without recovering from
                        consciousness. Captain Mayricke was born in July, 1874, entered the Royal
                        Engineers in March, 1894, and obtained his company in April, 1904. From 1901
                        to February of this year he served in the Egyptian Army, and in October last
                        he was appointed Adjunct of the Gloucestershire R. E., the headquarters of
                        which are at Cheltenham. </p>

                    <p>The annual general meeting of the shareholders of the North Nile Valley,
                        Ltd., was held on the 27th alt. at Winchester House, Old Broad-street,
                        London, E.C., under the presidency of Mr. Edgar Anderson (the chairman of
                        the company).</p>
                    <p>The secretary (Mr. C. F. Palmer) having read the notice convening the meeting
                        and the report of the auditor,</p>
                    <p>The chairman said: Gentleman; – It is now my duty to move the adoption of the
                        report and accounts, which contain full information of the business/of the
                        company. The balance-sheet, as you will see, has been brought up to the 30th
                        of September last, and covers the three prospecting expeditions which have
                        been sent out to Egypt by your company. A considerable amount of work has
                        been done at Haimur, and in the earlier stages of that work the mine showed
                        sufficient promise to warrant energetic development. At the same time, it
                        has always been recognized as a complicated proposition, owing to its
                        lenticular formation, and to the irregularity of the fissures in which the
                        lode fillings occurs. You will have gathered from your engineers’ report
                        that, at the end of the 1904 season’s operations, the outlook was promising,
                        but last season’s developments have only confirmed the difficult of arriving
                        at definite conclusions with regard to your property. As you are aware,
                        recent mining in Egypt has not been carried out on a sufficiently large
                        scale, at all events at depths, to determine what are the probabilities in
                        the case of your property, and it is impossible, with the data in hand, to
                        form an opinion as to the permanence of your mine! The only definite
                        evidence we have is that where the ancients left off working on your
                        property the poor zone was encountered, whilst almost immediately underneath
                        that point some rich specimen stone was found. As you were advised in an
                        interim report, those rich lenses had again pinched out. In view of the fact
                        that developments are proceeding at a considerably greater depth at Um
                        Garaiart, which is only a short distance from your mine, your directors are
                        advised that for the immediate future they should watch those developments,
                        when, no doubt, the information so obtained will form a basis on which to
                        decide the future policy of your company. Your engineers report that there
                        is a quantity of milling ore at grass, and they roughly estimate a further
                        quantity which may be stoped from underground. Upon a resumption of work
                        they advise that this ore will make good returns if crushed at the Nile
                        Valley Company’s mill, distant some eight miles, and that company has
                        expressed its willingness to crush it. Your directors have always kept
                        before them the economical working of your property, and they will continue
                        to have this in mind in the future. I have nothing more to say to you at
                        present. I shall be happy to answer any questions that may be put to me, and
                        I now beg to move the adoption of the report and accounts.</p>
                    <p>Mr. W.R. Patterson seconded the motion, which was at once put and carried,

                    <head>THE “EXTENSION” OF CAIRO.</head>
                    <p>The “Standard” published the following note regarding certain absurd
                        statements which have been circulated as to the future development of
                        Cairo:</p>
                    <p>“So popular is Cairo becoming, especially during the winter months, that
                        there is some anxiety locally as to how its accommodation can be extended.
                        Rumors have been spread to the effect that a European syndicate has
                        approached the Ministry of Finance with a view to the acquisition of a large
                        tract of desert land west of the Pyramids for building purposes. If the
                        request were granted a new town would rise almost under the shadow of the
                        Sphinx and the Pyramids, and Egypt’s capital would then extend to the site
                        of the ancient monuments.</p>
                    <p>“Inquiry from those best qualified to know, however, elicited no confirmation
                        of such a vandalistic suggestion. On the other hand, the theory was
                        decidedly negative. Colonel Gordon, who lived for sixteen years in Cairo,
                        stated that such a thing would never come to pass during Lord Cremer’s
                        tenure of office. It would be contrary to all desires of students of
                        Egyptology, and the Khedive would never be likely to support it. Should it
                        be found necessary to extend the city, the extension, said the Colonel,
                        would be towards the site of the old town, and not on the other side of the
                        river.”</p>

                    <p>THE EGYPTIAN DELTA LAND AND INVESTMENT CO., LTD.</p>
                    <p>The report of the directors of the Egyptian Delta Land and Investment
                        Company, Limited, which is to be presented to the shareholders at the
                        ordinary general meeting to be held on Thursday, 21st inst., at Winchester
                        House, Old Broad-street, London, E.C., comprises a statement of the
                        company’s audited accounts for the first period of its working, ended 30th
                        September, 1905.</p>
                    <p>LAND PURCHASES.</p>
                    <p>The total area of lands purchased at 30th September, 1905, aggregated 479,275
                        feddans, the total cost of which will be about £127,950, averaging £266.965
                        per feddan. In addition to these lands the directors have, in conjunction
                        with two other Egyptian Land Companies, acquired a valuable property in the
                        province of Gharbieh, comprising 1,577 feddans at L.E. 33-1/3 per feddan,
                        payable in eight annuities, with the intention of acquiring further
                        contiguous properties as occasion offers. This company holds one-sixth
                        interest in the investment.</p>
                    <p>DEVELOPMENT AND SALES.</p>
                    <p>No sales have yet been effected, it being the intention of the directors to
                        first thoroughly develop the land, either by setting out as town or building
                        sites or by irrigation and drainage as agricultural land.</p>
                    <p>GENERAL.</p>
                    <p>As stated in the original prospectus the lands acquired are situated in
                        districts traversed, or about to be traversed, by the Egyptian Delta Light
                        Railways. The directors are satisfied that the purchases already made are
                        sound, and should, when the necessary developments are completed, realise
                        good returns.</p>
                    <p>NEW CAPITAL.</p>
                    <p>In January, 1905, the authorized capital of the company was increased to
                        £250,000 by the creation of an additional 150,000 shares of £1 each. Of
                        these, 100,000 Shares were, in April 1905, offered pro rata to the existing
                        shareholders, at a premium of £1 per share, in the ratio of one new share
                        for each share held by them, all of which were made to enable the directors
                        to complete negotiations in hand in anticipation of considerable extensions
                        of lines being constructed by the Egyptian Delta Light Railways in the
                        Menoufieh province. The directors are informed that work on these extensions
                        will be commenced by the Railway Company so soon as the necessary Government
                        sanction is obtained, then they anticipate being able to purchase
                        considerable tracts of land, in the vicinity of the new lines, at favorable
                        prices.</p>
                    <p>FINANCIAL YEAR.</p>
                    <p>In order that the proprietors may be kept informed and in compliance with the
                        Companies’ Acts, the books of the company were closed at the 30th September
                        for presentation in December. It is, however, considered advisable to in
                        future close the accounts at 31st March, the present data falling during the
                        busy season in Egypt. A further report and statement of accounts will be
                        issued in June next, for the half year ending 31st March, 1906; and,
                        subsequently, annually at that date.</p>

                    <p>NEW EGYPTIAN COMPANY.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman of the Oceana Company, in speaking at their meeting held in
                        London on the 29th November, made the following remarks in regards to the
                        New Egyptian Company: –</p>
                    <p>The report of the New Egyptian Company, which has been sent to you with our
                        own report, will have acquainted you with its various important interests in
                        Egypt and the Sudan. The land in process of being reclaimed from the Nile by
                        the regulators and other works constructed under the able direction of Mr.
                        Beresford, the company’s consulting engineer, represents up to date an
                        expenditure of £147,980 or £27.38 9d</p>
                    <p>per feddan for 3.62 feddans of reclaimable and 1.873 feddans of purchased
                        lands adjoining, a figure which is far below the value of any cultivated or
                        crop bearing land in Egypt. It is a matter of great regret that the
                        Government should now decline to renew, on the same broad lines upon which
                        the company has the nest legal advice that it is entitled to substantial
                        compensation should the Egyptian Government persist in its present decision.
                        In addition to the land at Matai, which has been sold at a profit of
                        £64,380, the company owns a large block purchased from the Daira Sanieh
                        Company at a price materially under the present value of similar land. The
                        first section of the channel of the Menzaleh Canal and Navigation Company
                        between Port Said and Matarish is rapidly approaching completion. The Suez
                        Canal Company is opening up a connection with the Menzaleh Canal, which will
                        establish steam communications between Port Said and the terminus of the
                        railway at Matarish. The section from that point to Damietta and the opening
                        of the canal into the Nile will be continued afterwards, thus establishing
                        an uninterrupted waterway between Port Said and the large cotton-growing
                        districts of Mansourah and the Eastern Delta. The Upper Nile traffic carried
                        on by the steamers of the Sudan Development and Exploration Company, under a
                        guarantee of the Sudan Government, shows increased earnings; the steamers
                        have carried cargo from Khartoum for the Congo Free State, and it is hoped
                        they will soon be self-supporting. The company has been authorized by the
                        Sudan Government to survey a suitable tract of land near Khartoum in the
                        hopes of being able to effect its purchases for agricultural development.
                        Altogether the New Egyptian Company has a number of promising land and other
                        investments in a country which, owing to its good government and unequalled
                        advantages of soil and climate, has acquired a high degree of prosperity.
                        The company has just declared its first dividend of 12½ per cent.</p>

                    <p>EMPIRE-GROWN COTTON.</p>
                    <p>DEMAND FOR EGYPTIAN YARN</p>
                    <p>The annual meeting of the British Cotton Growing Association, the first since
                        its incorporation, was held in Manchester last week, the Lord Mayor
                        presiding.</p>
                    <p>Sir Alfred Jones, the president, in an opening statement said they ought to
                        be highly gratified and encouraged by what they had done. They were
                        producing cotton crops in the British Empire which would remain in British
                        hands, and a great deal of what was expended would very likely come back to
                        England.</p>
                    <p>From West Africa they were going to receive – from one territory alone –
                        10,000 bales of cotton this first season. The native was getting a paying
                        price, he was doing well, and the buyers were doing well also.</p>
                    <p>He had also a gratifying statement from the Governor of Sierra Leone, that it
                        would not be long before we had a quarter of a million bales of cotton from
                        there. There were enormous possibilities before them. It was not out of any
                        desire to oppose the American growers that they were doing what they could
                        to produce cotton under the British flag, so as to enable our cotton mills
                        to get it when they wanted it. At present they had to get cotton when the
                        American seller cared to let them have it. The Association was not only
                        itself producing cotton, but by its energetic policy and its instruction of
                        those concerned it had set the whole world growing cotton.</p>
                    <p>What had been accomplished he thought had been simply marvelous, and what
                        they had done he hoped was a small portion of what they would be able to do.
                        As to the financing of the native, they were going to do this on the same
                        lines as the Egyptian Bank had financed the native Egyptian, and this, he
                        thought, would advance the movement tremendously. The Association would be
                        the means of increasing the cotton grown, and he was sure Lancashire would
                        be able at length to get her cotton irrespective of American altogether. He
                        asked them now that a prosperous time had come in the trade to give as
                        freely as they could to the Association.</p>
                    <p>Mr. J. A. Hutton, in moving the adoption of the report, said they estimated
                        that the cotton grown under the auspices of the association amounted to no
                        less than £200,000 in value. They anticipated that they would have at least
                        25,000 bales next year as a result of last year’s work.</p>
                    <p>In the time to come West Africa, he believed would render them independent of
                        America in regards to medium staple cotton. Valuable work had been done also
                        in East Africa and India in producing cotton of the</p>
                    <p>Egyptian type. The increased supplies, Mr. Hutton intimated, would be
                        specially useful in view of the number of mills recently put down to spin
                        Egyptian cotton. To sum up the report, it might be said the result was that
                        the council of the association could state without fear of contradiction
                        that they had absolutely proved that the British colonies could produce
                        cotton of sufficient quantity and quality to supply the whole of
                        Lancashire’s needs.</p>
                    <p>Mr. C. W. Macara seconded the adoption of the report, which was carried
                        unanimously.</p>
                    <p>A resolution of thanks to the council of the association for their services
                        during the past year was passed on the motion of Mr. H. Nutall, president of
                        the Manchester Chamber of Commerce, seconded by Sir John Mark.</p>

                        sufferings of the Jews in Russia and with the objects of the league on their
                        behalf. The resolution was to effect that a united effort should now be made
                        to obtain from Turkey permission to establish a home for the Jews in
                        Palestine, and that the Government should be asked for its aid in treating

                    <p>This match was played on the College ground on the nd inst. The game was
                        keenly contested throughout and resulted in a draw, each side scoring two

                    <p>Our Port Said Correspondent writes: – Last Saturday, the British team again
                        played the native and this time came out winners by 4 goals to nil. The game
                        throughout was very fast, and shows that the committee have at least found
                        the necessity of picking men who have been training. As foretold earlier in
                        the football season, there is quite a lot of new members, and with a little
                        more practice we shall have a very strong side.</p>
                    <p>I hear that there is a possibility of Port Said and Suez E.T.C. teams
                        combining against Alexandria. If this match comes off, it is to take place
                        at Port Said and I’m sure that the Alex men would be given a good game.</p>

                        Lower Egypt, and formerly in Upper Egypt.</p>
                    <p>In the preceding articles the periods of design and construction of the works

                        benefit from the finished work.</p>
                    <p>Opinions have differed as to the respective merits of lift and free flow
                        irrigation. The latter has been charged with damaging land by saturation and
                        infiltration, and of bringing the salts in the soil to the surface; and,
                        therefore, lift irrigation, which does none of these things, has been held
                        by some to be the healthy system. There is much evidence to support the
                        accusation against freeflow. On the other hand, there is evidence to show
                        that the evils are not the necessary accompaniment of freeflow. For there
                        exis tracts of country which are so irrigated without any bad results, but,
                        on the contrary, with greater economy of money and labour then attends
                        irrigation by lift. It has been realised that the presence or absence of
                        efficient drainage determine whether freeflow shall be a healthy system or
                        the reverse; and it now seems to be recognised that the ideal system of
                        irrigation is to have freeflow at all seasons must not be understood to mean
                        that the canals should run continuously at the high levels that admit of
                        freeflow. The ideal system is far otherwise. The freeflow levels in branch
                        canals should only be maintained for the period that is necessary for
                        wtering the crops along the branch, and the canal level should be kept low
                        at other times. For instance, in summer the freeflow levels might be
                        maintainedd for six days, and the low levels for twelve, all the crops on
                        the branch receiving a watering during the high level period. Such an
                        arrangement would provide for one watering every eighteen days Again, in
                        flood, a week's high level. By such a system of alternate periods of full
                        and low supply, the water in the soil adjacent to the canals is kept moving,
                        and the soil is prevented from beccoming sour. The canals themselves also
                        act as drains to those lands alongside them which have imbided too liberally
                        during the high level period. </p>
                    <p>There is another consideration that must not be lost sight of. During the
                        floods of certain rivers the water carries along with it rich fertilising
                        matter, brought down from the hills where the rains which cause the floods
                        fall. It is most desirable to secure on the fields as much of this silt as
                        possible. Therefore, during flood, the canals should be run with liberal
                        supplies, and at such levels that the water can be readily made use of. But
                        there must be limits to the liberality, or else the drains will either have
                        to be made extravagantly large, or they can efficiantly perform. The
                        alternation of weeks high level and of reduced supply-not necessarily low
                        supply- seems to afford the most convienient compromise that gives the
                        advantage of a sufficiently liberal supply without the detracting
                        accompaniment of bad drainage. </p>
                    <p>Thereis another guiding principle in irrigation, which might perhaps have
                        been cited first as being essentially a general principle. It is this- that
                        the maximum amount of work must be made to irrigate the largest area
                        possible, and the water must be distributed with even handed justice to all
                        who have a right to it. This double obligation- which assumes that the
                        demand exceeds the supply- is best met by distributing the water according
                        to a well considered programme of rotations, or irrigation by turns, drawn
                        up and published for the information of those concerned some time beforer it
                        is to be brought into force. That the programme may be adapted to the amount
                        of wter supply that will be available in summer, it is necessary to estimate
                        the probabilities as regards its amount with the aid of the discharge
                        records of previous years. In doing this one should adopt the attitude of
                        the pessimist, so that the prgramme may be drawn up to suit the worst
                        conditions that the astatistics show to be possible, and one can then safely
                        be an optimist as regards the prospect of crops depending on the working of
                        the programme. In Egypt the outlook in the spring 1900 was as bad as it
                        could be, and the engineers of the Irrigation Department, realising this to
                        the fall, drew up their programmes accordingly. Later on, when there arose,
                        on one hand, an outery that the programmes were too severe on the crops,
                        and, on another, a wail of prophecy that the cotton crop could not be saved,
                        the irrigation men stuck steadfastly to their programmes and never lost
                        confidence in their plans. "They suceeded in saving a magnificent crop of
                        cotton," as the official report of the Under Secretary for Public Works
                        reccords. </p>

                    <head>Egyptian Cotton in Rhodesia</head>
                    <p>Egyptian cotton in doing very well in Phodesia, where numerous experiments
                        have lately been made. At Mirongo imported Egyptian seed and seed obtained
                        from native cotton plants were employed. The Egyptian cotton grew well, and
                        yielded a good crop one plant bearing no less than 164 bolls; the plants did
                        not appear to be injured by the cold. </p>
                    <p>The native or Senga cotton seed, which was purchased from natives and sown in
                        the same plot, germinated readily; the plants grew well, bore large numbers
                        of flowers, and gave every prospect of a good yield of cotton.Unfortunately,
                        however, the ripening was delayed by the cold weather, which caused
                        considerable damage to the crop. The reulting cotton was pure white, soft,
                        silky, and of good length.It was estimated that the yield would have
                        amounted to 500 lb. per acre if the cold weather had not interfered. On
                        another plot of ground in Mirongo, which was situated at the foot of a hill,
                        both Egyptian and native Senga cotton were planted. The soil was black, and
                        had a rocky sub soil. The Egyptian cotton was successful, and yielded a crop
                        of about 400 lb per acre. The Senga cotton did not give a good result, the
                        bolls falling from the plant before arriving at the maturing to test the
                        possibility of growing cotton as a potential plant.Egyptian plant of two
                        years growth gave a crop of fairly good but rather short cotton, amounting
                        to 500 lb. or 600 lb.per acre. Some native Senga cotton plants were left
                        without attention and allowed to grow wild; these plants when seven years
                        old yielded a large crop of cotton of quality.At Katumbi, Egyptian cotton
                        seed, was planted in dark, clamy soil. The plants grew to a height of 8 or
                        1o ft., but yielded a very small crop of cotton. at a distance of about a
                        half of mile from the Luuma River. The seed was sown in black, rich, soil.
                        The plants grew very well, attaining a height of 5-6 ft., and the bolls were
                        large and full. The crop surmounted to 400-450 lb.per acre. </p>
                    <p>The Senga cotton was also found to flourish at Katumbi. The results of these
                        and numerous other experiments demonstrate that the prospects of cotton
                        growing in Rhodesia are very promising.If good seed is securedand careful
                        methods of cultivation are employed, crops of 400-450 lb. per acre can be
                        obtained. Many different varieties, including native, Egyptian, American,
                        and Brazillian cotton have been tested, but apparently Egyptian cotton is
                        best suited to the local conditions and yields the most satisfactory
                        results. </p>
                    <p>Attempts are being made to persuade agriculturists to plant cotton, and also
                        to induce the natives to take up the cultivation. Seed has been distributed
                        to the natives, and assistance and advice are being given with regard to the
                        cultivation. Some difficulty has been experienced with regard to the labour
                        supply, but the opinion has been expressed that is the natives themselves
                        can be induced to undertake cotton growing, the labour difficulty will be
                        solved, since a native planter can always obtain plenty of assistance from
                        neighborhood kraals. </p>
                    <p>The Rhodesian Cotton Syndicate, which was formed at the end of 1903, is at
                        present carrying out extensive experiments with the aid of an American
                        cotton specialist. There is no doubt that the country possesses large tracts
                        of land well adapted for cotton cultivation, and in the Luangwa and Zambesi
                        Valleys the the rivers would afford transport facilities. </p>
                    <p>The first consignment of Rhodesian cotton for the British market has recently
                        arrived in Liverpool. The cotton was grown from Egyptian seed and has been
                        reported by experts as clean, fine, strong, and worth 6d. to 6 1/4d per lb. </p>

                    <p>The money market exhibits considerable ease today, after the distribution of
                        the over subscribed deposits for the new Japanese loans. The Bank of England
                        return shows continued development of resources, and those best acquainted
                        with the money market predict easy rates, which is confirmed by the discount
                        companies' quotation of six months' bills at 3 ¾-1/2 per cent.</p>
                    <p>The Rise in Consols</p>
                    <p>The feature of the week has been the rise in Consols of two points. This has
                        been cheifly caused by the operation of the Government; and no doubt money
                        is coming from Russia to be invested for safety in this premier security.
                        The paying off of Treasury bills also induced some further buying in other
                        gilt edged stocks. It would seem as if ease would tend to increase as the
                        year goes on, as larger amounts of money are being distributed by way of
                        dividend, and the public ar enot in a speculative mood. It is probable that
                        purchases of Consols or any of the gilt edged stocks at present prices will
                        prove more satisfactory investments in any case than even home rails, as
                        there is still a considerable margin for a rise and no apparent possibility
                        of any fall.</p>
                    <p>Money Lying Idle</p>
                    <p>The expanding trade is seen in the Clearing House returns, which show fifteen
                        millions over the amount to the same date last year.Uninvested funds are
                        largely increasing. We hear of one private account having £250,000 lying
                        awaiting investment, and this is a typical case. The rush for the new
                        Japanese Loan is another indication of the same thing. This must induce new
                        issues, of which there have been very few of late. There are, of course, bg
                        Russian loans in the background, but it is not expected that Russia will
                        require so much money under a democratic Government, who would not be likely
                        to allow huge sums to be spent on armament, but who would rather hold tight
                        the national purse strings. </p>

                        has, of course, centered in the issue of new Japanese Loan. This was
                        effected on Tuesday, and the number of applications received was so large
                        that the list was closed at noon on Wednesday.It is estimated that the

                    <p>Egyptian Banking</p>
                    <p>Ina somewhat lugubrious letter sent to the "Economist" by a correspondent in
                        Alexandria, it is stated that, "As a matter of fact, the banks in Cairo and
                        Alexandria are tightening the strings round their customers on loan account,
                        and the majority have been called upon to reduce their debit balances within
                        stated times. Of all the land and financial flotations of the past twelve
                        months, not a single one has been admittedd to rank as bank security; and on
                        sound stocks and shares the banks are now, with few exceptions, charging not
                        less than 7 or 8 per cent for loans." It is quite right that the bankers
                        should limit loans to customers, and we cannot doubt that the effect will be
                        salutary. At the same time we are inclined to say that if, on really sound
                        stocks, bankers are charging 7 or 8 per cent., there is clearly room for
                        still further loaning institutions. But perhaps we may differ as to what
                        sound stocks and shares consist of. It all comes back to what we stated in
                        our recent article, that the important thing is to create a class of
                        seccurity. To take a case in point. So far as we know, almost the whole of
                        the land and financial flotations of the past year are perfectly sound, but
                        a share in a more or less speculative security is never recckoned a proper
                        bank security. Assuming one of there land companies purchase a piece of
                        land, their first step should be to issue mortgage depentures, with the
                        extra security of the capital of the company, would in most cases be a
                        perfect bank security, an there would be no justification for such a rate as
                        7 or 8 per cent. for advances upon them. If the banks are not in a position
                        to advance money against such securities as these on moderate terms, it is
                        obvious that more competition is required. As a matter of fact, while the
                        number of banks is increasing, we doubt if there is too much banking
                        facility obtainable, considering the country is going ahead and is throughly
                        sound and prosperous. But with such a class of security the London Banks and
                        Stock Exchange should supply the deficiency. We are very glad to hear that
                        the Egyptian banks are withholding all facilities from the small
                        speculators. </p>

                    <p>The Egyptian market since our last has been almost lifeless, and it is very
                        difficult to find a share which has been dealt in to any extent. National
                        Bank of Egypt were a firm market in the earlier part of the week and had a
                        smart jump from 25 to 26 buyers in about half an hour, but this latter price
                        again brought in sellers, and the shares have sagged away, closing 25 ¾.
                        Agricultural banks have been up 9 3/8, at which figure they close. The new
                        shares are about 8 5/8. Dairs Deterred and Ordinary close 107-109, and 17
                        3/8- 5/8 respectively. Delta Preference keep very firm with buyers about at
                        1 7/8, but, of course, these shares are worth their price, and are always
                        picked up if they fall much. The Deferred are a nominal market at 10-14.
                        Delta Lands are 2 ¼. Salt and Soda are abut 1 ¼ and Agyptian Markets 1 3/8.
                        Union Fonciere close a fraction easier at 1 premium.There has been a small
                        enquiry for Khedivial Mail Debentures, which are quoted nominally 83-87.The
                        Ordinary shares remain 1 1/8. Daira Sugar close 4 7/8. There is nothing
                        doing in Investment and Agency or Egyptian Estates. </p>
                    <p>Mines</p>
                    <p>In the mining market South Africans have improved in tone under the influence
                        of the optimistic statement by Sir Julius Werner, that he believed the
                        period of difficulties due to the war had now passed, and that the mining
                        outlook was the brightest from every point of view. The Egyptian section
                        continues lifeless. Nile Valley close at ¾, and Block "E" are also 1/16
                        better on last week's quotation at 11/16. Egyptian Mines are slightly higher
                        at 12/8., bu tUm Rus are 1/8 lower at 17/18. United Africans are 1 5/8 after
                        being down to 1 9/16. </p>

                    <p>The Market this week has been very quiet, and the amount of business small;
                        quotations however are unchanged.</p>
                    <p>In Futures a moderate business has been done and the following are the latest
                        values:–</p>
                    <p>Dec. 8.11 Feb. 8.05 April 8.03 June 8.03 Jan. 8.06 Mar. 8.04 May 8.03 July
                        8.03</p>
                    <p>American Futures. The Market this week has experienced frequent and wide
                        fluctuations; opening easy; prices declined 10 points. On Monday, with
                        intense excitement and an enormous business, prices advanced 30 points, in
                        some of the distant positions even more; then a sharp reaction of fully 20
                        points, and later recovery of 7 points, to-day’s closing values being 4 @ 6
                        points higher than those of last Thursday. The early decline was due to the
                        heavy crop movements; the large advance to Mr. Price’s announcement that he
                        had practically covered his short interest in view of a very “bullish”
                        Bureau report, probably indicating a crop of 10 million bales. His action no
                        doubt precipitated the covering up of other large short interests, followed
                        by the usual sharp reaction. American Markets are closed to-day for a
                        National Holiday, but pending the Bureau report to be issued next Monday, we
                        do not anticipate any material change meantime. Much will depend upon this
                        report, and we think it will carry great weight; what it will be, we do not
                        believe anyone can say, but we hardly expect such a serious reduction since
                        their last issue, as an estimated of a crop of only 10 millions would
                        imply.</p>
