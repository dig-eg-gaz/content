                            <p>The Sultan and The Powers</p>
                            <p>For the moment the tension that has been existing between the Sultan
                                and the Powers is releived, and the Sublime Porte is state to have
                                accepted the Macedonian financial scheme subjecct to numerous
                                modifications. The crisis, it is hardly needful to point out, is
                                only temporaryily releaved even if we assume that the Sultan's
                                concessions are genuine, ffor the Macedonian problem will never be
                                solved by the peaceful methods of diplomacy or such mild acts of
                                coercion as the seizure of custom houses. The Blue Book issued
                                yesterday week on the situation shows very clearly the disturbed
                                state of the country, and gives information as to the steps taken by
                                the Powers to bring about an improvement. Whether the measures that
                                have been, and are now being taken will improved the position is
                                quite a different matter; unfortunately there is not much room for
                                hope that they will. The fault does not rest with the Sultan, as
                                some agitators would have us believe. It is true, of course, that
                                his honesty of the officials is seldom very conspicious; but the
                                main difficulty is in the dissensions of the Christian. The creeds
                                of the rival sects are still of that sturdy nature which disdains
                                toleration: and accordingly the long list of Macedonian outbreaks
                                contain many outrages and murders committed by one Christian body on
                                the other, while the Turkish Government looks on, only occasionally
                                interfering that it may impartially massacre both. Whille the
                                Churches are strong enough to defy the Government and to play on the
                                fanatic feelings of their followers by egging them on, and while the
                                neighboring States are able to interfere and to stir up racial as
                                well as religious strife, it is safe to predict that the condition
                                of  Macedonia will not be greatly ameliorated. The establishment of
                                a strong Administration able to depress disorder severly, whether
                                committed by Christian of Turk, seems to real way out; but at the
                                moment it is not possible; and the other alternative suggested, that
                                the country shall be divided among the disputants, would probably
                                lead to open war. </p>

                <head>The Situation in Russia</head>
                <p>The most hopeful eye can discern no improvement as yet in the internal condition
                            of Russia. Unfortunately there are signs that the mutiny in the Army and
                            Navy, which previously was confined to two or three places, is now
                            becoming general, and with it the Government loses all possibility of
                            controlling disorder. When the labour leaders failed recently to forment
                            a second strike, it was expected that industry would resume almost
                            normal conditions: but the telegraphists have struck, in some parts the
                            police also, and the railways may stop working at any moment. Of the
                            peasants less is heard: but agrarian outbreaks show that the spirit of
                            revolt is slowly working its way downwards. It is not, however, known
                            how far they have combined among themselves, if at all: and the isolated
                            action of single villages would have little effect outside their own
                            immediate boundaries. But agitators are doing their best to bring about
                            a rising in the provinces; whether they are able to sap the historic
                            traditions of loyalty to the Tsar remains to be seen. Meanwhile, ugly
                            rumours of dissensions at Court, and the struggle at headquarters is not
                            yet over: and the Administration can take no steps while thus
                            disorganised. The most disappointing symptom is the utter failure of the
                            Moderate Reformers to come forward. Refusing to assist the Government's
                            programme, and apperenty unable to suggest anything better themselves,
                            they are simply playing into the hands of the Extremists. Their timidity
                            is more dangerous for themselves than outspokeness, when revolution is
                            in the air: for their country it may be disastrous. </p>

                    <p>Hunting Fatality</p>
                    <p>We regret to announce the death of Captain Meyricke, who from 1901 to last
                            February served in the Egyptian Army. Captain Edward Gelly Mayricke,
                            R.E.,died in the Cambridge Hospital, Aldershot, last week from injuries
                            received when riding in the Open Military Steeplechase, at the Aldershot
                            Autumn Meeting, on Thursday. He was taking the jump after leaving the
                            cutting when his horse, Wych Elm, stumbled and fell throwing the rider
                            and rolling on him. Captain Meyricke was removed in an unconsious
                            condition- to Cambridge Hospital. His case was regarded from the first
                            as serious and his father was telegraphed for from Cheltenham. Captain
                            Mayricke lingered through the night, but he died the folloring morning
                            without recovering from consciousness. Captain Mayricke was born in
                            July, 1874, entered the Royal Engineers in March, 1894, and obtained his
                            company in April, 1904. From 1901 to February of this year he served in
                            the Egyptian Army, and in October last he was appointed Adjunct of the
                            Gloucestershire R. E., the headquarters of which are at Cheltenham. </p>

                    safeguarding Germany's interests, which were threatened by the Anglo French

                <p>NORTH NILE VALLEY.</p>
                <p>WATCHING THE DEVELOPMENTS AT UM-GARAIAT.</p>
                <p>The annual general meeting of the shareholders of the North Nile Valley, Ltd.,
                    was held on the 27th alt. at Winchester House, Old Broad-street, London, E.C.,
                    under the presidency of Mr. Edgar Anderson (the chairman of the company).</p>
                <p>The secretary (Mr. C. F. Palmer) having read the notice convening the meeting and
                    the report of the auditor,</p>
                <p>The chairman said: Gentleman; – It is now my duty to move the adoption of the
                    report and accounts, which contain full information of the business/of the
                    company. The balance-sheet, as you will see, has been brought up to the 30th of
                    September last, and covers the three prospecting expeditions which have been
                    sent out to Egypt by your company. A considerable amount of work has been done
                    at Haimur, and in the earlier stages of that work the mine showed sufficient
                    promise to warrant energetic development. At the same time, it has always been
                    recognized as a complicated proposition, owing to its lenticular formation, and
                    to the irregularity of the fissures in which the lode fillings occurs. You will
                    have gathered from your engineers’ report that, at the end of the 1904 season’s
                    operations, the outlook was promising, but last season’s developments have only
                    confirmed the difficult of arriving at definite conclusions with regard to your
                    property. As you are aware, recent mining in Egypt has not been carried out on a
                    sufficiently large scale, at all events at depths, to determine what are the
                    probabilities in the case of your property, and it is impossible, with the data
                    in hand, to form an opinion as to the permanence of your mine! The only definite
                    evidence we have is that where the ancients left off working on your property
                    the poor zone was encountered, whilst almost immediately underneath that point
                    some rich specimen stone was found. As you were advised in an interim report,
                    those rich lenses had again pinched out. In view of the fact that developments
                    are proceeding at a considerably greater depth at Um Garaiart, which is only a
                    short distance from your mine, your directors are advised that for the immediate
                    future they should watch those developments, when, no doubt, the information so
                    obtained will form a basis on which to decide the future policy of your company.
                    Your engineers report that there is a quantity of milling ore at grass, and they
                    roughly estimate a further quantity which may be stoped from underground. Upon a
                    resumption of work they advise that this ore will make good returns if crushed
                    at the Nile Valley Company’s mill, distant some eight miles, and that company
                    has expressed its willingness to crush it. Your directors have always kept
                    before them the economical working of your property, and they will continue to
                    have this in mind in the future. I have nothing more to say to you at present. I
                    shall be happy to answer any questions that may be put to me, and I now beg to
                    move the adoption of the report and accounts.</p>
                <p>Mr. W.R. Patterson seconded the motion, which was at once put and carried, with
                    one dissentient.</p>
                <p>THE “EXTENSION” OF CAIRO.</p>
                <p>The “Standard” published the following note regarding certain absurd statements
                    which have been circulated as to the future development of Cairo:</p>
                <p>“So popular is Cairo becoming, especially during the winter months, that there is
                    some anxiety locally as to how its accommodation can be extended. Rumors have
                    been spread to the effect that a European syndicate has approached the Ministry
                    of Finance with a view to the acquisition of a large tract of desert land west
                    of the Pyramids for building purposes. If the request were granted a new town
                    would rise almost under the shadow of the Sphinx and the Pyramids, and Egypt’s
                    capital would then extend to the site of the ancient monuments.</p>
                <p>“Inquiry from those best qualified to know, however, elicited no confirmation of
                    such a vandalistic suggestion. On the other hand, the theory was decidedly
                    negative. Colonel Gordon, who lived for sixteen years in Cairo, stated that such
                    a thing would never come to pass during Lord Cremer’s tenure of office. It would
                    be contrary to all desires of students of Egyptology, and the Khedive would
                    never be likely to support it. Should it be found necessary to extend the city,
                    the extension, said the Colonel, would be towards the site of the old town, and
                    not on the other side of the river.”</p>

            <p>THE EGYPTIAN DELTA LAND AND INVESTMENT CO., LTD.</p>
                <p>The report of the directors of the Egyptian Delta Land and Investment Company,
                    Limited, which is to be presented to the shareholders at the ordinary general
                    meeting to be held on Thursday, 21st inst., at Winchester House, Old
                    Broad-street, London, E.C., comprises a statement of the company’s audited
                    accounts for the first period of its working, ended 30th September, 1905.</p>
                <p>LAND PURCHASES.</p>
                <p>The total area of lands purchased at 30th September, 1905, aggregated 479,275
                    feddans, the total cost of which will be about £127,950, averaging £266.965 per
                    feddan. In addition to these lands the directors have, in conjunction with two
                    other Egyptian Land Companies, acquired a valuable property in the province of
                    Gharbieh, comprising 1,577 feddans at L.E. 33-1/3 per feddan, payable in eight
                    annuities, with the intention of acquiring further contiguous properties as
                    occasion offers. This company holds one-sixth interest in the investment.</p>
                <p>DEVELOPMENT AND SALES.</p>
                <p>No sales have yet been effected, it being the intention of the directors to first
                    thoroughly develop the land, either by setting out as town or building sites or
                    by irrigation and drainage as agricultural land.</p>
                <p>GENERAL.</p>
                <p>As stated in the original prospectus the lands acquired are situated in districts
                    traversed, or about to be traversed, by the Egyptian Delta Light Railways. The
                    directors are satisfied that the purchases already made are sound, and should,
                    when the necessary developments are completed, realise good returns.</p>
                <p>NEW CAPITAL.</p>
                <p>In January, 1905, the authorized capital of the company was increased to £250,000
                    by the creation of an additional 150,000 shares of £1 each. Of these, 100,000
                    Shares were, in April 1905, offered pro rata to the existing shareholders, at a
                    premium of £1 per share, in the ratio of one new share for each share held by
                    them, all of which were made to enable the directors to complete negotiations in
                    hand in anticipation of considerable extensions of lines being constructed by
                    the Egyptian Delta Light Railways in the Menoufieh province. The directors are
                    informed that work on these extensions will be commenced by the Railway Company
                    so soon as the necessary Government sanction is obtained, then they anticipate
                    being able to purchase considerable tracts of land, in the vicinity of the new
                    lines, at favorable prices.</p>
                <p>FINANCIAL YEAR.</p>
                <p>In order that the proprietors may be kept informed and in compliance with the
                    Companies’ Acts, the books of the company were closed at the 30th September for
                    presentation in December. It is, however, considered advisable to in future
                    close the accounts at 31st March, the present data falling during the busy
                    season in Egypt. A further report and statement of accounts will be issued in
                    June next, for the half year ending 31st March, 1906; and, subsequently,
                    annually at that date.</p>
                <p>NEW EGYPTIAN COMPANY.</p>
                <p>The Chairman of the Oceana Company, in speaking at their meeting held in London
                    on the 29th November, made the following remarks in regards to the New Egyptian
                    Company: –</p>
                <p>The report of the New Egyptian Company, which has been sent to you with our own
                    report, will have acquainted you with its various important interests in Egypt
                    and the Sudan. The land in process of being reclaimed from the Nile by the
                    regulators and other works constructed under the able direction of Mr.
                    Beresford, the company’s consulting engineer, represents up to date an
                    expenditure of £147,980 or £27.38 9d</p>
                <p>per feddan for 3.62 feddans of reclaimable and 1.873 feddans of purchased lands
                    adjoining, a figure which is far below the value of any cultivated or crop
                    bearing land in Egypt. It is a matter of great regret that the Government should
                    now decline to renew, on the same broad lines upon which the company has the
                    nest legal advice that it is entitled to substantial compensation should the
                    Egyptian Government persist in its present decision. In addition to the land at
                    Matai, which has been sold at a profit of £64,380, the company owns a large
                    block purchased from the Daira Sanieh Company at a price materially under the
                    present value of similar land. The first section of the channel of the Menzaleh
                    Canal and Navigation Company between Port Said and Matarish is rapidly
                    approaching completion. The Suez Canal Company is opening up a connection with
                    the Menzaleh Canal, which will establish steam communications between Port Said
                    and the terminus of the railway at Matarish. The section from that point to
                    Damietta and the opening of the canal into the Nile will be continued
                    afterwards, thus establishing an uninterrupted waterway between Port Said and
                    the large cotton-growing districts of Mansourah and the Eastern Delta. The Upper
                    Nile traffic carried on by the steamers of the Sudan Development and Exploration
                    Company, under a guarantee of the Sudan Government, shows increased earnings;
                    the steamers have carried cargo from Khartoum for the Congo Free State, and it
                    is hoped they will soon be self-supporting. The company has been authorized by
                    the Sudan Government to survey a suitable tract of land near Khartoum in the
                    hopes of being able to effect its purchases for agricultural development.
                    Altogether the New Egyptian Company has a number of promising land and other
                    investments in a country which, owing to its good government and unequalled
                    advantages of soil and climate, has acquired a high degree of prosperity. The
                    company has just declared its first dividend of 12½ per cent.</p>
                <p>EMPIRE-GROWN COTTON.</p>
                <p>DEMAND FOR EGYPTIAN YARN</p>
                <p>The annual meeting of the British Cotton Growing Association, the first since its
                    incorporation, was held in Manchester last week, the Lord Mayor presiding.</p>
                <p>Sir Alfred Jones, the president, in an opening statement said they ought to be
                    highly gratified and encouraged by what they had done. They were producing
                    cotton crops in the British Empire which would remain in British hands, and a
                    great deal of what was expended would very likely come back to England.</p>
                <p>From West Africa they were going to receive – from one territory alone – 10,000
                    bales of cotton this first season. The native was getting a paying price, he was
                    doing well, and the buyers were doing well also.</p>
                <p>He had also a gratifying statement from the Governor of Sierra Leone, that it
                    would not be long before we had a quarter of a million bales of cotton from
                    there. There were enormous possibilities before them. It was not out of any
                    desire to oppose the American growers that they were doing what they could to
                    produce cotton under the British flag, so as to enable our cotton mills to get
                    it when they wanted it. At present they had to get cotton when the American
                    seller cared to let them have it. The Association was not only itself producing
                    cotton, but by its energetic policy and its instruction of those concerned it
                    had set the whole world growing cotton.</p>
                <p>What had been accomplished he thought had been simply marvelous, and what they
                    had done he hoped was a small portion of what they would be able to do. As to
                    the financing of the native, they were going to do this on the same lines as the
                    Egyptian Bank had financed the native Egyptian, and this, he thought, would
                    advance the movement tremendously. The Association would be the means of
                    increasing the cotton grown, and he was sure Lancashire would be able at length
                    to get her cotton irrespective of American altogether. He asked them now that a
                    prosperous time had come in the trade to give as freely as they could to the
                    Association.</p>
                <p>Mr. J. A. Hutton, in moving the adoption of the report, said they estimated that
                    the cotton grown under the auspices of the association amounted to no less than
                    £200,000 in value. They anticipated that they would have at least 25,000 bales

                <p>In the time to come West Africa, he believed would render them independent of
                    America in regards to medium staple cotton. Valuable work had been done also in
                    East Africa and India in producing cotton of the</p>
                <p>Egyptian type. The increased supplies, Mr. Hutton intimated, would be specially
                    useful in view of the number of mills recently put down to spin Egyptian cotton.
                    To sum up the report, it might be said the result was that the council of the
                    association could state without fear of contradiction that they had absolutely
                    proved that the British colonies could produce cotton of sufficient quantity and
                    quality to supply the whole of Lancashire’s needs.</p>

                <p>A resolution of thanks to the council of the association for their services
                    during the past year was passed on the motion of Mr. H. Nutall, president of the

                <p>A copy of the resolution passes at a protest meeting held by the London Zionist
                    League was sent to Lord Lansdowne, who, in his reply, dated November 27,
                    conveyed to the league the deep sympathy of the Government with the sufferings
                    of the Jews in Russia and with the objects of the league on their behalf. The
                    resolution was to effect that a united effort should now be made to obtain from
                    Turkey permission to establish a home for the Jews in Palestine, and that the
                    Government should be asked for its aid in treating with the Porte for

                <head>Irrigation Engineering</head>
                <p>By Sir Hanbury Brown, K.C.M.G., late Inspecto r-General of Irrigation in Lower
                        Egypt, and formerly in Upper Egypt.</p>
                    <p>In the preceding articles the periods of design and construction of the works
                        of a canal scheme have been under consideration. We will now assume out
                        canals in working order with their regulating works, and our drains ready to
                        do their part. We have next to consider what should be our guiding
                        principles and our method of carrying them out, so as to derive the greatest
                        benefit from the finished work.</p>
                    <p>Opinions have differed as to the respective merits of lift and free flow
                        irrigation. The latter has been charged with damaging land by saturation and
                        infiltration, and of bringing the salts in the soil to the surface; and,
                        therefore, lift irrigation, which does none of these things, has been held
                        by some to be the healthy system. There is much evidence to support the
                        accusation against freeflow. On the other hand, there is evidence to show
                        that the evils are not the necessary accompaniment of freeflow. For there
                        exis tracts of country which are so irrigated without any bad results, but,
                        on the contrary, with greater economy of money and labour then attends
                        irrigation by lift. It has been realised that the presence or absence of
                        efficient drainage determine whether freeflow shall be a healthy system or
                        the reverse; and it now seems to be recognised that the ideal system of
                        irrigation is to have freeflow at all seasons must not be understood to mean
                        that the canals should run continuously at the high levels that admit of
                        freeflow. The ideal system is far otherwise. The freeflow levels in branch
                        canals should only be maintained for the period that is necessary for
                        wtering the crops along the branch, and the canal level should be kept low
                        at other times. For instance, in summer the freeflow levels might be
                        maintainedd for six days, and the low levels for twelve, all the crops on
                        the branch receiving a watering during the high level period. Such an
                        arrangement would provide for one watering every eighteen days Again, in
                        flood, a week's high level. By such a system of alternate periods of full
                        and low supply, the water in the soil adjacent to the canals is kept moving,
                        and the soil is prevented from beccoming sour. The canals themselves also
                        act as drains to those lands alongside them which have imbided too liberally
                        during the high level period. </p>
                    <p> There is another consideration that must not be lost sight of. During the
                        floods of certain rivers the water carries along with it rich fertilising
                        matter, brought down from the hills where the rains which cause the floods
                        fall. It is most desirable to secure on the fields as much of this silt as
                        possible. Therefore, during flood, the canals should be run with liberal
                        supplies, and at such levels that the water can be readily made use of. But
                        there must be limits to the liberality, or else the drains will either have
                        to be made extravagantly large, or they can efficiantly perform. The
                        alternation of weeks high level and of reduced supply-not necessarily low
                        supply- seems to afford the most convienient compromise that gives the
                        advantage of a sufficiently liberal supply without the detracting
                        accompaniment of bad drainage. </p>
                    <p>Thereis another guiding principle in irrigation, which might perhaps have
                        been cited first as being essentially a general principle. It is this- that
                        the maximum amount of work must be made to irrigate the largest area
                        possible, and the water must be distributed with even handed justice to all
                        who have a right to it. This double obligation- which assumes that the
                        demand exceeds the supply- is best met by distributing the water according
                        to a well considered programme of rotations, or irrigation by turns, drawn
                        up and published for the information of those concerned some time beforer it
                        is to be brought into force. That the programme may be adapted to the amount
                        of wter supply that will be available in summer, it is necessary to estimate
                        the probabilities as regards its amount with the aid of the discharge
                        records of previous years. In doing this one should adopt the attitude of
                        the pessimist, so that the prgramme may be drawn up to suit the worst
                        conditions that the astatistics show to be possible, and one can then safely
                        be an optimist as regards the prospect of crops depending on the working of
                        the programme. In Egypt the outlook in the spring 1900 was as bad as it
                        could be, and the engineers of the Irrigation Department, realising this to
                        the fall, drew up their programmes accordingly. Later on, when there arose,
                        on one hand, an outery that the programmes were too severe on the crops,
                        and, on another, a wail of prophecy that the cotton crop could not be saved,
                        the irrigation men stuck steadfastly to their programmes and never lost
                        confidence in their plans. "They suceeded in saving a magnificent crop of
                        cotton," as the official report of the Under Secretary for Public Works
                        reccords. </p>

                    <head>Egyptian Cotton in Rhodesia</head>
                    <p>Egyptian cotton in doing very well in Phodesia, where numerous experiments
                        have lately been made. At Mirongo imported Egyptian seed and seed obtained
                        from native cotton plants were employed. The Egyptian cotton grew well, and
                        yielded a good crop one plant bearing no less than 164 bolls; the plants did
                        not appear to be injured by the cold. </p>
                    <p>The native or Senga cotton seed, which was purchased from natives and sown in
                        the same plot, germinated readily; the plants grew well, bore large numbers
                        of flowers, and gave every prospect of a good yield of cotton.Unfortunately,
                        however, the ripening was delayed by the cold weather, which caused
                        considerable damage to the crop. The reulting cotton was pure white, soft,
                        silky, and of good length.It was estimated that the yield would have
                        amounted to 500 lb. per acre if  the cold weather had not interfered. On
                        another plot of ground in Mirongo, which was situated at the foot of a hill,
                        both Egyptian and native Senga cotton were planted. The soil was black, and
                        had a rocky sub soil. The Egyptian cotton was successful, and yielded a crop
                        of about 400 lb per acre. The Senga cotton did not give a good result, the
                        bolls falling from the plant before arriving at the maturing to test the
                        possibility of growing cotton as a potential plant.Egyptian plant of two
                        years growth gave a crop of fairly good but rather short cotton, amounting
                        to 500 lb. or 600 lb.per acre. Some native Senga cotton plants were left
                        without attention and allowed to grow wild; these plants when seven years
                        old yielded a large crop of cotton of quality.At Katumbi, Egyptian cotton
                        seed, was planted in dark, clamy soil. The plants grew to a height of 8 or
                        1o ft., but yielded a very small crop of cotton.  at a distance of about a
                        half of mile from the Luuma River. The seed was sown in black, rich, soil.
                        The plants grew very well, attaining a height of 5-6 ft., and the bolls were
                        large and full. The crop surmounted to 400-450 lb.per acre. </p>
                    <p>The Senga cotton was also found to flourish at Katumbi. The results of these
                        and numerous other experiments demonstrate that the prospects of cotton
                        growing in Rhodesia are very promising.If good seed is securedand careful
                        methods of cultivation are employed, crops of 400-450 lb. per acre can be
                        obtained. Many different varieties, including native, Egyptian, American,
                        and Brazillian cotton have been tested, but apparently Egyptian cotton is
                        best suited to the local conditions and yields the most satisfactory
                        results. </p>
                    <p>Attempts are being made to persuade agriculturists to plant cotton, and also
                        to induce the natives to take up the cultivation. Seed has been distributed
                        to the natives, and assistance and advice are being given with regard to the
                        cultivation. Some difficulty has been experienced with regard to the labour
                        supply, but the opinion has been expressed that is the natives themselves
                        can be induced to undertake cotton growing, the labour difficulty will be
                        solved, since a native planter can always obtain plenty of assistance from
                        neighborhood kraals. </p>
                    <p>The Rhodesian Cotton Syndicate, which was formed at the end of 1903, is at
                        present carrying out extensive experiments with the aid of an American
                        cotton specialist. There is no doubt that the country possesses large tracts
                        of land well adapted for cotton cultivation, and in the Luangwa and Zambesi
                        Valleys the the rivers would afford transport facilities. </p>
                    <p>The first consignment of Rhodesian cotton for the British market has recently
                        arrived in Liverpool. The cotton was grown from Egyptian seed  and has been
                        reported by experts as clean, fine, strong, and worth 6d. to 6 1/4d per lb. </p>

           <p>London, December 1</p>
                    <p>The money market exhibits considerable ease today, after the distribution of
                        the over subscribed deposits for the new Japanese loans. The Bank of England
                        return shows continued development of resources,  and those best acquainted
                        with the money market predict easy rates, which is confirmed by the discount
                        companies' quotation of six months' bills at 3 ¾-1/2 per cent.</p>
                    <p>The Rise in Consols</p>
                    <p>The feature of the week has been the rise in Consols of two points. This has
                        been cheifly caused by the operation of the Government; and no doubt money
                        is coming from Russia to be invested for safety in this premier security.
                        The paying off of Treasury bills also induced some further buying in other
                        gilt edged stocks. It would seem as if ease would tend to increase as the
                        year goes on, as larger amounts of money are being distributed by way of
                        dividend, and the public ar enot in a speculative mood. It is probable that
                        purchases of Consols or any of the gilt edged stocks at present prices will
                        prove more satisfactory investments in any case than even home rails, as
                        there is still a considerable margin for a rise and no apparent possibility
                        of any fall.</p>
                    <p>Money Lying Idle</p>
                    <p>The expanding trade is seen in the Clearing House returns, which show fifteen
                        millions over the amount to the same date last year.Uninvested funds are
                        largely increasing. We hear of one private account having £250,000 lying
                        awaiting investment, and this is a typical case. The rush for the new
                        Japanese Loan is another indication of the same thing. This must induce new
                        issues, of which there have been very few of late. There are, of course, bg
                        Russian loans in the background, but it is not expected that Russia will
                        require so much money under a democratic Government, who would not be likely
                        to allow huge sums to be spent on armament, but who would rather hold tight
                        the national purse strings. </p>
                    <p>New Japanese Loan</p>
                    <p>In the market for foreign Government securities, interest during the week
                        has, of course, centered in the issue of new Japanese Loan. This was
                        effected on Tuesday, and the number of applications received was so large
                        that the list was closed at noon on Wednesday.It is estimated that the
                        amount subsriced covered the loan leaves off tonight at 1 15/16 - 5/16 prem.
                        The continued unfavorable news from Russia has had a further depressing
                        effect on Russian bonds, which close at 83 ½-4.</p>
                    <p>Home Rails</p>
                    <p>Good traffic returns favorably influenced the home railway market, but
                        disquieting news from Russia caused prices to ease off somewhat yesterday,
                        and they finished below the best. American rails have received moderate
                        support during the week. </p>
                    <p>Egyptian Banking</p>
               <p>Ina somewhat lugubrious letter sent to the "Economist" by a correspondent in
                        Alexandria, it is stated that, "As a matter of fact, the banks in Cairo and
                        Alexandria are tightening the strings round their customers on loan account,
                        and the majority have been called upon to reduce their debit balances within
                        stated times. Of all the land and financial flotations of the past twelve
                        months, not a single one has been admittedd to rank as bank security; and on
                        sound stocks and shares the banks are now, with few exceptions, charging not
                        less than 7 or 8 per cent for loans." It is quite right that the bankers
                        should limit loans to customers, and we cannot doubt that the effect will be
                        salutary. At the same time we are inclined to say that if, on really sound
                        stocks, bankers are charging 7 or 8 per cent., there is clearly room for
                        still further loaning institutions. But perhaps we may differ as to what
                        sound stocks and shares consist of.  It all comes back to what we stated in
                        our recent article, that the important thing is to create a class of
                        seccurity. To take a case in point. So far as we know, almost the whole of
                        the land and financial flotations of the past year are perfectly sound, but
                        a share in a more or less speculative security is never recckoned a proper
                        bank security. Assuming one of there land companies purchase a piece of
                        land, their first step should be to issue mortgage depentures, with the
                        extra security of the capital of the company, would in most cases be a
                        perfect bank security, an there would be no justification for such a rate as
                        7 or 8 per cent. for advances upon them. If the banks are not in a position
                        to advance money against such securities as these on moderate terms, it is
                        obvious that more competition is required. As a matter of fact, while the
                        number of  banks is increasing, we doubt if there is too much banking
                        facility obtainable, considering the country is going ahead and is throughly
                        sound and prosperous. But with such a class of security the London Banks and
                        Stock Exchange should supply the deficiency. We are very glad to hear that
                        the Egyptian banks are withholding all facilities from the small
                        speculators. </p>
                    <p>Egyptians</p>
                    <p>The Egyptian market since our last has been almost lifeless, and it is very
                        difficult to find a share which has been dealt in to any extent. National
                        Bank of Egypt were a firm market in the earlier part of the week and had a
                        smart jump from 25 to 26 buyers in about half an hour, but this latter price
                        again brought in sellers, and the shares have sagged away, closing 25 ¾.
                        Agricultural banks have been up 9 3/8, at which figure they close. The new
                        shares are about 8 5/8. Dairs Deterred and Ordinary close 107-109, and 17
                        3/8- 5/8 respectively. Delta Preference keep very firm with buyers about at
                        1 7/8, but, of course, these shares are worth their price, and are always
                        picked up if they fall much. The Deferred are a nominal market at 10-14.
                        Delta Lands are 2 ¼. Salt and Soda are abut 1 ¼ and Agyptian Markets 1 3/8.
                        Union Fonciere close a fraction easier at 1 premium.There has been a small
                        enquiry for Khedivial Mail Debentures, which are quoted nominally 83-87.The
                        Ordinary shares remain 1 1/8. Daira Sugar close 4 7/8. There is nothing
                        doing in Investment and Agency or Egyptian Estates. </p>
                    <p>Mines</p>
                    <p>In the mining market South Africans have improved in tone under the influence
                        of the optimistic statement by Sir Julius Werner, that he believed the
                        period of difficulties due to the war had now passed, and  that the mining
                        outlook was the brightest from every point of view. The Egyptian section
                        continues lifeless. Nile Valley close at ¾, and Block "E" are also 1/16
                        better on last week's quotation at 11/16. Egyptian Mines are slightly higher
                        at 12/8., bu tUm Rus are 1/8 lower at 17/18. United Africans are 1 5/8 after
                        being down to 1 9/16. </p>

                <p>THE COTTON MARKET.</p>
                <p>Kearsley and Cunningham’s Weekly Report. Liverpool, November 30.</p>
                <p>The Market this week has been very quiet, and the amount of business small;
                    quotations however are unchanged.</p>
                <p>In Futures a moderate business has been done and the following are the latest
                    values:–</p>
                <p>Dec. 8.11 Feb. 8.05 April 8.03 June 8.03 Jan. 8.06 Mar. 8.04 May 8.03 July
                    8.03</p>
                <p>American Futures. The Market this week has experienced frequent and wide
                    fluctuations; opening easy; prices declined 10 points. On Monday, with intense
                    excitement and an enormous business, prices advanced 30 points, in some of the
                    distant positions even more; then a sharp reaction of fully 20 points, and later
                    recovery of 7 points, to-day’s closing values being 4 @ 6 points higher than
                    those of last Thursday. The early decline was due to the heavy crop movements;
                    the large advance to Mr. Price’s announcement that he had practically covered
                    his short interest in view of a very “bullish” Bureau report, probably
                    indicating a crop of 10 million bales. His action no doubt precipitated the
                    covering up of other large short interests, followed by the usual sharp
                    reaction. American Markets are closed to-day for a National Holiday, but pending
                    the Bureau report to be issued next Monday, we do not anticipate any material
                    change meantime. Much will depend upon this report, and we think it will carry
                    great weight; what it will be, we do not believe anyone can say, but we hardly
                    expect such a serious reduction since their last issue, as an estimated of a
                    crop of only 10 millions would imply.</p>
