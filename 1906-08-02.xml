                        <p>The visit of Mustapha Pasha Kamel to London i-i symptomatic of the ohange
                            that has been brought about by the Anglo-French Agreement. A few years
                            ago the “Egyptian Patriot” woald not have ventured to visit London in
                            his official &lt;araoity as the month- piece of Egyptian Nationalism.
                            Bat London now a-days ofTars a far wider scope to this gentleman than
                            the French Capital oan. Only a few days ago the “Figaro” warned any
                            o&lt; its readers, who might be likely to sympathise with the Pasha’s
                            aspirations, that they were approaching dangerous ground by so doing,
                            inasmuch as any flirtation With Pan Islamic ideas would only be an
                            encouragement tr malcontents in Algeria and Tunis, and that i behoved
                            England and Franoe, in view of their interests in Northern Africa, to
                            offer a firm stand against each a dangerous formofpo’itica)
                            propaganda.</p>
                        <p> The French have, in faot, become rather wea(y of this ydnug man’s Agent
                            harangnea against England in Egypt, and fail to see the utility of
                            countenancing his intrigaes; especially as they have to gh^ern a vast
                            Moslem population. He has con&amp;qqaent’y tamed Lie attention to
                            London, ana\rom all accounts appears to be very energetic. r(e has
                            written letters to the “Standard” and tubs? Tribune been the gaest of
                            the evening at a yegeptioo of the Pan-Islamio Society, and entertained
                            to a Innch at the Carlton Hotel a nnmber of" M..P.s and also oce member
                            of the Upper Hoase, Lord Lyttoo, whose only connection with Egypt
                            appears to be that his brother is the sou-in-law of Mr. Wilfred Blant.
                            It had been expected that about thirty M.P.'s would have accepted the
                            Pasha’s invitation. Mr. Byles made his excuses this time, but among
                            M.P.’s present were Mr. J. M. Robertson, M.P. for the Tyneside division
                            of Northumberland ; Mr. J. F. Boland, M.P. for Sonth Kerry j and Mr.
                            Fnllerton, the Liberal Labour M.P. for We t Cumberland. Herr Karl Blind
                            was also among the guests.</p>
                        <p>Afterwards Mastapha Pasha Kamel declaim ed against the “errors and lies”
                            wh;ch are spread alMover Bogtand about his oonntry. “The hamniation of a
                            whole country and a whole race by a more than barbarous execu­tion,” he
                            said, “is not sufficient for the rnlers of Egypt. They mast throw
                            discredit on the Egyptian nation. The real movement in Egypt is a
                            national one. The Egyptian people want independence. The Sudan, tha soul
                            of onr oonntry, has been sna’ched from ns by English politicians.”</p>
                        <p>Elsewhere we give a report of theepeecb which the Editor of “Al Lewa”
                            gave to bis gneets. No doabt the Earopean population in Egypt will be
                            surprised that the Pasha could have collected a nnmber of M.P.’s
                            together to listen to his Anglophobe harangue. Bat after an excellent
                            Innch at the Carlton it does not matter much what oratory follows, and
                            as nlost of the Labour and Nationalist guests of the Pasha were probably
                            incapable of following his fluent French it is charitable to suppose
                            that the greater part of the speech was incom­prehensible to those
                            present. The spokesman of the guests, the M. P. for Tyneiide, appears to
                            have been gaarded in his words. He de­clared that “the Egyptian
                            Nationalists shoo/d be frank and open in their demands, aod if they
                            aoted with prndenoe and patience, they might one day secure the blessing
                            of the giaranteed independence of Egypt” The meaning of the latter
                            phrase is really on a par with Lord Cromer’s declaration that “al­though
                            it may take a long time to arrive at Egyptian autonomy, that antonomy is
                            the ultimate goal towards which reform should gradually be
                            directed.”</p>
                        <p>That the visit of the Pasha will have any results we do not for one
                            moment believe. Not a single person of any weight in the political world
                            was among his gnests, and the fact that Mr. Byles failed to attend is
                            curiously signi­ficant. It is worth while, however, to remind oar
                            Liberal contemporaries on the London Press, who may be prone to listen
                            to onr oon- fr^re’s persuasive eloquence, that any support they may be
                            Refined to give him is tant­amount to a Tnrcophile policy in Egypt and
                            tfie Near East. As soon as the Little Euglan ier wing of the present
                            Government grasp tbia obvious faot, they will leavp Mnstapha Pasha Kamel
                            severely alone, for although they may detest Imperialism, they detest
                            the Saltan far more, and all the propaganda of the “Egyptian Patriot” is
                            merely directed towards the re­establishment of the political power of
                            tbe Caliph in Egypt and the Sudan.</p>

                        <p>ENGLAND AND TURKEY.</p>
                        <p>For a few hoars last week there was (a Constantinople correspondent
                            relates) every appearance of a fresh * incident” between Eng­land »nd
                            Turkey, but, happily, it has all been settled satisfactorily.</p>
                        <p>Early on Thursday morning a number of police and soldiers saddenly
                            surrounded an English ooal store, and allowed no one to enter or
                            approaoh it Tha Consulate, on being appealed to, sent a representative
                            to the spot, bnt he conld only find ont that an iradl had baen issaed,
                            though no one knew the reason. The Consulate applied to the Minister of
                            Police, and next day it was discovered that some months ago a meichant
                            had bought a quantity of old iron from the Admiralty, amongst which was
                            an old gun, broken np, and had placed it in a store called tbe Tiftik
                            Hane, previous to shipping it to England. Meanwhile, somebody reported
                            that the Admiralty were selling gans, which were bsing taken to the
                            Tiftik Hane Mohair Store, and an irad£ was immediately issaed ordering
                            the store* at Tiftik Hane to be searched. Unfortunately, Tarkish is a
                            difficult language to write, and, in the order, a single dot wai
                            omitted, so that it read “the store at Tewfeak Hane Gan Store.” The
                            □olioe therefore raided the only store near tbe Tewfenk Hane, which
                            happened to be a ooal store.</p>
                        <p>Oq this being explained, proper apologies were made, and the incident was
                            closed. It reminds one of the confusion that arose be­tween Tabah and
                            Dab ah, owing to the omission if a dot.</p>

                            working. When one of the Btriksrs approach ed these men a policemen

                        <p>An affray whioh, but for the prompt in­tervention of Bimhashi Parsons,
                            the Governor, might have had serions results, occurred on the 17th ult.
                            at a new village a mile or so west of Port Sadan. The place is occupied
                            by Sadanese, who had built the vi’lages and were, as is their castom,
                            digging wells, which were closely guarded from outsiders.</p>
                        <p>On the evening of the 17th several Haden- dawa approached one of the
                            wells, but were ordered off by the ghaffir, whe trie! to seize the 8word
                            of oue of the party. The ghaffir was kuocked down, and his cries
                            attracted the villagers, who gave chase to the intruders, stoning them
                            as they ran.</p>
                        <p>The Hadendowa, however, being reinforoed and numbering sixty, returned
                            armed to the teeth and attacked their pnreners, with whom they wore well
                            matched, and thanks to their weapons wonnded twenty-five of them, six

                        <p>It was at thia psychological moment, as the saying goes, that Bimbashi
                            Parsons,* with a detachment of troops, police, and ghaffirs, arrived and
                            promptly separated the warriors, and arrested those of them who ha I not

                        <p>The enmity between Sadanese and Haden­dowa is proverbial,and skirmishes
                            are frequent between them.</p>

                        <p>A White Paper has been issued dealing with the recent ontrage upon
                            British officers in Egypt, and with the subsequent executions at
                            Denishwai. The correspondence is prefaced by a Khedivial decree, dated
                            February, 1$95, which sets up a special tribunal for dealing with crimes
                            committed by natives against offioers or men of tie British Army of
                            Occupation, or of any British warship stationed in an Egyptian port.</p>
                        <p>A report to Sir Edward Grey by the Earl of Cromer, dated June 15, states
                            that the natives attaoked the offioers with nabonts, or heavy ! sticks,
                            and that the most serious attaok was made with these nabouts after the
                            offioers had been deprived of their guns, and were conse­quently
                            defenceless. “This fact,” he points ont, “shows a very hostile and
                            determined spirit on the part of the villagers.” A tele­gram from Mr.
                            Findlay, our aoting Agent after Lord Cromer’s departure, to Sir E. Grey,
                            on June 22, states that even the anti-English Press speaks of the
                            “olemenoy” ot the offioers attacked, and regards the oonduot of the
                            vil­lagers as casting discredit on the whole Egyp­tian people, as well
                            as being indefensible in itself.</p>
                        <p>A subsequent dispatch to Lord Cromer lays emphasis on the facts that the
                            offioers had gone to shoot by invitation, that the attack was probably
                            premeditated, and that a small fire whioh broke ont on a threshing-floor
                            (not in a granary, as previously stated), and which was at once
                            extinguished, was probably a precon­certed signal for this attaok, and
                            not the chief oanse of the exoitement. In Lord Cromer’s view this
                            premeditation against officers in uniform gives a very serions aspect to
                            the incident.</p>
                        <p>A post-mortem examination made by the medioo-legal expert of the native
                            tribunals established that the blow given to Capt. Boll had caused
                            concussion of the brain, and that while not sufficient to cause death,
                            it had reduced him to a weak condition, in whioh he was quickly affected
                            by sanstroke, and had thns acted as a contributory oanse of his death.
                            It is added at least two severe blows on the head were received by Ball
                            after his helmet had been knocked off; subsequently, when already
                            safferiDg from concussion, he was com­pelled by his assailants to run in
                            the snn.</p>
                        <p>With respect to the trial of the prisoners arrested for taking part in
                            the outrage, Mr. Findlay informs Sir E. Grey that “the deoision of the
                            Court was unanimous. Premeditation</p>
                        <p>and concerted action were clearly established 15 or 20 years,, escaped

                            Capt. Ball. II Having laid down these grave considerations, am informed

                            apeoial cases it should not be retained. He also expressed its opinion
                            that extreme forbearance proposes that the.terms of the Decree of 1895
                            and self-restraint characterised the behaviour should be amended in the
                            souse of, for the of the officers. It was only after the latter fQtnre,

                            oootinued it in cold blood and showed the greatest brutality. Three ot
                            the best-known native advooates defended the aconsed and were given a

                            occasionally differ from them oerned.” He adds that the “reports
                            published as to the time and method of giving effect to</p>
                        <p>in the Press have mostly been either false or inacourate, in spite of
                            every facility having been given. The Egyptian, being a fatalist, does
                            not greatly fear death, and there is there fore much to be said for
                            flogging as a jadioial punishment in Egypt.”</p>
                        <p>The most serious part of the correspondence oonoerns the effect prodaoed
                            in Egypt by the attitude of a certain seotion of the Radical party in
                            Parliament. On this subject, Mr. Findlay, telegraphing to Sir E Grey on
                            July 5. uses plain language. “It is my duty,” he says, “to warn you of
                            the deplorable effect whioh is being produced in E *ypt by the fact that
                            mem­bers of Parliament have seriously oallel in question the unanimous

                        <p>memorandum by the Earl of Cromer, in whioh</p>
                        <p>he offars some general remarks upon the Denish­wai incident, and opon its
                            relation to the administration of jastioe in Egypt. Expressing his
                            concurrence in the Bteps taken by Mr. Find­lay, he says, 'Hid I remainel
                            in Egypt, I should in every respect have adopted the same course as that
                            which he pursued. The prisoners had a perfectly fair trial, by a very
                            well-oonsti- tated Court, all the members of whioh spoke Arabic, in
                            which language most of the proceed­ings were conducted. I consider that
                            the sen­tences, though severe, were j asfc and necessary.</p>
                        <p>I can see nothing reprehensible in the manner in which they were
                            executed. I may remark that Mr. Machell, who was in charge of the
                            proceedings, is asingnlarly humane man, and is very popular among the
                            natives of Egypt by reason of the great sympathy he has always shown for
                            them.”</p>
                        <p>Then follows a lengthy survey of past judi­cial and administrative
                            methods in Egypt, demonstrating the infamous frequency with whioh, for
                            the slightest offences and by the most subordinate officials, the lash
                            was nsed with severity. This state of things, on the initiative of Lord
                            Dufferin and his successors, has been completely changed, hut with
                            results that our pseudo-humanitarians at home should carefully weigh.
                            “One of the results of the sadden abolition of the ‘courbash’ was that
                            the people refased to work. I well remember that at one time it seemed
                            that the alternatives would be presented to the Egyptian Govern­ment and
                            ita British advisers of either allowing the fields to remain
                            uncultivated, or else of per­mitting the people to be flogged in order
                            to save them from starvation. It was only the very remarkable skill
                            shown by Sir Colin Moncrieff and his assistants whioh enabled the
                            Government to tide over the period of transi­tion—a period whioh, I may
                            observe, I think caused me greater anxiety than any other daring my
                            lengthened Egyptian experience. A farther result whioh ensaed from the
                            imme­diate abolition of the ‘oonrbash’ was that life and property became
                            insecure. Ot all the Egyptian Ministers with whom I have had to deal,
                            none, probably, had a greater respeot for the law than Nubar Pasha, who
                            assumed office ahoot a year after the isaae of Lord Dnfferin’s famous
                            Circular. Nubar Pasha, however, found it necessary to appoint what were
                            termed ‘Commissions of Brigandage’—in other words, to introduce martial
                            law.</p>
                        <p>“Since that time various improvements have been made in the system of
                            jastioe, hut the point to which I wish to draw special attention now is,
                            that gradually the lawless portion of the community in Egypt began to
                            understand that a principle which, so far as they were concerned, was
                            entirely novel, had been intro­duced into the administration of jastioe.
                            It was that no one could he punished for a orime unless he was proved to
                            be guilty. Farther,they oame to understand that proof, whioh would
                            satisfy the Law Co arts, was extremely difficult to obtain, and that in
                            the large maj crity of cases, even when guilt was proved, the
                            punish­ments were far from being severe. The result has been that, in
                            default of adequate proof, a large number of persons accused of crime,
                            who were unquestionably guilty, have, during the</p>
                        <p>nature of those sanctioned by the penal code.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion, Lord Cromer says “There is no royal road to progress in
                            Egypt. Any attempt to prematurely foroe Western institu­tions and
                            Western ideas on the people on only have one resalt, namely, to produce
                            a reaction,</p>

                        <p>Mustapha Pasha Kamel gave a political dejeuner at the Carlton Hote’, last
                            Thursday, at whioh he expounded his views and those of the party he
                            represents before a small gather­ing. Among the guests were Lord LyttoDj
                            Mr. John M Robertson, M.P., Mr. Boland, M.P., Herr Karl Blind, and M.
                            Suhrawardi, Secre­tary to tho Pan Islamic Association.</p>
                        <p>In the course of a long and animated address in French, Kamel Pasha
                            declared that many errors and falsehoods were current in England with
                            regard to the Egyptian population. It was said, for instance, that they
                            were fanatical. Nothing could be farther from the troth. If by
                            fanatioism it was only meant that they were Mnssqlmans, then one might
                            as well say the English were fanatics because they, with that great man
                            Gladstone at their head, sympathiz­ed with the Christians of Eastern
                            Earope. The fact was that Islamism enjoined them to treat the Christians
                            with justice and equity, and theirProphet was married to aChristian
                            woman. A National Movement.</p>
                        <p>The present agitation in Egypt was a natio­nal movement. The Egyptian
                            people were more than ever attached to the principle of the
                            in­dependence of therir territory. Certain people were hypnotized by the
                            financial situation of Egypt, and were astonished that the Egyptians are
                            not happy under the regime of a foreign occupation. To hear them talk
                            one would think that Egypt was a bazaar and not a fatherland. In order
                            to understand why Egyptians deplor­ed the English occupation, one must
                            hear in mind that England has taken from them the Sudan, whioh was the
                            very soul of their ooub- try, and for which they had made so many
                            sacrifices. Again, the number of English officials continually
                            increased, while that of the Egyp­tian officials decreased.</p>
                        <p>One of the chief causes of discontent related to education. Before the
                            oooapation, when the Badget of Egypt was far less heavy than at present,
                            the Government schools were free. Under Lord Cromer education was
                            reserved for the children of the rich. The Nationalist Party in Egypt
                            did all they could to remedy this lamentable state of tbiugs. A large
                            number of poor children received free education in national schools
                            supported by voluntary con­tributions.</p>
                        <p>Administration of the Law.</p>
                        <p>Then there was the question of the adminis­tration of the law. The numbar
                            of English judges in the courts was constantly increasing, and at the
                            same time Lord Cromer clang to that extraordinary tribanal, the doings
                            of whioh at Denirhwai had aroused so muoh indignation. In was a
                            monstrous abuse that in a civilized country there should exist a court
                            which had no oode or law, and from whose decisions there was no appeal
                            and no hope of pardon. He de* manded in the name of justice and humanity
                            the revision of the Denishwai judgment before independent judges, such
                            as those of the Mixed Court of Appeal at Alexandria.</p>
                        <p>With regard to the trial of foreigners for criminal offences, Egyptians
                            were indignant to see so many of them get off soot-free owing to what
                            were called the Capitulations. Foreign prisoners should he sent for
                            trial before the mixed tribunals, which inspired confidence.</p>
                        <p>It would Dot he forgotten that Egypt de­manded, and obtained, daring the
                            revolution of 1882 a constitution. England annulled the gift, while
                            promising, through Lord Dufferin, to restore it to Egypt in due season.
                            Nothing could secure for Egyptians tranquillity, jastioe, and order hut
                            a constitution giving the people the right of control over the measures
                            of the Government. In claiming its liberty, Egypt did not ask for alms,
                            hat for a reoognized and incontestable right.</p>
                        <p>At the close of Kamel Pasha’s address, Mr. J. M. Robertson ass a red him
                            cf the sympathe­tic interest whioh his views inspired in those who had
                            listened to him. Mr. R ffiertson express­ed no opinion upon the
                            Denishwai affiir, but said the Egyptian Nationalist Party had the aotive
                            sympathy of a large part of the English people, wno understood their
                            aspirations, and hoped that, with prudence and deliberation, the
                            independence whioh had been guaranteed to their omintry would heoome an
                            accomplished fact. 1</p>
                        <p>THE PASHA INTERVIEWED. . In conversation with a representative of ’ “The
                            Daily Chronicle,” Kamel Pasha made ’ the following carefal and
                            considered statement i of the views of his party:— 1</p>
                        <p>“In the first place,” he said, “it is essential to impress upon the
                            English people the simple troth that fanatioism—by whioh I mean
                            reli­gious animosity—has no existenoe at all in Egypt. The charge of
                            fanatioism is always recurring, and it is invariably trumped up with a
                            view to injuring our people. There is do hatred whatever towards
                            Christians as sneh.</p>
                        <p>It is too often forgotten that Islam commands tolerance and jastice
                            towards Christians, and the Prophet himself set the example by marry­ing
                            a Christian wife.</p>
                        <p>Religious Toleranoe.</p>
                        <p>“And of all Mussulmans the Egyptians are</p>
                        <p>the most tolerant. The Mohamedans have lived side by side with the
                            Christian Copts for centuries, and men of all nationalities resident in
                            Egypt have recognised onr Liberalism in thia respeot. Many EuroDeans
                            have even con­tributed to the rational sohools established among ns by
                            private subscription.</p>

                            newspapers, and so on. We were the first Mussulman people to adopt
                            European civilisa­tion and yet the English seem to regard ns as</p>

                            qaite as high a culture as the lead­ing European States. It is absurd to
                            compare ns with Moroocn, or with Lake Chad, as many English people
                            do.</p>
                        <p>“Ofcouree, we feels natural sympathy with the other peoples of I’lam,
                            just as Gladstone used to speak of the Armenians as his brothel
                            Christians; hut Islam must never be confound­ed with fanaticism among
                            us. Such parties as the Jew baiters or the more violent political and
                            religious sects of Europe oooldnot exist in Egypt. Do you suppose that
                            if we had been fanatics the small British army of occupation could have
                            held its own in a population of 12,000,000, or that Lord Cromer
                            ooal&lt;M|ave induced as to believe we were happy and prosperous for
                            twenty-four years ? In face of recent assertions I cannot too often
                            repeat that fanaticism does not exist among us. Egypt is the land of
                            true democracy and Liberalism.We know well enough that fanatioism
                            produces only destruction, but a Liberal spirit works for the progress
                            and enlightenment at which we aim. Tho Denishwai Exooutlons.</p>
                        <p>“The method of the Denishwai trial and ol the executions has undoubtedly
                            prodaoed a most painful impression on all classes. The nation has never
                            been so unanimous. Even the bitterest opponents of the British occupa
                            tion could not have believed such an outrage possible. All Egypt from
                            the sea to Nubia felt that such treatment was barbarous and unworthy

                            independence should nevertheless be guaranteed by the Powers^, as is the
                            case with sc many small nationalities^ For onrselves, we demand a free
                            constitution and a truly national Government, bat as long as our debt to
                            Earope continues we are per­fectly willing to accept the financial
                            oontrol of England or of France.</p>
                        <p>Education Arrested.</p>
                        <p>“Till this independence comes, we shall devote all our power to extending
                            education among onr people. A thing whioh oame as a shock to all
                            Egyptians, and, I think, migh t well shook all civilised people, was
                            England’s refasal to grant higher edaoation to the poor in the
                            Government sohools. Before the British occupation all Government schools
                            were free, or pretty nearly free, and tha ohildren of poor parents could
                            rise to the highest positions in the State. In faot, most of the
                            remarkable men of modern Egypt have been ohildren of poor parents.</p>
                        <p>“But the British system opens these sohools only to the rich, who oan pay
                            the oost of higher edaoation. Lord Cromer has instituted a feeble kind
                            of elementary education for the poor, bnt no students are now admitted
                            free into the good sohools, and among a demooratio people like onrselves
                            it is rightly regarded as a orime to prevent the poor from sharing in
                            the highest t edaoation. This grievance alone would have , sofficed to
                            make the British Administration</p>
                        <p>•hated.</p>
                        <p>“But, above all, it is, as I have said, national k independence and a
                            free Constitution whioh . we demand. Even Tewfik granted ns a Pariia- l
                            ment, which was destroyed when the British oame. Lord Dufferin promised
                            ns a Parliami j again in 1885, hat nothing has oome of th promises, and
                            now Lord Cromer has</p>

                        <p>In Egyptian cotton rather more business has been done this week ; the
                            only changes however in quotations are a reduction of i per lb. in Fiue,
                            and an advance of J per lb. in G. od Brown. Uppers are unchanged. In
                            Futures a fair business has taken place, and the latest valaes are,

                        <p>American Futures —Business this week has again been very restricted, and
                            prices have experienced a fall of 13 points, to day’s olosing values
                            being 11 @ 12 points be^ow those of last Thursday. The decline has been
                            chiefly dne to weariness at the limited nature ot tho business general
                            pessimistic sentiment, and to considerable uneasiness at the condition
                            of affairs in Russia. The crop reports are gene­rally accepted as
                            favourable, although there have been continued rains over certain
                            portions of the cotton area, which in more lively dr CQmstances would
                            probably have attracted more attention, and which may become serious if
                            prolonged.</p>

                        <p>Home Ralls.</p>
                        <p>There are several additional home railway dividend returns to annoanoe,
                            most of whioh have been received by the market with satis­faction. The
                            Lancashire and Yorkshire in­creases its rate from 3j to 4 per oent. per
                            annum, this being the best for any Jane half- year since 1900. The South
                            Eastern distri­bution is at the rate of 1 per cent, per annum, against |
                            per cent. 12 months ago. The Chatham pays £2.17 per cent, on its First
                            Preference stock, as compared with 2| per cent. The London and Soath
                            Western main­tains its rate of 4 per oent., and places £20,000, whereas
                            last year no allocation to reserve was made. There was some
                            disappoint­ment that the Great Central is only distributing 2 per cent,
                            on the 1889 Preference stock, the market having expected something like
                            3| per oent. On the 1881 Preference the dividend is increased from 3 to
                            5 per oent. The Central London and Waterloo and City dividends remain
                            unchanged at 4 and 3 per cent, res­pectively, hot that of the City and
                            Sooth London is J higher at 2j. The North Staf­fordshire rate is also
                            increased by a similar amount to 4 per oent. The North Eastern announce
                            a dividend of per oent., an increase of and the amount carried forward
                            is increased by £20,651.</p>
                        <p>The home railway market has derived considerable strength from these
                            returns, and the shares have been actively dealt in. Quota­tions are
                            very appreciably better on balance. Americans.</p>
                        <p>Some weakness was noticeable in the American railway market as a result
                            of the death of Mr. Russell Sage, but the determined buying of the
                            shares by Wall Street-due to a desire to prevent the Rassian trouble
                            from becoming a bear influence—speedily dispelled the gloom, and for the
                            greater part of the week the tone has been Arm. Union Pacifies have
                            again received aotive sapport, and the closing price to night shows an
                            advance of no less than 5 points at t55 j. Chioago-Mil- waukee also have

                        <p>It is being more and more reoognised that there is a good futare for
                            these shares, in view of the excellent agrioultnral and oatton orop
                            prospects, and the continually improving state of trade throughout the
                            country. With steadier money conditions, the advance in American railway
                            stocks is bound to be rapid. Egyptians^</p>

                        <p>The South African market has developed quite a substantial reoovery since
                            onr last, aod although it is doubtless the fact that this is largely due
                            to professional buying, it is none the less satisfactory that the
                            operations should have been so effective. It certainly indicates a
                            complete change of tone, and augurs,well for the future. To dealers,who
                            have had to undergo a long period of depression, the revival this week
                            has been verv welcome, and they have displayed some of their old-time
                            oheerfulness. Most of the shares have steadily advanced, and Rand Mines,
                            East Rands, Goldfields, ModderfonteiDS, and South African Gold Mines are
                            all up about J.</p>

                    <p>It is understood that the battleship Dread­nought, whioh is completing at
                        Portsmouth, will be ready for commissioning well within the time allowed by
                        the Admiralty. The armament of the ship is being prepared with unremitting
                        energy, though a little delay has arisen in mounting the two guns of the
                        port side barbette. These are the only big guns that have not been put in
                        position. The two after barbettes have been plaoed one behind the other, so
                        that the gans of the more forward one will not be able to fire over the
                        other, as has been freely asserted in an offioial description. The gnu fire
                        of the ship when finished will thas be six guns firing ahead and a similar
                        number astern, with eight guns on either beam. The vessel’s two tripod masts
                        have been shipped, and form a striking con­trast to the ordinaiy masts of a
                        warship, being somewhat ungainly and awkward in appearance. They are of
                        different sizes, the heavier one being plaoed amidships. This carries a big
                        fire control station, and to the mast will be attached the gaff for the
                        wireless telegraphy gear. The second mast, which is placed aft, is also
                        fitted with a fire control station.</p>
                    <p> The Admiralty issaed last night a memoran­dum explanatory of the programme
                        of new constructions for 1905 6,with details not includ­ed in the Navy
                        Estimates for 1906-7. Among the details givea are the principal features of
                        the Dreadnought design, whioh are now offi­cially issaed for the first time.
                        The battleship’s armament is given as ten 12 inch gans, twenty- seven
                        12-poander quick firing anti torpedo boat gans, and five submerged torpedo
                        tubes. In the arrangement of the armament adopted, six of the guns are
                        mounted in pairs on the centre line of the ship. The remaining four guns are
                        mounted in pairs on the broadside. Thus eight 12-inoh gans (80 per oent. of
                        the main arma­ment) can be fired from either broadside, and four or possibly
                        six 12-inoh gans, or 60 per oent. of the main armament,oan be fired
                        simul­taneously ahead or astern. In view of the potentialities of modern
                        torpedo oraft, and considering especially the ohances of torpedo attaok
                        towards the end of an action, the anti-torpedo boat gnns are separated as
                        widely as possible from one another, so that the whole of them shall not be
                        disabled by one or two heavy shells. Special attention has been given to
                        safeguarding the ship from destruction by underwater explosion. The question
                        of the best type of propelling machinery was most thoroughly considered by
                        the committee of naval and scientific experts, and the memorandum states
                        that there was no difficulty in arriving at a decision to adopt the torbine
                        propalsion from the point of view of sea going speed only. The point that
                        chiefly occupied the committee was the question of providing sufficient
                        stopping and turning power for purposes of quick and easy mance ivriDg ; and
                        after experiments it was considered that all requirements in this respeot
                        promised to be fully met by the adoption of turbine machinery. The speed
                        designed tor the Dreadnought is 21 kuots., and the coal bunker capacity is
                        2.700 tons. With this amount of ooal she will be able to steam about 5,809
                        sea miles at economical speed, and about 3,500 at 18J knots, after allowance
                        has been made for bad weather and for a small amount of ooal loft in the
                        bunkers, The total estimated oost of the Dreadnought as revised, including
                        guns, is given as £ 1,797.497.</p>

                            doings daring July is taken from the All Saints’ Church magazine:—</p>
                        <p>The matches played by the Institute daring Jaly provided nothing very
                            sensational, the chief feature of an uneveutfal month’s cricket being
                            the superb all-round play of M. T. Smith. This player has figured as
                            hatsmaD, bowler, and wicket keeper, and has been highly suc­cessful in
                            all three positions. In fact, he was the only one of the old players to
                            do hia self jastice. v Two very capable players have been found in
                            Messrs. E. Seeley and W. Cadman. The former is a bowler of no small
                            merit, while the latter is an extremely useful batsman. Mr. F. de Costa,
                            though not so successful with the bat as usual, captained the team as
                            well as it coaid possibly be done, and the Institute were fortunate when
                            they secured his services. Not once daring the whole month have the
                            R.I.C.C. been able to put a strong team in the field, and ody on one
                            occasion did they win. On the 8th Angnst, Rev. J. T. Boms returns from
                            England, and with him as captain, it is to he hoped that the R.I.C.C.
                            will improve their fairly good position. d</p>

                            that 33 were up for one wicket, but so well did Smith and Riley bowl
                            that the remaining nine fell for the addition of only 18 rurs, the
                            R.I.C.C. thus winning by 32.</p>

                            have they given a more inglorious display than in this match. Catoh
                            after catch was dropped and the throwing in was terribly erratic. The
                            visitors deolared at the abova-menticned score. The institute didn’t do
                            much when batting, the only noteworthy featares being the batting of
                            Cadman and the careful play of E. 8eeley, which enabled the Institute to
                            effect a drawx</p>
                        <p>Another draw was the result of the match with the Military Police. The
                            Railway men, who batted first, gave a good exhibition. The hero of the
                            matoh was T. Smith, who batted for eighty minutes. His inniogs of 54 not
                            out was absolutely faultless. The total was 128. The first six wiokets
                            of the Police fell in quick suooession but by oare- ful play, the two
                            men who were partnered for the seventh, kept in till time, the soore
                            being 85.</p>
                        <p> The Institute lost to the Sergts. King’s Royal Rifls Corps on Friday,
                            20th July, The Sergts, took first knook and were all ont for 76. E.
                            Se3ley bowled very well indeed, disposing of five baatmen for only 21
                            runs. The home team only managed to soore 48, the Sergts, thus winning
                            by 28 rnns.</p>

                        <p>MOUNT TROODOS,</p>
                        <p>Cyprus.</p>
                        <p>A limited number of paying gne t* can be received by a Lady daring the
                            Sarnmer Months. Cyprus is 24 hours by sea from Port 8aid. Troodo* 6,406
                            feet abjve the sea is a delightful and healthy place amongst the pice
                            forests where the troops and Government Officials spend the hot
                            season</p>
                        <p>Terms 2J Guineas per week.</p>
                        <p>Fvr farther particulars apply to Miss YOUNG,</p>
                        <p>Nikosia, or to the Editor</p>
                        <p>Further Particulars.</p>
                        <p>Position. The pine covered slopes of Mount Troodos where Miss Young has a
                            eamp, are about 6406 feet nlxive the sea ; the troops stationed in
                            Cyprus and the Principal Government Officials live there during the hot
                            season from about June till October.</p>
                        <p>Routes. Troodos is about 35 miles from the port of Limassol from which
                            there is a good carriage road to Platres 31 in. Beyond Platres the road
                            is good but steep and from that point people often ride on mules for the
                            rest of the journey. There is also an excellent road from the Capital,
                            Nicosia, by which j>ersons going from that side of the Island drive all
                            the way (about 16 miles).</p>
                        <p>Climate. The climate is very dry and healthy; in the daytime it is
                            delightful ; the nights, especially after the end of August, are often
                            rather cold.</p>
                        <p>Dress. There is a good deal of red dust on the hills, and ladies should
                            lie provided with washing skirts. White is a good deal worn, but it is
                            advisable to have some brown, fawn, or dust-coloured linen dresses which
                            do not shew dust stains as the washing is not first rate. A warm woollen
                            “coat and skirt” costume is also indispensable.</p>
                        <p>Rides. There are plenty of delightful rides amongst the hills, but the
                            roads and bridle paths are too steep for bicycles. Mules and ponies can
                            be hired for the</p>
                        <p>season.</p>
                        <p>Expeditions. Places of interest to lx* reached on mule or jxmy back are
                            Kykko Monastery, Kalopanaioti, Trooditissa Monastery, etc.</p>
                        <p>Games. There is a Tennis Club with two good Courts, there are also one or
