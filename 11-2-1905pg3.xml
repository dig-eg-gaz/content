                        <head>THE  RESTORATION OF NOUZHA.</head>
                        <p>Nouehs Gardens, situated on the bank of the Mahmoudieh Canal, near Ramleh, destined shortly to become one of the fashionable rendezvous of Alexandrians. For years past the grounds, at one time beautiful, have been allowed to go to wreck and ruin, being only used for an occasional picnic party.
                            A charge has now come over the place, however. The Municipality, at the beginning ol the present year, very wisely decided to take the property in hand, and restore it to its pristine beauty ; and judging by what we saw during a recent visit, a most excellent beginning has been made. If the necessary funds are forthcoming Alexandria will in a very short time be endowed with a park and grounds worthy of a big city, attractive not only to residents—who are sore to make it their favorite drive—but also to visitors.
                            The grounds now present a most charming and fascinating aspect. Avenues, alleys, and paths have been laid out, all the undergrowth has been removed, the grotto and pond have been completely relaid, hedges trimmed, and new beds and a lawn laid out. Great attention has been paid to the trees; of which some very rare specimens are to be found, and these have been brought Well into view. A special plot, shaded and cool, has been cleared out for the use of children,
                            We particularly noticed a plot laid out with chrysanthemums. There are a thousand of these plants to be seen in full bloom, and they present a striking and most beautiful mass of colours, some blooms being particularly noticeable for their vivid colour and size. It is quite, a good show, and Augurs well for the future.
                            We hope that now this excellent beginning has been made the work will be kept up, and that by next year, with a band day and the necessary accommodation provided for afternoon tea, etc., Nousha will become the rendezvous of our local "smart set.”</p></div>

                            <p>In a letter to the London "Standard,” on speculation in sugar, Mr. Geo. Mathieson, managing director of Messrs. Clarke, Nickolls, and Coombs, Ltd., says :— The French expert at the Brussels Convention, the late M. Cromer, although in the end he overreached himself; quite correctly recognised in that international compact the finest Instrument for speculation that had been forged for many a day. Its restrictions in preventing the free circulation of sugar delivered consumers for a time into the cornerers’ hands. It was largely owing to the small surpluses of Russia, etc., that Mr. Martineau despises, finding their way round, and setting free for export sugar otherwise required in non-prohibited countries, that the corner was ultimately broken up. Although M. Cronier, by attempting to grasp to much, came to disaster, other more fortunate speculators succeeded in fleeting sugar consumers in this country alone to the tune of at least £6,000,000 during the last twelve months, as can be seen by the Board of Trade figures. It is no mean achievement, and while the convention is in operation, other speculators, when chance offers, will work it to the same end more effectively, and, perhaps, guided by the Cronier disaster, more wisely for themselves. But we are hopeful our lesson has been learnt, and that no British Government will be mad enough to renew the contention, or ever again enter into a similar compact, In an article on the financial situation and the position of the Basque de Ftaooe, the "Monitear des InWrtts Maferiels” remarks:--
                                " Il est certain que si les traites Cronier avaient été présentées à la Banque de France, elles auraient été presentées. Le tireur était depuis longtemps assez suspect an point de vue do-crédit dans le monde 'financier.

                        <p>The Egyptian Government has issued a circular relative to those who wish  accompany the Mahmal caravan to the Hadjas, in which it points out the advantages which are gained by making the pilgrimage under such conditions.
                            This year, as in former years, the Government has decided to allow those who are desirous of so doing, and who undertake to submit to the prescribed conditions, to accompany the" Mahmal caravan.
                            Those who take Advantage of this offer of the Government will he placed under the protection of the Emir el Hag and the military escort of the Malmat, and in case of need they will receive immediate medial care and ebemists, who are at the disposal of the accompanying pilgrimage are also attached to the Caravan. The journey will also be accomplished by the shortest possible and least laborious route, and under special conditions as regards comfort safety, and prestige. The cost of the expedition will be lessened by joining the caravan, as pilgrims will profit by the advantageous arrangements which the Emir el Hag is able to make regarding camels.
                            In So far as the expenses of the journey  concerned, experience has shown that the sums deposited in former years have been insufficient, and for the present year it has been decided that those accompanying the Mahmal must make the following deposits, according to the degree of comfort they desire to travel in: L.E. 25.500mm. for each first class passenger; including charge for one camel (an extra charge of L.E. 13.500 mm, is made for every additional camel); L.E 23 for the second class passenger with [    ] camel ; L.E. 20.500mm. for the third class passenger with one camel; LE. 14 whenever camel is shared by two pilgrims ; L.E. 10.500m. for every child from 4 to 10 years of age who shares a camel  another child or with a parent.</p></div>

                        <head>THE LATE SIR CHARLES WILSON</head>
                        <p>The "Times" gives the following appreciation of he Sudan career of the late Sir Charles Wilson:--- When troubles with Egypt were brewing in1882, Sir Charles Wilson volunteered for special service in that country, and after the

                            Lord Dufferin’s mission until the end of 1883. For the Egyptian campaign he received a medal and the Khedive a Star and promotion by brevet to the rank of colonel in the Army. He also received the honorary degree of D.C.L. from Oxford in 1883. Up to that time honors had been gained in peaceful fields either by scientific ____________ or by ___matic successes. As a natural consequence of _______________________ his military advancement had been relatively slow. The chance for him to earn distinction in the leadership of mend did not come until he had lost the habit of thinking and acting as a soldire. All Sir Charles Wilson's Oriental experience and familiarity with Ara________ marked him as an _____________ to direct the intelligence branch of a force operating against native tribes in the Sudan. For these duties therefore, he was appointed Deputy-Adjutant and Quartermaster-General on the Headquarters staff with Lord Wolseley's expedition for ____ relief of General Gordon in September, 1884. One of his subordinates then was Captain Horatio Herbert Ki_____, who, holding temporary rank as a major in the Egyptian Army, had been sent up the Nile by Sir Evelyn Wood earlier that year to prepare the way for an advance by enlisting the services of Sheikhs who had no thrown in their lot with the Dervishes. Much of the organisation on which Sir Charles Wilson relied afterwards for news of the Mahdi's movements was thus rady at hand. Nevertheless he had to exercise great discretion and keen judgement in sifting the evidence of agents whose stories were more often than not untrustworthy. That he performed these duties to Lord Wolseley's entire satisfaction is proved by frequent -mention in despatches, though events several thinks discounted the value of his conclusions. He did however, succeed in establishing communications with the beleagureed her in _______________________ were kept up to the last by ___________________ fidelity to the cause they served _____________ in question simply because _____________ taken did not give them a _____________ any important secrets. When Sir Herbert Stewart's little force set out from Korti on January 6, 1885, for a hazardous but glorious march across the Bayuda desert, Sir Charles Wilson accompanied it. To him Lord Wolseley had entrusted a letter for General Gordon, with orders that he should deliver it into the hands of the defender of Khartoum. There was no thought at that time of the possibility of his having to command the desert column if Sir Herbert Stewart should be killed or wounded seriously. Lord Wolseley had made arrangements, which were shattered when in Colonel Fred Burnaby fell fighting at Abou Klea.
                            After Sir Herbert Stewart was wounded fatally in the second battle at Gubat the command devolved on Sir Charles Wilson in cirute of his seniority. Being thrust suddenly into the position of military leader for which previous training had not qualified him he did his best to cary out Sir Herberts Stewart's plans. Whether he delayed too long after Gordon's steamers had joined him or simply took the common-sense precaution which circumstances demanded, is a question about which differences of opinion will alas exist. There was certainly nothing to justify the bitter attack made upon him because of his failure to reach Khartoum before it fell. A scapegoat was wanted to draw off attention from the blunder of others in higher authority, and he suffered accordingly. The attack delivered by SIr. Charles Wilson at Metemmeh on January 21 did not though unsuccessful, involve waste of time, because the four steamers from Khartoum only reached him while his troops were being withdrawn from that attempt. The next day, a hostile force having been reported near Shendy, Sir Charles Wilson thought it necessary to make a reconnaissance down the river in that direction. Then it was discovered that the frail boat needed repairs to their machinery. These were not completed until late January 23. The following morning Sir Charles Wilson,having with him a few British soldiers in red coats and less than 200 Sudanese, started Khartoum. When after encountering many difficulties and fighting their way past Derviah batteries, the steamer were not within sight of Khartoum, they were too late. The place had fallen two days earlier, and General Gordon was dead. The belief that this catastrophe might have been averted but for the delay at Metemmeh and in the connoitring towards Shendy rests on no trustworthy evidence. </p></div>

"Al Moayad" gave publicity to a scheme for preaching the Koran in those parts of the country where Christian missionaries have been allowed to preach the Gospel. Many moelena notables are said to be very anxious to prop___ Islam among the heathens of the Southern Sudan, and are generously supporting the scheme. According to "Al Moayad" a sheikh ___ stated that if a sum of about L.E. 400 were allowed him he would leave for the Sudan and would under take to _______ a _______________ and preach the Koran there. </p></div></div>
