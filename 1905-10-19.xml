                        the eye. It appeals alike to artistic and practical house decoration.</p>
                    <p>HALL'S DISTEMPER is of special value in hot climates. Owing to its cool,
                        pleasing colours, great weather-resisting and germ-destroying properties, it
                        lends itself to every kind of wall, wood, brick or stone coating, possessing
                        all the advantages of paint, colour- wash, and disinfectant at one third the
                        cost of oil paint. It never blisters in the hottest sun, and the fact that
                        it can be washed adds greatly to its sanitary advantages.</p>

                    <p> With the refloating of the Pobyeda— whose time by a strange irony of fate
                        means ' Vict- ory"—the last of the font great ironclads which were sunk
                        within Port Arthur harbour set December has been added to the fleet of the
                        cocquering islanders. It was at first sup- osed that the Pobyeds and her
                        comrades in misfortune were injured beyond all hope of repair by the
                        explosion of Russian dynamite mines as much as by the shimose shells hurled
                        on them by the artillery of the investing force. Recent investigations hate
                        proved that his is not the case. The engines of all, or nearly all, the
                        sunken ships had been grossed and the valves opened, and though the I
                        droppiog shells from the land batteries had done them a certain amount of
                        damage, the nines had only been need in the last few hours, when the
                        intention *of General Stoessel to surrender had astonished and horrified
                        Capt. Wiren and driven the undemoralised remnants of the fleet to attempt to
                        destroy heir own ships. It appears that these vessels had been sunk in the
                        first instance with the view of preserving them till Rodjestveosky's arrival
                        in Eastern wafers. Their engines, etc., had been greased, their guns and
                        ammuni- ion for the most part removed to shore, and the Rossians counted on
                        being able to raise their vessels after Rodjestvensky had fought a fleet
                        action, in February, which they expected would prove sufficiently
                        destructive to both sides, and to thrown few "lame docks" into the balance
                        of the naval war. They count- td, of course, on the Baltic Fleet arriving in
                        February and on its being far more battle worthy than it ultimately proved,
                        and their chagrin at Stoossel's sudden surrender cost have been
                        profound.</p>
                    <p> Japan had now added eight Russian iron- clads to her fleet, and thorgh
                        experts have declared that four of the captured vessels will lever be fit
                        for much, the fact that the Japanese have been at pains to raise and repair
                        them goes far to prove that they are better informed of the real condition
                        of the hulls than their critics. The Mikasa will probably be raised in a
                        couple of months' time add Japan will then have thirteen battleship*, four
                        of them old and second line vessels, and right large armoured cruisers that
                        hare proved themselves capable of lying in the line. Two very powerful
                        battle- ships and two large armoured cruisers are building, and though no
                        indemnity has been obtained, there is every reason to expect that the new
                        programme spoken of early in the was will be carried out in the next five or
                        six years Japan is now fifth in the list of the naval Powers, as far as her
                        material strength is concerned, bat we imagine that when the experience of
                        her sailors, and the practical training of her gunners, is taken into
                        account no judge of comparative naval strength will refuse a still higher
                        place to the naval forces of the Risen Sun.</p>

                        fair speed and the cart was the time crossing the line. The car-driver rang
                        his bell and shouted to the man to get out of way, but, to the astonishment
                        of the lookers-on, did not slacken speed. The front board of the car be-
                        came entangled with the axle pin of the cart and it was with considerable
                        difficulty that the latter was extricated. Had the driver of the car

                        Court to-draw up a "tawkil" on behalf of the girl. The Cadi asked the
                        witnesses whether the woman was really the daughter of the claimant and
                        received an affirmative reply, but after the tawkil had been granted the
                        head fhaffir of El Atamneh appeare I before the Cadi and informed him that
                        the girl was his own niece and not the daughter of the claimant. The guilty

                    <p>We have received an interesting and well-executed map of the Lebanon
                        district, the work of Major Huber, ex-engineer in chief to the province of
                        the Lebanon. The map, which is drawn up on the scale of 1/100,000 is divided
                        into four sheets and gives the principal churches, roads, and caracole of
                        the province. The only criticism we have to make is the comparative absence
                        of details as to the frontier districts N.E. of Zsh- leg, and in the N.E. of
                        the Kara and Bastroun divisions, but the compiler's explanation that the
                        boundaries of the province are still unde- termined no doubt accounts for
                        this. </p>
                    <p>TO CONVERT THE JAPS</p>

                        Mohamedans of India, recently resolved to leave for Japan to preach the
                        Koran, in the hope of spreading Islam among the Japanese. Mr. Korima, the
                        Japanese official appointed to make a study of the world's religions, has
                        lately read a book on Islam written by a chinese Mohamedan, and a Japanese
                        committee called the author and received him very cordially. In their
                        religious conversation the stopped at the Mohamedan words "La ilaha ills
                        Allah" (there is no God but the one God), when Mr. Korims exclaimed that
                        there were several duties. The committee however, resolved that every Moslem
                        rule which proved to be right and suitable should be inserted in the Japa-
                        nese papers.</p>

                        have been almost entirely renewed inter- nally and no comfort has been
                        forgotten. Two new restaurant cars have been ordered from Belgium and are
                        expected to arrive here in December. The company have also arranged to open

                        and the general sub-management of the Assouan to Luxor line. An improvement

                        charged, but the charges for dinner and refreshments in the restaurant car
                        remain the same as last winter; this special train will be continued as long
                        as the traffic warrants it, and we understand that the Railway Adminis-
                        triton will make similar arrangements on the Cairo-to-Luxor line should it

                    <p> La ville où los diplomates européens vont si réunir est surtout célèbre par
                        le brillant com- bat quo l'amiral français Linois soutint contre l'amiral
                        anglais Saumarez, le 6 juillet 1801. Ce succès, qui rappelait les plus
                        grands jours d, notre ancienne marine produisit on France un enthousiasme me
                        général. Trois vaisseaux françai- combattireut contre six anglais; en
                        détruisirent deux et sur les autres en gardèrent un prison- nier. La Prance
                        battit des mains n ce bean lai d'armes et le premier Consul envoya un sabre
                        d'honne .r au brave amiral Linois. Algésiras a une foire très pittoresque,
                        "la féria", où l'on a un aperça for carachteristique ces mocars locales et
                        où détient sous les cos- tumes les plus bigarrés, tous les types si varié de
                        l'extreme Espagne.</p>
                    <p> Les diplomates suront sûrement le plaisir d'y assister. La féria ayant lieu
                        tous les aus en juillet, la lenteur mystérieuse de la diplo matie saura bien
                        faire traîner la Conféreuc jusques-la.</p>
                    <p> A moins que la conférence, malgré la décision prise, ne se réunisse pas à
                        Algésiras. Les diplo- mates a ment ioura aises. Or, la petite ville
                        espagnole est loin d'offrir, tant au point de vue des communications que des
                        logements, le comfortable nécessaire. Dans ce cas, Algésira n'aura ou qu'une
                        résurrection éphémère, assez cependant pour nous remettre en mémoire un

                    <p> Liverpool, October 12.</p>
                    <p> Egyptian Cotton is very neglected, the actual sales of ''Spot being very
                        small ; there haS been scarcely sufficient busi- ness doing to test prices
                        and quotations are without change for the week. Futures have been inactive,
                        and the follow- ing are the latest values .</p>

                    <p> American Futures. The beginning of the week was characterized by heavy
                        "Bear" selling; everything apparently being in favor of a tall, and prices
                        declined rapidly 23 points, but towards the dose of the week the Market was
                        freely applied with "killing frost" cables, ceasing a sharp reaction take
                        place, but whether any serious damage has occurred seems doubtful. Spinners
                        have bought "Spot" cotton much more freely, and the offerings of cif cotton
                        by the South have been less plentiful, which has helped to strengthen the
                        hands of the , "Bulls." This afternoon the Now York market report coming
                        lower, thus indicating no material damage to the crop by frost our Market
                        developed con- siderable weakness, and the following closing quotations shew
                        a decline of 21 points for the week:—</p>

                    <p>COMPANY ROYAL INNISKILLINGS</p>
                    <p> MOUNTED INFANTRY.</p>
                    <p> The above teams met on Friday evening at Abbaasieh in a friendly encounter.
                        The ground was in the pink of condition while both teams pot on their best
                        available eleven, so every- thing pointed to a good gone. There would be
                        about 500 spectators present when the ; teams lined out under the control of
                        referee Mr. Spence in the following order : F Com pany—goal, Johnston ;
                        backs, Duffy and Gabbrieth ; halves, Branagh, Bond, and Harbinson ;
                        forwards. Boy Walib, Bradshaw Collins, Smyth, and Boy Armstrong. Mounted
                        Infantry —goal, Clarke ; backs, Baggley and Williamson ; halves, Connelly,
                        Goslin, and Skimmer ; forwards, Flagg, Dovey, Wolsam, Greer, and Gorman.</p>
                    <p> Collins started operations for F Company, Who took op the running, Smyth and
                        Arm strong combining wall, but Williamson averted disaster. For almost ten
                        minutes play re mained in this M. I. camp until a nice bit of manuveriog on
                        the past of Greer and German ended in the latter having a shot which miseed
                        the spot by inches. The greens now worked up ; Smyth, getting possession of
                        the sphere, raced the length of the field and., centered, and WaLsh catching
                        the ball, lost a glorious chance by sending behind. The mounted boys now had
                        an innings, Greer and the centre forward showing conspicuous form ; the
                        former's swinging centres went a-begging spring to the right wing not being
                        in their place. Play was now confined to midfield until Bond relieved
                        matters; only fora moment ' however, as the I Konnas came down once more.
                        Their progress however was short-lived as Daffy with a great drive sent them
                        to this right-about. The first inner of the match to the visitors, but this
                        was sent behind. On the kick-off the M. I. took play in hand and Johnston
                        had his hands fall, but be was equal to the occasion. Both trams were
                        playing for all they were worth, both end being visited turn. Up and down
                        the field they raced, tho pace boing a ' cracker." The galloping 8th ' were
                        in a very favorable position when a free was given against Connelly. This
                        was well placed into goal by Harbinson, a corner follow- ing this, and,
                        being taken by Walsh, proved unproductive. Both teams strove hard to open
                        the score, but all to no purpose. Some good play by Bond reulted in
                        Armstrong getting the sphere and dodging a couple of opponents, sent across
                        to Smyth, who in torn gave to Collins, who missed the mat h-wanted spot by
                        inches. The Greens now held tho advantage, tho mounted boys' defences being
                        severely taxed, and it took the custodian to be in hit best form or a sxore
                        would have reunited. The M. I. now got away, Greer loading the group but
                        Harbinson spoiled their little game and play was in a trice transferred,
                        when William- Son and company came in fir a lively time. They however kept
                        their goal intact At this stage of the game the excitement was great. Play
                        raged fast and furious from this to half- time, the score then standing

                    <p> After the usual interval and refreshments play was once more resumed. F
                        Company soon swept around the Reds' goal, but the custodian saved in good
                        style and play was token towards Johnstone, but the latter did not exert
                        himself as the defense in front of him repelled all attacks. Some good
                        individual play on the part of Harbinson ended in Walsh running the ball
                        over the line. Play was now of the give-snd take order until Greer raised
                        the hopes of his supporters by running the leather well np and entering
                        well. Branagh, however, robbed Flag as Johnny was in the act of shooting.
                        The green-shirts now took up the running sturdily, little Bond making good
                        headway and parting to Smyth, who ran through all opposition and with an
                        Unsaleable shot drew first blood for bis side. This made the. I Konvas play
                        np mu-h better, and Gorman should have made the scores equal,' but
                        over-eagerness spoiled a good chance. Both teams were playing with great
                        determination, especially the Gallopers, who showed good form. The
                        spectators now urged their favorites to go in and win, each end being
                        visited in tarn, bat the shots either lacked the necessary sting or
                        over-eagerness spoiled all attempts. A fine com- bined movement on the part
                        of Smyth ended in Collins getting possession of the ball and with a "daisy
                        cutter" be sent np the second goal on play. P Company deserved their lead.
                        In resuming the Greens came away again and were within an ace of scoring,
                        the custodian saving from Armstrong at the expense of a corner. This,
                        however, came to nothing. The Gallopers now pulled themselves together and
                        Green gave a Flag a glorious chance ; in fact, this chance of a lifetime,
                        but his shot went the way of the others. The M.I. still kept that pressure
                        up, but all to no avail, as Duffy and company were display Ing their cool
                        form. P Company were now displaying some of last seasons form, Smyth Bond,
                        and Collins proving themselves a terror to the Reds' defense. Play slackened
                        down now until a rash was made on the Gallopers' citadel, a scrimmage
                        ensuing. The custodian saved well, but be had to acknow- Ledge defeat a
                        third time. With a good lead F Company took things pretty easy now. This
                        horse soldier* were advancing in strong order, leading the column, when the
                        long whistle sounded full time, leaving F Company winners of a most
                        interesting and well fought match by the following (core : F. Company ...

                    <head> GAMBLING IN COTON.</head>
                    <p> The publication of the foil official report of he second International
                        Cotton Congress, held a Jane last, together with a ootering circular rom the
                        President, Mr. Micara, serves to remind os that a great step has been taken
                        n the direction of'organising the industry >oth in first Britain and on the
                        Continent, tod to some rxtent in the United States. The >bject of this
                        organisation is, in the first piaoe, :o afford protection against gambling;
                        in the isoond, to extend the socrces of the supply of -aw cotton; and,
                        thirdly, to introdnoe desir- tble reforms in the oondnot of the industry as
                        i whole, and in the packing, delivery and her details connected with the
                        famishing of to raw material. \With the energetio efforts hat are now
                        being'tnsde to extend the growth 5f cotton within trig. British Empire, as
                        set forth in Mr. J. H, Hatton's admirable paper -ead at the Conferees, we
                        dealt folly at the rime, and we need only repeat here that the Bri-ish
                        Cotton Crowing Association is doing nost excellent work in this direction,
                        the effect of which it may be reasonably hoped will in i tew years be to
                        render Europe considerably less dependent npon American cotton than is the
                        case at present. This Association, however, and the other Associations ol
                        the same kind in the Continent are distinot from the Inter- lational
                        Federation,1 though they are olosely inked with it, and in course of
                        timaLwill i.rohab'y be affiliated thereto. Theobj«ji» of :ho Federation are,
                        however, ajwajhafrwseen, noro comprehensive, the most prominent, per- reps,
                        being in the words (if fir.jMstna:— To counteract the optwations of mani-
                        pulators in unduly enKneing tbe-prioe of the raw material, making it a
                        counter in gambling operations; indeed, an effective remedy for these
                        operations can only he attained by international action on the part of the
                        users of ootton.</p>
                    <p> Mr. Macara nsefally reminds ns, that the recent wages dispute in the English
                        ootton trade, which almost led to a national calamity, was mainly brought
                        about by the said gambling operations. He adds an illustration of the
                        Bnormous losses to the industry which may be and are caused by such
                        speculation. The annual average crop of the world, at a value of 5d per lb,
                        realises some £160,000,000, and the estimated value of the products
                        manufactur- sd therefrom is £350,000,000. An average price of 4d per lb
                        would, it is stated, prove sufficiently remunerative to growers, even ia
                        reasons of comparatively poor yield. In the reason before last, however,
                        speculation raised the average price paid by spinners to as muoh as 7d per
                        lb—' in round figures about £100,000,000 in exoesa of a prioe which would
                        have adequately rewarded the growers for their labour and enterprise.''</p>
                    <p> A large proportion of this enormous sum went into the poskets of oatside
                        speculators in no way connected with the industry, and it is not surprising,
                        nnder such circumstances, that the manufacturers of Barope are sink- ing
                        international jealousies and differences and cimbining for their mutual
                        protection. Bven the Amerioan manufacturers, as judged by the recent speech
                        of Mr. J. R. MaoColl, the President of the New England Cotton Manufacturers'
                        Association, are (ailing into line with the rest, and an American delegate
                        was, as a matter of fact, present at the June Conference ; although, as that
                        gentleman re- marked, American spinners may not have yet reached the point
                        where they are prepared to organise to rastriot the consumption of Ameri can
                        ootton. The difficulties in the way of patting a curb on exosssive
                        speculation were reoognised—although perhaps not folly reoog- nised—by the
                        Congress. It was admitted that business in lutores is neoessary for the
                        market as at present constituted, and also -that men cannot handle enormous
                        crops properly unless ibey obtain some cover. Sufficient oover is not to be
                        found in the trade itself, and so the outside speculator is drawn into the
                        market, and manipulation interferes disastrous- ly with the play of supply
                        and demand. It is suggested that if every mill included in the international
                        Federation .were to take over a oertain amonot ot ootton—say, even a quarter
                        of a million bales in a'l—they might. be safe- guarded against the worst
                        evils ol manipula- tion. The regulation of the output, which might also to
                        some extent be secured, would . afford furtherproteotion; and to hedged
                        round, the ootton market would present a less at- tractive field for
                        gambling to the profes- sional speculator than is the case at present.
                        Obviously there are very considerable difficul- ties in the way of attaining
                        this desirable end, but the first step is to obtain the adhesion to the
                        Federation of the majority of Boropean producers, and this seems in a fair
                        way of being attained. It is intolerab's that an enormous, indispensable
                        industry, employing hundreds of thousands of operatives, shoold be muloted
                        to the extent of a hundred millions sterling in a single year through the
                        operations of pro- fessional gamblers. Everyone, therefore, who is
                        interested in the welfare of the working classes, or who is desirous of
                        upholding the pricoiple of fair play in commerce, will wish God-speed to the
                        International Federation, and to the various cotton growing associations
                        which are striving to place the industry on a sounder Economic basis.</p>
