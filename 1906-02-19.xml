                        leads to groupings that vary from time to time. The general prin¬ciple of
                        the groupings has been, since the Six¬teenth Century at any rate, that in
                        proportion as one State increases in population, territory, and
                        organization, and therefore in power, the others become apprehensive of its
                        too great preponderance. Its great prosperity and strength begin to seem a
                        menace to the inde¬pendence of the others, and the growing State, in the
                        consciousness of its developing power, is apt to expect its influence to
                        become paramount and to attribute to itself a superiority hardly consistent
                        with the fall autonomy of its neighbours. Such was the posi¬tion at one time
                        of the Germania Empire, at another of the Spanish Monarchy, afterwards of
                        the French Monarchy, and subsequently of the first French Empire. In every
                        case the expanding State found the maritime power of Great Britain an
                        obstacle to the foil attain¬ment of the sort of supremacy towards which it
                        was impelled. There has, therefore, always been tendency for Great Britain
                        to be regarded with special jealousy by the strongest Conti¬nental Power,
                        and the consequence of that jealousy has always been to draw towards Great
                        Britain the sympathy of those Continen¬tal States which were apprehensive of
                        a prepon¬derance dangerous to their free will. The difficult periods have
                        been those of transition, when there has been a change in the relations of
                        the Continental Powers. Thus Great Britain in tie Sixteenth Century found
                        herself in opposition to the preponderance of Spain. The sentiment of
                        opposition lasted long after the necessity was gone, and the tendency to
                        co-operate with France was continued into the period when the real danger to
                        the independence of States was from France rather than from Spain.</p>
                    <p>During the second half of the Nineteenth Century the great change that took
                        place in Europe was the attainment of German unity, and the rise in Central
                        Europe of a German S ate stronger in respect of population, territory, and
                        organization than any of the other settled States, for Russia is still
                        rather an Asiatic despotism than a European organised State. The event of
                        the dose of the Nineteenth Century was the propagation in Germany of the
                        theory that Great Britain with her maritime resources and her colonies and
                        her Indian Empire was an obstacle to Germany’s develop¬ment. This
                        propaganda, sedulously fostered by an influential party in Germany, was
                        ac¬companied by a corresponding development of German sentiment. The event
                        of the beginning of the Nineteenth Century has been the recog-nition in
                        England of the political significance of this new German sentiment Germany
                        has taken the place in the European system which was occupied in the
                        Sixteenth Century by the Spanish Monarchy and in the Seventeenth by he
                        French Monarchy. It is of the expansive purpose of Germany that her
                        neighbours are apprehensive, and at the same time Germany has shown that she
                        regards Great Britain as it was regarded by Philip II., by Louis XIV., and
                        by Napoleon. The recognition of these foots has made dear to the other
                        Continental States the true position of England, obscured tor nearly a
                        century They now see that England with her naval power is the balancing
                        element in the European system, the one element which by its nature must be
                        in sympathy with their independence and opposed to any designs which would
                        menace it This is the funda¬mental fact, the instinctive recognition of
                        which is the deep historical basis of the entente cordiale</p>

                    <p>NO GOVERNOR APPOINTED</p>
                    <p>CHITTY BEY DECLINES THE POST.</p>
                    <p>The final selection of a new Governor of the National Bank of Egypt has still
                        to be made, r for Chitty Bey has declined to accept the post. (After the
                        Egyptian Government had agreed I to accept the selection of the board of
                        directors d it was universally considered a foregone conclusion that the man
                        whom they had chosen as their candidate would be appointed, and great was
                        the amazement yesterday when it was known that the Director General of
                        Customs o ha 1 intimated on Saturday afternoon that he r did not wish to
                        accept the moat remunerative ii position in Egypt. The grounds on which
                        Chitty Bey has based his refusual is that he has had I no experience of
                        banking business and that he ii therefore does Dot consider that he can
                        conscientiously accept the management of the E moat important banking
                        concern in the country.</p>
                    <p>The reason for his selection as their candidate by the board of directors was
                        that during his tenure of office as head of the greatest revenue-earning
                        department in Egypt, he had shown great powers of administration and
                        organization, and had in every way given proofs that he was possessed of the
                        exceptional , abilities necessary for the guidance of the “ bank. Another
                        point which carried great weight with the board in making their choice was
                        that he was a man of iron fixity of purpose, so that if he had made up his
                        mind that a certain course was the right one, he would not deviate from it a
                        hair's breadth notwithstanding what powerful influences might be brought to
                        bear on him from the City.</p>
                    <p>The selection if Chitty Bey by the board re¬presented the collective judgment
                        of the most competent set of business men in Egypt, for the directors
                        include the cream of he commercial and financial intelligence of the
                        country. When such practical men as Boghos, Pacha Nubar, Baron Jacques de
                        Menasce, Messrs. Aghion, Beyerle. Foster, de Tschndi, Cattaui, Suares,
                        Zervudachi. Rollo, Ralli, Benachi, Salvago. Milton, and Pelazaeus decided to
                        choose the Director-General of Customs so as their candidate, it was the
                        highest tribute n that oonld be paid to his character and capacity.</p>
                    <p> At the interview which took place at the British Agency this day week
                        between Lord Cromer and the directors, it was, however, decided that advice
                        from London should be, sought, but on Friday morning the Egyptian Government
                        announced that it would not g abide by this decision and was quite willing “
                        to same to accept the candidate of the hoard. The waiver on the part of the
                        Egyptian Government was tantamount to Lord Crmar's endorsement of the
                        directors choice, and consequently everybody expected that a final decision
                        would be arrived at when the board, met on Saturday afternoon. When it was
                        known therefore yesterday morning that Chitty Bey had intimated his in
                        willingness to accept the post all the qnidnoncery of Cairo and I
                        Alexandria, who had already begun to speculate as to who would be the new
                        head of the Customs, had to start on a fresh trail; but the search for
                        motives which would induce he rennroiation of the most lucrative billet in
                        Egypt nonplussed the boldest in a country whose prosperity engenders only
                        the most sordid ideals.</p>
                    <p>Besides the magnificent salary, the L.E. 1 000 house allowance, and the
                        annual remuneration of L E. 1,200 and L.E. 500 for the chairmanships of the
                        Agriculture and Abyssi¬nian Bank", there are other lucrative per¬quisites
                        attached to the governorship. per example, after the 4 percent. to the
                        share¬holder, and 10 per cent, to the reserve on original profile, there is
                        10 percent. which goes to the board, of which the Governor first takes 25
                        per cent. L.E. 10,000 went to the board, he took LE 2,500 before the board
                        came in, and then came in himself far the balance with the rest of the beard
                        as a director. There are of course plenty of other legitimate ‘‘pickings,”
                        even if extraneous directorships are henceforth prohibited, and the total
                        annual income will come not far from L.B. 10,000.</p>
                    <p>When a man who is only, in receipt of LE. 1.500 a year refuses such a post on
                        the grounds of lank of qualification when it is spontaneous¬ly offered to
                        him, the imagination of the aver¬age person is at a loss to account for such
                        a situation. Especially is this so in Egypt, where lack of experience has
                        never been considered a disqualification and we have English officials
                        placed in positions requiring most technical knowledge who have never
                        received any professional training. For instance, one of the moat important
                        posts in the Ministry of Justice is held by an official who has had no legal
                        training whatsoever, and there are many other instances of favourites of
                        fortune who have been jockeyed into positions without any
                        quali¬fications.</p>
                    <p>The decision of Cbitty Bey is to he respectes’. He bolds that it is the
                        primary and principal qualification of a banker to be well acquainted with
                        banking, for it is a business which is not learned in a day, but needs
                        antitude end ap¬prenticeship like any other calling. Of banking Chitty Bey,
                        from practical experience, admit-tedly knows nothing. Therefore, according
                        to the Egyptian precedent, “lucus a non Iucendo,” so usual in the bestowal
                        of office in Egypt, the choice of the Government and of the board of
                        directors has fallen upon him. To some his refusal of such a position will
                        be incomprehen¬sible. To others it will be explicable on the grounds that he
                        lacks the most conspicuous mark of genius, the faculty of rising to the
                        occasion. But to a minority his decision will be received with respect as a
                        memorable sample of scrupulousness in a country where such a virtue is by no
                        means conspicuous.</p>
                    <p>A meeting of the directors of the National Bank took place on Saturday
                        afternoon, but no decision as to who should be selected as Governor was
                        arrived at.</p>
                    <p>Our native contemporary “A1 Moavad.” in notifying Chitty Bey’s action,
                        remarks, “In any care he is one of the most useful Englishmen in Egypt, and
                        Egyptians will be glad to see him always holding high positions, which bring
                        him in touch with natives and where his service are useful to the country,

                    <p>The members of the Egyptian Press who recently visited the Sudan gave a
                        dinner to Owen Bey on Saturday evening at 8hepheard’s Hotel. ID spite of the
                        fact that thirteen sat down to table owing to the absence of Naoum Bey
                        8hakair, the best of good spirits and cordiality prevailed, and the
                        excellent menu provided speedily appeased the qualms of the most
                        superstitious. The health of the guest of the evening was proposed by M. R.

                        felicitous after time speeches that few but a Frenchman can make. Dr. Paris

                        Shenouda also proposed the health of Owen Bey in eloquent terms.</p>
                    <p>In replying to the toasts in his honour Owen Bey, after thanking the Press
                        for their good wishes, and complimenting them on the excellent articles that
                        had been evoked by their visit, stated that every official, Egyptian,
                        Sudanese, and British, would be glad to know that their work had been
                        appreciated by disinterested observers, and that the members of the Press
                        had thoroughly appreciated their visit to the Sudan and the efforts of the
                        Sudan Government to make their visit a pleasant one.</p>
                    <p>More speeches followed. Mr. Tite, to whose kindness the Press are greatly
                        indebted, replied in a few cordial words to a well-deserv¬ed toast by Dr.

                        unmixed benefit, bringing to/ether representatives of all shades of opinion
                        who were united in their desire to advocate the good of Egypt. After
                        thanking Owen Bey for his toast he called upon all pre¬sent to drink to the

                        Deoember. 190V The operations of the period under review have resulted in a

                        leaving a balanoe at oredit of profit and loss of £6,364 14 3. The directors

                        been obtained from the | discounting of local paper, and a considerable
                        extension of this branch of the company’s business is in contemplation. The
                        company’s ' position has been kept liquid, as its invest¬ments are all
                        readily realisable. Various proposals likely to prove sources of revenue are
                        under consideration. A commercial branch has recently been inaugurated at
                        Alexandria . for the conduct of an import and export business which will be
                        prepared to act as agents for British and other firms who desire a

                    <p>BATTLE OF FLOWERS</p>
                    <p>AN IMMENSE GATHERING</p>
                    <p>Last night Cairo spent its time endeavoring get rid of the confetti collected
                        during the f afternoon at the “Bataille de Fleurs.’’ Ghezireh 1 still is
                        laid deep in the rainbow-tinged snow- e storm that filled the air during the
                        fray, and t there are but few out of the population who | did not add their
                        quota to the display. Every arahieh in the place must have-been busy
                        conveying the merry-makers across the river, and neither love nor money were
                        able to secure a conveyance for the return journey.</p>
                    <p>Though the procession was advertised to commence at three o’olock, many
                        people were in their seats soon after two, and a steady and ever-increasing
                        stream of all sorts and conditions followed on their steps, till every seat
                        in every stand and loge was filled, and the course was bordered on either
                        side by a gaily-dressed crowd of men, women, and children, which almost put
                        the decorations even 1 out of conceit with themselves. The confetti and
                        flower sellers did a roaring trade, and when their stock was all run out,
                        the enter¬prising Arab gathered up the fragments off the sandy paths,
                        stuffed them again into discarded bags, and reaped a second harvest. From a
                        strictly impartial view it cannot said that the display of decorated
                        carriages could be compared with those to be seen on the Riviera, or indeed
                        anywhere in France during the carnival season, and as a matter of fact there
                        were many who said the display, was not up to the avenge for Cairo, and was
                        inferior even to that of last year. The most, beautiful carriage, and it
                        really was a work of art, was that belonging to Omar Bey Sultan. It
                        represented a huge basket of pure white, with a high arched handle from,
                        which depended long streamers of snowy chiffon. Both handle and basket and
                        its stand were adorned with white flowers, and on it were perched a crowd of
                        white-feathered, doves. The horses, too, were white, and so also was the
                        harness with silver mountings. The coachman, beside whom stood the Bey, was
                        also in white, and the sayces, too, were robed immaculately and carried
                        white and flower- bedecked wands in their hands. It was not surprising that
                        this oarriage obtained the pig d’honneur, a handsome silver cup, and M.
                        Ferdinand de Martino gained the grandprix for his motor decorated with
                        wreaths of violets and white flowers. Another carriage, drawn by two horses,
                        was transformed into a veritable kiosk of flowers wherein was enshrined a
                        dainty lady with two charming children in fairy like attire; another motor
                        oar, which gained the second prize and was owned by M. Alexander Comanos,
                        was transformed into the likeness of a scarlet dahabieh wreathed about with
                        flowers, and two tiny children in a gaily- decorated oar drawn by a
                        diminutive donkey ware overcome with pride when presented with a prize
                        banneret. 0 her prizes ware awarded to the three ladies bearing
                        flower-decked' sunshades (Mmea. Z *her, Beriketti, and Innis), I perhaps the
                        prettiest being one with large transparent medallions encircled with dainty
                        wreaths of lilies of the valley, the fragile hat of the Wwearer being made
                        to coreespond</p>
                    <p>In the procession were many other carriages more or less decorated, and many
                        people pre¬ferred spending their time moving round and round the course to
                        remaining in the stands, and considering the crowd of pedestrians and
                        vehicles it was wonderful that the afternoon passed without mishaps. As for
                        the spirit of carnival, it was there with all its accustomed accessories.
                        The air was filled with confetti and flowers and merry battles ware fought
                        at every corner and ail along the line. Carriages were entangled wtth paper
                        serpentines, while hats and pretty frocks, to say nothing of the garments of
                        the sterner sex, were soon decorated and bespangled with the multicoloured
                        particles</p>
                    <p>The fun ran riot till confetti bags were finished and the spirits of the
                        throwers exhausted. With dusty throats and spent energies the worn out folk
                        streamed back to the Ghezireh Palace Hotel, where every available nook and
                        cranny was filled with eager tea drinkers. The road back to Cairo was a long
                        procession of vehicles following all the same direction, and though the
                        unfortunate way¬farers had a long and dusty tramp home, the carriage folk
                        did not gain in point of time.</p>

                    <p>SATURDAY'S PERFORANCE OFF.</p>
                    <p>The Cairo Opera House was flooded on Saturday night—not by a thunderstorm but
                        by internal irrigation, the work of an ingenious employ who, doubtless for
                        curiosity’s sake, turned on the fire tape which are designed to play on the
                        stage in case of fire. The streams that descended on the stage should have
                        satisfied and reassured him or any who doubted the value of the precautions
                        now taken against fire, but their volume also alarmed him to such a degree
                        that, paralyzed with tenor, he forgot to turn off the fire main. The
                        scenery, the stage, the orchestra, and many of he properties were drenched,
                        the electrical installation was injured, and the management could only send
                        a frantic appeal to the Ministry of Public Works, who came, saw, and
                        estimated the damages. Consequently there was no per¬formance on Saturday
                        night Iris gave place to Beidckt, and Cairo bad something to talk of.</p>

                        artillery ashore shelled the Turki. The French cruiser Lalande intervened
                        and ordered the Zenith to return here. </p>

                    <p>Dear Sir,—Had I realised, when, in a frivolous mood, I sent you my
                        impressions of the Cataract Hotel fancy dre?8 hall, that any remarks could
                        be seized upon by an ill-bred person and made the subject-matter of an
                        offensive letter, I should never have penned those lines at all.</p>
                    <p>The lady in question, in sheer light-hearted- ness, donned a dragoman’s
                        costume in ignorance of the evil effects her action would have on the native
                        mind; and any remarks were meant to be a gentle rebuke for an action which I
                        felt sure the toiler knowledge of the servant mind would have prevented.</p>
                    <p>The query mark after the word “lady” in the letter of a "Lover of Womanly
                        Women” is the result of the workings of a puerile brain.</p>
                    <p>All those who have the privilege of knowing this lady, are deeply conscious
                        of an honour which “A Lover of Womanly Women” could never experience.</p>
                    <p>As the writer of the critique in question I should be most happy to meet ‘A
                        Lover of Womanly Women” at any time she suggests.— Yours, etc.,</p>

                    <p>THE MUMMIED BEAST. </p>
                    <p>BY HENRY DE VARIGNY</p>
                    <p>The EMbalming of Animals</p>
                    <p>Some seventy centuries ago the Egyptians began to embalm the dead. Viewing
                        their work with delighted satisfaction—like the late lamented Pencil, who
                        admired even the backs of his pictures—they kept on with it, and embalmed
                        everything that could by hook or crook be embalmed. The irreverent
                        Egyptologist who digs the soil of the old Nile valley finds it honeycombed
                        with the graves of kings, queens, priests, dignitaries, and folk of low
                        degree, while underground Egypt has yielded up its millions and even
                        billions of millions animals. Many of them found a practical use as
                        fertilizers.</p>
                    <p>From time to time it has occurred to naturalists that these mummied animals
                        would repay study, and though many of the deposits have been exhausted, M.
                        Maspero succeeded in securing remnants of them, and in handing the remnants
                        over to competent naturalists. Hence the beautiful book which MM. Lortet and
                        Gaillard of Lyons have brought out under the title, “La Faune Momifiee de
                        l’Ancienne Egypte.”</p>
                    <p>I have said that the Egyptians embalmed almost everything, and, as a matter
                        of literal fact, their animal burying-grounds contain monkeys, dogs,
                        jackals, cats, shrewmice, rats, cattle, antelope, gazelles, sheep, wild
                        sheep and goats, to say nothing of birds— among them the ibis—and such
                        reptiles as the serpent and the crocodile, with a plentiful supply of fi h,
                        mollusks and injects. Each species boasts countless examples</p>
                    <p>From all this we may extract at least a respectable amount of philosophy.
                        When Napoleon invaded Egypt, Jomard propounded an interesting problem in his
                        "Description de l’Egypte ” Said Jomard: "These various mummies and fragments
                        of animals will one day enable naturalists to tell what it species inhabited
                        Egypt during a very rem ate period. Indeed, there is no other way of knowing
                        whether the animals that now thrive in Egypt are the same as those that
                        throve three centuries ago, or to establish the grave question as to the
                        invariability of essential or specific forms throughout the ages.” To the
                        question put by Jomard, the Lyons naturalists give categorical reply. The
                        species embalmed twenty, thirty, or even seventy centuries ago have not
                        changed in the least. The animals of modern Egypt are the animals of ancient
                        Egypt </p>
                </div>
                <div type="page">
                    <head>Evolution</head>
                    <p>Is this equivalent to saying that evolution is a humbug ? Not at all. For
                        every naturalist can name species that have remained unchan-ged, not merely
                        for seventy centariei, bat for thousands of centuries. Some of these are
                        brachiopods, whose origin dates from the most ancient period of life upon
                        the globe. On the other hand, evolution doesn’t depend in the least upon
                        proving tint species have changed. Such necessity exists solely when
                        environment changes, or when an animal eaters a new environment. An animal
                        adapted to its environ- ment changes only when the environment changes. Now
                        in Egypt the environment has long been what it is to-day, and we should have
                        no reason to expect to find the animals of present-day Egypt at all
                        different from their ancestors of sixty or seventy centuries ago. And they
                        certainly are not. Far from militating against the theory of evolution, the
                        study of the mummied animals of Egypt precisely fulfil the evolutionist’s
                        expectations and predictions. I need not dwell further upon this highly
                        important fact ; let ns pass now to an examination of certain secondary
                        facts brought out by the Lyons naturalists. We shall find them
                        instructive</p>

                        a mile long, is packed with them. Bat biology here notes an interesting
                        fact; the Egyptians had two kinds of cat. The one that ] was most frequently
                        embalmed (and therefore doubtless the most highly venerated) was the
                        magnificent gloved cat, Felis maniculata, which still exists in a wild state
                        in all parts of the country. The other was a domesticated variety of that
                        species. It would be immensely interesting, I may say in passing, to make a
                        special study of the oat of the Egyptian necropoles in documents of known
                        date, so as to learn to what degree and with what speed the cat became
                        transformed when she left her free life and became domesticated. But this
                        much, in any case, is worthy of comment: there is DO longer in Egypt a
                        fall-blooded example of the domesticated gloved cat. The breed is pore only
                        when wild. </p>
                    <p>The gloved cat had evidently its share in producing our own domesticated cat,
                        as had also very possibly—the booted which is now found in North Africa, bat
                        which is common enough in Europe during the Quaternary period. The
                        “bracelets” on the torelegs of our striped cat are plainly those of the
                        gloved cat ; and in Spain it is beyond question that the domestic cat is
                        descended from the gloved variety. So far as appearances go, we might
                        conclude that the Egyptians had a cat that has since disappeared, or that
                        they had an <cb n="2"/>imported cat; in reality the cat was there all the
                        while, only enjoying a life of freedom </p>

                    <head>The Ibis</head>
                    <p>With the ibis the case is wholly different. The ibis was sacred to Isis ; it
                        personified the Nile Valley ; it was the emblem of Egypt in the days when
                        Toth, the god of learning and medicine, personified the intellect. But Hero-
                        dotus attributes two ibises to Egypt; a black one, which was a great
                        destroyer of serpents, and a white one, which was a domesticated bird. When
                        the Nile rose, then came countless it ibises, and the people credited them
                        with what was really the work of the river. But no black ibis exists ; what
                        now becomes of Herodotus’s veracity! Thanks to science, it gets its defence;
                        the philologists explain that the Damn applied to the black ibis is that of
                        another species, which exists to-day, and certain mummied ibises are found
                        to be this very bird. And now someone will ask about the white ibis, far the
                        white ibis has undeniably vanished from Egypt. And yet it was living there a
                        century ago • Savigny saw several specimens of it in the Delta. Some were
                        observed even as late as 1877, and it still survives in Ethiopia. Perhaps
                        Egypt does not attract it so effectually as formerly. At any rate the
                        difficulty need not embarrass us. </p>

                    <head>The Sheep</head>
                    <p>Another point, however, involves really serious difficulties, which make MM.
                        Lortet and Gaillaid’s explanation of it only the more interesting. It
                        concerns sheep, of which the Egyptians embalmed two varieties—the Qvis
                        Platycera and the longipes. Where did they get them! Such a question as this
                        is full of interest for historians of civilization and of humanity in
                        general. It was at first supposed that the longipes came from Asia. Asiatic
                        importations were long in fashion—man was thought to have come from Asia,
                        and so were animals and plants; theology, certain philosophies, and a lot of
                        legends agreed in making Asia the cradle of every living creature that WAS
                        at all worth while. Now MM. Lortet and Gaillard beg leave to observe that
                        there are serious reasons for believing that the sheep in question (and many
                        other animals, for that matter) didn’t originate in Asia, but rather in the
                        very part of Africa where they are to-day. Pray observe that the prehistoric
                        burial places of Egypt contain this sheep and only this sheep. On the other
                        band, a very ancient document —it dates from the thirteenth dynasty—tells ns
                        that King Snefron ravaged the Upper Nile and brought home seven thousand
                        Negroes and 200,000 cattle and sheep. Already the inferior races had begun
                        to be looted by the strong ; Egypt had witnessed a prelude to the
                        “Congnism”—sit venia verbo—of our own day. No doubt it was from the Sudan
                        that pre- historic man originally got the lengipes sheep, which had perhaps
                        been more widely indigenous in the Nile Valley before men became numerous. I
                        And fi ally it is to be noted that the sheep in question doesn’t bear a
                        foreign name. Its thoroughly Egyptian name is “ba.” Thus every- thing goes
                        to show that the animal didn’t come from Asia or from any far-off country,
                        bat was a native of Egypt. </p>
                    <p>As regards the other variety, it's quite a different story. Ira name is
                        “sau”—strongly suggestive of Asia, particularly of Assyria, Arabia, and
                        Palestine. Mummied specimens in Egypt date solely from the first dynasty,
                        and probably we should find this variety still living in Asia if we searched
                        diligently enough. Let us render unto Asia the things that are Asia’s and
                        unto Africa the things that are Africa’s</p>

                    <head>Cattle</head>
                    <p>The study of mummied cattle is no less significant. The Egyptian cow was
                        believed to have been an importation from Asia—probably from Syria. but the
                        debris of ancient Egypt afford no remains of this Asiatic variety ; they are
                        found only at a very recent period. </p>
                    <p>On the other hand, the ancient Egyptians possessed a beautiful breed of
                        cattle that no longer exists. Where did it go to? Where did it come from? In
                        Egypt it is evidently extinct. But it exists elsewhere in profuse abundance,
                        from Khartoum to the Great Lakes. In other words, the animal the ancient
                        Egyptians embalmed was none other than the zebu, droves of which exist
                        to-day on the plains along the Upper Nile. It was imported into Egypt dozens
                        of centuries ago: it dwindled and died off as the result of some sort of
                        epizootic, and it was replaced by an Asiatic breed, which was quite possibly
                        brought to Egypt by some returning conquerer. Again we are forced to credit
                        Africa with a product of Africa. </p>

                    <head>The Origin of Man</head>
                    <p>In other directions, however, one may generalize, and that is what MM. Lortet
                        and Gaillard do so pretty fearlessly when they leave the subject of beasts
                        and turn to that of men. It is folly, say they to suppose that the African
                        race originated in Asia. Like his sheep and his cattle, he originated in
                        Africa The flint implements scattered by the billion along the shores of the
                        Nile cannot possibly be regarded as having belonged to vanished negroid
                        tribes; they simply belonged to the oldest of ancient Egyptians. All the
                        skulls that have been un- earthed show themselves to be those of ancient
                        Egyptians and not those of prehistoric men. The modern Egyptians are
                        descendants of the ancient Egyptians, who were descendants of prehistoric
                        Africans, not, of prehistoric Asiatics. </p>
                    <p>So the mummies don’t teach us anything about the origin of man. That subject
                        has al- ready been fairly exhaustively discussed, though MM. Lortet and
                        Gaillard add further support to the conclusion reached by the

                    <p>The cattle give us further information of great value, for tbeir mummies
                        prove that the Egyptians bad succeeded in breeding a race of cattle without
                        horns. Handers cattle, so eagerly <cb n="3"/>sought for by modern breeders,
                        had already been obtained by the -Egyptians. How? No- body knows.
                        Nevertheless, they had them, and they gave them a distinctive name.
                        Apparently they didn’t make them work, hot treated them as a mere curiosity.
                        And yet they were by no means rare. A single district had 2 0 hornless
                        cattle as over against 835 homed ones. These cattle were born without horns
                        ; they had not been artificially dehorned. Moreover, we have Stanley’s word
                        for it that in the neighbourhood of the African lakes one finds hornless
                        cattle enough like those of the Angus, Suffolk and Iceland breeds. Probably
                        those races, like that possessed by the Egyptians, sprang from exceptional
                        individuals, born with- out horns and used for the purpose of securing a
                        hornless breed. In other words, the Egyptians practised selection and
                        employed it intelligently long before European breeders ever thought of so
                        doing, which certainly reflects credit en the Egyptian brain and affords an
                        interesting topic for the historian of their civilization to descant

                        the ape fell victim to tuberculosis then as now. The great malady of modern
                        times existed in the Nile Valley thousands of years ago, and it doubtless
                        killed men as well as monkey*. But it is likely that the ape came from a

                    <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                        January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so warm as
                        Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm
                        than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in
                        the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest
                        place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                        sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on each of
                        the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="3"/>
                    <p>They are as follows:-</p>
                    <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southhampton,
                        London or Liverpool—occupy about 4 days. The short ones are as follows:—</p>

                    <p>The steamers, of the P.&amp;O. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageriea
                        Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines are
                        also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by travellers to
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made without change
                        in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp;O.
                        Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna
                        express from Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail Steamers “Osiris" and “Isis” to Brindisi. One of these leaves port
                        Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian <cb n="6"
                        />mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                    <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                        attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats" having
                        been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi.
                        If you are going straight through to England you will find the train waiting
                        at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete
                        arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in
                        London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <head>SICILY.</head>
                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.’s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMENA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is the
                        station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful,
                        occupying about one hour. In and around the town is much to interest the
                        visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but restored under the Romans.
                        CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of Etna and here also is a fine
                        Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all over
                        the island, are an endless sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting
                        history, having been a Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C.
                        413, and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb
                        is to be seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                        about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                        delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The
                        Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S.
                        Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral,
                        Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also worth a
                        visit.</p>

                    <head>CENTRAL ITALY.</head>
                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.’s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                        bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento
                        [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                        City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence itself the churches
                        and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local promenades and
                        excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and
                        fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea
                        level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero,
                        thence by cog-wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks
                        takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; hero there is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                        and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                        house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                        and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                    <head>NORTHERN ITALY</head>
                    <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                        the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and deliciously cool
                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy’s most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                        SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal springs,
                        change trains at Borgo San Donino and in half-an-hour you are at

                    <head>NORTHERN ITALY (Continued) and The ITALIAN LAKES.</head>
                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the mostdelightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea port.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                        lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza :</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo, Cadenabbia,
                        and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio opposite. The walk
                        from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio is most enjoyable. A
                        steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake Lugano in three-quarters
                        of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                            hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated on
                            the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San

                        <p>LOCARNO, may be reached by rail from Bellinzona in forty minutes. This pretty
                            town, situated at the top of lake Maggiore has a mild climate and is an
                            excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated above the
                            town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings, “Entombment,"
                            by Ciseri, and ‘Tho Flight into Egypt,” by Bramantion.</p>

                        occupations. La fatigue de la purgation étant annulée par l'effet de la
                        bonne alimentation, on se décide aisément à recommencer autant de fois que
