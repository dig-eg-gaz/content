                    <head>THE STATE OF EUROPE</head>
                    <p>The conference of Algeciras has drawn attention to the possible assistance
                        which Great Britain may render to France if events should happen to take an
                        unfortunate turn. This goodwill which has sprung up in recent
                        <!-- column break but I'm not sure how to do that for page 2 --> between
                        France and England, of which President Loubet so felicitously indicated last
                        week the origin and progress, is the sentiment accompanying a very important
                        historical development. It indicates the instinctive recognition by both
                        nations of Great Britain’s peculiar function in the Euro¬pean economy. The
                        Continent of Europe contains a number of nations and of great States more or
                        less identical with them. These States, in virtue of the principle of their
                        existence, which is that of the independence of each of them, reinforced in
                        modern times and especially in the last hundred years by the principle of
                        nationality, and necessarily in perpetual rivalry, which leads to groupings
                        that vary from time to time. The general prin¬ciple of the groupings has
                        been, since the Six¬teenth Century at any rate, that in proportion as one
                        State increases in population, territory, and organization, and therefore in
                        power, the others become apprehensive of its too great preponderance. Its
                        great prosperity and strength begin to seem a menace to the inde¬pendence of
                        the others, and the growing State, in the consciousness of its developing
                        power, is apt to expect its influence to become paramount and to attribute
                        to itself a superiority hardly consistent with the fall autonomy of its
                        neighbours. Such was the posi¬tion at one time of the Germania Empire, at
                        another of the Spanish Monarchy, afterwards of the French Monarchy, and
                        subsequently of the first French Empire. In every case the expanding State
                        found the maritime power of Great Britain an obstacle to the foil
                        attain¬ment of the sort of supremacy towards which it was impelled. There
                        has, therefore, always been tendency for Great Britain to be regarded with
                        special jealousy by the strongest Conti¬nental Power, and the consequence of
                        that jealousy has always been to draw towards Great Britain the sympathy of
                        those Continen¬tal States which were apprehensive of a prepon¬derance
                        dangerous to their free will. The difficult periods have been those of
                        transition, when there has been a change in the relations of the Continental
                        Powers. Thus Great Britain in tie Sixteenth Century found herself in
                        opposition to the preponderance of Spain. The sentiment of opposition lasted
                        long after the necessity was gone, and the tendency to co-operate with
                        France was continued into the period when the real danger to the
                        independence of States was from France rather than from Spain.</p>
                    <p>During the second half of the Nineteenth Century the great change that took
                        place in Europe was the attainment of German unity, and the rise in Central
                        Europe of a German S ate stronger in respect of population, territory, and
                        organization than any of the other settled States, for Russia is still
                        rather an Asiatic despotism than a European organised State. The event of
                        the dose of the Nineteenth Century was the propagation in Germany of the
                        theory that Great Britain with her maritime resources and her colonies and
                        her Indian Empire was an obstacle to Germany’s develop¬ment. This
                        propaganda, sedulously fostered by an influential party in Germany, was
                        ac¬companied by a corresponding development of German sentiment. The event
                        of the beginning of the Nineteenth Century has been the recog-nition in
                        England of the political significance of this new German sentiment Germany
                        has taken the place in the European system which was occupied in the
                        Sixteenth Century by the Spanish Monarchy and in the Seventeenth by he
                        French Monarchy. It is of the expansive purpose of Germany that her
                        neighbours are apprehensive, and at the same time Germany has shown that she
                        regards Great Britain as it was regarded by Philip II., by Louis XIV., and
                        by Napoleon. The recognition of these foots has made dear to the other
                        Continental States the true position of England, obscured tor nearly a
                        century They now see that England with her naval power is the balancing
                        element in the European system, the one element which by its nature must be
                        in sympathy with their independence and opposed to any designs which would
                        menace it This is the funda¬mental fact, the instinctive recognition of
                        which is the deep historical basis of the entente cordiale</p>

                    <p>NO GOVERNOR APPOINTED</p>
                    <p>CHITTY BEY DECLINES THE POST.</p>
                    <p>The final selection of a new Governor of the National Bank of Egypt has still
                        to be made, r for Chitty Bey has declined to accept the post. (After the
                        Egyptian Government had agreed I to accept the selection of the board of
                        directors d it was universally considered a foregone conclusion that the man
                        whom they had chosen as their candidate would be appointed, and great was
                        the amazement yesterday when it was known that the Director General of
                        Customs o ha 1 intimated on Saturday afternoon that he r did not wish to
                        accept the moat remunerative ii position in Egypt. The grounds on which
                        Chitty Bey has based his refusual is that he has had I no experience of
                        banking business and that he ii therefore does Dot consider that he can
                        conscientiously accept the management of the E moat important banking
                        concern in the country.</p>
                    <p>The reason for his selection as their candidate by the board of directors was
                        that during his tenure of office as head of the greatest revenue-earning
                        department in Egypt, he had shown great powers of administration and
                        organization, and had in every way given proofs that he was possessed of the
                        exceptional , abilities necessary for the guidance of the “ bank. Another
                        point which carried great weight with the board in making their choice was
                        that he was a man of iron fixity of purpose, so that if he had made up his
                        mind that a certain course was the right one, he would not deviate from it a
                        hair's breadth notwithstanding what powerful influences might be brought to
                        bear on him from the City.</p>
                    <p>The selection if Chitty Bey by the board re¬presented the collective judgment
                        of the most competent set of business men in Egypt, for the directors
                        include the cream of he commercial and financial intelligence of the
                        country. When such practical men as Boghos, Pacha Nubar, Baron Jacques de
                        Menasce, Messrs. Aghion, Beyerle. Foster, de Tschndi, Cattaui, Suares,
                        Zervudachi. Rollo, Ralli, Benachi, Salvago. Milton, and Pelazaeus decided to
                        choose the Director-General of Customs so as their candidate, it was the
                        highest tribute n that oonld be paid to his character and capacity.</p>
                    <p>At the interview which took place at the British Agency this day week
                        between Lord Cromer and the directors, it was, however, decided that advice
                        from London should be, sought, but on Friday morning the Egyptian Government
                        announced that it would not g abide by this decision and was quite willing “
                        to same to accept the candidate of the hoard. The waiver on the part of the
                        Egyptian Government was tantamount to Lord Crmar's endorsement of the
                        directors choice, and consequently everybody expected that a final decision
                        would be arrived at when the board, met on Saturday afternoon. When it was
                        known therefore yesterday morning that Chitty Bey had intimated his in
                        willingness to accept the post all the qnidnoncery of Cairo and I
                        Alexandria, who had already begun to speculate as to who would be the new
                        head of the Customs, had to start on a fresh trail; but the search for
                        motives which would induce he rennroiation of the most lucrative billet in
                        Egypt nonplussed the boldest in a country whose prosperity engenders only
                        the most sordid ideals.</p>
                    <p>Besides the magnificent salary, the L.E. 1 000 house allowance, and the
                        annual remuneration of L E. 1,200 and L.E. 500 for the chairmanships of the
                        Agriculture and Abyssi¬nian Bank", there are other lucrative per¬quisites
                        attached to the governorship. per example, after the 4 percent. to the
                        share¬holder, and 10 per cent, to the reserve on original profile, there is
                        10 percent. which goes to the board, of which the Governor first takes 25
                        per cent. L.E. 10,000 went to the board, he took LE 2,500 before the board
                        came in, and then came in himself far the balance with the rest of the beard
                        as a director. There are of course plenty of other legitimate ‘‘pickings,”
                        even if extraneous directorships are henceforth prohibited, and the total
                        annual income will come not far from L.B. 10,000.</p>
                    <p>When a man who is only, in receipt of LE. 1.500 a year refuses such a post on
                        the grounds of lank of qualification when it is spontaneous¬ly offered to
                        him, the imagination of the aver¬age person is at a loss to account for such
                        a situation. Especially is this so in Egypt, where lack of experience has
                        never been considered a disqualification and we have English officials
                        placed in positions requiring most technical knowledge who have never
                        received any professional training. For instance, one of the moat important
                        posts in the Ministry of Justice is held by an official who has had no legal
                        training whatsoever, and there are many other instances of favourites of
                        fortune who have been jockeyed into positions without any
                        quali¬fications.</p>
                    <p>The decision of Cbitty Bey is to he respectes’. He bolds that it is the
                        primary and principal qualification of a banker to be well acquainted with
                        banking, for it is a business which is not learned in a day, but needs
                        antitude end ap¬prenticeship like any other calling. Of banking Chitty Bey,
                        from practical experience, admit-tedly knows nothing. Therefore, according
                        to the Egyptian precedent, “lucus a non Iucendo,” so usual in the bestowal
                        of office in Egypt, the choice of the Government and of the board of
                        directors has fallen upon him. To some his refusal of such a position will
                        be incomprehen¬sible. To others it will be explicable on the grounds that he
                        lacks the most conspicuous mark of genius, the faculty of rising to the
                        occasion. But to a minority his decision will be received with respect as a
                        memorable sample of scrupulousness in a country where such a virtue is by no
                        means conspicuous.</p>
                    <p>A meeting of the directors of the National Bank took place on Saturday
                        afternoon, but no decision as to who should be selected as Governor was
                        arrived at.</p>
                    <p>Our native contemporary “A1 Moavad.” in notifying Chitty Bey’s action,
                        remarks, “In any care he is one of the most useful Englishmen in Egypt, and
                        Egyptians will be glad to see him always holding high positions, which bring
                        him in touch with natives and where his service are useful to the country,

                    <p>The members of the Egyptian Press who recently visited the Sudan gave a
                        dinner to Owen Bey on Saturday evening at 8hepheard’s Hotel. ID spite of the
                        fact that thirteen sat down to table owing to the absence of Naoum Bey
                        8hakair, the best of good spirits and cordiality prevailed, and the
                        excellent menu provided speedily appeased the qualms of the most
                        superstitious. The health of the guest of the evening was proposed by M. R.
                        C. Canivet, up from Alexandria for the occasion. in one of those neatly
                        felicitous after time speeches that few but a Frenchman can make. Dr. Paris
                        Nimir made an admirable speech in the highest of Arabic. and Tadros Bey
                        Shenouda also proposed the health of Owen Bey in eloquent terms.</p>
                    <p>In replying to the toasts in his honour Owen Bey, after thanking the Press
                        for their good wishes, and complimenting them on the excellent articles that
                        had been evoked by their visit, stated that every official, Egyptian,
                        Sudanese, and British, would be glad to know that their work had been
                        appreciated by disinterested observers, and that the members of the Press
                        had thoroughly appreciated their visit to the Sudan and the efforts of the
                        Sudan Government to make their visit a pleasant one.</p>
                    <p>More speeches followed. Mr. Tite, to whose kindness the Press are greatly
                        indebted, replied in a few cordial words to a well-deserv¬ed toast by Dr.
                        Nimr. Owen Bey prop sad “The Press” in a well oho«en and interesting speech,
                        to which Mr. Hafiz Awad and Mr. Graves replied, the former pointing out that
                        from the point of view of the Press the journey to Khartoum had been an
                        unmixed benefit, bringing to/ether representatives of all shades of opinion
                        who were united in their desire to advocate the good of Egypt. After
                        thanking Owen Bey for his toast he called upon all pre¬sent to drink to the
                        proipen-y of the larger unity of the Nile Valley. It was not till after 11

                        to be held at Wim-hes'er H nre, 0 d Broad Street, London, on Thursday next.
                        The report and statement of accounts embrace the period sinoe the
                        incorporation of the company on the 9th of January, 1905, to the 81st
                        Deoember. 190V The operations of the period under review have resulted in a
                        nett profi' (without including any of the apprecia¬tion on investments
                        referred to below) of £8 987 2 0. From this the directors have decided to
                        write off one third of the preliminary expenses, amounting to £2.622 7 9,
                        leaving a balanoe at oredit of profit and loss of £6,364 14 3. The directors
                        recommend that this balance be dealt with as follows—In pay¬ment of a
                        dividend of 10 per cent, free of income tax on the paid-op capital - f the
                        com¬pany, £50,000, leaving £1,364 14 3 to be carried forward.</p>
                    <p>It has not been deemed necessary to set aside anything for reserve, as the
                        investments made by the company represent an appreciation (which does not
                        appear in the accounts submitted, of £10,000 on the basis of a valua-tion
                        taken at practically the lowest point touched during the recent crisis on
                        the Egyptian Bourse, since when prices have recovered considerably. The
                        flotation of two important companies, the Building Lands of Egypt, Limited,
                        and the Associated Cotton dinners of , Egypt, Limited, has been carried out
                        and the success which has already attended the operations of these two
                        companies has justified the expectations of the directors. A good return has
                        been obtained from the | discounting of local paper, and a considerable
                        extension of this branch of the company’s business is in contemplation. The
                        company’s ' position has been kept liquid, as its invest¬ments are all
                        readily realisable. Various proposals likely to prove sources of revenue are
                        under consideration. A commercial branch has recently been inaugurated at
                        Alexandria . for the conduct of an import and export business which will be

                    <p>BATTLE OF FLOWERS</p>
                    <p>AN IMMENSE GATHERING</p>
                    <p>Last night Cairo spent its time endeavoring get rid of the confetti collected
                        during the f afternoon at the “Bataille de Fleurs.’’ Ghezireh 1 still is
                        laid deep in the rainbow-tinged snow- e storm that filled the air during the
                        fray, and t there are but few out of the population who | did not add their
                        quota to the display. Every arahieh in the place must have-been busy
                        conveying the merry-makers across the river, and neither love nor money were
                        able to secure a conveyance for the return journey.</p>
                    <p>Though the procession was advertised to commence at three o’olock, many
                        people were in their seats soon after two, and a steady and ever-increasing
                        stream of all sorts and conditions followed on their steps, till every seat
                        in every stand and loge was filled, and the course was bordered on either
                        side by a gaily-dressed crowd of men, women, and children, which almost put
                        the decorations even 1 out of conceit with themselves. The confetti and
                        flower sellers did a roaring trade, and when their stock was all run out,
                        the enter¬prising Arab gathered up the fragments off the sandy paths,
                        stuffed them again into discarded bags, and reaped a second harvest. From a
                        strictly impartial view it cannot said that the display of decorated
                        carriages could be compared with those to be seen on the Riviera, or indeed
                        anywhere in France during the carnival season, and as a matter of fact there
                        were many who said the display, was not up to the avenge for Cairo, and was
                        inferior even to that of last year. The most, beautiful carriage, and it
                        really was a work of art, was that belonging to Omar Bey Sultan. It
                        represented a huge basket of pure white, with a high arched handle from,
                        which depended long streamers of snowy chiffon. Both handle and basket and
                        its stand were adorned with white flowers, and on it were perched a crowd of
                        white-feathered, doves. The horses, too, were white, and so also was the
                        harness with silver mountings. The coachman, beside whom stood the Bey, was
                        also in white, and the sayces, too, were robed immaculately and carried
                        white and flower- bedecked wands in their hands. It was not surprising that
                        this oarriage obtained the pig d’honneur, a handsome silver cup, and M.
                        Ferdinand de Martino gained the grandprix for his motor decorated with
                        wreaths of violets and white flowers. Another carriage, drawn by two horses,
                        was transformed into a veritable kiosk of flowers wherein was enshrined a
                        dainty lady with two charming children in fairy like attire; another motor
                        oar, which gained the second prize and was owned by M. Alexander Comanos,
                        was transformed into the likeness of a scarlet dahabieh wreathed about with
                        flowers, and two tiny children in a gaily- decorated oar drawn by a
                        diminutive donkey ware overcome with pride when presented with a prize
                        banneret. 0 her prizes ware awarded to the three ladies bearing
                        flower-decked' sunshades (Mmea. Z *her, Beriketti, and Innis), I perhaps the
                        prettiest being one with large transparent medallions encircled with dainty
                        wreaths of lilies of the valley, the fragile hat of the Wwearer being made
                        to coreespond</p>
                    <p>In the procession were many other carriages more or less decorated, and many
                        people pre¬ferred spending their time moving round and round the course to
                        remaining in the stands, and considering the crowd of pedestrians and
                        vehicles it was wonderful that the afternoon passed without mishaps. As for
                        the spirit of carnival, it was there with all its accustomed accessories.
                        The air was filled with confetti and flowers and merry battles ware fought
                        at every corner and ail along the line. Carriages were entangled wtth paper
                        serpentines, while hats and pretty frocks, to say nothing of the garments of
                        the sterner sex, were soon decorated and bespangled with the multicoloured
                        particles</p>
                    <p>The fun ran riot till confetti bags were finished and the spirits of the
                        throwers exhausted. With dusty throats and spent energies the worn out folk
                        streamed back to the Ghezireh Palace Hotel, where every available nook and
                        cranny was filled with eager tea drinkers. The road back to Cairo was a long
                        procession of vehicles following all the same direction, and though the
                        unfortunate way¬farers had a long and dusty tramp home, the carriage folk
                        did not gain in point of time.</p>

                    <p>EMPLOYER'S STRANGE FREAK</p>
                    <p>SATURDAY'S PERFORANCE OFF.</p>
                    <p>The Cairo Opera House was flooded on Saturday night—not by a thunderstorm but
                        by internal irrigation, the work of an ingenious employ who, doubtless for
                        curiosity’s sake, turned on the fire tape which are designed to play on the
                        stage in case of fire. The streams that descended on the stage should have
                        satisfied and reassured him or any who doubted the value of the precautions
                        now taken against fire, but their volume also alarmed him to such a degree
                        that, paralyzed with tenor, he forgot to turn off the fire main. The
                        scenery, the stage, the orchestra, and many of he properties were drenched,
                        the electrical installation was injured, and the management could only send
                        a frantic appeal to the Ministry of Public Works, who came, saw, and
                        estimated the damages. Consequently there was no per¬formance on Saturday
                        night Iris gave place to Beidckt, and Cairo bad something to talk of.</p>
