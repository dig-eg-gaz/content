                        <p>What is a national policy and what is the
                            policy of the British nation? In the “National
                            Review” for May the attempt is made to
                            represent Great Britain as specifically committed
                            to a course of which neither the
                            wisdom nor the necessity, still less the deliberate
                            acceptance by the nation, appears to us
                            to be proved. It is made by Sir Rowland Blennerhassett,
                            whose function it has been for
                            several years to illustrate with his great know
                            ledge and ready pen those features of the
                            German public life of to-day which make for
                            antagonism to Great Britain. That our country
                            men should keep open eyes for the development
                            of Germany, and while studying Germany
                            should not be blind to the influences which
                            make her people politically unfriendly to Great
                            Britain, is most needful. But this openmindedness
                            ought not to degenerate into such
                            a bias as may upset the balance of judgment.
                            In his account Sir Rowland Blennerhassett
                            describes as a policy what are no more than a
                            series of acts that have come about rather by
                            drift than by design and presents them as parts
                            of a great scheme which has certainly never
                            been considered and thought out by any Urge
                            section of the British public. Moreover, from
                            this scheme the essence of a policy, its strategical
                            basis, is absent. The scraps of political
                            action which Sir Rowland Blennerhasett
                            brings together are the alliance with Japan and
                            he understanding with France. These exist To
                            them he adds an "arrangement” with Russia,
                            which he has long advocated, and a farther
                            arrangement with Italy, the object of these
                            arrangements being to preserve the liberties of
                            Europe, among them of the Bohemians and
                            other Austrian Slavs, the object of the whole
                            combination being to keep Europe from under
                            “the iron heel of a Prussianised Germany.”</p>
                        <p>It is not a little remarkable (says a writer in
                            the London "Morning Poet”) that this account
                            of what Sir Rowland Blennerhassett calls "the
                            new and national foreign policy of England”'
                            should be introduced at the close of a paper on
                            the genesis of Italian unity, in which Italy is
                            depicted as the prey to a "growing disorganisation
                            in administration,” to “the spread of
                            revolutionary force?," and to "disintegrating
                            materialism." These are the symptoms of t
                            "dangerous condition which has not yet passed
                            away." This account of the condition of Italy
                            hardly comes well in an argument for co-operation
                            with Italy in European affairs. It does no
                            make a solid basis for this particular item of
                            the new programme. But that is a detail upon
                            which it would be ungracious to dwell, especially
                            as on any theory of British policy the
                            people of Great Britain have long cherished,
                            and we trust will ever cherish, a peculiar goodwill
                            to the people of Italy and to their union in
                            a national State. A national policy, according
                            to our view, consists in the conscious connection
                            in the public mind between the great aims
                            recognised as necessary to the nation's welfare
                            and the means by which those ends are to
                            be attained. By the nation we understand
                            not simply the people, and not simply the
                            State or the Government, bat the people organised
                            as a State and represented by its
                            Government. A nation’s policy at any given
                            moment is, of course, the policy of its Government.
                            But for policy in that sense no adjective
                            is required ; if we speak of a national policy
                            we mean a policy expressing the general sense
                            of the people, in which both parties concur.
                            The policy of Pitt in the long war with France
                            was in this sense national. There was an opposition,
                            but it was unable without offending the
                            general feeling and temper of the country
                            to make effective resistance to the foreign
                            policy of Pitt. If at the present day any
                            general view of the future course of
                            British action is to commend itself to the
                            bulk of our countrymen, to men who on
                            a domestic question would perhaps be divided
                            —for example, not only to Mr. Birrell but
                            also to Lord Hugh Cecil, not only to Mr.
                            Chamberlain bat also to the Duke of Devonshire-
                            then it mast not merely set np some
                            aim to be reached, but most set beside it some
                            means by which that end can reasonably be '
                            expected to b6 compassed. The great ends
                            which most men accept as governing the
                            conduct of Great Britain in relation to foreign
                            Powers are the maintenance of the British
                            State in its dependence and in the possession
                            of such influence as it has, and can rightly
                            exercise. Great Britain is attempting as well
                            as it can to administer India and to improve
                            the administration of Egypt. In these matters
                            our countrymen think that they have a work
                            to do, and that they ought not to be meddled
                            with in the doing of it What are the mesne
                            from which the successful attainment of
                            these ends can rationally be expected 1 First
                            that the work should be well and honestly done,
                            so that there may be no reproach against Great
                            Britain, as in these matters an unprofitable
                            servant. Next that Great Britain should so
                            husband and organise her own strength as to
                            be able of her own resources to make a good
                            fight for the right, if while doing right she
                            should be exposed to challenge ; and lastly
                            that, giving no ground for challenge in any
                            wrong done by her, and being so armed that
                            she need fear no challenge, she may so approve
                            herself in both respects to the general
                            judgment of mankind, and in particular to the
                            sympathies of the best nations, that in case of
                            a conflict of principle some of them will be on
                            her side. The true nature of co-operation between
                            nations, especially in case of war, consists
                            not so much in contract and the letter of
                            a bond as in such a community of aims that
                            one of a group cannot be assailed without the
                            rest of the group feeling themselves menaced
                            and therefore impelled to take part in a common
                            defence. The alliance with Japan when
                            original y made was acceptable to the people
                            of England largely because they felt that
                            Japan was being wrongfully pressed by a
                            wantonly aggressive Power. The diplomatic
                            support given to France in the Congress at
                            Algeciras was given because Great Britain's
                            word was pledged, bat it was given gladly and
                            with general approval because it was felt that
                            France was not being fairly treated by those
                            who forced the Congress upon her.</p>
                         <p>The practical basis of a national policy
                            must be the organisation of the nation for
                            the support of its policy, in other words, such
                            an organisation of Navy and Army as would
                            enable the whole strength of the country, its
                            best intellect, and its best physical force to be
                            available for resistance to challenge. Without
                            that basis there will never be a national policy
                            worth the name. That is the missing element
                            in Sir Rowland Blennerhaasett’s scheme And
                            while that is wanting there will never be the
                            national feeling of self-reliance without which
                            alliances and arrangements are apt to be temporary
                            expedients to escape from temporary embarrassments.
                            This national organisation will
                            come of clear thinking and will come of itself
                            so soon as the War Office has faced the
                            subject squarely. It will hardly come of agitations
                            for compulsion. Meantime much good
                            results from all endeavours to illuminate the
                            intimacy of the relations by which Great
                            Britain is bound to Europe. which Rowland
                            Biennerhassett, though in our judgment his
                            ideas of policy are open to criticism which will
                            not always lead to their acceptance, does
                            valuable service of this kind. The study,
                            showing how closely all Great Britain’s foreign
                            affairs are knit together, and bow everything
                            in them depends on the relations of Great
                            Britain to the Great Powers, it highly

                        Monseigneur <unclear/>. Archbishop of Cypress and Apostlic Dalegata.
                        The school band ably performed a choice repetoire, and
                        Louis XVII was a play in four acts which is of local interest in that
                        it was written by the Rev. Father Delaporte, of the Society of Jesus.
                        We congratulate the College upon the great success of its artistic labours,
                        and look forward to another entertainment of the kind. The good Brothers
                        are certainly useful labourers not only in the scholastic,
                        but in many other fields of social activity.</p>

                        <p>A native camel driver of Delingsat was
                        severely bitten in the arm last week by his 
                        camel in a fit of temper. He was attended
                        by the village doctor and the wound seemed to be
                        getting on well, when, four days after the bite,
                        the victim behaved in a strange manner and finally 
                        became a raving maniac and expired in convulsions
                        with all the symptoms of hydrophobia. The natives 
                        of his neighbourhood thought that the unfortunate man's
                        madness was due to the divine afflatus instead of to the
                        camel's teeth, and their beleif was confirmed by his
                        speedy death, for they thought he had been specially 
                        summoned to the heaven in haste. A movement therefore has been
                        started to erect a shrine.</p>

                        <p>Remarkable skill is shown by native trackers

                        ground in the vicinity is composed of soft sand. The
                        trackers examined the post early the following morning,
                        and soon picked up the tracks of two men and a donkey,
                        which they followed to the Government stables. All the
                        syces were paraded before the trackers, who picked out the
                        Governor's syce and the syce of the Staff Officer as the
                        owners of the tracks. The donkeys were then ministered, and
                        the trackers picked out the Inspector's donkey as the animal
                        whose tracks they had followed. The stables were searched, and some
                        loaves of sugar discovered. Further search was then made and
                        the remainder of the stolen sugar waas dug up clsoe by. The 
                        two syces were tried and confessed. They stated that, finding the
                        box was too ehavy to carry, they had used the Inspector's donkey.</p>

                    <dateline>London, Tuesday.</dateline>
                    <p>A telegram from both Vienna states that Izzet Pacha
                    is in disgrace owing to the warlike policy which he
                    counselled in the recent crisis.</p>
                    <p>The news contained in the above telegram <unclear/> rejoice many hearts.
                        Moreover, it contains the information we lately published and which we had
                        obtained from reliable sources. Some months ago a rumour was current on the
                        Bosphorus that the Sublime Porte party, headed by the Grand Vizier, were on
                        the ascendant and had wrested from Izzet the monopoly he enjoyed in the way
                        of governing the Arabian villayets with his protégé, who, in return, kept
                        him well supplied with pocket money. Now all this has been knocked on the
                        head, and the cry is "Next." The current against him had probably been
                        flowing for long, but few had dared attack him. The Akaba intrigue, which of
                        course his oppenents told all Europe was his doing, has afforded them the
                        means of at once securing his fall and providing the Sovereign of the
                        Bosphorus with a convenient scape-goat on whom to lay the burden of the
                        recent fiasco. Sic transit: However, in the interests of all concerned in
                        the welfare of Arabia, and the maintenance of those relations of traditional
                        friendshi which have marked British diplomacy in Turkey with a perculiar
                        character, it is perhaps well that this Affaire Akaba should have its
                        Dreyfus. It is a case of necessity the Tyrant's plea.</p>

                    <dateline>Jerusalem, May 12.</dateline>
                    <p>The Governor of Jerusalem has just received a telegraphic communication from
                        the Sublime Porte acquainting him of a decision of the Council of Ministers,
                        approved by an Imperial Iradé to the effect that the district of Nazareth,
                        governed by Kaimakam, is to be transferred from the jurisdiction of the
                        Mufesserifat of Acre to that of Jerusalem, and that the necessary orders
                        have been issued to the Vali of Beyrout within whose district Acre is
                        situated. On receipt of this news, Rechid Bey informed the Porte that the
                        decision would not be carried out, and was inconsistent with the present
                        formation of the Vilayets of Beyrout and the independent Mufesserifat of
                        Nablus,which is within the Vilayet of Beyrout, is situated between Nazareth
                        and Jersualem, and unless Nablus is also annexed by Jerusalem the decision
                        wil be quite unpredictable.</p>

                    <head>BOULAC BRIDGE.</head>
                    <p>It has been decided that the Public Works Department with the assistance of
                        whatever technical advice they may think fit to call in, shall, in the case
                        of the Boulac Bridge, prepare their own designs, and shall lay down, in the
                        minutest detail, the materials which are to be used. The competing firms,
                        who will be selected from various nationalities, will, of course, have to
                        fonform strictly to the specification. There will then be only one question
                        to be decided, namely, that of price. The adoption of this system should
                        obviate all the difficulties which occurred in connection with the
                        construction of the Rodah Bridge. In the case of the Rodah Bridge, the
                        various competing areas were invited to prepare their own designs, and
                        moreover, signed deal of latitude was left as regards the material which was
                        to be used in various parts of the structure. Hence, much difficulty arose
                        in deciding which was really the best offer and it was only by the
                        moderation and good sense of all concerned that an acrimonious discussion
                        did not take place as to the rival merits of the proposal put forward by
                        firms of different nationalities. It is desrable that any risk of this sort
                        should be avoided in the future.</p>

                        to a question, said that a satisfactory joint

                        not less than three miles from Akaba. There is

                            into the Press. It appears that the Sub
                            Governor’s son, a young and enthusiastic
                            partisan of the Pan Islamic idea, recently made
                            some rather injudicious speeches at a Moslem
                            club. There is no reason to believe, however,
                            that the father was guilty of anything more
                            than a certain carelessness with regard to his
                            son’s language.</p>

                        strongly object to taking part in any pro-German
                        demonstration of anti-British tendencies, because

                        part in Balkan affairs. Germany, he says,

                        operations justifies them in continuing the

                        of debentures in order to replace those paid

                        of 5 per cent for the past six months be
                        declared, which with the 5 per cent, paid in

                    <p>One of the funniest examples that has ever

                        is the failure of the Mohamed Aly
                        Memorial. Only a few months ago, on the
                        occasion of the centenary of Mohamed Aly, a
                        public meeting was convened at the Alexandria
                        Municipality in order to decide what steps
                        should be taken to evolve some permanent
                        memorial in honour of the founder of the Khedivial
                        Dynasty. Great enthusiasm was displayed
                        for the moment and the leaders of European
                        and native society countered in their zeal to
                        honour the great Macedonian, who first essayed
                        to bring Egypt within the sphere of modern
                        civilisation. The proposition, of Mr. Michel
                        Sinadino to found a madhouse was accepted,
                        and it was supported by many of fbe leading
                        citizens. Subsequently it was decided that the
                        Municipality should bear the expenses of the
                        fête and that subscriptions should be invited
                        to erect a lasting tribute, which was to take
                        the shape of Mr. Michel Sinadino’s proposals.
                        Since then we have heard nothing of the madhouse
                        project and the public is still waiting

                        scheme for a promenade pier at Alexandria, I fail to see that the Alexandria
                        Municipality is at all justified in accepting Mr. W. O. Joseph's proposals.
                        This gentleman demands not only a mere pier but a number of other monopolies
                        which no Municipality would be justified in grainting. He demands a
                        concession for a pier, baths, and appurtenances within a zone including Kait
                        Bey (the old Pharos) and Fort Silsileh. This is too much of a monopoly to
                        give away, and the Municipality would be very ill advised if they accorded
                        more than the pier and a kilometre on each side. This is quite sufficient
                        for the purposes which he has in view.</p>

                        shown that the unchecked carrying of aims
                        favoured crime, but so far nothing has been
                        done to stop it. What is wanted is action and
                        not vain recommendations. The police it not
                        sufficient and cannot do it, nor will the omdehs
                        and sheikhs. These worthy functionaries only

                    <p>Mr. Joseph Austen Chamberlain, whose, engagement to Miss Dundas is announced
                        in to-day's Reuter's telegrams, is the eldest son of the late Secreatry of
                        State for the Colonies. Born in 1863, he was educated at Rugby and at
                        Trinity College, Cambrdige. He did not make his maiden speech in the House
                        of Commons until April 1893, when he interposed in the debate on the Home
                        Rule Bill, and received from the then Prime Minister a kindly compliment and
                        a genial criticism, bringing out unmistakeably Mr. Gladstone's grand manner
                        and great dignity. "It was a great speech," said Mr. Gladstone, "that must
                        have been dear and refreshing to a father's heart." Mr. Joseph Chamberlain
                        was deeply touched by the kindly and unexpected tribute, for the son had
                        spoken on the one subject which had caused an irrevocable breach between the
                        father and his former chief.</p>
                    <p>Upon the accession of the Unionists to the office Iin 1895 Mr. Austen
                        Chamberlain was apoointed Civil Lord of the Admiralty, serving under Mr.
                        Geschen, and developing an aptitude for business which did not surprise
                        those who were best acquianted with his qualities. So highly did he
                        distnguish himself that after the general election of 1900 Lord Salisbury
                        promoted him to the difficult post of Financial Secretary to the Treasury;
                        whilst Mr. Balfour, on becoming Prime Minister in July, 1902, made him
                        Post-master-General with a seat in the Cabinet.</p>
                    <p>At St. Martin's le Grande he held the scales evenly as between the public and
                        the gigantic staff under his command. His transfer to the Treasury in the
                        exalted position of Chancellor of the Exachange was a signal recognition of
                        proved merit, and was acclaimed by the public. At the Post Office he had to
                        grapple with problems of finance and difficulties of administration and thus
                        had a felicitous preparation for similar work on a more extended scale. The
                        young administrator does not confine his labours to London. At Highbury he
                        manages a small dairy farm, taking a keen interest in both the practical and
                        the scientific aspects of farming. Mr. Austen Chamberlain strongle resembles
                        his father in appearance. </p>

                    <p>An American writer gives vent to the follow-
                        ing opinion on English policy in Egypt. It is
                        difficult, however, to understand the point of
                        view of the writer : —</p>
                    <p>We sneer at the Chinese for their abnormal
                        suspicion of each other, finding much humour
                        in the story about the nine members of a firm
                        who secured the company’s funds in a safe
                        fastened by as many looks, but the distrust
                        of the Oriental partners was exaggerated a
                        hundredfold when the European bondholders
                        scrambled for seats on the- lid of Egypt’s strong
                        box. The patient was bedridden with financial
                        cramp, but the volunteer nurses were afraid to
                        trust each other alone with the sufferer over-
                        night for fear the bed-clothes and furniture
                        would be missing in the morning.</p>
                    <p>Among the first on the scene was our old
                        friend, John Bull, esquire, who makes a

                        for what he can get out of it, and who is really
                        an expert in resuscitating faint and exhausted
                        governments. Seeing that some one had to
                        administer to stricken Egypt, it was dollars to
                        doughnuts that the rotund Doctor John would
                        get the job, even if he had to force his services
                        on the needy, which he promptly did.</p>
                    <p>When the willing physician to sore and
                        languishing nations takes a case by his peculiar
                        method of insistence, the patient is
                        almost certain to show just enough signs of
                        improvement to offer encouragement, bat the
                        wont of it is that he never quite recovers.
                        Great Britain’s colonial hospital is fall of
                        convalescents, but a complete cure is never
                        effected. Furthermore, the possessions of the
                        sufferer are gradually diverted to the maintenance
                        of the large and competent corps of
                        British experts who devote their lives to his
                        case. I think no one will take exception to
                        the statement that a sick government that
                        once becomes a patient of England never gets
                        well.</p>

                    <head>MOULED EN-NEBI IN LONDON.</head>
                    <p>The Mouled en-Nebi was celebrated last
                        week in London by the Faithful at a banquet
                        held at Frascati's restaurant.</p>
                    <p>“Salam aliekum !” (Peace be with you !) was
                        the greeting in favour, and while beyond the
                        antechamber the unresigned were busied over
                        the discussion of forbidden indulgences, within
                        all was orthodox and fit matter for true believers. Perhaps a hundred ladies and gentlemen
                        took part in the proceedings, and of this
                        number folly one-half were English. The Persian
                        legation was represented, but the Sublime
                        Porte, perhaps in view of existing diplomatic
                        events, was not. Iq Liverpool, the Sheikh-ul-Islam,
                        Abdallah Quilliam, was known to be
                        celebrating the occasion among Northcountry
                        friends of Islam, with an address bearing upon
                        the questions at issue between Turkey and
                        Great Britain. But at the conversazione of the
                        Pan-Islamic Society in London politics were
                        not touched upon, and the talk was rather
                        social and academic than topical.</p>
                    <p>The room presented a distinctly picturesque
                        appearance when Mr. Abdul Kadir rose to
                        address his audience, soon after nine o’clock.
                        Among the men present the conventional
                        evening dress of Europe was mostly favoured,
                        but in some cases its strict sobriety was enlivened
                        by a crimson fez of the military shape,
                        or a turban of white cashmire, or of silk of the
                        Prophet’s own green, and spangled. The Mahomeans
                        present were largely natives of Indie,
                        and many of them were students reading for
                        the Bar in London. Mr. Abdul Kadir said that
                        of late thinking men in the West had ceased
                        adding the words “false” and “impostor” to
                        every reference to the great Arabian prophet,
                        and had come to realise the great fact that
                        Mahomet had preached reverence for Christ as
                        for the very Spirit of God, and for the early
                        prophets of Israel. </p>
                    <p>While the English friends of members were
                        supplied with refreshments, the members themselves
                        adjourned to another room for prayer,
                        the hoar having arrived for evening devotions.</p>

                    <p>Le Caire, Lundi 15 Mai.</p>
                    <p>A Londres, le taux de l’escompte libre est
                        resté invarié hier à 3 5/8 pour cent.</p>
                    <p>Au Stock Exchange, le Consolidé anglais s
                        clôturé en hausse de 1/8 à 89 7/8. L’Unifiée a
                        réactionné de 1/8 à 104 1/8. La National
                        Bank est demeurée inchangée à 26 5/8 et la
                        Daira à 17 8/8. L’Agricole a regagué 1/8 &amp;
                        10 1/8 et la Delta Light autant à 12 3/8.</p>
                    <p>A Paris, l'action Crédit Foncier Egyptien
                        est renseignée en reprise de 3 francs à 775.
                        La Banque d’Athènes, d’autre part, est remontée
                        de 147 à 151 francs.</p>
                    <p>Ici, la réaction forcée que nous avions fait
                        entrevoir discrètement hier s'est dessinée dès
                        ce matin, malgré toutes les nouvelles favorables.
                        Elle s’est principaiement manifestée
                        sur les valeurs dirigeantes, ainsi qne sur
                        quelques autres, dont la faiblesse est peut être
                        imputable à certaines positions. Hâ ons nous
                        de le dire, cette situàtion ne présente rien
                        d’inquiétant et peut être considérée comme
                        transitoire ; mais la modération et la prudence
                        s’imposent. Il importe surtont de se garer
                        contre les tendances dont la prétention ostensible
                        est de "sontenir la place,” mais dont
                        l’objet réel semble être de pousser les cours
                        dans la seule vue de s’alléger. Le marché
                        s’améliorera assurément, mais encore fant-il
                        lui laisser le temps de retrouver son assiette
                        normale. Pour l’instant, de hauts prix éphémères
                        eraient, certes, l’affaire d’anouns ; mais
                        ils auraient le tort souverain de causer à la
                        masse des déconvenues dout les effets déprimants
                        pourraient se faire sentir jusqu'à la
                        période de rentrée, sinon an delà.</p>
                    <p>Nous détachons d’ure lettre de Londres, en
                        date du 8 Mai, le passage suivant relatif à la
                        situation monétaire :</p>
                    <p>“Le resserrement monétaire déterminé par
                        la catastrophe de San-Francisco est visiblement
                        en train de se détendre. L’exode d’or diminue
                        et il est probable que nous ne tarderons pas à
                        voir le taux de l'escompte libre subir une
                        réduction sensible. Mais les effets de cette
                        amélioration tarderont peut-être à se faire
                        sentir, dans une forte mesure, an Stock Exchange.
                        Il ne faut pas, en effet, perdre de vue
                        que, si les Compagnies d'assurance n’ont pins à
                        procéder à de grosses ventes de fonds publics,
                        il n’y a pas lien d’espérer, d’ici quelque temps,
                        qu’on les rencontrera par les bons acheteurs et,
                        partant, parmi les principaux soutiens du
                        marché financier. En tout cas, c'est la un fasteur
                        important en moins en faveur d'une
                        hausse sérieuse et stable.”</p>

                        l’exercice clos le 31 Mars dernier. Avec
                        le coupon intérimaire payé en Novembre 1905,
                        le dividende annuel s’élèvera à 10 %.</p>
                    <p>La National Bank, qui avait été poussée
                        hier jusqu’à 26 3/4, a fini aujourd’hui à 26 3/8,
                        perdant ainsi toute son avance de ces jours
                        derniers. L’Agricole s’est mieux comportée :
                        elle a maintenu en clôture son prix d’hier.

                        <p>To the Editor of the "Egyptian Gazette."</p>
                        <p>Sir—I notice in the letter you reproduce
                            from the “Tribune” under the signature of
                            Midhat Haydar Bey that astonishment is
                            expressed that Lord Cromer should have allowed
                            H.E. Ghazi Mukhtar Pacha, Imperial
                            Ottoman High Commissioner in Egypt, to treat
                            with the Khedive on a question in which the
                            prestige of Great Britain was at stake,and that
                            Lord Cromer refused to recognise in his
                            Excellency “any quality other than that of a
                            simple private gentleman of distinction living
                            at Cairo.” In reply to that assertion, I must
                            aver that if Midhat Bey is astonished I am
                            even more so, not so much at his objections,
                            which are naturally tainted with bias, put
                            that Lord Cromer should have confided such
                            a statement to a journalistic exile, which, from
                            what I have heard of Lord Cromer’s diplomatic
                            aptitudes, I very much doubt to have been the
                            case. If the Ghazi’s presence in Egypt is singly
                            that of “a private gentleman of distinction,”
                            then all I can say is, that the British Government
                            and its Representative at the Court
                            of Abdeen are entirely in the wrong in having
                            had anything to do with him all along, and
                            particularly, dating this recent crisis, when; hip.
                            Excellency played so prominent a role as
                            mediator between the Sublime Porte and ,the
                            Khediviate that his illustrious name is now a
                            household word m Great Britain, nearly all the
                            British Press, with one or two exceptions,haying,
                            appreciated those services by calling him “the
                            Man of the Hour,” There are some things
                            which neither exiled journalists nor their informants
                            can obviate, and that is the existence
                            of an international arrangement by which
                            H.E. Ahmed Mukhtar Pacha enjoys, and
                            exercises, the authority of Imperial Ottoman
                            High Commissioner in Egypt. The title-
                            deeds to that office are just as valid
                            in the eyes of international judgment as
                            are those of the Imperial Ottoman High
                            Commissioner at Sofia, the chef-lieu of, the
                            Vilayet of Bulgaria. There is no gainsaying
                            the fact that Great Britain bay practically
                            annexed the quondam Ottoman province of
                            Egypt; no one would contest that point. But
                            to say, as Midhat Bey pretends, that Mukhtar
                            Pacha is simply a private gentleman resident
                            in Egypt is on a par with many other peculiarities
                            in this Land of Paradox. If I remember
                            rightly, l think Midhat Bey is a son of the
                            Grand Vizier of name. He had to flee
                            Turkey for political reasons or opinions.
                            It is this sort of fugitives who constitute
                            what is known u the famous Young Turkey
                            Party, a body of political opinion which
                            sounds very grand and patriotic in newspaper
                            sounds, but which really means very little.
                            I am afraid I have abused your hospitality,
                            but this is a matter of general interest,
                            particularly ,at' the present moment, when
                            a serious crisis has been so happily avoided

                            Quidnuncs have accused of being the prime

                        <p>Dear Sir, — Sir John Lubbock, some years ago, prepared
                            a list of what he considered the best hundred
                            classics. The publication is now out of print. As many
                            persons are so occupied with their business pursuits
                            that they have no time to consult public libraries, it was
                            suggested that a movement be set on foot to supply
                            this class with a model library; Accordingly, a library
                            Committee in association with noted scholars, are preparing
                            a library of forty volumes; about 1/4 of the books.
                            are special translations from Oriental literature.</p>
                        <p>As a member of the advisory Committee, I have no
                            hesitation it commending this collection for just what it
                            claims to be. A model library of complete classics prefaced
                            with reviews by famous scholars.</p>

                            and they to submit you a confidential proposition. If
                            you will sign and return the enclosed card information
                            regarding this proposal will be furnished.</p>
                        <p>Very faithfully yours,</p>
                        <p>(Lithographed signature) Justin McCarthy.</p>
                        <p>The cards, I may say. were addressed-to
                            Justin McCarthy, Alexandria. The circulars
                            were followed in each* ease by the visit of a
                            gentleman of ingratiating manners,who claimed
                            to represent “The Colonial Press,” which
                            was publishing this collection of books, and
                            asserted that he was an American citizen. His
                            cards bore the name of “William F. Bebell.”
                            He persuaded a number of persons to sign a
                            contract guaranteeing payment of £22 for the
                            forty volumes if after examination on delivery
                            they proved satisfactory. Some six weeks later
                            the books came and a good few of those who
                            had signed the contract paid first and examined
                            the books later. Others examined and
                            returned them; other, again, refused to return
                            them till they had satisfied their curiosity as
                            to certain facts, namely,</p>
                        <p>1. Could Mr. Bebell prove that he was the accredited
                        agent of the Colonel Press?</p>
                        <p>Did the Colonial Press of London, and the 5th Avenue,
                        New York, exist? No London Directory contained the name.</p>
                        <cb n="2"/>
                        <p>3. Why the books were not entered at Sationers' Hall.</p>
                        <p>4. Who were these literary committee men?
                            Timothy Dwight we know, and Justin McCarthy
                            we know, but who are Paul Vandyke
                            and Richard Henry Stoddard? “Who’s Who”
                            for <!--illeg--> contains the names of Charles Warren
                            Stoddard and Henry Van Dyke, American
                            litterateurs ; Paul and Richard Henry are unquestioned.</p>
                        <p>Until these points are cleared up I advise
                            those who have the books .to wait or to return
                            them. I have seen a good few of the forty
                            volumes. They are well printed but their
                            binding, to put it mildly, does not coincide
                            with the samples produced by Mr. Bebell. This
                            gentleman produced a number of sample plates,
                            engravings, etchings, etc., specimens of what
                            the volumes would contain. But to these specimens,
                            I hear, but few additional plates or
                            etchings are added, and I felt some surprise
                            when I discovered that British Orators (Vol.II.)
                            contained: 1. a good photogravure of Gladstone ;
                            2. an engraving of the god Faunus ;
                            3. an engraving of a page of a medieval hour
                            book, and no other illustrations.</p>
                        <p>As for the text the volume and a half taken
                            up by “Persian Literature” gave prodigious
                            extracts from well-known, one might say
                            “stock,” translations of the Shah Nameh, with
                            Fitzgerald’s, Rubaijat, etc. Snoh posts as
                            Attar and Jami were unmentioned. There
                            was something bald and <!--illeg--> in the
                            translation of Cicero, the notes on the text
                            were alarmingly brief and unelucidative. Personally
                            I doubt the wisdom of paying £22
                            for 40 volumes that contain well-known passages
                            from most literatures served up in a
                            cheap binding and unsupported by any really
                            valuable commentaries and notes bearing the
                            names of great scholars. It is all very well
                            to publish short prefaces with names like
                            Epiphanius Sludge below them but I require
                            something more, for, any way, who are most
                            of these learned preface writers?</p>
                        <p>I hoep that Mr. Bebell will be able to
                        answer the questions given above in a
                        satisfactory manner. If he can well and good ; 
                        the Colonial Press has made a good margain.-</p>

                    <head>RHODESIAN COTTON CULTIVATION.</head>
                    <p>While all interested in the industrial and
                        economic development of Rhodesia will have
                        gladly learned that the cotton produced there
                        is fetching as much as 8d. per lb. at Liverpool,
                        almost a fancy price, it remains to be
                        shown whether the grower receives adequate
                        reward for embarking in the risky venture.
                        The cost of transport is so inordinately high
                        that it would be futile to base any calculations
                        on the profits scorning to American,
                        Egyptian, and Indian growers when selling
                        at even lower prices. It is certain, of course,
                        that hr the not very distant future, freight
                        rates from the Rhodesian cotton fields, both
                        railway and oceanic. will be materially diminished.
                        But in the meanwhile it will sorely
                        discourage the local cultivators if they find
                        that every pound placed on the home market
                        represents a substantial loss. The majority
                        are by no means over-supplied with capital ;
                        most of what they possessed when they started
                        as Rhodesian farmers has been spent on
                        plant, house building, and maintenance expenses.
                        They are not in a position, consequently,
                        to trust to the future to bring them
                        compensation for recurrent losses on cotton
                        Cultivation. There is, happily, a possibility
                        that the late enhancement of saleable value
                        at Liverpool is sufficient to safeguard against
                        loss, if not to ensure some profit. If that be
                        the case, Rhodesia will be on the high road
                        to the agricultural prosperity which the great
                        statesman from whom it takes its name is to
                        have foreseen.”</p>

                    <p>To those in this twentieth century, who, in
                        their pride and boasted wisdom, are prone to
                        feelings of pity for the people who were obliged
                        to exist, from force of circumstances, in the
                        days of long ago, it should be something of a
                        revelation to read of the conditions in the
                        world as they existed 6,000 years ago as described

                    <p>In this book, strange to say, we read that
                        men’s thoughts were similar in character to
                        the thoughts of the wise men of to-day. “Social
                        life was very similar Men were taught to treat

                        (Monogamy prevailed at that time ); there are
                        terse statements as to the generosity of men,
                        as to the scowling boor,the irrepressible talkers
                        of every station of life, the bard working'
                        clerk and the tradesmen who give credit when
                        money is tight It is remarkable that long
                        before a King in Israel had discovered that all
                        human things were vanity and vexation of
                        spirit, this ancient vizier Ptah-hotep declared
                        that he had done all manner of good to those
                        over whom he ruled and yet “that there was
                        no satisfaction therein.”</p>
                    <p>Curiously enough there are few references
                        to the worship of the soda (so innumerable in
                        Egypt) but “the god” is constantly spoken of
                        as if each man in applying the instruction
                        must deal with his own special divinity, “whoever
                        he was.” The ethical system of both these
                        writers seems to have been based on the maxim;
                        “Be good and you will be happy.”</p>
                    <p>The statement that the ancient Vizier used
                        that “he had done all manner of good to those
                        over whom he ruled and yet that there was no
                        satisfaction therein” is used to-day in just the
                        same spirit as 6,000 years ago. To-day officials
                        will use the same sentiment in excusing their
                        carelessness or their failure to enforce laws,
                        that there is no appreciation of their efforts.
                        That the people after all do not know what
                        they want, or what is best for them. That the
                        man who tries is criticized as well as is the
                        man who lets things glide along as they will.</p>
                    <p>The man who holds office as well as the man
                        in private life most realize that which in his
                        judgment seems right and trust in the future
                        for his reward or in the satisfaction of having
                        done his duty, and there is much of peace in
                        the thought of duty well done.</p>

                    <p>L'Affaire Zalzal.</p>
                    <p>On se rappelle que cet employé des chemins
                        de 1er fut victime d’an accident en se précipitant
                        héroïquement au secours de trois femmes
                        qui allaient être écrasées par un train.</p>
                    <p>Il y perdit son bras droit. La compagnie le
                        garda à son service, mais ne lui accorda pas
                        d’indemnité. Ce que voyant Zalzal lui intenta
                        un procès et obtint L.E. 300 à titre de dommages-intérèts.</p>
                    <p>Depuis, la compagnie a congédié cet employé
                        sons prétexte de suppresion d’emploi. D’où
                        nouveau procès de Zilzal pour réclamer l’allocation
                        de la pension spéciale prévue par l’art.
                        35 de la loi du 21 juin 1895. Le tribunal a
                        débouté le demandeur parce que l’accident
                        dont il a été victime ne l’a pas mis dans l’impossibilitié
                        de servir puisqu’il a continué son
                        service à la compagnie jusqu'en 1904, date de
                        son licenciement,, et que, d’autre part, ayant
                        été indemnisé pour l’accident, il ne pouvait
                        cumuler avec cette indemnité le bénéfice de la
                        pension spéciale.</p>
                    <p>Eu appel, ce jugement vieut d'être confirmé.</p>

                    <byline>BY WILFRED SCAWEN BLUNT.</byline>
                    <p>(From the "Manchester Guardian.")</p>
                    <p>Lord Cromer’s Egyptian Reports always
                        remind me, if I may say it without irreverence,
                        of the first chapters of the Book of Genesis,
                        where we read that “the Lord saw everything
                        that he had made, and he saw that it was very
                        good.” They are the annual record of a creation
                        of material progress set down with dignified
                        satisfaction by its creator, and as such
                        they have acquired in England an imposing
                        authority, all the more generously accorded
                        because the glorification of his work is also a
                        glorification of England’s. With this it would
                        be churlish to quarrel; nor do I propose to say
                        a word here in disparagement of that part of
                        his achievement which is material. Lord Cromer
                        deserves all the credit he claims for this
                        and more, for it is really to himself alone, to
                        his own personal qualities of patience, prudence,
                        and extreme financial sobriety, that the
                        result is due. Indeed, it is so much the case
                        that the chief peril Egypt now runs economically
                        is the difficulty there will be one day of
                        finding for him a successor. Under a more
                        ambitious administrator Egyptian finance
                        might easily become deranged and the welfare
                        of native agriculture, the true basis of Egyptian
                        prosperity, be sacrificed to industrial enterprise
                        and foreign adventure. It is not as an administrator
                        but only as a statesman that I shall
                        venture a criticism.</p>
                    <p>Regarded politically, Lord Cromer’s work
                        has in reality been far from a success, and I
                        believe it to be largely his fault that we new
                        find ourselves involved in trouble not only
                        with the Ottoman Sultan but with Mahometan
                        feeling in Egypt, and, if the thing goes much
                        farther, perhaps throughout the world. I will
                        explain this in detail. Lord Cromer, when he
                        arrived at Capo in September, 1883, was given
                        for his task the carrying out of the policy
                        sketched for him by Lord Dufferin in his celebrated
                        despatch of that year. It was a programme
                        of disinterested work for England and
                        of political reconstruction for Egypt. He was
                        to re establish some form of self-government
                        and to initiate certain reforms, it was, however,
                        no part of the plan to retain Egypt for
                        England, and it was especially explained that
                        the Indian expedient of governing through a
                        ”masterly Resident” was not within the limits
                        of his commission. Outside this programme he
                        had carte blanche to use the instruments and
                        means he might choose. His mistake, and it
                        has proved to have been a vital one, was made
                        at the outset It was a curious one for a man
                        so intelligent, and knowing Egypt already, to
                        have made. The reforms he had to introduce
                        were, above all things, to protect the native
                        fellaheen from the Turkish pashas, who had for
                        a century been plundering them, and whose
                        interest it was to continue existing abuses.
                        Self-government too, in any form of free
                        institutions could only be made with hope of
                        success through that party in Egypt whose
                        programme such institutions been. Nevertheless
                        he chose for the instruments of his
                        policy precisely the reactionary Turkish pashas
                        and excluded rigorously every native Egyptian
                        reformer. That this was so of his own free
                        choice I have personal knowledge.</p>
                    <p>On the 26th of September, 1883, I find in
                        my diary that being for a few days in Egypt
                        on my way to India, I discussed the whole
                        political situation with Sir Evelyn Baring, as
                        he then was. The extract stands as follows :—
                        After describing him as one “who imposes on
                        one a good deal as a man of sense and integrity,
                        and without being exactly brilliant seems capable
                        of original ideas,” it goes on :—</p>
                    <p>"He asked me my view about the state of
                        things in Egypt. I gave him a sketch of the
                        position two years ago, of the parties in the
                        Azhar, and of the manner in which the Liberal
                        party there had been alienated from England,
                        and the triumph of the fanatical party on the
                        restoration of the Khedive. He seemed to agree
                        with me that a reform should have a religions
                        basis, hot would not admit that the Turks and
                        Circassians were incapable of this. He explained
                        that he had come to Egypt originally as re
                        presentative of the Bondholders, and that he
                        had always held the interests of these and of
                        Egypt to be identical The control had, in fact,
                        done great good. While controller he had always
                        refused to act in too close concert with the
                        Consul General, as he held himself to be, above
                        all things, one of the Khedive’s officers. He had
                        found that by showing the chief personages,
                        even Riaz, that he only wished their good he
                        had generally succeeded in making them do as
                        he wanted. I objected that he bad not prevented
                        Riaz’s cruelty—his arbitrary arrests and persecutions.
                        He said that Riaz’s fault was that he saw
                        things too ‘couleur de rose.’ He would not believe
                        that neglecting the just claims of the
                        soldiers would raise a rebellion. With regard to
                        finance, which we next discoursed, I was glad to
                        find that Baring held sound views on the point
                        of the debts of the fellahin. He was for settling
                        them down to date and restoring the
                        old state of the law and making mortgage
                        impossible. He quite understood the evils
                        attending the mixed tribunals as similar to
                        those of the civil courts in India. He said
                        that they should be his first care. He did not,
                        however, seem at all helpful of Egypt’s solvency.
                        With the introduction of a new system
                        of government and the abolition of the Kurbash.
                        the financial prospect was a very doubtful one
                        He talked about the elections to the Assembly
                        (they had just been concluded under circumstances
                        of police superintendence, which made
                        free voting impossible) as a novel experiment,
                        which, if it had not exceeded this time might
                        another. I explained to him that there was no
                        <cb n="2"/>
                        such novelty in it, that two years ago there had
                        been elections which had succeeded, and that
                        if these last had not it was because all liberty
                        had been crushed. How could a man vote independently
                        as long as there was nothing in
                        the nature of ‘habeas corpus’ to secure him
                        from arbitrary arrest? These arbitrary arrests
                        were, with the debts, the reason of the rebellion,
                        and would be again. He promised to have this
                        provided against, though perhaps habeas
                        corpus was too much to give all at once. What
                        the country wanted above all was order and
                        peace. I asked him if he did not think of
                        restoring the National party, at least the
                        civilian exiles, but he said this was quite out
                        of the question. They could not restore the
                        National party without another revolution, and
                        another revolution could not be. He asked me
                        whether the Nationalists had do leader in
                        Egypt. I said none that I knew of; the reign
                        of terror had crashed all courage out of the
                        few who had not been exiled or imprisoned.
                        In conclusion he said that as far as he was
                        concerned he should support the Khedive and
                        the Circassians with all his power.”</p>
                    <p>This conversation is very interesting now,
                        especially in view of what Lord Cromer writes
                        in his present Report complaining of the
                        Turkish reaction and eulogising that great
                        native reformer and religious teacher the late
                        Grand Mufti, Sheykh Mohammed Abdu, who
                        represented all his life the opposite pole of
                        thought to these, and who, after having spent
                        some months in prison at Cairo, bad in 1883
                        just been sent from Egypt into exile by the
                        re established Turkish Ministry, and who
                        remained in obscurity after his return daring
                        the next seventeen years of Lord Cromer's
                        regime, Of the value of this great reformer,
                        by far the ablest at d most enlightened
                        Mahometan in Egypt, Lord Cromer says not
                        a word too much, yet it is a fact that he and
                        his political disciples were ruthlessly proscribed
                        during all these years, and it was only
                        in 1900, when the Sheykh’s valuable life was
                        nearing its close. that for the first time lord
                        Cromer discovered his merit. The whole
                        National party and party of reform of 1883
                        had been ruled out by Lord Cromer’s political
                        unwisdom. This was Lord Cromer’s first and
                        greatest mistake, the consequences of which he
                        feels to-day. Twenty-three years of the absolute
                        repression of all independent thought of a
                        liberal political kind and the exclusion of
                        courageous men from responsible office have
                        thrown all lead in patriotic thought in Egypt
                        into the hands of the reaction.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Blunt concludes as follows:-</p>
                    <p>From what I have said, therefore, it will be
                        understood that while accepting as a candid
                        statement of fact all that Lord Cromer says
                        in Report on financial, economical, and
                        other material successes, I cannot regard as
                        equally candid his few political remarks or the
                        inferences be would draw of the content
                        prevailing in Mahometan Egypt with English
                        rule. I know the contrary to be the troth.
                        Politically, Lord Cromer is a diplomatist, and
                        tells only the of truth he thinks it expedient
                        the public at home should hear. He
                        tells us nothing of the growing race estrangement,
                        so lamentable a feature of his régime,
                        analogous to the race estrangement in India,
                        and due to the same causes. Thirty years ago
                        Englishmen were popular with all classes in
                        Egypt, and they were respected as kindly
                        strangers and without ill-designs. Now they
                        are both disliked and despised. The material
                        progress made by the country under English
                        occupation is not associated in the native mind
                        with a need of gratitude, any more than it
                        used to be in Lombardy under Austrian role,
                        or is in Ireland, it there be any progress,
                        under English rule to day. Why should it ?
                        All know in Egypt that we are not there now
                        for philanthropy, but for pay and political
                        purpose Ou the other hand, the Sultan, who
                        was formerly disregarded, has assumed some-
                        what heroic proportions in Egyptian eyes. His
                        project of a Hedjaz railway is popular. He is
                        looked upon as defender of their faith. Again,
                        how should it be otherwise 1 I should trust
                        L :rd Cromer’s Reports more implicitly if he
                        told os without concealment of these things.
                        But he keeps them apparently for his private
                        letters, as other diplomatists do, addressed to
                        the Secretary of State. His optimism is for the
                        public,</p>

                    <p>Extensive works are being carried on at Port Said by the
                    Suez Canal Company. It is expected that within the next five
                    years the habrour will have been increased to more than twice
                    its present size. An extensive basin is being dredged on the
                    eastern side of the Canal, for the use of colliers and
                    petroleum ships. When this is completed, the Abbas Basin
                    (on the western side now occupied by the colliers) will be available
                    for vessels to load or discharge general cargo in connection
                    with the interior of Egypt. At the same time,
                    the Cherif Basin, on the western side, is being doubled in size
                    and deepened to 30 feet. Wharves and warehouses will be constructed
                    without delay. The Suez Canal Company's workshops will be removed
                    to the eastern side of the harbour, where accommodation will be
                    made for a new village European and Arab workmen, and the tract of
                    land at present occupied by the workshops will be dredged
                    away and deepend, making a new large basin of the arsenal with
                    wharves reaching up to the railway station.</p>

                    <p>The body of a man who lived more than
                        seven thousand years ago, the oldest man of
                        whom we have any record, is now reposing in
                        the Egyptian gallery of the British Museum.
                        He was found on the banks of the Nile in
                        Upper Egypt. It is not known just how loDg
                        ago he lived, that is, to a year or a day, but
                        his antiquity may be inferred from the statements
                        of the antiquarians that he considerably
                        antedates Menes, who ruled in Egypt five
                        thousand years before Christ, so that, compared

                    <p>This patriarch of the race was buried in a
                        neolithic grave with his neolithic pots and
                        kettles and the neolithic flints with which he
                        procured subsistence carefully arranged about
                        him. There are no inscriptions on these
                        utensils, no epitaph on his gravestone, for he
                        lived long before the invention of writing.
                        This patriarch, older than the oldest mummied

                        heart of the world’s bustling metropolis, was
                        ignorant of the conditions, impulses or incentives
                        of modern life. He knew nothing of books,
                        of business, of polities, or organized labour, of
                        amusements, of society, of money. But was this
                        neolithic man less happy thin we are who
                        know of all these things? Knowing nothing of
                        books, he was spared much "weariness of the
                        flesh.” Knowing nothing of business, he was
                        spared its worriment and possible bankruptcy
                        and defalcation. Knowing nothing of politics,
                        he knew nothing of industrial life, he was not
                        concerned about hours or pay, or strikes.
                        Knowing nothing about theatres, he was not
                        bored with bad performances nor exasperated
                        with extortionate prices. Knowing nothing of
                        society, ha did not have to listen to its small
                        talk, follow fashions, or rain his digestion,
                        Knowing nothing of money and having no
                        need of it, for all the world about him was
                        his, he ought to have been ideally happy.</p>
                    <p>The apostles of gloom will say that the
                        neolithic men was happy, much happier than
                        we, with all our vaunted knowledge and refinement. They will say he lived when the world
                        was fresh and in its teens and man’s hand and
                        the "tooth of time” had not marred the beauty
                        of the new creation, The more dispassionate
                        verdict will be that while the neolithic man escaped
                        many of the vexations and troubles of
                        this age, he knew nothing of its peculiar
                        pleasures, and that if it were possible to count
                        up his days of unalloyed happiness it would
                        be discovered that he had no more of them
                        than the average man of this age. The venerable
                        relic of neolithic days had the toothache,
                        no doubt, but no dentist to relieve it. His
                        eyesight grew dim and he had no spectacles.
                        There are many robbers and murderers in
                        Alexandria but life and property are safer here
                        than they were on the banks of the Nile in the
                        good old prehistoric times. Then nearly every
                        man distrusted everybody else and had to be
                        continually on guard against unexpected,
                        hidden foes. There cannot be much happiness
                        where life is fall of fear.</p>

                    <head>DRINK IN EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>Throughout the past year, special attention
                        has been paid to this important question. Out
                        of 466 applications for licences to sell alcoholic
                        drinks, which were forwarded and strongly
                        recommended by Moudirs and Commandants,
                        no less than 370 were refused. The majority of
                        the establishments for which licences were
                        finally granted are those which have existed
                        for a considerable time, the proprietors of which
                        have died or retired. Even in these oases new
                        licences have not been granted until an exhaustive
                        investigation showed that each establishment
                        was really indispensable to a majority of
                        Europeans residing in the vicinity. As regards
                        establishments already in existence, it has until
                        recently been found impossible to place complete
                        reliance on the statistics hitherto furnish-
                        ed, A year’s inspection and control have
                        resulted in the discovery of many small shops
                        which had not previously been recognized.
                        Consequently, the apparent decrease is not so
                        great as would have been supposed—a reduction
                        of 100 licenced and 178 unlicensed being
                        all that the figures show. Arrangements have
                        been made with the Railway Department to
                        prohibit drinking shops, under the name of
                        buffets, at any except the important stations
                        and, as the contract of each falls iD, it will not
                        be renewed unless the importance of the
                        station renders the existence of a buffet indispensible.
                        It mast not be forgotten that the
                        existing law does not deal with the sale of drink
                        by bottle or ease, so that the petty grocers and
                        shopkeepers who sell wine and spirits under
                        these conditions entirely escape control.
                        Amongst the labouring classes in the villages
                        there appears to be little or no drinking. People
                        who live in the provinces rarely see a drunken
                        m >n. In the provincial towns, however, there
                        is a certain amount of intoxication, though
                        still, happily, not much. It has become the
                        fashion of late years for the wealthier land-
                        owners and notables to keep a supply of wine
                        and spirits in their houses, mainly, I believe,
                        for purposes of entertainment. (From Lord
                        Cromer’s Report).</p>

                    <p>The 1st Battalion King’s Own Light Infantry,
                        which has been placed under orders at
                        Gibraltar to hold itself in readiness for service
                        in Egypt, is commanded by Lieutenant
                        Colonel R. C. Money, with Major L A. H.
                        Hamilton second in command. It numbers
                        about 850 of all ranks, and would have moved
                        from Gibraltar to South Africa in November
                        next.. It was never in Egypt, nor in South
                        Africa. The 2nd Battalion, Sheffield, it may
                        be recalled, served with much distinction in
                        the South African War aDd not a few of its
                        veterans are with the 1st Battalion now.</p>
                    <p>My statement that the U Battery Royal Horse Artillery
                    would bring out the new 13-pounder gun to Egypt is confirmed.
                    The guns will be increased from four to six owing to the battery
                    going out on active service conditions.</p>

                        who took service with the Khedive’s forces in
                        1884, and who was afterwards A. A.G. at Cairo,
                        has just been appointed to the command of the
                        Standerton Sub District, Transvaal, with the
                        temporary rank of Brigadier General. His
                        services in the Sudan aDd Uganda, both in
                        peace and war, are too well known to dilate
                        upon here. His many friends in Egypt will be
                        pleased to learn of his well-deserved advancement.</p>
                    <p>Captain N. W. Gardner, 2nd Battalion

                        with the Egyptian Army, his name having
                        been on the list of candidates for a considerable
                        time. Captain Gardner has worn the
                        busby of the Fusiliers since January, 1899,
                        and he was promoted captain in September,
                        1604. He accompanied the Fusiliers when
                        they marched to the "Roof of the World” in

                        Black Watch in June, 1899, from the Militia,
                        and a few months later went with the 2nd

                    <p>A BROKEN-DOWN SYSTEM.</p>
                    <p>This is a condition (or disease) to which doctors give many names, but which few
                        of them really understand. It it simply weakness—a break-down, as it were, of
                        the vital forces that sustain the system. No matter what may be its causes (for
                        they are almost numberless), its symptoms are much the same; the more prominent
                        being sleeplessness, sense of prostration or weariness, depression of spirits
                        and want of energy for all the ordinary affairs of life. Now, what alone is
                        absolutely essential in all such cases is increased vitality—vigour--</p>
                    <p>VITAL STRENGTH &amp; ENERGY</p>
                    <p>to throw off these morbid feelings, and experience proves that as night succeeds
                        the day this may be more certainly secured by a course of the celebrated

                        "used up,” and valueless. This wonderful medicament is purely vegetable and
                        innocuous, is agreeable to the taste —suitable for all constitutions and
                        conditions, in either sex; and it is difficult to imagine a case of disease or
                        derangement, whose main features are those of debility, that will not be
                        speedily and permanently benefited by this never-failing recuperative essence,
