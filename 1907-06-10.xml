                <head>INDIAN UNREST</head>
                    <p>The news from India for some weeks past has been read by those who take an interest in the welfare of that country with mingled feel ings. It is distressing to observe that a part of the result of the policy which has tried to give Western instruction to all who were willing to receive it, has been to create a class of writers and speakers whose one aim is to overthrow the Government that has marie their existence possible. It is distressing also to see that the class of writers and speakers just described have attained to a considerable influence over a portion of the Hindu population. On the other hand, there is some satisfaction to be derived from the fact that the Indian Govern-ment has not by the knowledge that these conditions exist been scared into any hurried departure from its jdeals or from its methods of government, and that even when the preach-ers of anarchical doctrines have led their hearers into excess there has been no rush into repression, but only a moderate and sparing use of powers, which the Government has long possessed but rarely used, of removing to safe places the inciters to disorder. The recent steps taken by the Indian Government, happily with the entire concurrence of the Government at home, have had perhaps a more salutary effect than might have been produced by a wholesale display of force or by a severe course of repression The campaign of mis-representation and invective, accompanied by demonstration - of disloyalty and attempt, at terrorism, together with the organiz-
                        
                        ed boycott, which began in Bengal has made its way into the Punjab, to the great disgust of the loyal Mohammedans. The removal of a few leaders to distant places of seclusion has had a quieting effect and the deportation of another agitator from Amritsar, announced last week, will help to convince the others that their occupation is not for ever to he tolerated. The Circular sent by the Indian Government to local Governments pointing out the measures that may reasonably be taken to prevent schools and colleges from being nur-series of sedition seems also to he a step in the direction of the restoration of tranquility. Very welcome, too, is the resolution reported this morning empowering local Governments to pro-secute newspapers that publish articles inciting to disturbance. The natural tendency of ob-servers at home in presence of sedition in India is to urge the Indian Government to put it down with a strong hand. That is a tendency to which we do not wish to yield. The Indian Government is better informed than any observers here, and is more keenly aware of the possible consequence of its action than can be any critics in this country. It is not only informed hut responsible. Accordingly the duty of good citizens in this country is to uphold the Indian Government in every possible way, even to the extent of remembering that every human Government is liable to make mistakes and therefore of abstaining from microscopic criticism of its action.
                        
                        One of the chief difficulties of any Govern-ment, which like that of Great Britain is organised upon democratic principles in so far that it is responsible to a Parliament, is that in dealing with the affairs of distant countries, specially of countries of different society and speech from our own, there is always the possibility of criticisms made upon it in the ordinary course of Parliamentary life being misinterpreted at the other end of the tele-graph wire. If one party is in office, and the other party, being in opposition, discusses freely the executive or other acta of the Government, persons at a distance may infer that this country is divided and therefore has no strong will. Such an impression, if it should be produced or encouraged in India just now, would be most unfortunate. We venture to hope that it will not be produced. It is fortu nate that the Viceroy of India appointed by the late Government has the confidence of their successors. It is fortunate that the res-ponsibility to Parliament is for the government of India is in the hands of Mr. Morley, in whose character and ability both parties have complete confidence. There are, of course, many who do not agree with some of Mr. Morley’s political theories, theories which we have often had occasion to criticise. But Mr. Morley is a worker, a great student, an administrator of more than ordinary power, There is no fear in his case of a failure to grasp the nature of a situation, or of a weakness in decision or in tenacity of purpose. His conduct and that of the Government of India in dealing with the agitation and the disturbances in India will hardly he the subject of criticism from the Opposition. It would, we venture to think, be a misfortune if any embarrassment were caused him by lack of sympathy from among those who are as a rule the supporters of the present Government.
                        
                        The doctrine now taught by some of those Hindus whoa few years ago were represented as the advocates of the gradual introduction of representative methods and a constitutional system into India, is that of overthrow of the British Government as soon as possible, by the plan of passive resistance and of a strike of all natives in Government employ, and if that fails then by conflict. While such a theory is preached in India it appears to us that no Englishman, whatever his theory 'of Govern-ment maybe, can without injuring his country and India, express sympathy with any form of Indian propaganda. In doing so he would be playing with fire. In India it is the class that has had the benefit of European instruc-tion that expresses extreme doctrines, and observers in England should hear in mind that these doctrines are preached to people un accustomed to political debate and still more to that political action which is part of the daily life of the people of this country. Those who would support the Indian Government in measures for restricting the liberty of the Indian Press to spread denunciations of the British administra-tion do so on the ground that the conditions of India are not those of England. Here there are always newspapers on both sides. There is no danger of the cause of law having no expo-nents. But in India the case is very different. Of those who have had a literary training perhaps the pick are in Government employ or in such other employment as is not consistent with their being journalists. But those whose literary instruction has not opened for them a career in the public service are exposed to the temptation, not always resisted, of seeking influence and notoriety by attacks on the Government. In a country where instruction even after many years of Government effort to spread it, is the privilege of a very few, the Government is not only entitled but bound to exercise some supervision to prevent its being misused. No doubt the great powers possessed by a Government like that of India could conceivably be misused. Everyone will admit that in theory. But in practice the character of the Indian Government and its splendid tradition of equity and tolerance7 Are a great guarantee, and to those people in this country who favour the development of self-government in India, as elsewhere, there could be no better guarantee that the Indian Government will not misuse the powers which it possesses for dealing with sedition and disturbance than the character of Mr. Morley. It is not likely that he will err on the side of unnecessary- severity,</p>
