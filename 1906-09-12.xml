                    <head>ISLAM IN LONDON.</head>
                    <p>The great mosque, which is to be erected in London, is to be worthy of the
                        Capital of an Empire, which has more Moslem subjects than any other. The
                        most impressive features of Mr. Chambers' new mosque are the stately dome
                        and the lofty minaret from the circular balcony, near the summit of which
                        the muerrin calls the faithful to prayer. In certain aspects the plan of a
                        mosque bears a not remote resemblance to that of a Christian church. In the
                        design much is left to the taste of the architect, but one thing absolutely
                        necessary is that the worshippers as they pray must have their faces set
                        towards Mecca. So much stress is laid on this matter that when the scheme
                        for the erection of the mosque at Working was in preparation an officer of
                        the Peninsular and Oriental Company actually went down to the spot and took
                        strict bearings by which the architect was ruled. Similar measures will, of
                        course, be taken in this instance. The plan of the mosque which London it
                        about to number amongst its religions buildings will be approximately
                        square. The most sacred part is the recess known as the Mihrab, set in the
                        middle of the wall which the worshippers face. Roughly speaking, it would
                        correspond to the chancel of a Christian church. Next in sacredness is the
                        Mayaura, somewhat equivalent to our nave, which not even Moham- medans may
                        enter unless they are in the. holiest of disposition, and in which are sat
                        the Minbar, or pulpit, and the Dekke, or reading desk, from which the Koran
                        is expounded to the faithful. The Mohamedan service, it may be mentioned,
                        follows no hard and fast rule. It consists mainly of extempore prayers
                        supplemented by the reading and exposition of the Koran by the "learned men"
                        of the community. There are, of course, no seats in the interior, and each
                        worshipper kneels on the carpet which be brings with him for the purpose and
                        which may vary greatly in splendor or cost according to the rank or wealth
                        of the worshipper. As is also well- known, a Mohamedan mast divest himself
                        of his footwear and wash his feet before entering the building, from which
                        unbelievers ate studiously barred. For the purpose of this feet- washing
                        process, a fountain or reservoir of pure water is provided in the enclosed
                        court which gives entrance to the mosque. Perhaps the best means of giving
                        an idea of the outward appearance of this building is to state that the
                        height of the minaret will roughly correspond to the height of one of the
                        western towers of St. Paul's Cathedral, and that the width of the main
                        façade will be about 30ft. narrower than the western front of St. Paul's as
                        seen from Ludgate hill. There, in point of dimension, the resemblance
                        ceases.</p>

                        to the Throne. The envoy is to point out the great danger of supporting the
                        candidature of either Reshad the prêsent Sultan's eldest nephew, or of the
                        eldest son of the Sultan, Abdul Aziz, who are Liberals. He is also to point
                        out that the candidature of his Majesty's third son is alone desirable in
                        order to prevent revolutionary complications. </p>

                    <dateline>Constantinople, September 11.</dateline>
                    <p>Although it was declared that the Sulten had almost recovered, the
                        specialist, Dr. Berg- mann, has been summoned here for consultation.
                        (Reuter)</p>
                    <p>Referring to the article appearing in our issue of the day before yesterday
                        from the "North German Gazette" under the heading of "The Sultan," a
                        correspondent writes from Cairo as follows : — Why does the "North German
                        Gazette" in writing in praise of the Sultan of Turkey make the ridiculous
                        statements that when he came to the Throne the country was in a state of
                        financial collapse its army badly organized. The letter statement cannot be
                        true. The army at that time was fighting and had been fighting against
                        Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Russia, and Romania; in fact what may be considered
                        the whole Slav race, and though it came out of it beaten, was not without a
                        certain honor. Read Plevna, Brie room, and Kars. The financial collapse was
                        brought about, as is well-known to all readers, by the attempt to westernize
                        the East. Within four years of the termination of the Russo-Turkish war the
                        coun- try was in a healthy, flourishing condition, and the peasants quite
                        contented with their lot, Christians and Moslems working peacefully side by
                        side. But the moment the present Sultan felt himself secure on the throne
                        his grasping character began to make itself felt somehow or other he managed
                        to sequester in so far as was possible the but estates for the benefit of
                        the so-called Civil List, but in reality for his own privy purse. He tamed
                        Yildiz Kiosk into an armed camp and practically kept all his intelligent and
                        honest advisers as prisoners in order to centralize the whole power in his
                        own hands and these actions entailed such enormous expense that all sorts of
                        petty, vexatious, local taxes have from time to time been levied. The so
                        called reforms effected by Abdoul Hamid have been the farming out of tithes,
                        compulsory séquestration of cattle, the draining away of the best blood for
                        the most disgracefully fed, clothed, and looked-after army in the world,
                        except for a few thousands of soldiers around Constantinople who are under
                        the personal supervision of German advisers. The finan- cial condition of
                        the country was improved at the expense of the bond holders and in order
                        that a few of the banks might make good profits, which were styled
                        commissions, on the financial re arrangement by raising new loans at lower
                        rates of interest end paying off the old ones. Railway concessions were
                        granted with kilometric guarantees, such guarantees being again assured by
                        increased internal taxes collected by the contributions indirectes, such
                        concessions being given for personal reasons, whereas the older established
                        companies would bave constructed the lines without guarantees, but refused
                        to grease the palms of a ring of sharks from all the departments. Let the
                        "North German Gazette" point ont one real reform during the thirty years of
                        the Sultan's reign. The agricultural products of the country are not
                        increasing pro rata to the area of undeveloped land for the simple reason
                        that no Turk will cultivate more than is absolutely necessary for a living.
                        The only flourishing lands are those belonging to the rayahs, who, although
                        taxed like their neighbors, are exempt from conscription to an army, of
                        which 20 per cent return to their homes in good health but unfit to resume
                        their labours as cultivators of the soil. To turn to the mining industry.
                        The country abounds minerals, but the opposition against mining, or rather
                        against granting concessions to Europeans, is so great that, with the
                        exception of a few concessions granted by his predecessor or in the early
                        part of his reign, there are hardly any mines opened out, or if there are
                        any they can only be got through the "Honest Broker." The Turkish peasant is
                        a patient, steady, honest man, who is amenable to good government. His great
                        religions favour can be and very often is worked upon to the point of
                        fanaticism by a few narrow minded bigots who act as if they were still
                        living in the early days of the Hejira and not 13 centuries later when other
                        nations and other idea have come to the front Under an enlightened ruler,
                        who would collect around him a few honest patriote inch aa existed at the
                        beginning of the present Sultan's reign, who would raise the country to a
                        standing based on a firm foundation, there is no reason that the Turkish
                        Empire should not stand out before its Western neighbors in an example, and
                        at the same time be the guiding light to Islam in reality, not in name only,
                        as it is at present. None of the Powers desire the disappearance of Turkey
                        aa a nation, but it is time that it understood that it is only draining its
                        beat blood in trying to keep the cock-pit in order. Let them abandon
                        European Turkey by giving them autonomy under the guarantee of all the
                        Powers, and let them commence real reforms under conscientious advisers, in
                        which case Asia Minor would once more become the garden of the world. </p>

                        Agency to extend the penalty, in view of the brutality of the assault. </p>

                    <p>A divorced wife recently took proceedings in the Mehkemeh Sharieh against her
                        husband, claiming her "nafaka." The Mehkemeh ruled that the nafaka should be
                        paid; and as the husband possesses nothing except a house, the Mehkemeh sold
                        it in order to cover the claim of the divorced wife's nafaka. The poor
                        husband being greatly enraged by the judgment attempted to commit suicide by
                        taking draught of phenic acid, and in spite of prompt medical treatment he
                        is in a very precarious state. The German Courts have lately had to consider
                        the question of the validity of a Turkish divorce pronounced in these
                        circumstances : a German subject goes to Constantinople, there becomes a
                        Musulman, and it naturalized as a Turkish subject Constantinople becomes his
                        domicile, and there it no question of naturalization in fraudem legis.
                        Originally married in Germany according to the Lutheran rites, be divorced
                        his wife according to Turkish law, and married again. The Court below laid
                        down a clear principle : the marriage was originally monogamic, and could
                        not be changed by the act of the hatband into a relation which it depended
                        upon his free will to continue or not Court above pat it on a narrower
                        ground. It laid stress on the circumstance that the wife was in German
                        -territory at the time of the alleged pronouncement, and that the "bill of
                        divorce" was sent through the post to Berlin ; the transaction was in part
                        in German territory. </p>

                        <head>GROWTH OF FLOUR IMPORTS.</head>
                        <p>Those of our members who take the trouble to read our monthly article on
                            the Customs returns will have noticed during the past year repeated
                            allusions to the growth of the flour imports. They will also have
                            observed that from time to time we have endeavored to persuada home
                            millers and exporters to examine the position with a view to entering
                            the market. Although was believe our remarks have been the cause of one
                            or two firms opening out here, there is still room for farther
                            enterprise in this direction. The following, table above the total
                            imports into Egypt of floor daring the past five years. </p>
                        <p>1901.. . Kilos. 66.606.938 ... LB. 622.897</p>
                        <p>1902 58.446.073 446.868</p>
                        <p>1903 67.777.970 ... ,, 638.088</p>
                        <p>1904 78 838*91 ... ,, 627.710</p>
                        <p>1905.. . ,, 121.492.087 989.465</p>
                        <p>The following was the average price per 1.000 Kilos c.i.f Alexandria
                            during these five years respectively : — LE. 7.85, LE. 7.79, LE. 7.88,
                            L.E. 7.96, and L.E. 8.14.</p>
                        <p>It will be observed from the above that while the quantity imported has
                            increased, the average price per 1.000 kilos c.i.f. Alexandria has also
                            risen since 1902. Taking for a moment the 1905 figures, we find that ont
                            of fifteen different sources of supply the undermentioned were the five
                            principal ones. </p>

                        <p>Romania ... " 5.018 483 „ 41.110</p>
                        <p>England „ 3.874,694 „ 31.520</p>
                        <p>Other Countries „ 5.975.561 „ 50.190</p>
                        <p>The total kilos were 121.422.087, a total value of L.E. 989.465.</p>
                        <p>The second of the above tables clearly indicate that the bulk of the
                            trade (62.6 %) is in the hands of the French, and that England's share
                            it practically microscopic. It is, however, gratifying to find that the
                            Home Country's shipments have shown a considerable expansion during the
                            past eighteen months, and that an effort is being made to recapture some
                            of the trade formerly held by us. Whereas we were only credited with
                            L.E. 7,811 in 1904, the figures rose to LE. 31,520 during 1905, whilst
                            for the first half of the current year the clearances were veined at
                            about L.E 38,000. There is thus a probability that the returns for 1906
                            may rival those of 1900, when England shipped 8,909,864 kilos= LE.
                            67,628 to Egypt, being the largest quantity ever sent over in any one
                            year. The principle quality of French floor told on this market it the
                            one known as "Soft White,'' the price running from 20 to 21 franca the
                            100 kilograms (220 lbs) f.o.b. Mantilles. The "Hard White" ranges from
                            19 francs to 23 francs the kilo, whilst the lower grades begin at 17/-
                            the kilo. The English floor is sold in sacks of 280 lbs. the usual price
                            being from 21/- to 23/6 per beg c.i.f. Alexandria. The duty payable to
                            the Customs it the ordinary ad valorem one of 8 %, there being alto
                            about ½ % for quay duties if landed at Alexandria. The flour trade is
                            one of the few branches of Egypt's imports which are done on a cash
                            basis so far as the country of origin is concerned. The merchant here as
                            a rule either opens a credit abroad, or pays cash against documents. The
                            bakers end retailers, of course, have credit facilities from the
                            merchants, the usual term running from 30 to 60 days. As far as we can
                            see there are no insuperable difficulties against the sale of English
                            floor in Egypt, if proper steps be taken to introduce and push the same.
                            There is, however, no denying the fact that the trade is a risky one,
                            and that on a falling market the buyers are very apt to find soma excuse
                            for securing a substantial discount, or for refusing delivery. Great
                            care must be taken to deal with reliable men whether as merchants buying
                            for their own account, agents selling on behalf of the miller, or the
                            actual local users. It is perhaps not necessary to mention the
                            importance of providing against any variation in the quality of the
                            shipments. 7 The two main complaints we have received in connection with
                            English floor are (1) the delay in receiving the goods owing to
                            irregular sailings, especially from the Northern ports and (2) the
                            damage done by rats daring transit, in consequence of the bags not being
                            strong enough. With regard to No. 1, the millers are better able to
                            suggest a remedy than the writer, whilst in the case of N°. 2 the answer
                            is obvious. (British Chamber of Commerce.) </p>

                    <head>EGYPTIAN GLASS IMPORTS.</head>
                    <p>According to a bulletin to a by the French Chamber of Commerce at Alexandria,
                        Egypt, the glass trade of the country is quickly increasing, the value
                        imported last year amounting to E140,000, compared with E40,000 in 1892. The
                        rapid increase is owing to a variety of circumstances, chiefly the great
                        influx of Europeans, who do not care to employ the earthenware table
                        utensils so largely used by the natives. There has, however, been a
                        considerable improvement in this respect among the native population, and
                        glass is behing extensively employed for all purposes. Glass ornaments,
                        mostly bracelets, are greatly prized by the native women, while the increase
                        in the use of oil for lighting purposes has given rise to a large demande
                        for glass chimneys, three-fourths of which come from Bohemia and one-fourth
                        from Germany. Bottles for mineral waters are largely imported from England,
                        being delivered in Alexandria at about E1 per gross.</p>
