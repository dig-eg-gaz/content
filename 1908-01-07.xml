                    <p>THE HEDJAZ RAILWAY.</p>
                    <p>The strategic importance of the Hedjaz rail- way in regard to Egypt: is very
                        great and we advise.all interested in this great undertaking to peruse the
                        series of three instructive articles from the Cairo Correspondent of "The
                        Times" on the progress made in the construvtion of the railway from Damascas
                        td Mecca.</p>
                    <p>"The Times" in a leading article on. the subject points out that when it is.
                        completed and connected with the Anatolian Railway by</p>
                    <p>means of the existing system in Sytia and the 'continuationiof the Baghdad
                        'line' as -far as Aleppo, it will be, a strategical factor of the first
                        importance. By means of it the Turkish troops from Constantinople, Asia
                        Minor, and Syria can be transported in a few days into the Arabian peninsula
                        or concentratéed with even greater ease on the frontiers of Egypt without
                        having to, make any part of the journey by sea, an important point for the
                        Sultan, who a fleet but no navy. 'By means of it the Sultan will be able to
                        tighten his grip on the unruly Arab tribes who from time to time. have given
                        him and his predecessors no small 'amount of trouble, and he will be able
                        with much greater effect than at,present to threaten our position on the
                        banks of thé -Nile, should he ever be 20 ill-advised as to wish to do so.
                        Even as it is, unfinshed and unconnécted with the Anatolian line, it has
                        been found useful for the transport of troops to fight the rebels in Yemen
                        and tor strengthening the influcace of the Constantinople Government bver
                        the Beduin tribes. » Another advantage which the Sultan will derive from
                        bridging the distance between the seat of his government and the Holy Cities
                        of Islam is that it will enable him to keép a closer watch over the local
                        magnates of Mecca aud: Medina, whose influence over their fellow-citizens
                        aud whose. tendency to _ regard themselves as semi-independent are. 80
                        little to"his liking that he generally retains some members of their
                        families a$ hostages in Constantinople.</p>
                    <p>The importance which 'Abdal Hamid at- taches to these objects may. /be
                        'measured by the extent to which in the construction of this railway he has
                        .broken through all the old traditions and violated ali the precedents' of
                        Ottoman administration. The history of the undertaking is striking proof
                        that, if pro- phecy is always dangerous, it is doubly danger- ous in dealing
                        with Turkish affairs. Thé cons- truction of the. Hedjaz Railwayhas not been
                        an easy task. Everything needéd for the line has had to be imported from
                        abroad, some of the eouatry through which it passes presents considerable
                        technical. difficultities, and great- est obstacle of all, over long
                        stretches of the line there is no. water to be "found. No one, and
                        especially no. one acquainted, with the corruption and inefficiency which
                        are the chief characteristics of Turkislt administration, believed that a
                        Palace Commission would suc- veed' in laying, as it has already done, 600
                        miles or more' of. well-constructed . railway running" forthe greater part
                        of its length through sand and stone deserts, and is ac- complishing that
                        task at a rate and at a cost which make the line compare very favourably in
                        those respects with similar railways cons- tructed 'under :'European
                        management. Still less was it believed that the management of ° the
                        enterprise would be marked by the absolute honesty to which our
                        Correspondent testifies in common with other competent observers ; and it
                        did not tend to lessen this scepticism that the responsible control of the
                        work was placed in the hands of the man who is believed to have first
                        suggested the idea of biilding the railway, the Sultan's: Second Secretary
                        ahd Chamberlain, the Syrian Izzet Pasha. Much of the credit for the success
                        which has been achieved is undoubtedly due to Meissner Pasha, the. German
                        engineer in charge of the actudlswork of construction, to whom our
                        Correspondent pays a warm tribute. His. energy and techilical skill, his
                        .knowledge and sympathy with. the .Turkish character, and his power of
                        inspiring his subordi- nates with his own enthusiasw have obviously 'been
                        important factors in the progress 6f-the undertaking. The flattering
                        reception he receiv- ed both from the Sultan and from Izzet'Pasha ' _on 'the
                        occasion of his recent visit to Constan- tivople, and still more the
                        comparatively free hand he enjoys in his own department, are -}-sufficient
                        proof that his services are appreciated at Yildiz. "He would, however, be
                        the first to acknowledge that he would have been unable to do what he has
                        done had he not been loyally supported by his employers.</p>
                    <p>It is perhaps even yet too early to. say for certain that the high standards
                        which have hitherto been observed will be maintained to the erid. Moreover,
                        as the railway approaches the Holy 'Gities the Bedouin tribés, who, if not
                        positively friendly, have so far done little or nothing to interfere with
                        the work, may be- cotne alarmed at the menace to their, vested "| interests.
                        The tribes around Mecca and Me- dina depend for their livelihood on hiring
                        camels to the pilgrims, and many. of the magnates in the Holy Cities are
                        interested in the traffic, 'That local feelings of this kind can- not be
                        lightly disregarded is shown by the , trouble which is now being made by
                        people who have property at Jeddah and whose in- dignation was aroused by
                        the decision to choose Rabigh instead of Jiddah as the Red Sea port of the
                        railway. None thé less, we may "| take i¢ as almost certain that the*work
                        wil! be completed, even if not quite so speedily as is now -expected.
                        'Unfortunately, the dis- organization which is already to be noticed in the
                        traffic department makes it only too likely thatthe line, when finished,
                        will not be managed in a way t0 fulfil the expectations of the Musul mans
                        who have so liberally: contributed towards: the cost of building it. The
                        Sultan and Izzet Pasha are evidently mach more anxious to construct the line
                        than to 'see it used in a business-like fashion. We can only hope that these
                        apprehensions will not be justified. We-canhot 'disguise from ourselves that
                        the railway may some day be used to threaten our position in Egypt, and that
                        efforts have béen made to give an anti- British bias to the Pan-Islamic
                        policy which it is means to' further, but we cannot regard without sympathy
                        an enterprise in which our Musulman fellow-subjects 'take auch a keen
                        interest, and which, when, completed, will render it easier for them to
                        fulfil their religious duty by making the pilgrimage to Mecca at : least
                        once in their lives,</p>

                        <p>"LOHENGRIN."</p>
                        <p>Wagner performances sre, one would say, rather out of place in Cairo :
                            the "elect and select" come in late, and leave early, and look rather
                            bored, the rank and file applaud when- ever there is a convenient break
                            in the music. Happily "Lohengrin" is fairly continuous, -but the few
                            opportunities it offers were enthusias- tically seized. I fear that Herr
                            Mottl, had he been conducting, would have led the orchestra to a
                            personal assault on the audience, he cer- tainly would not have
                            tolerated the casual and ill-tuned entrances of late-comers, or the
                            noise and shuffling before the end of each act. Still the andience as a
                            whole seemed to take: the performance of "Lohengrin" as a delicate com-
                            pliment to their taste and powers of apprecia-| J tion, and the
                            applause, though given at inex- cusable moments, during the acta !, was
                            merited.</p>
                        <p>Far the best part of the whole performance was the singing of Mmes Magne
                            and Fierens in thesecond act. Mme Magne was far less constrained than
                            usual: she had - evidently studied the spirit of the music, and
                            unquestionably both in voice and in treatment she revealed it to the
                            full: the middle and more subdued tones of her voice were especially
                            charming, and her bigh notes were pure, faultless and full of 'feeling.
                            And Mme Fier- ens! what a splendid Ortrud! her acting was the last word
                            of realism, and her singing that of a real artiste who knew the music
                            and the meaning of the part past all question. Her gestures, eyes, and
                            voice —and what a fine voice! — expressed every detail and depth of
                            power, passion, hate, cunning and evil triumph.</p>
                        <p>For the rest, M. Valette.was quite good as Tebramund, and M: Wiglio
                            adequate as Henry the Fowler, but they—and this may be said of the
                            chorus also—were hardly in touch with the misic.: it,was not convincing
                            to them : but M. Valette has the makings of a really fine Tebra- mund,
                            his sudden appearance from within the church was perhaps his best
                            moment, he rose. to the situation. M. Soubeyran was yery far' from
                            convincing ; his voice has not the requisite power or résonance, and he
                            takes the music in a species of cadence quite remote from its real
                            movement: his farewell to the Swan was perhaps the only approach to.a
                            success, but.it was too-affected. The orchestra was quite good,
                            especially in the characteristic violin passages which constitute the
                            real 'motif' of the work : but they also inclined to cadences now and.
                            again ; andthe wedding chorus was harried ; it might have been a species
                            of dance, taken as it was. Still the performance as a whole was far
                            better than one might have expected, and the singing of Mmes Magne and
                            Fierens would have been worth hearing anywhere.</p>

                    <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                        January may be a little warmer than the Riviera and possibly not so warm as
                        Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm
                        than many other places in Europe. </p>
                    <p>Many people leave Egypt far too early in the year, for as a rule the weather
                        in April and May is perfect. The warmest place to go to on leaving Egypt is
                        Sicily.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                        sea, and we therefore subjoin a list shewing the time occupied on each of
                        the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>
                    <p>They are as follows:-</p>
                    <cb n="3"/>
                    <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southhampton,
                        London or Liverpool—occupy about 14 days. The short ones are as
                        follows:—</p>

                    <cb n="4"/>
                    <p>The steamers of the P.&amp;O., the Egyptian Mail S.S,. Co., North German
                        Lloyd, Orient, and Messageries Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor,
                        British India, Bibby and Henderson Lines are also excellent, and their
                        steamers are largely patronised by travellers to Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 hours). That to Port Said can now be made without change
                        in 4 ½ hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p>The quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp;O. Brindisi express
                        from Port Said, by the Egyptian Mail S.S. Co., from Alexandria to Marseilles
                        and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna express from Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe. The Egyptian Mail S.S. Co., have
                        also made arrangements whereby luggage can be collected and sent to any
                        address.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail<cb n="6"/> Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis" to Brindisi. One of these
                        leaves Port Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian
                        mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                    <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                        attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats" having
                        been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi.
                        If you are going straight through to England you will find the train waiting
                        at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete
                        arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in
                        London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <head>SICILY.</head>
                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMENA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. <hi rend="italic"
                            >Giardini</hi> is the station at which to alight, and the drive up to
                        Taormina is most delightful, occupying about one hour. In and around the
                        town is much to interest the visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but
                        restored under the Romans. CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of
                        Etna, and here also is a fine Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic
                        remains that are found all over the island, are an endless sources of
                        pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting history, having been a Greek city,
                        which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C. 413, and taken by the Romans in
                        B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb is to be seen. The cathedral
                        was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with about 300,000 inhabitants,
                        is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a delightful climate. Much of
                        interest is to be found in this fine city. <hi rend="italic">The Palazzo
                            Reale</hi> is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of <hi
                            rend="italic">S. Giovannia degli Eremiti</hi> with its picturesque
                        cloisters. The Cathedral, Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal
                        Park are also worth a visit.</p>

                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                            bay—<hi rend="italic">Castellamare</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                            >Sorrento</hi>. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento [you can
                        drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                            <hi rend="italic">City of Flowers</hi> and its surrounding country. In
                        Florence itself the churches and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst
                        the local promenades and excursions should not be omitted. <hi rend="italic"
                            >The Cascine</hi> is the most attractive and fashionable promenade in
                        Florence, whilst the <hi rend="italic">Viale dei Colli</hi>, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to <hi rend="italic">Vallombrosa</hi>, with its <hi
                            rend="italic">Monastery</hi> 3,300 feet above the sea level. This is
                        made first by ordinary train from Florence to <hi rend="italic">St.
                            Ellero</hi>, thence by cog-wheel railway to <hi rend="italic"
                            >Saltino</hi>. The ascent through groves of oaks takes an hour, and most
                        striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; here there is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                        and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                        house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                        and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,

                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo

                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>

                    <head>NORTHERN ITALY (Continued) and The ITALIAN LAKES.</head>
                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea port.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea. No hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from <hi rend="italic">Milan</hi> you make the tour of the
                        beautiful Italian lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza.</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come <hi rend="italic"
                            >Tremezzo</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Cadenabbia</hi>, and <hi rend="italic"
                            >Menaggio</hi> with the prettily-situated town of <hi rend="italic"
                            >Bellaggio</hi> opposite. The walk from <hi rend="italic">Tremezzo</hi>
                        along the shore of the lake to <hi rend="italic">Menaggio</hi> is most
                        enjoyable. A steam tram runs from <hi rend="italic">Menaggio</hi> to <hi
                            rend="italic">Porlezza</hi> on Lake Lugano in three-quarters of an hour,
                        then steamer to Lugano in two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                        hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated on
                        the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San
                        Salvatore, M. de Caprino.and M. Generoso.</p>
                    <p>LOCARNO may be reached by rail from Bellinzona in forty minutes. This pretty
                        town, situated at the top of Lake Maggiore, has a mild climate and is an
                        excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated above the
                        town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings, "Entombment,"
                        by Ciseri, and 'Tho Flight into Egypt," by Bramantion.</p>

                    <p>Many people visit Greece after wintering in Egypt, as it is so easily reached
                        from Alexandria ; the climate in April is charming. The best steamers are
                        those of the Khedivial Mail Co. and the Russian Steam Navigation Co.</p>
                    <p>It is hardly necessary to point out to Tourists the extraordinary interest of
                        a visit to Athens from an artistic, historical and archaelogical point of
                        view, and if possible tourists should average to be in Athens for the
                        Orthodox Easter in order to witness the Good Friday and Easter Eve
                        ceremonies, and to be present at the dancing on the Easter Tuesday festival
                        held at Megara, for which a special train is run from Athens.</p>
                    <p>It is worth while to spend a few days in CORFU on account of the beauty of
                        the scenery. There is also good snipe and quail shooting to be had.</p>
