                    <p>THE HEDJAZ RAILWAY.</p>

                    <p>The strategic importance of the Hedjaz rail- way in regard to Egypt: is very
                        great and we advise.all interested in this great undertaking to peruse the
                        series of three instructive articles from the Cairo Correspondent of “The
                        Times” on the progress made in the construvtion of the railway from Damascas
                        td Mecca.</p>

                    <p>“The Times” in a leading article on. the subject points out that when it is.
                        completed and connected with the Anatolian Railway by</p>

                    <p>means of the existing system in Sytia and the ‘continuationiof the Baghdad
                        ‘line’ as -far as Aleppo, it will be, a strategical factor of the first
                        importance. By means of it the Turkish troops from Constantinople, Asia
                        Minor, and Syria can be transported in a few days into the Arabian peninsula
                        or concentratéed with even greater ease on the frontiers of Egypt without
                        having to, make any part of the journey by sea, an important point for the
                        Sultan, who a fleet but no navy. ‘By means of it the Sultan will be able to
                        tighten his grip on the unruly Arab tribes who from time to time. have given
                        him and his predecessors no small ‘amount of trouble, and he will be able
                        with much greater effect than at,present to threaten our position on the
                        banks of thé -Nile, should he ever be 20 ill-advised as to wish to do so.
                        Even as it is, unfinshed and unconnécted with the Anatolian line, it has
                        been found useful for the transport of troops to fight the rebels in Yemen
                        and tor strengthening the influcace of the Constantinople Government bver
                        the Beduin tribes. » Another advantage which the Sultan will derive from
                        bridging the distance between the seat of his government and the Holy Cities
                        of Islam is that it will enable him to keép a closer watch over the local
                        magnates of Mecca aud: Medina, whose influence over their fellow-citizens
                        aud whose. tendency to _ regard themselves as semi-independent are. 80
                        little to“his liking that he generally retains some members of their
                        families a$ hostages in Constantinople.</p>

                    <p>The importance which ‘Abdal Hamid at- taches to these objects may. /be
                        ‘measured by the extent to which in the construction of this railway he has
                        .broken through all the old traditions and violated ali the precedents’ of
                        Ottoman administration. The history of the undertaking is striking proof
                        that, if pro- phecy is always dangerous, it is doubly danger- ous in dealing
                        with Turkish affairs. Thé cons- truction of the. Hedjaz Railwayhas not been
                        an easy task. Everything needéd for the line has had to be imported from
                        abroad, some of the eouatry through which it passes presents considerable
                        technical. difficultities, and great- est obstacle of all, over long
                        stretches of the line there is no. water to be “found. No one, and
                        especially no. one acquainted, with the corruption and inefficiency which
                        are the chief characteristics of Turkislt administration, believed that a
                        Palace Commission would suc- veed’ in laying, as it has already done, 600
                        miles or more’ of. well-constructed . railway running” forthe greater part
                        of its length through sand and stone deserts, and is ac- complishing that
                        task at a rate and at a cost which make the line compare very favourably in
                        those respects with similar railways cons- tructed ‘under :‘European
                        management. Still less was it believed that the management of ° the
                        enterprise would be marked by the absolute honesty to which our
                        Correspondent testifies in common with other competent observers ; and it
                        did not tend to lessen this scepticism that the responsible control of the
                        work was placed in the hands of the man who is believed to have first
                        suggested the idea of biilding the railway, the Sultan’s: Second Secretary
                        ahd Chamberlain, the Syrian Izzet Pasha. Much of the credit for the success
                        which has been achieved is undoubtedly due to Meissner Pasha, the. German
                        engineer in charge of the actudlswork of construction, to whom our
                        Correspondent pays a warm tribute. His. energy and techilical skill, his
                        .knowledge and sympathy with. the .Turkish character, and his power of
                        inspiring his subordi- nates with his own enthusiasw have obviously ‘been
                        important factors in the progress 6f-the undertaking. The flattering
                        reception he receiv- ed both from the Sultan and from Izzet’Pasha ‘ _on ‘the
                        occasion of his recent visit to Constan- tivople, and still more the
                        comparatively free hand he enjoys in his own department, are -}-sufficient
                        proof that his services are appreciated at Yildiz. “He would, however, be
                        the first to acknowledge that he would have been unable to do what he has
                        done had he not been loyally supported by his employers.</p>

                    <p>It is perhaps even yet too early to. say for certain that the high standards
                        which have hitherto been observed will be maintained to the erid. Moreover,
                        as the railway approaches the Holy ‘Gities the Bedouin tribés, who, if not
                        positively friendly, have so far done little or nothing to interfere with
                        the work, may be- cotne alarmed at the menace to their, vested “| interests.
                        The tribes around Mecca and Me- dina depend for their livelihood on hiring
                        camels to the pilgrims, and many. of the magnates in the Holy Cities are
                        interested in the traffic, ‘That local feelings of this kind can- not be
                        lightly disregarded is shown by the , trouble which is now being made by
                        people who have property at Jeddah and whose in- dignation was aroused by
                        the decision to choose Rabigh instead of Jiddah as the Red Sea port of the
                        railway. None thé less, we may “| take i¢ as almost certain that the*work
                        wil! be completed, even if not quite so speedily as is now -expected.
                        ‘Unfortunately, the dis- organization which is already to be noticed in the
                        traffic department makes it only too likely thatthe line, when finished,
                        will not be managed in a way t0 fulfil the expectations of the Musul mans
                        who have so liberally: contributed towards: the cost of building it. The
                        Sultan and Izzet Pasha are evidently mach more anxious to construct the line
                        than to ‘see it used in a business-like fashion. We can only hope that these
                        apprehensions will not be justified. We-canhot ‘disguise from ourselves that
                        the railway may some day be used to threaten our position in Egypt, and that
                        efforts have béen made to give an anti- British bias to the Pan-Islamic
                        policy which it is means to’ further, but we cannot regard without sympathy
                        an enterprise in which our Musulman fellow-subjects ‘take auch a keen
                        interest, and which, when, completed, will render it easier for them to
                        fulfil their religious duty by making the pilgrimage to Mecca at : least
                        once in their lives,</p>

                    <p>We have heard the question often asked remarks the “Sudan Times”, whether the

                        connecting Khartoum with Omdirman, We have not received any of- ficial
                        information on the subject,bat we under- stand thatthe construction of this
                        bridge has ngtdfeen given up, though it is temporarily postponed owing to
                        paucity of funds, and to the utilization of such funds as are available for
                        the execution of projects of immediate ur- gency to the Government. When
                        this bridge is taken in hand, we understand that it will not be a-railway
                        bridge, but will be merely for foot and vehicle traffic. Ita costis figured

                        som@time to come; is that of artificial fertilisers. Statistics have -been
                        prepared which show that in 1902 the total imports were 2,000 metric tons,
                        valued at I.E. 18,000, whilst in 1906 tlie’ figures were nearly’ 13.000

                        the deliveries amounted | g to 7,579 metric tons, valued at LE. 76,907. Of |

                    <p>“LOHENGRIN.”</p>

                    <p>Wagner performances sre, one would say, rather out of place in Cairo : the
                        “elect and select” come in late, and leave early, and look rather bored, the
                        rank and file applaud when- ever there is a convenient break in the music.
                        Happily “Lohengrin” is fairly continuous, -but the few opportunities it
                        offers were enthusias- tically seized. I fear that Herr Mottl, had he been
                        conducting, would have led the orchestra to a personal assault on the
                        audience, he cer- tainly would not have tolerated the casual and ill-tuned
                        entrances of late-comers, or the noise and shuffling before the end of each
                        act. Still the andience as a whole seemed to take: the performance of
                        “Lohengrin” as a delicate com- pliment to their taste and powers of
                        apprecia-| J tion, and the applause, though given at inex- cusable moments,
                        during the acta !, was merited.</p>

                    <p>Far the best part of the whole performance was the singing of Mmes Magne and
                        Fierens in thesecond act. Mme Magne was far less constrained than usual: she
                        had - evidently studied the spirit of the music, and unquestion- ably both
                        in voice and in treatment she revealed it to the full: the middle and more
                        subdued tones of her voice were especially charming, and her bigh notes were
                        pure, faultless and full of ‘feeling. And Mme Fier- ens! what a splendid
                        Ortrud! her acting was the last word of realism, and her singing that of a
                        real artiste who knew the music and the meaning of the part past all
                        question. Her gestures, eyes, and voice —and what a fine voice! — expressed
                        every detail and depth of power, passion, hate, cunning and evil
                        triumph.</p>

                    <p>For the rest, M. Valette.was quite good as Tebramund, and M: Wiglio adequate
                        as Henry the Fowler, but they—and this may be said of the chorus also—were
                        hardly in touch with the misic.: it,was not convincing to them : but M.
                        Valette has the makings of a really fine Tebra- mund, his sudden appearance
                        from within the church was perhaps his best moment, he rose. to the
                        situation. M. Soubeyran was yery far’ from convincing ; his voice has not
                        the requisite power or résonance, and he takes the music in a species of
                        cadence quite remote from its real movement: his farewell to the Swan was
                        perhaps the only approach to.a success, but.it was too-affected. The
                        orchestra was quite good, especially in the characteristic violin passages
                        which constitute the real ‘motif’ of the work : but they also inclined to
                        cadences now and. again ; andthe wedding chorus was harried ; it might have
                        been a species of dance, taken as it was. Still the performance as a whole
                        was far better than one might have expected, and the singing of Mmes Magne
                        and Fierens would have been worth hearing anywhere.</p>
