                <div type="item"><head>MONDAY, APRIL 2, 1906.</head>
                <head>ALGECIRAS.</head>
                <p>The whole civilised world will welcome the news of the 
                happy issue of the most momentous international debate 
                that has been convened since the Berlin Conference. A 
                few days ago, in discussing the possible peaceful termina¬tion
                of the Algeciras conference, the “Morning Post” declared that
                it would have been a mis-fortune of the first magnitude if the 
                affair of Morocco had led to a quarrel between any of the Great 
                Powers. In spite of the strong na¬tional feeling which exists in 
                each of the coun- tries principally concerned in these negotiations
                there is no sane and sensible man either in Germany, France, Spain,
                or Great Britain who really thinks that Morocco, taken on the maximum
                valuation, is worth a conflict be¬tween any of the Powers. Supposing 
                its soil to be the most fertile, its climate the most bene- ficent in
                the world, and its mineral wealth to be inexhaustible, yet the question
                whether the task of bringing into its administration the beginnings of
                order and of giving to European residents and traders the elements of
                security for person and property should be </p>
                <cb n="6"/>
               <p>entrusted to one Power or to more, and even the question
                    whether a settlement now made might or might not give one Power something
                    of a special position in the country, are not worth a struggle between 
                    civilised Powers. Such a conflict would in six months destroy more wealth
                    and absorb more human energy than Morocco could in any case reproduce in 
                    half a century, Of this all the Powers concern¬ed are firmly convinced, 
                    and the fact that they are so having been well known has made graver, from
                    the beginning, the anxiety with which the possibility of a deadlock has been 
                    regarded. Everyone has put the question, “What’s he to Hecuba or Hecuba to him ?”
                    and in the absence of a possible answer has sought behind the friction and delay
                    which have attended upon diplomacy for sums profound explanation.
                The great prestige with which Bismarck sur-rounded the policy of the German Empire, 
                the presumed astuteness and profundity of German diplomacy, and the generally recognised
                excel¬lence of the German military and naval organi¬sation have erased most observers to
                imagine that Germany had some deep design. The theory weir known to be held by many officers
                of the German Army that Germany ought to take the first opportunity to attack France in order
                that she might be unable to take part in the future conflict which, these same officers imagine
                to be inevitable between Germany and Great Britain, lent itself to the hypothesis that the 
                German Government was meditating an attack upon France of which the excuse was to be found 
                in some disagreement con- cerning Morocco. The tone in which the German Government has for 
                several years without a solitary exception alluded to its relations with Great Britain has 
                lent colour to the same hypothesis. Even when a British Ad¬miral on a visit to a German port
                in the Baltic sent a message conveying his respects to the German Emperor, the Emperor’s reply
                was almost as frigid and as chilling to British feelings as his famous message to President Kruger.
                Sentiment asked what these things meant, and could only infer that they boded no good. But the German
                Emperor, though he is a careful student of German sentiment, and therefore as a rule carries it with 
                him even when—perhaps especially when—he offends the sentiment of other nations, is not a senti¬mental
                statesman. He is always doing business, and the feelings of his own and other rations are a portion of
                the data upon which his calculations are based. He has not, and never has had, the idea of plunging 
                Germany into an international conflict without knowing the reason why and without foreseeing a satis
                ¬-factory ending. In the case which has been during the last few months thought possible, there has 
                been no sufficient reason why. Ger¬many was subject to no menace. Her territory, her rights, her 
                interests were in no way threat -ened. It is just conceivable that Prince Bulow may have taken umbrage
                at the expression used in the Anglo-French Agreement about Morocco by which Great Britain ‘ recognised 
                that France was entitled to a peculiar posit on in that country. But though the words used may not have 
                been formally unexceptionable, and would, perhaps, have been better omitted, seeing that the substance 
                was perfect¬ly conveyed by the undertaking not to obstruct the action which France might take in Morocco
                any objection that could be raised was merely formal, fir no one in the world doubted that Morocco and 
                its good order was a matter of special interest to France, and no one in the world supposed that Great 
                Britain claimed any right to dispose of anything in Morocco beyond her own rights and interests in that
                country.The probability is that the German Govern¬ment wished it to be understood that no such settlement
                as that of the future of Morocco ought to be effected without Germany’s being con¬sulted and being a 
                consenting party. That having been made plain, and that wish having been met, the main intention of 
                German policy in the matter has probably been fulfilled. No doubt there may be a little more behind. 
                Bismarck and his disciples learned something from Napoleon, and Napoleon learned from his master in 
                strategy never to make a project without two faces. It is likely enough, there- fore, that Germany, 
                while pressing her point in regard to Morocco, has had her eye on something else as well, and that while
                the theory of the right of Germany to be consulted in any settlement of Morocco has been asserted the 
                wishes of Germany in regard to the Middle East have also been kept in mind. That remains to be seen.</p></div>

            <p>Finds at Oxyrhynchus.</p>
           <p>The work of discovery at Oxyrhynchus during the last season has resulted in a large accumulation of material, no fewer than one hundred and seventeen boxes of papyri being brought away. Among the most interesting finds are a comedy of Philemon on which Plautus based his “Aulularia,” and a discourse on music, perhaps by Hippias of Elis. A con-¬tract dated in the fifth year of Sotu I. furnishes the oldest date yet found on a Geek papyrus. A very interesting document is a Greco- Roman calendar about BC 300, giving data as to the various deities and their festivals.</p>

            <p>The materials and discussions of Professor Flinders Petrie’s new book, ‘Researches in Sinai," which will shortly be published, are not drawn from any previous publication. They contain the first detailed account of the Egyptian remains in Sinai, the results being given in chronology, with a revision of the dates in Egyptian history according to the most recent results. The Semitic discoveries, which are entirely new, include the system of Semitic ritual and the common use of a Semitic writing in the earliest age, the conditions of climate, the route of the Exodus, the question of the numbers of the Israelites down to the monarchy, and the evidences of early docu¬ments in the Pentateuch.</p>

                <p>Report of Directors</p>
<p>              The following is the report of the directors of the Egyptian Estates, to be submitted to the shareholders at the first annual general meeting to be held at Winchester House. Old Broad, street, London, E C., on Wednesday, 11th inst. : —
                The directors herewith present the first balance sheet and profit and loss account made up to the 13th March, 1906. The company was registered on the 3rd March, 1905, but it was some months before it was able to commence operations, and the average period for which the subscribed capital has been available does not exceed six months. During the past three months 179.315 additional ordinary shares have been issued, of which 153,315 will row rank for dividend with the original capital. Five per cent, debentures have also been issued for £150 000 part of £300 0 0 created. If the issue of the remainder should be thought advisable, the available resources of the company, include-ing the reserves now created, would amount to over £800,000. The whole of the lands and properties shown in the balance sheet are car¬r-ied at cost, and on a revaluation would shows a large appreciation on the purchase price. The amount to the credit of profit and loss account is £67.177 1649d. This does not include a sum of £25,655 17s. 7d. shown in the balance sheet, but which, although ascertained profit, is only payable by instalments extending over the next 2 1/2 years, and is, therefore, not divisible profit at the present time. The directors pro-pose the payment of a dividend of 2s. per share, free of income tax upon the ordinary shares. This will absorb £40,492 2s, and will entail an appropriation of £ 0,900 to the deferred shares, which will admit of a dividend of 10s. 9d. per share being paid on these shares. The directors, in the exercise of their powers, have placed £126 071 17s. 6d. to reserve, being the amount of premiums received on shares allotted since the issue of the prospectus, against which have been written oft the whole of the preliminary expenses an 1 the expenses of the debenture issue to date, leaving a ret balance on reserve account of £10-1,090 12s. l0d. In accordance with Article 99 of the Articles of Association, the Directors are entitled to one- tenth of the profits over and above an amount sufficient to pay a dividend of 7 per cent. per annum on the ordinary shares, and £3,23 5s. 4d. will be appropriated under this head. These various amounts, deducted from the £67 177 16s. 9d. will, after due provision has been made for income tax, leave a balance of £9/89 Us. 7d. The directors wish to place upon record their high appreciation of the services rendered to the company by the managing director in Egypt, Mr. Montagu Summers, and of the able co-operation of Mr. Lang Anderson and George Nungovich Bey.</p>

                   <p>T.R.H. at All Saints'</p>
                   <p>VISIT PAID TO THE BARRAGE</p>
               <p>Yesterday their Royal Highnesses the Prince and Princess of Wales attended morning service at All Saints’ Church Cairo. Of coarse, the building was crowded and it was fortunate that the restoration of the north aisle had been completed or there would not have been room for the congregation. As it is, the in¬adequacy of the church accommodation is only too apparent. Three clergymen took part in the service. Rev. Thompson Barns, M. A., read the prayers, Right Rev. Bishop Morley, D.D., acting Archdeacon in Egypt, celebrated the Holy Communion, and the Very Rev. Dean Butcher preached from the 1st Lesson Exodus 8.2: ‘‘And he looked, and behold the bush burned with fire and the bush was not consumed."
                The Dean spoke of the scene of the vision of the Peninsula of Sinai, of which we now know much more than we ever did before, and of the symbolism of the vision itself, the fire representing, first, the discipline of trial, secondly, the comforting and enlightening effects of the Holy Spirit. He mentioned the fact that the burning bush and the text were the emblem and motto of the Church of Scot¬land. He quoted Matthew Arnold’s well-known sonnet on Marcus Aurelius:
                “ There were no suoccours here 
                The aids to noble life were all within.”
                and contrasted this with the experience of the humblest Christian, who can always obtain through Christ—help from outside— the aid of the Holy Spirit.
                The hymns selected by their Royal High¬nesses were No. 260 in H A. and M., “Hark my soul," No. 438 ‘ How bright those glorious spirits shine," and 215, ‘ The Church’s one Foundation." There was an unusually large choir admirably directed by Mr. Peacock.
                The Earl of Cromer met the Royal party at the church door and sat with them in the Agency pew. General Bullock, C.B., Major Watson Pacha, C.M.G., D.S.O., and several members of the suite occupied the first four seats.
                After attending divine service their Royal Highnesses returned to Abdeen Palace, after¬wards lunching with Brig. General Bullock. In the afternoon they paid a visit to the Barrage, accompanied by H.H. the Khedive, by whose desire the gardens were closed to the public during the afternoon. Sir Wm. Garstin also accompanied their Royal High¬nesses.
                The party went out on the Khedive's yacht. The Nile was so rough and the wind so trying, however, that the Khedive and T. R. H., after arriving at the Barrage and inspecting the works, gardens, etc., wired to Cairo for a special train, by which the re¬turn journey was made.</p>

                <div type="item"><head>A GALLANT RESCUE.</head>
                <p>Yesterday morning, at about 10.30 o’clock, a Greek was walking along the lower parapet of the new quay near Fort Silsileh, when he slipped and fell into the sea. The nearest Coast- guard sentry was informed and he promptly proceeded to the spot with a life-saving apparatus. By this time the Greek had drifted oat about sixty yards from the quay wall and was too exhausted to swim to the buoy, which had been thrown out as far as possible. The sea was breaking heavily over the wall and there appeared to be little hope for the man, as although there was a small crowd of onlookers no one proffered any help. However, a Coast¬guard orderly, Ahmed Ibrahim Hamid, who was passing by, on seeing the man’s predica¬ment, called to the crowd and asked whether any of them would try to save the life of the drowning man. No one made reply, so he at once stripped and plunged into the sea. He swam out with the buoy to the Greek and assisted him alongside the quay, where he was hauled up.
                If this act of bravery had taken place at home the rescuer would certainly have been entitled to the medal of the Royal Humane Society. There are decorations, Medjidish and Osmanieh, for the officers, but there is none for the men in Egypt. Why should not a special Order be created for deeds of bravery? At any rate it is to be hoped that the brave coastguardeman will meet with some reward.

               <p>This year’s Military Tournament at Abbas- sieh was honoured by the presence of the Prince and Princess of Wales, and in consequence of this fact, and of the excellent management of the committee, proved a great social success.

The committee had done their work admirably throughout. The eighteen events on their programme were all attractive and often amusing. The tent pegging was de- cidedly good, the riders taking the pegs with great finish and neatness. The wrestling on horseback delighted the audience—though for other reasons than the tent pegging—and the physical drill displays, bayonet fighting and contests between various aims delighted all who watched them. But it was the social and not the athletic side of the function that made it most interesting to all who were present. Here again, the committee, after issuing a great number of invitations, had obviously made up its mind to do all in its power for the entertainment of its guests. The enclosure was therefore roped in on the S. E. side of the parade ground so that neither sun nor wind made their presence unduly felt—a boon and blessing if ever was one. A smaller en¬closure was reserved for the Ministers, the Diplomatic and Consular Corps, and for the members of the Caisse de la Dette, and next to it was the Khedivial tent. At the opposite extremity of the enclosure was the tea tent, which was always thronged and admirably managed by Mr. Wild of the Savoy Hotel. George Nungovich Bey devoted himself with skill and assiduity to the supply of the Khe-divial party and the Royal visitors. The fact that in spite of the presence of nearly 1,000 visitors the tea tent triumphantly met all demands (on a warm afternoon too) merits mention.
                The committee, which deserves any amount of credit for its successful organisation of the tournament, and of thanks for the hospitality extended to so many guests by its members in conjunction with the Sirdar and the officers corps of the Egyptian Army, consisted of, Miralai Matehett Bey, Miralai Palmer Bey, Kaimakam Gordon Bey, Kaimakam Stockwell Bey Kaimakam Hassan Bey Hilmy, Bimbashi Flint. Bimbasbi Betbell, Bimbashi Broadbent and Bimbashi Rome. The programme had been drawn up by Saghcologassi Ahmed Effendi Fetin.
                The police arrangements and traffic control were perfect and Man-field Pacha’s subordinates did wonders. The native population of Cairo was there is its thousands. A long row of harem carriages on the side of the parade-ground opposite to the enclosure testified to the interest aroused among the Turkish and Arab ladies of Cairo by the tournament and the Royal visit, and the rank and file of the Egyptian Army were out in hundreds.
                The Corps Diplomatique, the Ministers, and the members of the Legislative Council were present in full strength at the ceremony. The Sirdar and Lady Wingate with a strong con¬tingent of officers and officials from the Sudan were present, and among others we noticed Sir William Garstin, Lord Edward Cecil, Mr. Percy Macbell and Lady Victoria Machell. Mr. and Mrs. And Mrs. De C. Findlay, Sir John and Lady Rogers, Sir Horace Pinching, Mr. Douglas Dunlop, Mr. Dugdale and the Lady Eva Dugdale, Crookshank Pacha and Mrs. Crook shank, Mr. Webb, Sir Augustus and Lady Hemming, Miss Hemming, Gen.

Mrs. Rom, Miss Phillips, Capt. and Mrs. Duffus, Miss Langley, Dr. and Mrs. Madden, Dr. and Mrs. Milton, Mr. Potts, Mr. and Mrs. Wells, Mr. and Mrs. Satow, Mr. Roche, Mr. and Mrs. Hogg,—but the mere repetition of names, however pleasant their associations, must weary the reader and might be continued over columns.
                H.H. the Khedive arrived comparatively early at the tournament, followed shortly afterwards by H.RH. the Prince of Wales. H.RH. the Princess of Wales arrived later, after visiting H.H. the Khedivah and H.H. the Khedivah Mother at Koubbeh Palace in company with Lady Cromer, with whom she left Abdeen at 3.30 p.m. and proceeded by special train, leaving Pont Limoun station at 3.45 p.m. Lord Cromer arrived shortly after H.R.H the Princess of Wales had driven up.
                The Royal visitors were greatly pleased with all they saw of the tournament, and H.H. the Khedive was kind enough to express to the Sirdar his high appreciation of the arrange¬ments made. It was indeed one of the great events, perhaps the great event of the season.</p>

                <p>NEW HARBOUR WORKS.</p>
               <p>(FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT.)</p>
                <p>Port Said, Saturday.</p>
               <p>The erection of warehouses in connection with the Menzaleh Canal is nearing completion. They are being built behind Dowrie’s point and will shortly be ready to receive cargo. The Custom House and railway lines have also been started and when finished should be of great benefit to the tradespeople of the town.
                Messrs. Wills and Sons’ engineers have now arrived and things will 60on be in fall swing in connection with the new harbour and docks which are being built on the N. E. shore of Port Said. All the stone for the construction of the harbour and docks are to come from Suez by barges, which I understand have al¬ready been despatched from England.
                Murder at Ras el Ech.
                Some little time ago a burglary was com¬mitted at Ras el Ech and two police officers were sent from Cairo to enquire into the matter. No arrests were made, but a number of Greeks were brought up for examination. These Greeks were examined one by one, and after answering some questions one of them pulled a revolver out of his pocket, and, before any one could realise the situation, shot one of the officers in the brain, killing him on the spot. The body of the unfortunate officer was taken to Cairo accompanied by a force of 200 police from the Capital.
                Hotel Improvements,
                Messrs. Wills and Co. are making some ex¬tensive alterations to the Eastern Exchange. The shop under the hotel is, I hear, to be transformed into tea-rooms. This should prove a successful innovation.
                Football.
                The football season at Port Said has come to an end, and I think the Port Said Club have had a record year for the number of games, if not wins. Rugby and hockey have taken the place of Association to a great extent, and the young sportsmen here must feel very thankful for the presence of a guardship here again as one can always get up a match of some sort.</p>

                <p>From day to day the rights of hike on land grow less and less in consequence of the deci¬sions of the Mixed Appeal Court and the Wakfs General Administration that the rights could be definitely bought off on payment of a lump sum equivalent to the dues for twenty years to come. The Wakfs, for the benefit of which these hikrs had been originally created, invest the money obtained for relinquishment of •he rights in land, which is turned into Wakfs, bringing in far more than the hikrs, which required a great deal of money and trouble to collect.

                <p>DEVANT LA REVOLTS ARABE. *</p>
               <p>Tandis que 1'attention de la France et de 1’Europe etait absorbee par la guerre russo- japonaise, puis par les debuts des affaires maro- caines, un drame politique d’un interet tragique et d’une importance mondiale commencait a s'ouvrir dans la partie naturellement la plus riche, mais aussi, depuis de longs siecles, la plus abandonnee et la plus ignoree de l’Empire ottoman, l’Arabie.
                Longtemps opprime, et en apparence, en- dormi, le peuple arabe se reveille et revendiqne son independance.
                Or, qni dira, qui osera prevoir la repercus¬sion de cet etonnant mouvement sur la politi¬-que des Etats europeens, tous interesses, et la France la premiere, en sa qualite de grande puissance musulmane, a cette crise redoutable de la domination torque? Probleme pressant, d’une gravite qu’on ne peut exagerer et sur lequel il importe que l’opinion francaise soit renseignee au plus tot.
                Ce sera le grand bienfait du livre si informe et si sur de M. Eugene Jung que de nous mettre, par un expose lumineux et magistral de l’histoire du pays, de ses ressources economi- ques, de la revolution qui l’agite, de la situa-tion respective des puissances, en l’etat d’abor- der ce snjet. aujourd’hui presque inconnu, et qui sera demain la matiere des polemiques internationales les plus passionnees.
