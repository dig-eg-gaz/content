                        <p>Apropos of our leading article today, we may mention that a man described
                            as a "Hebrew Christian,” who was on his way to America to his daughter's
                            home, brought a letter (which we have seen) from the Jews' Society,
                            Jerusalem, to the Rudolph Home, asking that kindness might be shown to
                            him on his passing through Alexandria. Food was given to him, and
                            shelter provided, but he asked for money, which was refused. He left the
                            home after three days' stay and applied to the Chief Rabbi for
                            assistance! It would be interesting to learn the particulars of this
                            man's "conversion," which, doubtless, have been duly reported to London,
                            and it is somewhat difficult to understand what good purpose was
                            effected by merely sending him on to Alexandria instead of direct to
                            America.</p>
                        <p>Probably the Jerusalem Society were anxious to get rid of him at the
                            least possible cost, and so passed on their “convert" as far as Egypt
                            only.</p>

                    <p>Sir,—I learn that owing to the effect of the article you published a few days
                        ago concern- ing the Tanta Municipality, pointing out that the new election
                        was performed under pressure in favor of the new members; who are unfit for
                        the position, the Inspector of the Interior has requested you to support ,
                        your allegations by proof. My newspaper, "Al Horrieh,” Tanta, being the
                        first to criticise the election in a special supplement, indicating the
                        irregulari- ties which took place in the same election, I send you by post
                        “Al Horrieh” and its supplement.</p>
                    <p>Notwithstanding, simple and good proof can be given to the Inspector. He
                        should be re quested to ask the moudir, himself, whether the municipal
                        election was concluded according to the usual rules, and if the pressure of
                        some notables of influence had any effect on its results, or not. The moudir
                        cannot deny the fact that the new members are uneducated and unfit.—Yours,
                        etc., MAHMOUD FEHMI.</p>

                    <p>It is rumoured in Cairo that the German Government is taking considerable
                        interest in the fortunes of the Abyssinian Bauk and is of opinion that at
                        least one-third of the shares should be in German hands. </p>
                    <p>How far this statement is true we have no means of knowing, but it is worth
                        noting that more than one German bank offered to subscribe the whole capital

                    <p>The steadily increasing progress of Alex- andria is seen in the report of the
                        Administra- tor on the Budget Estimates of the Alexahdria Municipality for
                        the forthcoming year. The estimates amount to LE. 195,000 in receipts and
                        L.E. 191,570 in expenses, leaving a reserve of LE. 3,430. The estimate
                        receipts show a snrplnB of LE.- 11,850 over those for J905. This surplus is
                        made up for the most part of the following items: import and export dues,
                        L.E. 2,000; tax on vehicles and beasts, L.E. 1,200 ; house tax, L.E. 3,400;
                        2 % tax. L.E. 1,500 ; quarry working dues, L.E.1,000. But from this surplus
                        of nearly L.E., 12,000 a deduction must be made of the budgetary estimates
                        for 1905;. figuring in the extra- ordinary budget of the next year’s
                        working; in accordance with the regulation on June 12, 1905. If, therefore,
                        half of tho Free State Land sales, L.E. 4,000, and the sales of the Tanzim
                        surplus, L.E. 8x0, be deducted, the total net surplus will be L.E. 7,000. </p>
                    <p>A note on the extraordinary budget con- tains an interesting, statement of
                        the expen- diture of the Municipal Loan up to the end of last month. Of the
                        total loan of L.E. 499,980 .(£540,000) there only remains a balance in hand
                        of LE. 31,070, the Munici- pality having up to now expended L.E. 463,994 out
                        of the L.E. 495,070 allotted for the various credits. The following sums
                        have already been spent: Quay-Collector, L.E. 356,132 ; filters and
                        levelling land, L.E. 5,568 ; filters (forfait), L.E. 51,004 ; new drainage
                        works, L.E. 27,158 ; expropriations, L.E. 18,301; miscellaneous expenses,

                    <head>LORD CROMER AND GORDON.</head>
                    <p>Lord Edmond Fitzmaurice has sent the fol- lowing letter to the Editor of the
                        ‘‘Times” in , reply to Lord Cromer: - </p>
                    <p>Sir,—I do not think that the interesting communication from Lord Cromer,
                        which appears in your columns of today, with refe-renece to the instructions
                        to General Gordon in 1884, necessarily requires any comment on my part, as
                        the fuller and more detailed narrative of the facts given by him
                        substantially confirms my own shorter acccount. I may, however, take this
                        opportunity of saying that in that account, I was anxious to show that there
                        was no desire on my part to divest the home Government of responsibility at
                        the expense of Sir Evelyn Baring in regard to General Gordon’s instruc-
                        tions and what followed upon them.</p>
                    <p>In this I am glad to gather from Lord Cromer’s letter that I have not been
                        unsuccess- ful. How far the two sets of instructions, for both of which the
                        home Government must accept responsibility, were contributory causes, and in
                        what proportion, to the subsequent disaster, will probably always remain a
                        subject of legitimate difference of opinion. </p>
                    <p>In regard to the passage to which Lord Cromer alludes at the end of his
                        letter, there was no intention on my part to convey the impression that the
                        epigram attributed to him in 1882 by M. Alfred Ramband, in his recently
                        published “Life of M. Joles Ferry’’’ was uttered at a time when he and M. de
                        Reverseaux were respectively the representatives of Gveot-Britain and France
                        in Egypt; and I can only regret that my reproduction of M. Alfred Rambaud’s
                        story should have produced that impression.</p>
                    <p>Believing that it was possible that the career ofM. de" Reverseaux might not
                        be quite so fami-liar to English as to French readers, I merelywished to
                        indicate that he was the distinguished diplomatist who was afterwards
                        Consol-General in Egypt. But I admit my language should have been clearer. I
                        may, however, beallowed to point out that, if Lord Cromer willrefer to the
                        passage in M. Alfred Rimbaud’s work he Will see that the anecdote is told in
                        aperfectly complimentary sense, and is intended to emphasize the
                        inferiority, in other author’sown opinion, of French diplomacy during the
                        period in question, to the diplomacy in Egyptof Great Britain, in which Lord
                        Cromer hashad so eminent a part.</p>
