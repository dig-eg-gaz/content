                        <head> THE GERMAN EMPEROR.</head>
                        <p> We do not wonder at the enthusiasm with which all Germans celebrated
                            their Emperor's silver wedding yesterday. Few monarchs have. deserved
                            better of their country than the Emperor, and if his people just now are
                            inclined to mark the anniversaries of his birth and marriage with an
                            especial warmth they have reason enough for their inclination. Fortune
                            and a matured and brilliant stroke of policy have raised him within the
                            past twelve month' to what is scarcely less than the dictatorship of
                            Europe. His Majesty at this moment holds a position of actual and
                            potential power almost Napoleonic in its range and effectiveness Carlyle
                            long ago declared that Europe by, Sedan had exchanged a mistress for a
                            master. His words have come true, and if the German people are thrilled
                            by the evidences of their truth with a new exaltation, with a supreme
                            consciousness of being on the crest of the rising wave, and with a fresh
                            and zealous pride in their ruler, who shall blame them ?</p>
                        <p> Popular estimates of heirs-apparent are rarely worth much. Even if they
                            were their usefulness would still be limited ; for the weight of a
                            crown, the sudden change in duties, surroundings, advisers, and
                            interests radically modify | h e character. History is foil of instances
                            where men were one thing as Crown Princes and quite another as Kings. It
                            is, therefore, nothing strange that William II. should seem to-day a
                            totally different being from the youth whose abrupt accession eighteen
                            years ago to the most powerful throne in Europe sent a shiver of alarm
                            from London to Moscow. The alarm • was not unnatural. The coolest headed
                            states. men shared it. At the time nothing else seemed possible. Both as
                            Prince William and as Crown Prince the present Emperor had done nothing
                            to reconcile foreign Powers to the idea of his new position. Royal
                            rhetoricians are usually disquieting, and the young Prince haul net only
                            genuine powers of declamation which he seemed only too anxious to show
                            off, but he invariably chose the most disturbing of all topics on which
                            to exercise them. The world had no option but to catch the rattling of
                            the sabre and the beat of the war drum through all his impetuous
                            periods. The uneasiness redoubled during the brief and pitiful tragedy
                            of his father's reign. The Crown Prince appeared to sink the son too
                            much in the coming Emperor. He should have kept in the background;
                            instead, he took every opportunity of posing before the people in full
                            pageantry of war. He might at least have held his tongue; instead, his
                            speeches multiplied in vehemence and fervid imagery. Europe found it
                            hard to forgive his struttings and line-light effects. It wrote him down
                            as a rather self-willed and theatrical youth, consumed with Chauvinism,
                            and lending himself with an avidity that seemed more French than German
                            to the easy histrionics of militarism. Wherever he went the full stage
                            effects of a regimental setting went with him. Whenever he spoke it was
                            in flaming apostrophe of the sword and martial glory and he heroic deeds
                            of the most warlike of his ancestors. It was inevitable that the world
                            should see in him little more than a prancing German edition' of Harry
                            Hotspur, dashing, heady, with an instinct for flashy and inopportune
                            display, and terribly given to sounding the charge.</p>
                        <p>‘To do the big thing in the big way." That, one is convinced, is the
                            direction in which the balance of the Emperor's nature overwhelmingly
                            inclines. He is a man who may be touched on many sides, whom things stir
                            quickly and strongly. Above the fundamental bent towards whatever is
                            clean, manly, and above board, above the range of glowing sympathies,
                            there is his strong imaginative, aid yet stronger dramatic, sense to
                            appeal to. No one manages to throw scab feeling into little
                            international courtesies His telegrams of condolence to the widows of
                            Marshals MaoMahon and Canrobart were, in' their way, quite perfect. He
                            has something, perhaps a good deal, of the Crusader temperament. He is
                            profoundly moved by tales of heroism, by the clash and jar of elemental
                            life, and he has himself set an example of triumph over disabilities
                            that does not fall below the heroic level. His left arm, AS everyone
                            knows, has from his birth been practically useless. He has met the
                            affliction by training the right arm to do the work of two- an easy feat
                            to record, not so easy to accomplish. Many men simply throw up the race
                            on smaller pretexts than that, and a King who had not the right fibre in
                            him would be peculiarly seduced into making himself out a martyr of
                            circumstances. The Emperor has never been one of that kind. So far from
                            sitting down under his handicap, he rose to conquer it. In his list of
                            accomplishments there is a guarantees of something more than mere
                            versatility, and more even than a liking for the wholesome, manly things
                            of life: there is proof of so immense strength and discipline of
                            character, energy, will power, and of that “infinite capacity for taking
                            pains” which, if it be not genius, is at least as solid a foundation as
                            one could wish for any head of a State. Look at it which ever way you
                            please, it takes a man to win such a match with Fate as that. No
                            weakling could have done it; no one with any SERIOUS FLAW IN HIS
                            character could have done it. </p>

The party was shown over the school by a British official, who has laboured most energetically and most successfully in what may be regarded as a somewhat ungrateful task. He was accompanied on his tour of inspec¬tion by a Pasha who had served as an officer in the Mahdi’s army, who in the old regime had been eminent as a slave-trader, and who on the fall of the Khalifa had thrown in his lot with the British, and who had been promoted to high rank as a faithful adherent of British rule, end a sincere convert to British ideas. When the inspection was over the Pasha asked his British colleague what the school cost. He was informed that in round numbers the cost was £5' 0 a year. On hearing this the veteran slave-dealer said, with a sigh, “To think that only a dozen years ago you or I could have brought the whole lot, toys and girls, for £50,” </p>

                     <head>The Sucrecries Bairam  Bey' Conclusions Must Go Into Liquidation  </head>   
                        <p>Saturday’s hearing of the Sucreries case proved interesting enough after a banal opening Me. Carton de Wiart having demanded the approval by the Tribunal of the settlement arranged by the company and the majority of its creditors, and given a number of cogent reasons for its approval, Me. Padoa Bey wished to make certain observations, but the Court finally ruled that Bairam Bey, who represented the Government, should speak first. Bairam Bey then rose and gave his conclusions as to the granting of the concordat, which may be summarized as follows. 1 </p>
                        <p>The approval of a concordat preventif, even though voted for by all the creditors could only be granted by a Court if the debtor had been unfortunate, i.e , had suffered from causes over which he had no control and of good faith. In this case the debtor was a fictitious person —a joint-stock company - and there could be no question of good or bad faith in connection therewith. The Sucreries Company qua company was an abstrac¬tion ; who personified it ? Its administrators or its shareholders in general meeting! The  text of the law now in force and European.* precedents left no doubt that the administra¬tors alone were capable of legally representing this fictitious personality.</p>
                        <p>In this particular case the administrators had paid dividends from the profits of secret and at first successful speculation. It had accepted M. Cromer’s bills and had increased its expenditure at a time when its factories were working at a loss. The drawing of a distinction between the members of the board who were responsible for these proceedings and those who were ignorant of them should not influence the Court. Members of the board who were kept in ignorance of the truth should have insisted on verifying the accounts sub¬mitted to them and insisted before the respon¬sible parties on their undoubted rights. Moreover, the board, on the collective principle, was an undivided legal personality, and no distinction could be drawn between its mem¬bers. Therefore, as the board was a personality and had not acted in good faith, nor been unfortunate it must go into liquidation.</p>

                        <p> Signor Serato and Mme. Malatesta gave their farewell concert at the Savoy on Friday, and in spite of a somewhat thin audience, owing no doubt to the second day’s racing at Ghezireh, both the celebrated violinist and his most efficient accompanist outvied all their previous successes. Signor Serato’s rendering of Veracini’s sonata was beautiful in the extreme, but never has he been heard to such good effect as in Max-Bruchs concerto in sol minors. The Adagio movement in special, with its plaintive melody, could not have been given with more fine feeling and purity of expression. The Rondo brillante of Schubert’s was also a treat for the musical and those not so highly gifted, and as an encore he gave a well-known Polonaise of Vicuxtomps’ which was absolutely masterly in its treatment. Mure. Malatesta, gave two solos, that delightfully quiet and simple Albumblatt fur Elise of Beethoven’s, and Chopin's Polonaise la bornolle maggiore, which is such an absolute contrast and which gave Mme. Malatesta every opportunity to display her undoubted mastery of her instrument.</p>
                        <p>  It is much to be regretted that this is the last occasion this season that we shall I hear these two musicians, who have made such a success for themselves, but we trust; that Signor Serato’s coming season in London will add fresh laurels to his reputation.

                            <p>Carnival has suddenly burst forth in virulent form and the street’s of Cairo yesterday were filled with streams of overladen carriages and b 'By onlookers, and on every side were seen pedestrians jigging along in fantastic attire, and the toot of the tin and paper trumpets were heard in all directions. Very soon after lunch there was a general exodus in the direc¬tion of Ghezreh and many fearfully and wonderfully decorated cars were to be seen in the procession. A huge sun helmet formed the canopy over an equally enormous up-side down straw hat wherein sat a collection of the typical tourists, blue-veiled, blue spectacled, and attired after the fashion of Caran D'Arche. Then again followed a windmill fashioned of pink satin and gaily decorated with crimson flowers wherein was ensconced a fair incognita. A ponderous fort on wheels was peopled with a host of sailorboys, another car supported a enormous crescent moon from which peeped out a motley crowd of Pierrota, a scarlet figure sitting astride of a cask in front of it. Another CAT represented an elephantine typewriter, and , yet another illustrated the sad fate and punish meet doe to speculations various stuffed figures hanging from the gallows upon it A massive boat contained another crew of Bailors who spent their spare time singing to the light guitar, while just behind them followed on a troupe of Japanese in fan decked carriage canopied by a wide spreading umbrella.</p>
                            <p>It was impossible to keep count of all that passed, and it there were many fewer folk upon the stands the crowd on foot was far thicker than it was the preceding Sunday. The Ghezreh Palace was crowded during the afternoon and teas were served for over two thousand people, and this number could have been only the smaller half of those who were on the grounds. The drive home even was a matter of difficulty, and the crowd of onlookers at the fur her end of the bridge was almost as dense as that upon the course. Naturally the English contingent was in the minority, but these who were there appeared to be enjoying themselves, and a fair number of those who stayed away were inclined after¬wards to regret the fact.</p>

                        <p>Never this season has there been such a collection of decorations worn by the gentlemen, or so many beautiful frocks and wonderful jewels displayed by the ladies, as on the occasion of the Austro-Hungarian ball at the Savoy Hotel, Cairo, on Friday last. The ball room was filled with guests of all nationalities and dancing became a matter of great difficulty as the evening wore on. At about half past ten the strains of the Austro-Hungarian nations' anthem announced the arrival of Count Koziehrodsky, Minister of that country, who was accompanied by Count Stadnicky and M. Emilo Charles Welunscheg, secretaries to the Agency, M. de Hahn, and the other members of the Agency and Consulate. It would be impossible to enumerate ail those who were present, but noticeable among the some six hundred guests were Mr. and Countess Valda Machell, M Moise Cattaui Bey, M. and Mme. de la Boaliniere, Princes Louis and Antoine d’Orleans, the Prince of Siam, M. and Mme de Martino Pachs, M. Ferdinand de Martino, Mme de Vrie-, M. Ang. Fatica, Major L’Estrange John¬stone, Boghos Pacha Nubar, M. and Mme Mas- kens, Marquis and Marchioness Salvago-Ragg', Abaci Paoba, M. lgnaoe Ztbrevsky, Miles Anne and Abe Z brevity, Count and Countess de Piccolimci Baron and Baronessde Villebois, Count Zichy, Hon.

M. and Mile Prampolini, M. and Mme Giew, Mme. Zuhar</p>
                        <p>Very beautiful was the dress worn by Mme De Martino Pachs of gold-spangled gauze with pink satin and roses at the corsage. and aiming eyes falored  in the wake of Mme de Vries in her wonderfully fitting frock of a thick embroidered crepe de Chine which some said was amber-colored while others declared it pink. On one half of the draped crossover bodice appeared glimpses of diamentee gauze which also showed at the opening of the long tunic skirt. Lady Valda Machell was wearing her wedding dress, a stiff white brocade em-broidered with light sprays of silver, and her jewels included a diamond and ruby tiara and a handsome dog color of pearls with diamond clasps Mrs. Bullock had on a handsome gown of blue brocade with shaded pansies in 'he lace of the corsage. and the Miles. Zebrevsky were much admired in their pretty  frocks of spangled gauze Mme. Cattaui was in an empire frock of turquoise chiffon velvet with much heavy metallic tissue on the bodice, and Mrs. Nungovich’s dress of white velvet embroidered with softly glowing beads . of various shaded was finished with tiny revers of pink velvet. As before remarked. the display of jewels was something unique; the value of the pearls  alone must have ran into only thousands of pounds, and the diamonds  would have ransomed many a king,

                            INNISKING KILLINGS FAREWELL
                            MIRTH AND SADNESS COMBINED
                        </head>
                        <p>There was a note of sadness under the gaiety of Thursday’s dance at Ghezireh Palace Hotel, for the thought was present in the minds of most that it was the last occasion on which the popular officers of the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers would make merry within 'hose historic walls. Men may come and men may so, but whoever takes their place it will be a long time before the gallant Inniskillings are forgotten, and there were many, we fancy, who felt that no future could quite make up for the past. It was tactful inspiration that led to the orchestra bursting forth with the strains of "Auld Lang Sync” at the beat of midnight, and one ventures to think that both Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers and Cairo Society will have their thoughts in common whenever they hear those well-known bars again. Naturally there was a big dinner given in honour of the departing guests and many a farewell had to be gone through daring the evening, for part oft he regiment was leaving the following day and time was short and opportunities few.</p>
                        <p> There were numerous other dinner parties in progress at the same time, for Ghezreh Palace Hotel and the 8avoy run each other hard on the score of popularity and far be it from us to say which is the more favored. Certainly the surroundings and architectural beauties of the former attract many blessed with a sense of the artistic, but then there are solid advantages connected with 'he latter which cannot be gainsaid. Prince Louis and Prince Antoine d’Orleans were among the hosts on Thursday evening, and Col. and Mrs. Gordon, Mr. and Mrs. Hewetson, Capt. Rainsford, Lady Lamnson, Mr. and Mrs. Pepper, Mr. and M-s. Williamson Wilson, Mr. Phillips, and Mrs. Andrews were all entertaining parties of various sizes. Conspicuous among the crowd who afterward is congregated in the large hall and ballroom were the Count and Countess Larsche and Sir James Blythe with his family party consisting of Captain and Mrs. Rome and his pretty unmarried daughters. Major and Mrs. Wynne were also there, the latter wearing a particularly graceful Empire dress, the short bolero edged with a narrow pleating from beneath which flowed the soft and filmy skirt Mrs. Hewetson is one of the lucky few who are always irreproachably gowned, and her black frock molded her beautiful figure to perfection. Mrs. Home too was much admired in her gauzy frock glittering with faint lines of silver sequins, the bolero with its apologies for sleeves being fashioned entirely out of heavy dull silver tissue. Mrs. Smart who brought her young and charming daughter, was wearing a blue chiffon trimmed with lovely lace, and Mrs. Roper, in black with jetted corsage showing folds of golden tissue at the décolletage, was wearing many fine diamonds, notably a diamond snake enrolling her throat. Mrs. And Miss Leveridge were among their friends, the latter wearing a fresh and dainty softly hued muslin, and Mrs. Morgan was in a pretty lace frock adorned with tiny wreaths of chiffon roses. One of the Miss York’s wore an extremely dainty frock of grey moonlight silk with wreaths of very pale pink chiffon roses. Miss Phillips looked her best in a pretty shade of blue with folds of pink and cluster of roses at the décolletage, and Miss Rees was in cream lace with a large bunch of violets in the corsage. Mrs. Hunter was wearing a curious but becoming combination of grey and copner colour, the latter appearing as ceinture and at the neck, and Mrs. Armstrong had on a very handsome grey chiffon velours with applications of dull silver passemanterie on the bodice. </p>
                        <p>Time forbids a further mention of the many other pretty toilettes present, but among those as yet unmentioned were: ---Capt. And Mrs. Bayley, Dr. and Mrs. Phillips, Major Wynne, Mrs. And Miss Crotton, Mr. and Mrs. Scott-Dailgeish, Mr. and Mrs. Foeden, Mr. and Mrs. Lesdon, Mrs. Cranston, Lady and Miss Lampson, Miss Ambridge Miss Bontler. Lady and Miss Lampson, Miss Hemming the Misses Coles, Mrs. Allen Joseph, Miss Joseph, Miss Orborne. Major Watson, Major Davidson, Col. And Mrs. Gordon, Lient. Roberson, Lient. Cunningham, Mr. Randolph Berens, the Messrs. Musgrove, Mar. and Mrs. Mitchell Innes, the Hon. G. Morgan, Capt. Morgan, Mr. J. P. Taylor, Dr. Armstrong, Major Pirie, Mr. Curphy, Lady Warner, Mr. Carter Wilson, etc. etc. </p>

                        (Later). Um Skofeel has arrived at Colonel Mackenzie’s camp. The tension has been re-lieved.

                    <head>Prospectus</head>
                    <p>The Company has been formed for the purpose of {inter alia) carrying on business as Engineers. Contractors and Builders, and the undertaking of irrigation, railway, canal, marine, sewage, and constructional engineering, and public works of all kinds.</p>
                    <p>In consequence of the growth of the trade and the increase of the wealth in Egypt, and the consequent raising of the standard of living among all classes, and the steady increase in the population, the building industry in Egypt has been extraordinarily active within recent  years ; and it is reasonable to suppose that the activity will be at least well maintained, if not increased, in the future. Engineering and building operations of all kinds are in progress throughout the country. Large sums of money are to be expended on public works. Private houses, flats and offices are on all sides being erected, and the demand for snob buildings is ever , increasing.</p>
                    <p>The following is an extract from the note by the Financial Adviser on the Budget for 1906</p>
                    <p>‘‘Roughly speaking, it may be said that Egypt, is actually spending from L.E. 300,000 to L.E. 400,000 annually on public buildings ; not, I think, an extravagant sum, having regard to the revenue of the country and the fact that everything has to be provided ab initio, hospitals, post offices, prisons, asylums, schools, police stations, to say nothing of Gouvernorats, and other Government buildings of practically every description.</p>
                    <p>“Of course in the above figures are not included great works of public utility of a remunerative nature, which are charged to Reserve Fund.”</p>
                    <p>With the working capital at its command, the Company will be in a position to take full advantage of the increasing prosperity of the country, and to undertake engineering and building contracts of the largest kind. Hitherto it has been found that Where any works of magnitude have been executed in Egypt, the preponderance of contracts has been secured by European firms. As regards the erection of buildings, as distinguished from other works, the Company will be in the favourable position of being able to complete them from basement to roof, including their equipment throughout with electrical and sanitary appliances ; thus the profits on minor contracts can be secured to the Company. There is a great demand for small residential houses in Cairo and Alexandria, and a wide field is open to the Company to erect small houses in suitable localities, according to the plans and requirements of purchasers, and to have the cost of erection secured by Mortgages payable in instalments, with the usual interest there on, extending over a period to suit the convenience of clients.</p>
                    <p> The Company will in the first instance acquire and amalgamate the businesses carried on by the well-known firms of Engineers, Contractors and Builders, Messrs. McClure and Dorling, of Alexandria, and Messrs. G L. Pezzi and Co„ of Cairo and Alexandria. Both firms are highly respected, and have been entrusted with numerous important contracts by—amongst others—the Egyptian Government, H. H. The Khedive, the British Govern¬ment, the Egyptian State Railways Administration, the Prisons Department, the Quarantine Board, the British Schools, the Alexandria Water Company, etc. etc.</p>
                    <p>Messrs. G. L. Pezzi and Co., who have been established since 1865, in addition to their business as Contractors and Builders, canty on the lucrative business of supplying the building trade with paints, papers, and other building materials and requisite.</p>
                    <p>The immediate vendors to and promoters of the Company are Messrs. Barc’ay, Hicks and Co., of Cairo (hereinafter called “the Vendors”), who have agreed to acquire the said businesses from their respective proprietors with a view to the re-sale thereof to the Company at a profit, the particular of which appear from the statements hereinafter contained. The proprietors, Mr. T. McClure, Mr. S. Dorling and Mr. G. L. Pezzi who will be the first Managing Directors of the Company, show their confidence in the Company’s future, not only by taking six-sevenths of their proportion of the purchase price, other than the valuation of the stock and plant, entirely in fully paid shares, but they have also agreed, by the undermentioned Agreements (4) and (5) that during the first five years their salaries as Managing Directors shall not be payable in any year in which the Company shall not have earned profits sufficient to pay a dividend of 7 per cent, on the initial paid-up hospital, and have further agreed to retain a holding of 10 000 shares during their term of office, and to deposit the certificates of such shares with the Company.</p>
                    <p>Both businesses will be taken over by the Company as going concerns as from the 1st day of October, 1905, and the Company will have the benefit of all profit realized from that date. The property to be transferred to the Company will include, besides the goodwills of the two businesses, the benefit of all pending contracts, the benefit of the existing agreements for the business premises, the book debts from the 1st October, 1905, and the office furniture, fixtures and fittings.</p>
                    <p>The purchase price for the sale of the said goodwills, the pending contracts, the agreements for tenancy of the business premises, book debts, office furniture, fixtures and fittings has been fixed by the under-mentioned Agreement 1) at £10,000. The stock-in-trade, plant and appliances will be purchased at a valuation. The Vendors have agreed to pay the preliminary expenses of the Company down to the first general allotment of shares other than Brokerage, stamps on Share Warrants, and stamp duty on the Sale Agreement. Such preliminary expenses are estimated at £2,500. The value of the goodwills is fixed at £30 000. The Vendors have also agreed in consideration of the further payment of £6,000 in cash to subscribe or procure subscriptions for 75,000 shares in the Company ; 12,0 00 of these shares have been subscribed for by the Memorandum of Association. The laid amounts payable to the Vendors, namely £46,000 altogether, will be paid and satisfied as to £25,000 by the allotment of 25,000 shares and the balance of £21,000 in cash.</p>

                    <p>The Company will have the advantage of the expert services of Mr. Thomas McClure, Mr. Stanley Darling and Mr. G. L Pezzi. who have consented to act as Managing Directors for a period of five years at a salary of £700 per annum each, payable only as above stated, after profits have been oarnef sufficient to pay a dividend of 7 per cent off the original capital of the Company. Messrs. McClure, Darling and Pezzi have all been in Egypt a great number of years during which  time they have been engaged in engineering and building contracts of all kinds, and have acquired an exceptional knowledge of the peculiar and special requirements of the engineering and building industry of that country.</p>

                    <head>Sport and Play. Football. Cairo Shield Final Tie. Royal Inniskillings King's Royal Riple Corps</head>
                    <p>The above well known rivals met on Satur¬day week to decide who should hold the above shield for the season 1906. The ground was in the best of order as both teams entered the arena each confident of victory. The captains lined their men out in the following order : King's Royal Rifle Corps—goal, Pickervince ; backs, Swinbourne, Ventimore; halves, Craston Wilson and Bruke; forwards, Mitchell, Bicknell, Booth, Soouter and Ketterick. Royal Inniskilling Fosilier’—goal, Lieut. Vernon ; backs, Robinson and Reid ; halves, Millar, Walker, and Smyth ; forwards, Black, Hutton, Cun¬ningham, Greer and Walsh.</p>
                    <p>The Inniskillings won the spin of the coin and decided to defend the city goals. Booth started the ball rolling before 7,500 spectators. The Rifles got away in fine style but Smyth robbed Mitchell and play was transferred towards Pickervince, but Venimors cleared well Some give-and-take play now ensued until Bruke got away and gave to Soouter, who had a nice ran towards Vernon, but his parting shot went wide. On the kick off Black got possession and centered well and Cunningham gave the sphere to Greer, who rent in a fast shot across the goal month, where Black, who was lying handy, had no troubles in scoring the first goal for the inniskillings amid cheers.</p>
                    <p>On resuming the Rifles got on a fast ran, Booth giving his wing men plenty of chances, bat over-eagerness spoiled all attempts. Good play by Smyth brought play well down but Broke, who was playing a fine game, robbed Black and play was transferred toward" Vernon. The latter in saving conceded a corner which was sent behind. On the kick-off the Inniskillings got away, Cunningham having a shot at goal, but the custodian was in fine fettle and saved the situation. Play now took a turn towards Robinson and Company. The left wing of the K.R.R. were playing a fine game. Once or twice Ketterick had very hard lines, his shots, which were of the international order missing the poet by a hair's breadth. The Inniskillings now took play in hand. Black, getting away on a good run, sent across where Greer got possession and with a last shot he sent np the second goal. The ball had just been centered when Greer, accepting a golden opportunity, scored again. The Rifles now took play in hand and Vernon had to be on his best behaviour or a goal would have been scored. Each goal was visited in turn np and down the field, the pace being a hot one. The Inniskillings now scored again per Hutton. Nothing of importance occurred from this up to half time, the score reading :—</p>
                    <p>Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers ... 5 goals
                        King’s Royal Rifle Corps	 Nil </p>
                    <p>After the usual interval and refreshments play was once more resumed. The start was a bit sensational as the Rifles bombarded the Inniskillings’ goal, and it was more by good look than guiding that Vernon kept a clean sheet. The Inniskillings now advanced per Cunningham, but they were forced to retire, Craston relieving and Burke got away and sent in a daily cutter to Vernon, who just managed to save. The Rifles bad hard lines in not (poring but their shots lacked the necessary aging.” Good only by Walker changed the scene of operations and play was around Pickervince and be had a few iho‘8 to deal with, one shot from Blaok being weh saved. Midfield play now followed until

Midfield play now followed until Souter got away on his own centered well. Burke, receiving, gave Bicknell, who missed the post by inches. Play for a while was in favour of the Rifles, and it made Vernon look out for his p’s and q’s. Play now became some what slack, Cunningham introducing some tricky work. Hutton and Black were combining but Swainbourne was one too many for them. Time and again he robbed when all seemed  lost. The Rifles forwards now showed some fine combination but score they could not do. They planted the ball everywhere except the proper place. The Inniskillings now wakened up and Walsh got away on a dashing run and centered well to Cunningham, who in turn gave to Black sent well across to goal mouth. Walsh, getting the sphere sent in as swift shot, but the custodian brought off a very clever save. The Inniskillings were pressing very hard when offense spoiled any chance they had. Both teams were completely fagged out. It was now mearing up to full time as the Rifle strove hard to score, Ketterick striking the upright in the attempt. The excitement was intense as Booth sent past. On the kick-off Greer got away on a nice run and dodging Wilson he gave to Walsh, who with a high a shot sent the ball into the left top corner of the net. With only two minutes to go the Rifles made one more attempt but it was useless ,, the ball finding the back of the net. Shortly after the referee’s whistle sounded for full time leaving the Inniskillings winners of the shields and one of the best contested matches ever seen in Cairo by the following score:
                        
                        Royal Innisking Fosiliers… 5 goals 
                        King’s Royal Rifle Corpos …Nil

                    <p>The first tie of the Gordon Challenge Cap was played on Saturday before a large crowd of residents and visitors. The opposing sides were :
                        THE TOURISTS	MOSQUITOES
                        1.	Mr.	Paravioiui	1.	Cant. Stockwell
                        2.	Mr.	Pickering	2.	Mr. Gore Graham
                        3.	Mr.	de Frev lie	3.	Capt. Bartlett
                        Back, Co). Sparkes Back. Mr. Dudgeon
                    </p>
                    <p>Umpire, Captain Rome.
                        1st Chukker.—The Mosquitoes were first on the ball, ran it down, and narrowly missed scoring, Bartlett hitting wide and losing a good chance. From the hit out the tourists worked the ball up the ground and Dudgeon, in trying to save, scored a subsidiary against his side. Counting. the Mosquitoes took the ball down the ground but Sparkes weaved wel1, the ball was worked back to the Mosquitoes’ goal and from a melee in front Paravicini put it through. Scrambling play ensued, though the Tourists continued to press and Pickering scored for them again. It was a sticky chukker in which the tourists did most of the pressing and scored 2 goals and 1 subsidiary to nil.
                    </p>
                    <p>2nd Chnkker.—For the first half of this chukker the game was confined to the Tourists’ end, the Mosquitoes missing one or two chances of scoring. Bartlett, however, with a brilliant ran down the field, scored the fret goal for his side. The same player shortly afterwards made another fine ran bat hit wide with his last shot. Dudgeon cantered well with a near side shot and Sparkes, in trying to save, hit behind. From the resulting penalty Bartlett scored. It was another rather sticky chukker in which the Mosquitoes were better and scored 2 goals to nil.</p>
                    <p>3rd Chukker.—Pickering get away from the throw-in but glimpsed a chance of scoring. Give- and-take play followed, first one side then the other attacking. Bartlett, on a fast white pony, with a great run the whole length of the ground, locked like getting a certain goal, but the hall bumped and Sparkes cleared. The Tourists then attacked and from a hustle in front of the posts snickering scored with a very neat shot. The same player again scored short¬ly afterwards, putting the Tourists 2 goals ahead. Then came the best piece play of the day. Bartlett got on the ball near his own goal and brought it right down, well backed up by Graham and Stockwell, the latter finally scoring a good goal. This was and very much better chukker, of which the Tourists had slightly the better and scored 2 goals to 1.</p>
                    <p>4th Chukker.—With seven minutes to play the Mosquitoes were 1 goal and 1 subsidiary to the bad. They played up hard and looked like scoring, but Sparkes saved well. Up and down the ground the ball travelled. Dudgeon, in trying to meet the ball, let in de Freville, who however missed chance. Tune was finally called with no farther ad¬dition to the score, the Tourists winning a good, hard, even game by 4 goals 1 subsi¬diary to 3 goals.</p>
                    <p>For the winners Sparkes and de Freville were best, the former being very safe and his hitting true and clean. For the losers Bartlett WAS brilliant; his hitting WAS hard, sure and straight, he was beautifully mounted, and always on the ball.</p>

                    <p>The final game in the above tournament, which has been in progress during the present month, was reached on Thursday, when teams representing the Royal Engineers and Sergeants of the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers met to decide supremacy.</p>
                    <p>The R.E. team were favourites, bat the RI.F. team (who were unfortunate in losing one of their best players, ordered to Crete) made a determined fight, and gave the supporters of the R.E. team an anxious time, as at the close of the first three games, only fifteen points divided the teams, The last player of the R.E. team, however, won by another fifteen, thus making the R.E. team winners of the tournament by the narrow margin of 30 points.</p>
                    <p>The special prize of a championship billard match one, for the highest break, goes to Sergeant Major Lumsden, R.I.F. The play of Loe Cpl. Robinson, of the K.R. Rifles and Supper Berry of the R.E., during the tournament, was much admired.</p>
                    <p>Score:
                        S.M. Lumsden 138  v Supper Berry 150

Great care had been taken to arrange them as accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several things to be considered . To begin with there is the difference in climate between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.
                        </p>
                        <cb n="2"/>
                        <p> This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so warm as Sicily, but in MArch it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in the year, for as a rule the weathet in April and May is perfect. The warmest place to go to on leaving is Egypt is Sicily.
                        </p>
                        <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at sea and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on each of the various routes between Egypt and the continent of Europe.</p>
                        <cb n="3"/>
                        <p> They are as follows:-
                        The long sea routes -- from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southampton, London or Liverpool--occupy abiut 14 days. The short ones are as follows:--
                        Port Said or Alexandria to Bridinsi: 3 days
                        Alexnadria to Messina: 3 "
                        Port Said or ALexandria to Marseilles 5"
                        Alexandria to Venice and Trieste 4"
                        Alexanria to Naples 3"
                        Port Said to Genoa 5 "
                        Alexandria to  Constantinople 4"
                        Alexandria to Pirricus 2"
                        Port Said to Gibraltar 7"</p>
                        <cb n="4"/>
                        <p>The steamers, of the P. and O. North German Lloyd, Orient and Mesageries Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines are also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by travellers to Egypt.
                        </p>
                        <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest in that to Alexandria, without change (3 hours). Taht to Port Said, can now be made without change in 4 1/2 hours.
                        </p>
                        <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant line had also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.
                        </p>
                        <cb n="5"/>
                        <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by P. and O. Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna express from Alexandria.
                        </p>
                        <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at afixed charge to deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                        <p> The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the fast Mail Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis" to Brindisi. One of these leaves Port Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian <cb n="6"/> mails from the great lines arrived from Bombay. </p>
                 <p>These small but comfortable ships ahve enormously powerful engines, and attain a very high rate of speed . They are called the "Ferry boats, having been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi. if you are going straight through to ENgland you will find the train waiting at Brinidisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said. </p>

                    <p>The direct route is by the FlorioRubatiino Co.'s steamers which ahve leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMINA, one of the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is the station at which alight and, the druve up Taormina is most delightful, occuping about one hour. In and around the rown is much to interest the visitor. The theatre is of Greek Origin, but restored under the Romans. CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of Etna and here also is a fine Cathedral. The Greek, ROman, and Saracenic remains that are found all over the island, are an endless sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting history , having been a Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C. 413 , and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain-- his tomb is to be seen. the cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple, PALERMO, with about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The Palazzo Reale is of Sarcenic origin and close to it the church of S. Giavanna degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral Musuem, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and ROyal Park are also worth a visit.  </p>
                    
                    <!-- Central Italy -->
                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days. </p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10nhours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it wihtout wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its bay--Castellamare and Sorrento {you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known  to need comment here. </p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the City of Flowers and be spent admiring the City of Flowers and its surround country. In Florence itself the churches and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local promenades and excursions should not be omitted. The Casino is the most attractive and fashionable promenade in FLorence, whislt the Viale dei Colli, one of the finest walks in Europe, opened 85 years ago, goes winding up through the hills a distnace of four miles. The most deligthful execrusion outside FLorence is that to Vallombroza, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea level. This made first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero, thence by cogwheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view/ </p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours; here there is a fine Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if possible be made in order to enjoy the view from Campanile at sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near PISA and on the main line from ROme to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way house beteen Egypt and England, and where livin is reasonable and the air and surroundings exceptionally good.  </p>
                    
                    <!-- Northern Italy   -->
                    <p>GENOA (LA SUPERBA)-- The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and a phenomenally equable temperature--warm in winter and deliciously cool breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer. </p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces, gardens and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are constant  delight to thousands of travellars who annually sojourn in Genoa. Then there are superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite marble columns and historical paintings and the incomparable Campo Santo filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the Lakes. The Cathedral is the principle attraction, with its beautiful windows illustratiing the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p> Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is SALSOMAGIORE, a reowned health resort on account if its thermal springs, change trains at Borgo San Domino and in half-an-hour you are at Salsomaggiore. </p>
