                    <p>I BRITISH FLOUR FOR EGYPT.</p>
                    <p>4 In an article on Egypt's increasing importa tions of flour the "Miller”
                        says : A short time ago we briefly commented upon the fact that although
                        Egypt was importing larger quantities -of wheat flour every year the
                        British</p>
                    <p> miller was not increasing his share of the trade in a corresponding ratio.
                        Roughly speak-ing Egypt now takes over a million sack-yearly, and there is
                        no apparent reason why the United Kingdom should not have a better showing
                        against other countries, and especially against the French miller, who up to
                        the present has had the lion's share of the trade with 700,000 sacks for
                        last year compared with 70,000 sacks originating here. This is 10 to one in
                        spotting parlance, and the odds are too long. It is quite true that our
                        millers have doubled their quantity during last year seeing that in 1905
                        only 34.000 sacks were sent out, and there is nothing, or should be nothing,
                        to prevent a still greater increase. The imports into Egypt of no other
                        article </p>
                    <cols n="6"/>
                    <cb n="6"/>
                    <p>during the last two years show such a great increase as flour and grain of
                        various sorts. Of course. we remember that opportunity served very well,
                        seeing that those years were of the lean kind in Egypt, both wheat and maize
                        being disappointing in yield ; but the opportunity must, or ought to, be
                        followed up with increased assiduity in order to make the business a
                        permanent one, remembering, also, that the population is constantly
                        increasing and that cereal growing is giving place to cotton, which pays
                        better. Besides that, the standard of living is rapidly being raised and new
                        towns and industries are being established. We may also remember another
                        thing Not long since one of the largest machinery orders ever given anywhere
                        was secured by an English firm of flour milling engineers for a plant in
                        South America, and the mill will very soon be at work. Behind that again yet
                        another mill quite as large is to be built upon the most modern lines, to
                        make flour for export to Europe. In the Argentine a powerful syndicate has
                        come to the conclusion that it will be more profitable to export flour than
                        wheat,and before long it will be doing it, so that we have one more reason
                        for exhorting the home miller to get farther afield before the crush comes,
                        to get established before the days of greater struggling begin to dawn It is
                        a comparatively easy task to hold the homo fort in the top grades, but the
                        medium and the residue are both likely to get more troublesome every year.
                        The British palate is a mighty particular one in these days, and everything
                        in flour below the top grade is unsuited to it, and wo single out Egypt and
                        Scandinavia as typical countries where there ought to be a sufficient outlet
                        for that residue, given the grit and push which is supposed to be
                        characteristic of our mental and physical embodiment.</p>

                    <p>INDUSTRIAL SCHOOL FOR THE BLIND IN ALEXANDRIA.</p>
                    <p>The Countess of Meath sends us the following communication : On various
                        occasion* you have kindly promoted the cause of a most useful institution
                        "The Industrial School for the Blind” in Alexandria. This establishment was
                        one of those fortunate enough to be allowed to show its wares at the
                        Agricultural Exhibition io Cairo opened this afternoon by H.H. the Khedive,
                        who graciously visited the stall allotted to the Blind School, and thus gavo
                        Lord Meath, who was present, an opportunity to toll his Highness that it was
                        this institution winch first introduced European wicker work into Egypt This
                        industry is now being taken up in several other establishments, and notably
                        in Egyptian prisons It is much to be hoped that ciiminal labour - though in
                        itaelf good for those engaged in it—will not be permitted to under sell that
                        done by honest hands, and thus spoil the market. Five pupils from the Blind
                        School at Alexandria wore present, and it is gratifying to find what skilful
                        workmen they have become under the instruction of English teachers. One of
                        the former attracted a good deal of notice by the ease with which he was
                        reading and writing Traille type.</p>
                    <p>• This institution, unlike the interesting one established at Zeitoun, has
                        never accepted an Egyptian Government grant, as it is the exclusive property
                        of the Ministering Childrens League, a society started in England for the
                        purpose of training children to lead unselfish lives and to take an active
                        interest in the needs of the poor and suffering.</p>
                    <p>The Association has now the proud record of having initiated the foundation
                        of 17 buildings devoted to charity in different parts of the world. Some of
                        them are even found in distant Australasia, as in all four quarters of the
                        globe this society has its branches. No than 32 centre* of work have been
                        estab-</p>
                    <p>lished lately in Russia.</p>
                    <p>The Blind School in Alexandria has during the 8 or 9 years of its existence
                        been fortunate enough to secure many friends but, it needs more who will
                        kindly assist the blind in the best way, namely, by helping them to help</p>
                    <p>themselves.</p>
                    <p>A new teacher has lately come out from England, who will keep a good stock of
                        wares in band, and will also gladly take orders for any special articles
                        required to meet the needs of customers.</p>

                            <p>A Cinematograph Conflagration</p>
                            <p>Last evening at about 8 o'clock while the Cinematograph was being
                                exhibited at the hall outside the Railway Terminus, the apparatus
                                caught on fire. There was a large audience present, but they
                                dispersed in an orderly manner and there was no stampede, The entire
                                cinematographic apparatus and a small portion of the hall were burnt
                                out. The damage to the machinery and films is estimated at from £300
                                to £100. The Alexandria Fire Brigade, under Yombashi Waller, was
                                very prompt in arriving on the scene and within ten minutes of the
                                call the fire was extinguished.</p>

                                the last moment. This will give sufficient time for the completion
                                of registration formalities and also avoid the delay to messengers
                                now caused by the sudden and late arrival of a very large quantity

                                commenced with a fair assembly at 10.15 p.m. By midnight the members
                                had been considerably increased, and there were by this time some
                                three to four hundred people present, with occasional parties still
                                arriving These late comers were in some instances not fortunate
                                enough to find them selves caught in the severe storm which passed
                                over about 11 o’clock. The costumes were pretty and varied, the
                                music good, a programme of 14 dances keeping the happy throng
                                engaged until the morning hours. Altogether a very enjoyable evening
                                was spent and what if the room was rather crowded, the atmosphere a
                                trifle stuffy, and the evening really too warm for dancing, so long

                            <p>Yesterday’s meeting of the General Assembly was unprecedented for the
                                animation with which the discussion of the many and various demands
                                brought forward was carried on. The Assembly debated all the morning
                                until midday and resumed its deliberation, in the afternoon at 8
                                o'clock and did not adjourn until late in the evening.</p>
                            <p>The resolutions proposing the enlargement of Tantah railway station
                                and that the estates of interstate Moslems should be devoted to
                                charitable purposes Were passed without opposition.</p>
                            <p>The greatest interest was shown in the pro-posal that the Arabic
                                language should be the sole vehicle of instruction in all the
                                Government schools, whether primary, secondary, or superior. Saad
                                Pasha Zaghoula strongly opposed this measure in a most eloquent
                                speech. Ha declared that neither the text books nor the teaching
                                stuffs were available for &lt;he purpose and he deprecated the
                                resolution as premature and calculated to injure the cause of
                                education in Egypt if it warn given effect to. In spite of his
                                speech the resolution was carried with only five dissentients.</p>
                            <p>The most important resolution next discussed was that that full
                                parliamentary institutions should be given to the Egyptian people,
                                who should have entire control of the financial and other
                                administrations. Pending the development of these institutions it
                                was demanded that the powers of the Legislative Council should be
                                largely increased.</p>
                            <p>This resolution was carried by a large majority.</p>

                            <p>ALLEN ALDERSON’S EXHIBITS</p>
                            <p>The first stand on the right, on entering the show ground, is
                                occupied by Messr. Allen, Alderson and Company Limited, of
                                Alexandria and Cairo, who exhibit a considerable number of
                                interesting engines and machines. The pair of 20. H.P. ploughing
                                engines. manufactured by Messra. John Fowler &amp; Co. (Lead) Ltd.
                                with their implements are conspicuously placed io front of thia
                                stood, needless to say they are beautifully finished and in every
                                respect among the leading article in this line. We understand that
                                Mesars. Allen, Alderson and Company Limited had prepared three sets
                                of tackle or this show, but both the 12 H P and 14 HP. set were sold
                                a few days since and it was impossible to spare them for them time
                                necessary for the show. Alongside these engines is one of Messrs.
                                Ruston, Proctor and Co. Ltd. well known Tibbin-making trashing
                                machines in motion. Here again we understand other machines
                                possessing especially interesting features for Upper Egypt prepared
                                for the show, bad to be delivered to buyers and were consequently
                                lost for exhibition purposes. We were informed that last year Mesars
                                Rustos, Proctor and Co. Limited made and delivered 986 thrashing
                                machines in all, number which we believe has never been hasten as
                                the production of one film in this line. The various portable steam
                                and oil engines exhibited on tbit stand call for no special comment
                                beyond the statement that they were all up to the usual standard of
                                the makers. We were specially interested in the new pattern helical
                                pumps by Messrs. Ruston, Proctor and Co. Limited, of which quite a
                                number were on show. These pumps are evidently great favorites, as
                                we notice many of then on the stands of others makers being driven
                                by various motor, and the "Ecola des Art et Metiers" have a
                                beautifully finished model of one of them on their stand.</p>
                            <p>Messrs. Allen, Alderson and Company Limited, also show a very
                                interesting deep lift centrifugal pump for wells 50 ft. deep, driven
                                by a 5 HP. oil engine. This was designed for Upper Egypt, where
                                there are hundreds of wells on which a sakieh was erected,
                                irrigating about 5 to 6 feddans. The cattle plague stopped many of
                                these and this small pump and engine was prepared to take the place
                                of the rakiehs. It cannot fail to be a real boon to the man of small
                                means. The same may be said of the 2. HP. oil engine and 8 helical
                                pump on the same stand, which is a responding plant fur Lower Egypt.
                                We cannot conclude this notice without alluding the 4 g HP. as
                                suction plant and engine on this stand, this a beautiful piece of
                                work, made by Raston, Proctor and CO. Limited, and we hear that
                                Messrs. Allen, Alderton and Co. Limited have sold a considerable
                                number of these, all of which are giving the utmost satis-faction,
                                they are suitable for corn mills, centrifugal pumps, electric
                                lighting and the hundreds of cases where a moderate amount of power
                                is required, combined with the utmost economy. We were informed that
                                the Aboukir Co. Ltd. has lately installed two of these with
                                centrifugal pumps, on their estates near Ramleh, and were much
                                pleased with them. Messrs. Allen. Alderson and Co. Limited have had
                                a special and long experience in tbit line, as previous to Messrs
                                Ruston, Proctor and Co. Limited taking up the manufacture they
                                erected a number of plants made by other continental films. We
                                noticed a good show of Messrs F. Reddaway and Co. Ltd’s famous
                                'Camel" brand belting. This article has made its way all over the
                                world and we need add little beyond stating that here as elsewhere
                                we were told it was the belt of the future. In conclusion we may say
                                that We were glad to see so good a show from the oldest firm in the
                                machinery line in Egypt, as there is often too much of a disposition
                                to rest on their lanrels long established businesses. Messrs. Alien,
                                Alderson end Co. Limited show however that they mean to move with
                                the time, and if possible keep a little ahead of it.</p>
                            <p>ARTHUR KOPPEL LTD.</p>
                            <p>This well known firm of world-wide repulsion has exhibited a number
                                of very interesting specimens of railway material of every
                                description. . We especially noticed a complete installation of
                                light railway plant, in connection with steel tipping wagons drawn
                                by a locomotive of 600 m/fn gauge, the working of which was much
                                admired. Among other items of interest our attention was called to'
                                light and heavy tails and sleepers of various section points, and
                                crossings, turntables, wheels and axles. Axelboxes and different
                                types of platforms and engine wagons used on light railways. All the
                                trucks bearing the mark "Arthur Koppel" combining lightness with
                                strength and durability are of the latest design, filled with
                                special patent roller bearings" which give a great saving of hauling
                                power. We can therefore highly recommend Messrs. Arthur Koppels
                                plant to all cultivators, industrial and contractors of this
                                country, which will surely find this material of greet value for
                                their respective work.</p>

                            <p>THE “EGYPTIAN STANDARD”</p>
                            <p>NEW NATIONALIST ORGAN</p>
                            <p>THE INAUGURAL TEA</p>
                            <p>At 5 o'clock on. Saturday afternoon the solemn inaugural ceremony of
                                a five o'clock tea to other in the "Egyptian Standard” and
                                ''L'Etendard Egyptian" took place at the Grand Continental Hotel,
                                Cairo. All the Egyptian followers of Mostapha Pasha Kamel mastered
                                in force, and the entire "Nationalist Party” were assembled in the
                                Arabic Hall nf the hotel, which consequently was almost full of
                                people. The first speech was delivered by the Praha. We need not
                                deal with the speech of Mustapha Pasha Kamel, for his statements
                                never vary and whether he is writing to * Le Tempe* or the
                                "Figaro"or contributing to his own vernacular organ his speeches
                                contain but a single theme concealed amidst floods of verbosity. It
                                is needless therefore to inform our readers that he again dilated
                                with impassioned eloquence on his great war cry of "Carthago eat
                                delenda" and after speaking on this topic for a considerable time
                                sat down amidst the enthusiastic plaudits of his audience.</p>
                            <p>Next came the French editor of "L'Etenard Egyptian."</p>
                            <p>M. Saint Ogan's discourse was embellished with some remarkable
                                historical allusions. We extract the following from the exordium:
                                Gentleman :</p>
                            <p>In the eighteenth century and under the ministry of Fleny France
                                remained inactive in presence of the Russian menace against Poland.
                                Fired with indignation, a Frenchman, the Count of Pelo, wished to
                                save his country's honor. He put himself at the head of a body of
                                his compatriots and. without instructions of any kind, obeying
                                simply a generous impulse, endeavoured to carry assistance to the
                                beleaguered ’own of Danzig.</p>
                            <p>I compare the group of Frenchmen who compose the editorial staff of
                                L'Eteadara Egyption with the above small army.</p>
                            <p>In hie peroration he invokes the Handled Years' War: </p>
                            <p>The ornel and undeserved ordeal of the English Occupation is only a
                                short episode.</p>
                            <p>the new paper under the Pacha's direction.</p>
                            <p>We need not give Mr. Rudy's speech in fall. The following preliminary
                                remarks of that gentleman will suffice:</p>
                            <p>Gentlemen.— It will necessary for me to explain to you Mr. Maloney's
                                and my presence among you here today, the reason why we have come to
                                Cairo to work under Monataf, Kamel Pasha's guidance on the editorial
                                staff of "The Egyptian Standard."</p>
                            <p>Before our arrival we heard and read about the foreign autocratic
                                government which is endeavoring to throttle Egyptian independence.
                                We learnt how it had come to the Nile Valey to advise the Egyptian
                                Government, to re-tore order before leaving and to teach the people
                                how to govern themselves. We had read about treaties signed in the
                                name of the British nation, and promises made by talesmen in the
                                name of the British nation. These treaties and promises have proved
                                to be empty, however; they were looked upon as worthless sheets of
                                papers and hollow word , involving the honor and dignity of no
                                nation. We were surprised, Mr. Manoley and I, at this disregard for
                                a given word. We could not understand it. Surely statesmen and
                                signatories —all of them British—could bear their own try no such
                                ill-will as to cause her name to be looked at askance abroad For was
                                not England one of the bulwarks of progress and civilization? Was
                                she not a free nation? How could she then tyrannize over a foreign
                                people, a country which was neither a colony nor a protecto rate,
                                but a friend? I repeat it, gentlemen, we could not understand it? We
                                were surprised to learn the ins and outs of certain happenings in
                                the Nile Valley; some even disgusted us when the gold palm with
                                which they bad been disguised wore off etc., etc.</p>
                            <p>After Mr. Rudy had finished the Pasha made another long speech and
                                then antes, "a 'anglaise" be it noted, was served and success to the
                                new papers was drank in tea.</p>
                            <p>The "Egyptian Standard" made its first appearance yesterday morning.'
                                It contains a number of articles all written in the style, which the
                                anglophobe vernacular Press has made ns acquainted with for years
                                past with the sole difference that English and not Arabic is the

                                brilliant play. Lieut. Crozier also, outside left, was very round
                                and safe. The first goal to the Dublin, the Guard’, gnat keeper was </p>
                            <p>caught napping, and the same may be said for the Dublins, when the
                                Guards scored their one and only goal. The judgement displayed

                            <p>KHARTOUM AGRICULTURAL SHOW</p>
                            <p>The fifth Annual Agricultural and Industrial how of Khartoum Province
                                was held in the Public Gardens last week, under the patronage of His
                                Excellency the Governor General. A large number of exhibits were
                                displayed in the usual manner.</p>
                            <p>In the morning, the exhibits were examined by the committee of
                                judges, and prizes were awarded. In the afternoon the gardens were
                                opened to the public, who came in large numbers. The weather was
                                fine, and the music furnished by the band of the King's Rifles added
                                considerably to the enjoyment of all present. The Governor General
                                and Lady Wingate visited the exhibition at 4.20 p.m. They were
                                received at the entrance by Miralai Stanton Bey and the Mamur of
                                Khartoum. His Excellency was much pleased with the exhibition and
                                expressed his satisfaction to the Governor.</p>
                            <p>At 5 o'clock refreshments were served at the refreshment pavilion.
                                The Governor entertained those that contributed to the prize fund,
                                to tea and refreshments. His Excellency left the gardens at 6 p.m.
                                after which prizes in cash and in the shape of fancy silver article,
                                were distributed among the successful exhibitors.</p>
                            <p>The success of the exhibition is in large measure due to the energy
                                and interest of Miralai Stanton Bey, tue Governor of the Pro-vince,
                                who was aided by his able staff of officers and officials. On the
                                whole, the exhibition was decidedly in advance of that of last year.
                                With the exception of the silverware department, the industrial
                                section did not make much advance. No carpentry work was exhibited
                                except a number of articles made at the Prison, and as we are told,
                                not especially designed fur the exhibition. The Gordon College
                                Workshops could certainly have sent a creditable exhibit of
                                carpentry work done by their pupils. The first prize for Angarebs
                                was awarded for an angareb of Zan wood, made in the, shape of a
                                European bedstead, and carved in a rather bizarre fashion. Measra.
                                Dilaveri exhibited a fine collection of osment pavement The
                                agricultural section was certainly in advance of former exhibition,
                                The cotton samples were of very fine quality, much superior to
                                anything hitherto seen. The vegetable collections attracted much
                                attention. There is no doubt but that market gardening would be
                                quite profitable in this country, if well taken in hand, and would
                                supply an important need. Very fine collection of grain of last
                                year's crop were exhibited. On the whole, says the "Sudan Times” the
                                improvement is quite marked though the agricultural section tedious,
                                more of it than the industrial The evidence is clear that the
                                Government is putting forth every reasonable effort to develop the
                                resources, of the country, and by such exhibitions is encouraging
                                Agriculture and Industry, and leading the country forward to a grand
                                destiny.</p>
