                        <head>Austria And Hungary.</head>
                        <p>That public opinion in Hungary has been bitterly offended by the attitude
                            of the Em- peror Francis Joseph is perhaps natural enough. Coldness to
                            the five representatives of the Hungarian Parliamentary coalition was
                            resented as an insult to the nation, and the Magyar people is to-day in
                            a dangerous mood. Althought a large proportion of its territories are
                            inhab- ited by hostile or indifferent Slavs and Roumanians, and though
                            the application of the proposed new army law by which com- mands must be
                            issued in Magyar to all the Hungarian contingents in the army of the
                            dual monarchy, might lead to the unpleasant discovery that more than a
                            third of the offi- cers of the Hungarian Crown were German by origin and
                            language, still the Magyar people seems ready to press Austria for the
                            fulfilment of its demands. The correspon- dent of the "Standard" at
                            Vienna gives the following interesting summary of the present situation,
                            which appears to explain the mo- tive of the sudden and disconcerting
                            action of the Emperor-King.</p>
                        <p>"There is no blinking the fact that Hungary for months past has been in a
                            state of actual revolt against the Crown. The Parliament has refused to
                            vote the contingents of recruits, or the Army Budget, or to ratify
                            commericial treaties, whilst the the municipalities, in obedience to the
                            Coalition, have refused to collect taxes or to pay rates. Whilst
                            nominally living under the Government of the Fejervary Cabinet, samed
                            and appointed by the King, the Hungarians have systematically refused to
                            obey its orders, and have been pratically governed in republican fashion
                            by themselves and their own represantitives. A peaceful revolution, it
                            is true, based on the constitu- tional grounds that the Government did
                            not command a majority, and therefore was no Government ; but, since the
                            majority refused to take over the reins except on conditions which
                            destroyed the little prerogative the King possessed, it amounted to a
                            very real revolution against the Crown. The King bore with this for a
                            long time, and might have borne it longer, were it not that, besides
                            being King of Hungary, he was, and is, Emperor of Austria, and the
                            passive revolution in Hungary began to react seriously, and threatened
                            to react very much more seriously, if it continued, in Austria. It
                            became clearer day by day that the longer the Coalition was left to
                            dominate in Hungary the more difficult it would become to bring the
                            country back into line with Austria, and indeed the wider grew the gap
                            which menaced to seperate the two countries altogether. Six months ago
                            the language used to-day would have been deemed impossible, and the
                            rupture is now discussed as an undesirable possi- bility, but a
                            possibility all the same. It is believed, however, that Hungary is not
                            yet prepared financially to cut herself off from Austria, however loudly
                            politicians may talk, and it is probably in the strength of this belief
                            that the Emperor issued his ultima- tum. That she is not prepared is
                            demonstrable, but a race like the Hungarian does not always count the
                            cost before acting, and herein lies the danger. On the other hand,
                            though the Hungarians govern Hungary, at least one- third of the
                            population is alien- German, Polish, Slovak, Ruthenian, Serb, and
                            Croatian. If ever the question of seperation between Hungary and Austria
                            arose, is is not at all clear what position these nationalities might
                            take up. They might insist on a maintenance of the dualism, or they
                            might decide to join Austria or their kindred States. These nation-
                            alities, habing at present practically no vote and no voice, can never
                            make themselves heard, and from Hungary comes only the Magyar trumpet.
                            If, however, universal suffrace were introduced a great change would
                            come over the scene-nor is it likely that the monar- chy could be
                            dissolved without their having a word in the matter. And herein lies the
                            grand mistake of the Hungarian Independence Party, in that they have
                            moved too soon. Had they waited another fifteen or twenty years they
                            might have developed their manu- factures and industries, and by
                            doubling their present system have Magyarised another fourth of the
                            population. They could then have come forth boldly to speak to the enemy
                            at the gate. As it is, they must be conscious of internal weakness, and
                            they have the nightmare of the universal suffrage, which will give votes
                            to all the feared and hated "nationalities," always dogging their steps.
                            They have been brought up with a sudden check of the lasso, and it will
                            be wise if they measure their strengthg well ere they stiffen their
                            necks against the strain. They are orally sure of Hungary for the Hunga-
                            rians if they bide their time, but they have to learn the value of the
                            precept Festina lente."</p>

                        Societe des Sucreries preseute dans la comptabilite da la Socidte Egyptienne

                    <p>“ Cependant — ajoute l’expert — la Socie genderala des Sucreries et de la
                        Raffinerie d'Egypte ayant garanti aux souscripteurs de la derniere emission

                        pendant 10 ans a compter du ler aout 1902, ainsi que pour le principal et
                        les interests des obligations emises par votre societe pour une somme de
                        L.E. 40,000, on doit se demander quelle valeur peut avoir aujourd’hui cette
                        ga- rautie, en presence de la situation actualle de la dite Societe
                        generale.</p>
                    <p>", Il est a noter qn’en exdecution de ses enga- gements du 19 septembre 1902,
                        fa Societe ger- nerale a parfait un et demi pour cent sur les millie actions
                        de la derniere emission pendant les exercices 1902-1903 et 1904-1905, et
                        fourni la totalite du 6 1/2 pour cent pour l’exercise 1903-1901, exercise
                        pour lequel il n'a pas ete distribue dividende.”</p>
                    <p>Il resulte de tout ceci, dit le "Progres”, que les souscripteurs de la
                        derniere emission ont perdu,par suite des pertes subies par les Sucre- ries,
                        la garantie de l’interet de leur argent, garantie d’autant plus precieuse
                        que cet in- teret leur avait ete paye, en tout du en partie, grace a
                        l’apport des Sucreries et qu’ils avaient droit de computer sur cet apport
                        jusqu a l’annee 1912. Quant aux obligataires, pour une som- me de Lst.
                        40,000, ils ont, perdu, pour la meme raison, la garantie du principal et des
                        interts. La Socidtd Egyptienne d'irrigation, bien que n’ayant pas essuye de
                        pertes materiehes du fait de la déconfitures des Sacreries, n’est done pas
                        bien fondee a avancer qu’elle n’a subi, de ce fait, aucun contre-coup. N’est
                        ce pas un contre coup, et des plus graves, que d’avoir perdu le garant, sous
                        la tutelle duquel elle etait nes, e avec l‘argent duquel elle a parfait le
                        paiement des dettes sociales.</p>
                    <p>Nous sommes convaincus que les adminis trateurs de la Societe Egyptienne se
                        rendant parfaitement compte de la situation voudront aviser aux mesures
                        necessaires, pour que ces contre coups n’aient pas, pour les actionnaires et
                        les obligataires, de plus facheuses conse quences.</p>
