                        <head>Austria And Hungary.</head>
                        <p>That public opinion in Hungary has been bitterly offended by the attitude
                            of the Em- peror Francis Joseph is perhaps natural enough. Coldness to
                            the five representatives of the Hungarian Parliamentary coalition was
                            resented as an insult to the nation, and the Magyar people is to-day in
                            a dangerous mood. Althought a large proportion of its territories are
                            inhab- ited by hostile or indifferent Slavs and Roumanians, and though
                            the application of the proposed new army law by which com- mands must be
                            issued in Magyar to all the Hungarian contingents in the army of the
                            dual monarchy, might lead to the unpleasant discovery that more than a
                            third of the offi- cers of the Hungarian Crown were German by origin and
                            language, still the Magyar people seems ready to press Austria for the
                            fulfilment of its demands. The correspon- dent of the "Standard" at
                            Vienna gives the following interesting summary of the present situation,
                            which appears to explain the mo- tive of the sudden and disconcerting
                            action of the Emperor-King.</p>
                        <p>"There is no blinking the fact that Hungary for months past has been in a
                            state of actual revolt against the Crown. The Parliament has refused to
                            vote the contingents of recruits, or the Army Budget, or to ratify
                            commericial treaties, whilst the the municipalities, in obedience to the
                            Coalition, have refused to collect taxes or to pay rates. Whilst
                            nominally living under the Government of the Fejervary Cabinet, samed
                            and appointed by the King, the Hungarians have systematically refused to
                            obey its orders, and have been pratically governed in republican fashion
                            by themselves and their own represantitives. A peaceful revolution, it
                            is true, based on the constitu- tional grounds that the Government did
                            not command a majority, and therefore was no Government ; but, since the
                            majority refused to take over the reins except on conditions which
                            destroyed the little prerogative the King possessed, it amounted to a
                            very real revolution against the Crown. The King bore with this for a
                            long time, and might have borne it longer, were it not that, besides
                            being King of Hungary, he was, and is, Emperor of Austria, and the
                            passive revolution in Hungary began to react seriously, and threatened
                            to react very much more seriously, if it continued, in Austria. It
                            became clearer day by day that the longer the Coalition was left to
                            dominate in Hungary the more difficult it would become to bring the
                            country back into line with Austria, and indeed the wider grew the gap
                            which menaced to seperate the two countries altogether. Six months ago
                            the language used to-day would have been deemed impossible, and the
                            rupture is now discussed as an undesirable possi- bility, but a
                            possibility all the same. It is believed, however, that Hungary is not
                            yet prepared financially to cut herself off from Austria, however loudly
                            politicians may talk, and it is probably in the strength of this belief
                            that the Emperor issued his ultima- tum. That she is not prepared is
                            demonstrable, but a race like the Hungarian does not always count the
                            cost before acting, and herein lies the danger. On the other hand,
                            though the Hungarians govern Hungary, at least one- third of the
                            population is alien- German, Polish, Slovak, Ruthenian, Serb, and
                            Croatian. If ever the question of seperation between Hungary and Austria
                            arose, is is not at all clear what position these nationalities might
                            take up. They might insist on a maintenance of the dualism, or they
                            might decide to join Austria or their kindred States. These nation-
                            alities, habing at present practically no vote and no voice, can never
                            make themselves heard, and from Hungary comes only the Magyar trumpet.
                            If, however, universal suffrace were introduced a great change would
                            come over the scene-nor is it likely that the monar- chy could be
                            dissolved without their having a word in the matter. And herein lies the
                            grand mistake of the Hungarian Independence Party, in that they have
                            moved too soon. Had they waited another fifteen or twenty years they
                            might have developed their manu- factures and industries, and by
                            doubling their present system have Magyarised another fourth of the
                            population. They could then have come forth boldly to speak to the enemy
                            at the gate. As it is, they must be conscious of internal weakness, and
                            they have the nightmare of the universal suffrage, which will give votes
                            to all the feared and hated "nationalities," always dogging their steps.
                            They have been brought up with a sudden check of the lasso, and it will
                            be wise if they measure their strengthg well ere they stiffen their
                            necks against the strain. They are orally sure of Hungary for the Hunga-
                            rians if they bide their time, but they have to learn the value of the
                            precept Festina lente."</p>

                        Behring's statement of the discovery of a cure for tuberculosis commands the
                        respect and attention of the entire world, as emanating from the discoverer
                        of the antidiphtheric serum and a man of high scientific reputation. His
                        announcement of a curative agents only amounts as yet to conviction and
                        awaits demonstration. It is hoped, however, that this newest tuberculin will
                        not share the fate of its predecessors.</p>

                        <p>Turkish Triumphs.—Marshal Faizi Pasba, commander in-chief of the Ottoman

                            it that the Sultan’s troops had marched with triumph to Breem and
                            occupied that town on the 22nd ultimo. The population are said to have
                            been submitted without resistance, and to have prayed and beseeched
                            Heaven to protect the Khalif and keep him victorious.</p>
                        <p>Prisoners by Deputy. — “Al Mokattsm" learns that two men of Meiet E!

                            petty crime, proved to have replaced the real culprits. Both prisoners
                            were identified as brothers of tho condemned men. These four brothers
                            are said to he on bad terms with the omdeh of their village, and to be
                            relatives of the ghaffir, who perhaps had a hand in arranging the

                        <p>Bedouin Brigandage. — "A1 Mokattam” states that a band of Kadeirah

                            camels belonging to a native named Odeh Melhoos close to El Arish. Their
                            owner, terrified by the Bedoaiu, made no resistance, but informed the
                            Governer af El Arish, begging that his camels should be recovered. Our
                            contemporary adds that no measures have yet been taken tor the recovery
                            of the animals.</p>
                        <p>Arment Teftish.—In our issue of tho 2nd instant we mentioned that the
                            Government had, in response to a petition from the inhabitants of four
                            villages comprised in the Ament teftish, decided upon returning the
                            lands in question, which had hitherto formed part of the Daira Sanieh
                            Administration, to the pet tioners on certain conditions. We are now
                            informed that the price of sale has been fixed at £35 per feddan payable
                            in 20 equal yearly instalments with interest at 5 1/2 per cent. per

                        <p>Orwat-el-Woska Schools— H.E. Risz Pasha recently paid a visit to the
                            school which bears his name at Bacos, Ramleh, and expressed himself
                            highly pleased with the excellent discipline maintained in tho school
                            and with the progress and tidiness of the pupils. We learn that the
                            Pasha not only publicly complemented the head master and the teachers on
                            the results of their care and attention, but communicated with the
                            President of the Orwat-e!-Woska Benevolent Society, announcing his
                            intention of presenting each of them with a sum equal to a month's
                            salary.</p>
                        <p>Sanitary Department. — The Direction General of the Sanitary

                            premises in the groups of of the Ministry of Public Works that are now
                            approaching completion and cost some £4,500 to build. The present
                            offices will in future be used for the auxiliary services and stores.
                            Sir Horace Pinching and Professor Bitter, director of the Hygienic
                            Institute, who have been representing the Egyptian Government at the
                            Tuberculosis Congress in Paris, are returning by the French mail of next

                            Institute now being constructed by the Government, is shortly expected
                            from Paris. This new Institute will replace the one which has until now
                            been attached to the Italian Hospital at Abbassieb, and towards the
                            maintenance of which the Government contributes a yearly sum.</p>

                            claiments—heirs of the late Khedive Ismail—have been summoned to appear

                            and the Princes will be held responsible for the interest, viz : about
                            £100,000 a year. The total amount that is to be paid to the shareholders
                            and holders of founders' shares amounts to about the same sum that the

                        <p>An inquest was opened yesterday at the British Consulate in Cairo before
                            Mr. Pio Sciortino, Pro-Consul, to enquire into the circumstances
                            attending the death of Private Charles Harris of E. Company of the Rifle
                            Brigade, stationed at the Citadel, who shot himself in the head with his
                            rifle while on sentry duty between the hours of 4 And 6 p.m. that day.
                            The jury was composed of Messrs. D. Macdonald, A. Gregory,and A.G. K.
                            Levick. After being sworn they proceeded to view the body at the
                            Citadel, and on their return to court they heard the evidence of Private
                            Alcoyne Bayliss, of the same company, who deposed how the deceased, on
                            receiving a letter from England on Saturday and reading it, appeared
                            depressed and more reticent than usual, and how he found the body near
                            the tennis court with the rifle by the side and marks of blood on the
                            ground, caused by the wound from the bullet, which entered the month and
                            came out at the back of the neck. At this stage the enquiry was

                            evidence.</p>

                    <div type="item">
                        <p>Our readers have doubtless remarked the numerous arrests and
                            perquisitions effected by the Khafieh or Ottoman secret police in Syria
                            at the expense of Egyptians or persons in frequent communication with
                            Egypt during the spring and summer of the present year, to which we have
                            given some prominences in our columns. It appears that the Turkish
                            central authorities, alarmed by the temporary success of the revolt in
                            the Yemen, and terrified by the reports of certain mischief-makers, who
                            are unhappily domiciled in Egypt, of an impending Arab rising, have for
                            some time past encouraged the local authorities to search houses for
                            arms and seditions literature, to arrest sheikhs and notables, and in
                            short to add fresh burdens to the lives of their subjects. It now
                            appears that the Porte has begun to suspect the reports of its own
                            agents, and an instructive story reaches us from Aleppo which goes far
                            to support our view that the "Nahda Arabiya’’ bogy was used by
                            unscrupulous agents to secure the Acquiescence of a frightened
                            government in their corrupt and oppressive practices.</p>
                        <p>It appears that the Vali of Aleppo recently informed the Mabein that he
                            had seditious news and begged to be allowed to convey it to
                            Constantinople. Leave was granted him and the nervous governor informed
                            the Porte that a terrible Arab plot to seize Aleppo was maturing and
                            could only be checked by prompt and severe measures. He therefore begged
                            to be allowed to seize all weapons and search every house in the town.
                            The Government, which was aware that Aleppo contained large numbers of
                            wealthy merchants, showed a certain reluctance to commence operations
                            without getting further details of the plot. Enquiries proved that the
                            story of the conspiracy was based on the flimsiest evidence ; the
                            nervous Vali was removed and Nazim Pasha, ex-Vali of Diarbekir, rules in
                            his stead.</p>

                            <p>The first outward bound steamer to come out of the canal since the
                                stoppage, was the M.M. mail steamer Yarra, which arrived at 7.35
                                p.m. yesterday, and was followed by 27 more steamers,the mail boats
                                coming first. The distance between the steamers was a mile and the
                                whole canal presented a rare sight owing to the numerous
                                searchlights of the vessels.</p>
                            <p>With the exception of a collision of the Austrian Lloyd steamer
                                Africa with the Dutch Mail boat in the canal, all went on remarkably
                                well, and by 5.20 this morning all the steamers were in the Suez
                                bay. A few steamers are still detained at Suez, as they have not yet
                                received tje electric light projector necessary for the passage of
                                the Canal.</p>

                            <p>Thirty four boats have now arrived from Suez, this mail boats coming
                                first. The harbour is still very full of vessels and it has been
                                found to necessary to order six or seven incoming boats to anchor
                                outside until the second batch of those which are in harbour have
                                entered the canal, which will probably be about half past six
                                to-night.</p>

                                    were held in the new Graving Dock, Gabbari, on Saturday
                                    afternoon before a large gathering of visitors which far
                                    excelled the attendance on previous occasions, and showing how
                                    much the club is advancing. Among those present we noticed H.H.
                                    Prince Aziz Hassan, Rear-Admiral Sir R. Massie Blomfield,
                                    K.C.M.G., and Lady , Blomfield, Mr. Freeman, acting British
                                    Consul General, and Mrs. Freemau, Mr. Ambrose Ralli,
                                    Vice-President of the Municipality, Mr. Critchley, manager of

                                    and many others of the elite of Alexandria. During the coarse of
                                    the afternoon a telegram was received from H.E. Sir Reginald
                                    Wingate Pasha, regretting his inability to attend, and
                                    expressing his wishes for an entirely successful afternoon, and
                                    Mr. A. Mitchell Innes, Under Secretary of State, Ministry of
                                    Finance, also wrote regretting that a previous engagement
                                    prevented him being present and wishing the club every success
                                    in their meeting. The weather was delightful, but the burning
                                    sun was rather trying during the earlier part of the afternoon.
                                    The want of a swimming bath is the more especially felt on these
                                    occasions, end we express the hope that at no very distant date
                                    the Municipality will make an effort to supply this long-felt
                                    want. There are a large number of swimmers and bathers in
                                    Alexandria, and during the hottest parts of the trying summer
                                    days the luxury of a bath is denied to the many who are unable
                                    to afford the time to go out to the covered baths at San Stefano
                                    or Mex. As we prophesied, some excellent swimming was witnessed,
                                    and so well were the handicaps framed that the spectators were
                                    more than once at a loss to distinguish between the winner and
                                    swimmer-np. The dock was very effectively decorated for the
                                    occasion with flags and, with the gay assembly, presented a very
                                    animated scene. Mounted and foot policemen, kindly provided by
                                    the authorities, kept the approaches and entrances clear; in
                                    fine everything had been most excellently arranged and the
                                    organising committee are to be congratulated upon the success
                                    with which their hard labour met. Mr. Walter F. j Sarjeant,
                                    chairman of the club, showed himself to be a hard worker and
                                    able adviser ; Mr. H. S. Martin, hon. sec., who has devoted
                                    every moment of his spare time to the work since his return from
                                    leave, must be especially pleased at the reward of success,
                                    which was in a very large measure due to him; and we most not
                                    omit to mention Messrs. Purvis and Webb, under whose supervision
                                    the dock had been prepared to receive the members of the club
                                    and their guests. Mr. D. Dampergola's Orchestra helped to
                                    enliven the proceedings with a number of selections admirably
                                    rendered. But to turn to the sports themselves: these, though
                                    not astounding when compared with the world’s records, were
                                    nevertheless of a high class and showed what great good the
                                    formation of n swimming club in Alexandria had done. The
                                    progress was marked and the performances of the juniors were
                                    especially creditable, and pleasing as promising a great future
                                    for the club. For event I., which consisted of the four
                                    preliminary heats of the 60 yards handicap for H. E. the
                                    Sirdar’s medal, seventeen competitors turned out. In the first
                                    heat A. A. Eeclestone and N. W. Ames cameijn 1st and 2nd
                                    respectively, in the second heat W. Wood and C.S. Scarth ; in
                                    the third E.A. Darton and G. N. Cheeseman, aand in the fourth
                                    P.E. Harrison and W. 0. Mace. Event II. was the 60 yards
                                    juniors' handicap for members under sixteen years of age. Five
                                    boys competed and the excellent handicapping was shown by the
                                    nearness of the race. Harry Ecclestone, a boy only just turned
                                    si. years, went off in nob’e style and the plucky little fellow
                                    kept his lead to the end amid loud shouts of "Go it, nipper." W.
                                    H. Talbot, however, drew up to the leader very well and was
                                    closely followed by C. E. L. Randall, who had to give 85 seconds
                                    start to Elsworth, and between the first three competitors there
                                    was barely the difference of a "touch." Event III., 60 yards
                                    veterans’ handicap for members of 35 years of age and over, was
                                    won fairly easily by W. Wood, but only a few inches separated A.
                                    Jackman and M. B. Irvin, who came in 2nd and 3rd respectively.
                                    The final of the Sirdar’s medal handicap was then swum off, the
                                    competitors being W. Wood, G. N. Chessman, P. E. Harrison, N. w.
                                    Ames, C. S. Scarth, E. A. Darton, W.O. Mace and A. A.
                                    Ecclestone. Ecclestone was scratch, conceding seventeen seconds
                                    to the limit man, and he won the race in a splendid manner.
                                    Starting off with a clean and strong stroke he almost
                                    immediately gained ground, and as the winning point was
                                    approached he just managed to overhaul Darton. His excellent
                                    swim and graceful action excited general admiration, and he was
                                    hailed as winner with loud applause. Darton, too, made a
                                    splendid fight, gaining second place, and Cheeseman came in a
                                    very good third. The juniors diving championship, for which a
                                    cup was presented by the hen. sec., followed. The diving which
                                    was from 3.5, and 8 feet, was not of an exceptionally high
                                    order, but considering the ages of the competitors it was as
                                    good as could be expected. Randall secured the cup and
                                    Mitchinson and Harry Ecclestone were awarded 2nd and 3rd places
                                    respectively. Event VI plunging championship, followed. As in
                                    previous years much difficulty was experienced, in marking off
                                    the distances but the judge finally placed Ames, A.B. Collier,
                                    end Mace. 1st, 2nd, and 3rd in order of the names. The prizes
                                    for this event were very kindly presented by the Alexandria
                                    Tramway Company Ltd., while the cup was given by the Alexandria
                                    and Ramleh Railway Co. Event VIL was a pole watch between the
                                    Alexandria Swimming Club and the Eastern Telegraph Company which
                                    was very evenly contested, though the E.T.C. had not been been
                                    able to practice for the match. The club were the first to
                                    score, Darton throwing in with splendid aim very soon after play
                                    began. ei d half time was called with the iowe care ab 1 to niL
                                    On changing ends the E.T.C. did better and drew even with a good
                                    shot from Incledon but only a minute before time. Ecclastone
                                    scored for the club and thus secured them the verdict. A ten
                                    minutes interval was then given but was not without some
                                    amusement; Mr. Martin, who bad been on dry land all this time,
                                    supervising and judging; was suddenly seized with a craving for
                                    the water and rushing along the spring board shoved off for a
                                    dive with the full force of his fourteen and a half stone; the
                                    board snapped and it was only the last fibers of wood which
                                    prevented it from accompanying him in his dive; he also gave
                                    some neat exhibition dives. The blindfold race insugurated the
                                    second half of the programme and afforded endless amusement.
                                    Some swam in circles, others returned to the starting point
                                    almost immediately, and not a few endeavoured to entangle
                                    themselves in tubs bad life-buoys which were placed on one side
                                    to await the obstacle race. Collier, swimming remerkably
                                    straight, won fairly easily and was followed by Mace and Lovell
                                    almost together. The seniors’ diving competition followed this
                                    and some very good diving was witnessed. The winners were, in
                                    order, Collier Ecclestone and Darton. The first, two tying for
                                    first place, had to dive again, when Collier gained the verdict
                                    owing to Ecclestone turning over slightly. Darton was inclined
                                    to "buck” but just kept outside the limits of the definition and
                                    his neatness obtained him third place. The obstacle race was
                                    most amusing and exciting. The competitors had to pass through
                                    life-buoys and barrels and over and under poles and some curious
                                    struggles were witnessed. Irvin the limit man looked a certain
                                    winner but on his return he stuck in a barrel and, being of no
                                    slight build, it was with great difficulty that he managed to
                                    extricate himself. The 1st, 2nd, and 3rd places were awarded to
                                    Ecclestone, Mace, and Scarth respectively. The Military polo
                                    match between teams of the Departmental Corps and Royal Berks
                                    was well fought but the former were distinctly superior and won
                                    fairly easily by 4 goals to 1. The Royal Berks were rather
                                    weakened by the department of their best men for Khartoum but
                                    they made a splendid fight against a strong team and there was
                                    very little fouling. Each member of the winning team received a
                                    money prize. The juniors then “walked the pole" and for this
                                    event, Randall secured the only prize. The seniors followed and
                                    Collier was the only competitor to take the flag out of its
                                    socket and therefore gained the verdict. When the military tug
                                    of war came off it was getting dark. The Departmental Corps and
                                    Royal Berks pulled against each other and as in the polo match
                                    the former won by two pulls to nil, and this was the concluding
                                    event.</p>
                                <p>Lady Btomfield then distributed the prizes supported by Prince
                                    Azic Hassan, Admiral Sir Massie Blomfield, K.C M.G., Mr Waiter
                                    F. Sarjeant, and Mr. Martin, but be before we refer to this part
                                    of the programme we must mention that she was presented on her
                                    arrival at 4 p.m. with a beautiful bouquet by Mr. Walter F.
                                    Sarjeant, and at the conclusion she was asked to accept a very
                                    handsome silver card case from the club as a souvenir of the
                                    pccassion. After each successful competitor had reveived his
                                    reward Mr. Sarjeant made a short speech in which he thanked Lady
                                    Blomfield for her kindness and the interest which she took in
                                    the club as was shown by her presence there that afternoon at
                                    the centre of such a large gathering. H.H. Prinoe Aziz Haasan
                                    and Admiral Blomfield were, he said, very welcome guests. To
                                    Prince Aziz he had to offer the heartiest thanks on behalf of
                                    the club for the generosity whcch he had shown that afternoon in
                                    offering a prize for any race next year which the club might
                                    choose. It has since been decided that a 220 yards scratch race
                                    will be swum for the Prince's prize, which will be a valuable
                                    silver cup. Remarking upon the success of the club Mr. Sarjeant
                                    mentioned that when it was formed three years ago there was but
                                    a handful of members while now they numbered two hundred and
                                    seventy. Before the gathering broke up, Admiral Sir Massie
                                    Blomfield in a short speech proposed a vote of thanks to Mr.
                                    Sarjeant and the energetic committee who had organised the
                                    sports and expressed the great pleasure which it bad been to
                                    Lady Blomfield and himself to witness the excellent exhibition
                                    of the art of swimming which had taken place that afternoon. We
                                    must not omit to mention that the chairman of the Club has
                                    kindly given a silver cup for the seniors’ diving championship
                                    and that the captains of the merchant marine service trading to
                                    Alexandria have most generally promised to present a cup for a
                                    junior championship to be decided upon later.</p>

                    jours en retard sur l'annee derniere, mais l’on est satis- fait du resultat que
                    l'on espere, en general, su- perieur a celui de 1904.</p>
                <p>Josqu’a ce jour, les rendements a l’egre- nage, sont d'environ 4 % inferieurs a
                    ceux de l’annee precedente.</p>

                    mois d’aout, sont dans l'ensemble satisfaisants, mais le resultat definitif
                    depend encore des influences atmospheriques d'Octobre.</p>
                <p>Dans la Haute-Egypte et le Fayunm l’on constate des degats considerables et malge
