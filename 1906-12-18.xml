                    <head>THE UNIVERSITY OF EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>An article in a recent issue of “East and West” deals ably with the question
                        of the pro- posed National University. Our contemporary says :</p>
                    <p>The papers of last week reported the election of a permanent committee and
                        certain office- bearers for the great project at a meeting of subscribers on
                        the 30th ulto. The reports show ed clearly that the movers in the enterprise
                        are beginning to feel keenly the initial diffi- culties inseparable from
                        such great schemes, are admitting them to themselves, yet are not making
                        them occasions of despair, but of fur- ther and more sustained effort. It
                        was rightly pointed out by the gentleman who has been elected to the
                        honourable, arduous, and intense- ly responsible post of vice-president that
                        in setting their hands to this enterprise they had staked the name of Egypt
                        before their coun- try, before the Government (as was explicitly
                        recognised), the foreign residents, and Europe , iteelf. That is perfectly
                        true. May so tremen- dous a thought only nerve them to win the stake, If
                        they do, they will have done a service for this country even greater than
                        the imme- _ diate service of giving it a university. This is why no
                        well-wisher of this country and its people can help wishing well also to the
                        men who have taken on themselves so enormous 4 responsibility, always
                        provided that the note struck in the original manifesto is going to dominate
                        the whole project in the future.</p>
                    <p>The meeting on the 30th November was primarily for the election of a
                        committee and office-bearers, so that it is perhaps hardly fair to criticise
                        its proceedings from any other point of view. Otherwise one might say that
                        too much was said about the raising of the money needed, and too little
                        about what seems to us the more important because more imme- diate duty,
                        viz., the fanning, and in the large majority of cases the kindling, of the
                        flame of public spirit throughout the country, and the winning of the
                        confidence of all the public- spirited men that may already exist, so as to
                        enlist their support. Unless this is done, it is hopeless to think that any
                        number of appeals, or desperate and undignified expedients such as lotteries
                        (which we earnestly hope will be tabooed), will produce a fraction of what
                        is necessary. How, then, are. public confidence and public spirit to be
                        aroused, maintain- ed, and enlarged? That is the question of questions for
                        the newly-constituted committee and officers, Clearly this task is a far
                        greater and more radical one than a vast begging- campaign, public
                        subscription-lists, compli- ments all round, circu’ars, letters to omdehs,
                        and all such familiar and time-honoured devices. The thing is too vast, too
                        serious for this. We reiterate once more our conviction that the country
                        needs educating upon the question of university education. Probably very few
                        know even what it means, or how it differs from the collegiate education
                        already supplied, or what practical modifications of the present system it
                        will involve, or whether it is a necessity or a pleasant luxury. The
                        manifesto shows that at least some of the leaders have a grasp of the above
                        questions in principle, but it is very possible that even they require much
                        further study of practical, all-important details. We repeat that study is
                        what is first needed; study and the means of con- tinuously, effectively,
                        and rapidly communi- cating the results of that study throughout the
                        country. The Universities of all the chief countries of the world, and more
                        particularly India, should be studied and the applicability of their systems
                        to Egypt carefully reported upon. Their various solutions of the religious
                        problem should be noted. Information about their relation to technical and
                        professional education, their solution of the residential problem, the place
                        taken by athletics in them, their discipline, ordering, and governance, —
                        should be massed and systematised, and debat- ed and corresponded about in a
                        Review specially for the purpose. All this clearly means the spending of
                        money for the expenses of such a commission, and of such a Reriew, for the
                        latter should not only be the best- editéd and best-got up Review in the
                        country, but should, with other pamphlets and publica- tions issued from the
                        same office, be pro- duced at prices which should render the widest possible
                        circulation feasible. There are always some who have not the courage to
                        spend money which will not yield an immediate and visible return. But the
                        di- rectors of this enterprise must not be of such poor calibre. Long views.
                        and not short ones are needed, for it is a long future for which they are
                        building. We respectfully com- mend these thoughts to the notice of the com-
                        mittee, with our hearty good wishes to them at the outest of their laborious
                        work.</p>

                        761 concealed in his boots, and P.T. 1,414 was found in the possession of
                        the other. In the course of the enquiry they admitted the theft.</p>

                    <p>Education is the order of the day nearly everywhere ; in Egypt this question
                        is very complicated. Nevertheless, as regards langua- ges, at the Berlitz
                        Schools (Cairo, 1 Sharia Kamel; Alexandria, 12 rue Rosette) the num- ber of
                        pupils continues to increase because the Berlitz method is the ‘royal road
                        to learning languages, being the most logical and the most practical.

                    <p>Affray on Steamer.</p>
                    <p>A serious brawl took place on the Russian steamer Tchichatcboff, which
                        arrived at Alex- andria last Saturday from Odessa and the Pireos, As she was
                        nearing Crete the deck passengers, mostly Armenians and Greeks, came to
                        blows. The Armenians made them selves somewhat too free with the Greek
                        women, which their men folk fiercely resented. A conflict ensued, which
                        lasted for some time, and which was only terminated by the stre- nuous
                        efforts of the captain, officer, and crew. A number of the combatants were
                        put in irons and handed over to the custody of the Alex- andria police on
                        arrival,</p>

                        of, much less to have taken photographs from. Por all the difficulties the
                        photographs were taken with perfect results, results which will be

                    <p>An Exciting Soene.</p>
                    <p>A most exciting scene occurred yesterday afternoon in the main street of the
                        Attarin quarter of Alexandria. A middle-aged Greek woman, belonging to a
                        respectable family, suddenly threw herself on the tram line just in front of
                        a passing tram. The street was crowded at the time, and many of the
                        bystanders were paralysed with terror at the painful spectacle. Just as the
                        tram was about to put an end to the woman’s life a Greek gentleman, of the
                        name of Orestes Notares, rushed forward and picked her up in the nick of
                        time. She struggled fiercely with her rescuer and tried again to effect her
                        purpose. Mr. Notaras called a passerby to his assistance and the two men
                        succeeded in mastering the frantic female, whom they conveyed to her home.
                        The motive for her attempt at suicide was that she was “tired of life.” </p>

                    <head>EDUCATION IN EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>MINISTER'S OPINION,</p>
                    <p>One of the most interesting features in the Native Press of the week is the
                        interview granted by Saad Pasha Zaghloul to a corres- pondent of “Al Ah-am.”
                        In view of the violent criticism which have long been directed against the
                        Ministry of Education, Saad Pasha’s views deserve fall quotation :—</p>
                    <p>"I have visited three kattabs, four primary schools, all the secondary
                        schools, and certain special schools, such as the Nasrieh girls’ training
                        college, the fikis’ school at Abd el Aziz, the Sanieh and Abbas girls’
                        schools, the School of Agriculture, and the Polytechnic. I noted with
                        pleasure the progress realised by all these schools, and mentioned it in my
                        speech delivered on the occasion of the granting of subventions to fikis,
                        and since published by the Press. I find the organisation to be perfect and
                        the methods of instruction easily followed and underatood by the pupils. I
                        cannot deny that the pupils are making obvious progress. It is true, as you
                        say, that the Press criticises the schools and their methods, but I am
                        vastly astonished at the sort of criticism that is indulged in by persons
                        who have never taken the trouble to visit the schools to learn by ocular
                        demonstration the enormous difference between their present and their former
                        condition. The head masters and pro- fessors do their utmost for the success
                        of their mission ; that isa ‘fait établi,” and I greatly regret that the
                        public does not appreciate their work and their merits. As for the lacuna in
                        instruction to which you allude, these may be derived from certain
                        imperfections in the programs. I have not yet had the time to examine them
                        minutely with the object of learning whether they are complete or not, and
                        so I cannot make any pronouncement on the subject for the moment.</p>
                    <p>“To sum up, the general condition of affairs is flourishing and the schools
                        are making great strides on the path of progress...... I shall be delighted
                        it those who are interested in education in this country, members of the
                        Press, and all who criticise instruction here and its methods, those whose
                        criticism is based upon the necessary experience and knowledge, would be
                        good enough to visit the Government schools so that their critiques, if they
                        have any to make, may rest upon s solid basis. I shall be very willing to
                        take into serious con- sideration all such criticism based upon per- sonal
                        observation</p>
                    <p>“T have remarked the small number of pupils at the School of Agriculture and
                        the girls’ school. A third of the pupils at the former institution are
                        Europeans, while ours is essentially an agricultural country and its people
                        ought to attach much more importance to agriculture than they do. The reason
                        of tic, I hear, is the desire of the students to form part of the personnel
                        of the Government, which cannot content them all.”</p>
                    <p>The Minister concluded by saying that he would do his best for the study of
                        agriculture.</p>
                    <p>Some of our contemporaries were inclined to hint that Saad Pasha had intended
                        to curse the Ministry. He bas obviously remain- ed to bless, </p>
                    <p>Saad Pasha Zaghlonl visited the technical school at Boulac on Sunday in the
                        company of Mr. Dunlop, and was present at the distribu- tion of prizes, at
                        the close of which his Excel- lency made the following speech :—</p>
                    <p>“You have completed your studies, and your success deserves the prizes you
                        have received. I congratulate you all, and hope that your conduct and your
                        industry will serve as a model in the future to your school-fellows. You
                        mast remember that these are not the last of your rewards. Another and a
                        greater reward awaits you, provided you go in search of it. I refer to the
                        benefits you will receive from your country- men if you win their
                        confidence. You will attain this end if you keep always before you the
                        improvement of your work and the perfec- tion of your methods. Follow this
                        end, and you will attain this great reward.”</p>
                    <p>Yesterday, Saad Pasha inspected the Khedi- vial Law School accompanied by MM.
                        Lambert and Archibald, and expressed his great satis- faction with all he
                        saw. His Excellency visited the classes of the English and French sections
                        and asked the students several questions. He also inspected the library,
                        finally leaving at 10.30 a.m. Tin school this morning, and will probably
                        visit some other school in the afternoon.</p>

                    <head> THE NATIONALIST PARTY</head>
                    <p> A FIERCE DISCUSSION.</p>
                    <p>Another amusing storm in a teacup is now raging. The combatants are Mustapha
                        Pasha Kamel and Dr. Nimr, and the subject of their dispute is Mr. Robertson,
                        M.P. Mutapha Pasha Kamel has telegraphed to “Al Lewa’’ from Paris stating
                        that Mr. Robertson has written to the “Times” to contradict the remarks
                        ascribed to him by Dr. Nimrio “Al Mokattam.” The latter paper is very angry
                        and calls the Pacha a “haggas” (scoundrel). The rejoinder to the Pasha’s
                        telegram runs as follows :-</p>
                    <p>That “haggas” (Kamel) who showed when in Cairo that he does not mind the
                        publication of “Al Mokattam,” now clearly shows that that newspaper’s
                        statements have had a very dam- aging cffect on his mind. As soon as he
                        arrived in Paris he sent a wire to his paper announcing that Mr. Robertson
                        bad contradicted what we had said about him in “Al Mokattam.” Bot the
                        “haggas” seems to have forgot- ten that “Al Mokattam” had imputed to Mr.
                        Robertson many things which he can never deny, as can be seen from the issue
                        of that paper numbered 5862. If the preten- sions of “Al Lewa” are correct,
                        and Mr. Ro- bertson has contradicted “Al Mokattam’s” statements, this is
                        tantamont on the part of “Al Lewa” that Mr. Robertson confesses he is a tool
                        in the bands of Kamel. “Al Mo- kattam” is waiting for the “Times” to arrive
                        in order to study Mr. Robertson’s letter, and then it will give an opinion
                        on the matter.</p>
                    <p>The following is the text of an article that appeared recently in “The
                        ‘limes,” which will supply the key to the above-mentioned controversy :—</p>
                    <p>Dr. Faris Nimr, editor of “El Mokattam,”bas published an interesting series
                        of articles on the attitude of the British political parties and Press
                        towards Egyptian questions, as noted by him during a visit to England in the
                        autumn of this year. The last of these articles contains an account of a
                        conversation between Dr. Nimr and Mr. John Robertson, M.P., as to the ru-
                        moured visit of the latter to Egypt at the head of a group of Radical
                        members. Mr. Robertson, after begging Dr. Nimr to deny the story in the most
                        unqualified terms, expressed his hope that the Egyptian public would
                        understand the Radical members of Parliament considered it necessary to keep
                        a careful watch over the policy and administration of the agents of the
                        British Empire in India and in Egypt in order to assure themselves that
                        their methods and aims conformed with British ideas and stan- dards. Their
                        sole object was to raise the moral and material condition of the peoples of
                        those countries. They did not aim at bringing about any changes in England’s
                        position as regards Egypt, they recognized the remarkable services rendered
                        to that country by Lord Cromer, and would never abandon Egypt to the Turks
                        or to itself. Mr. Robertson added that he was now convinced that Mustepba
                        Pasha Kamel’s policy was pro-Turkish rather than pro-Egyp- tian.</p>
                    <p>After the optimistic messages sent from London by Mustapha Pasha Kamel to “El
                        Lewa” and other organs of the Opposition, it bas come as an unpleasant
                        surprise to the Egyptian Nationalist extremists to discover that Lord
                        Cromer’s position is unshaken and that the tirades of Mr. Wilfred Blant do
                        not express the sentiments of the majority of the nation. The fact is that
                        the Oriental, however gifted, seldom understands the real nature of party
                        government and almost always attaches an exaggerated importance to the
                        criticisms which from time to time assail the principal agents of a
                        democratic Empire.</p>
                    <p>Many Egyptian Nationalists doubtless look- ed upon recent Parliamentary
                        attacks on details of British policy and administration in Egypt as
                        manifestations of the distrust of an im- portant, perhaps of the most
                        important, sec- tion of the British people. Identifying the criticisms of a
                        Parliamentary democracy with the manifestations of the displeasure of an
                        absolute Monarch, they imagined Lord Cromer to be in much the same position
                        as an Oriental Vali whose great ability and inflaence had began to arouse
                        the suspicion or the jealousy of a Sultan or of influential members of his
                        entourage.</p>
                    <p>In the meantime Mustapha Kamel affects a lofty scorn of the allegations of
                        the chief organ of “anti-patriots” and. intruders,” but, in spite the active
                        support of the Court party, his reputation must suffer among the members of
                        his party from Dr. Nimr’s disclo- sures.</p>

                    <p>"IL TROVATORE"</p>
                    <p>On Saturday, Mme Chaix-Bonheur made her debut in “Trovatore.” We have seldom
                        heard a better contralto—certainly not in Egypt—and one with greater
                        expression and less mannerisms. But the chorus and the orchestra were—well,
                        what they have been for a fortnight, and their display seemed at first to
                        upset the leaders. At the end of the 2nd, act the chorus was fist, the
                        orchestra out of tune and time, and every one with an ear in the audience
                        was looking aghast at his neigh- bour, when M. Escalais appeared, a ‘deus ex
                        machina” amidst the cacophony, and singing magnificently, brought them into
                        tune in no time, M. Mezy was a little inclined to be flat. Perhaps he caught
                        this tendency from the chorus. Mme Baron sang well. Of the orchestra no more
                        need be said.</p>

                    <p>THE “TIMES” AND RUSSIA.</p>
                    <p>ANGLO-RUSSIAN (CO-OPERATION,</p>
                    <p>London, December 17. The “Times,” in announcing the withdrawal of the decree
                        for the expulsion of its correspond- ent from St. Petersburg, dwells on the
                        mutual desire on the part of England and Russia to remove all
                        misunderstandings. It urges as the duty of both countries to promote peace
                        and progress in the Mid East, and to prevent the growth of distrust which
                        might devolve that duty upon others. It particularly refers to Persis, where
                        the joint action of England and Russia and their joint counsel for the good
                        of the Persian people and State may restore that interesting Kingdom to «
                        semblance of good government and to « measure of its old pros- perity.

                        will stay. The procession numbered 8,000. (Reuter)</p>

                    <head>THE PROBLEM OF EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>The following article is contributed by Mr. Robertson, M.P, to the current
                        is-ae of “The Twentieth Century Quarterly.” Mr. Robertson has identified
                        himself so closely with Egyptian matters in the House of Commons that his
                        opinions should be read with interest</p>
                    <p>I.</p>
                    <p>Postponed problems have a way of growing graver; and one of the many
                        postponed problems of British statemanship is that of the ultimate relation
                        of Egypt to the Ewrire. {t is not disputed that when oar decisive
                        intervention began in 1&amp;82, no one foresaw to what it was to lead; and
                        it seems likely that had the foresight been possible, the actual reluctance
                        of our statesmen to intervene as they did would have been raised to the
                        force cf a resolute refusal. To say this may look like ignoring the general
                        satisfaction now felt in England over the results achieved. But that really
                        cannot be ignored. So common, indeed, is complacency on that score, that
                        Lord Milner in his recent defence of his South African policy pointed to the
                        evolution in Egypt as going far to discount all criticism of the line of
                        action taken in South Africa, as regards, that is, the employment of the
                        force of the Empire in the interests of capitalists. In Egypt, he reminded
                        his auditors, the original act of decisive intervention had been denounced
                        as a placing of the nation’s forces at the service of European bondholders,
                        very much as the imposition of Chinese labour on the Transvaal has been
                        denounced in recent years. And the inference drawn was that, whereas the
                        inter- vention in Egypt had turned out very well for the Egyptians, no less
                        than for the bondholders, the courses taken in the Transvaal might be
                        expected similarly to yield the beat results. It is well worth while to keep
                        in view this argu- ment in considering the problem of Egypt on its
                        merits.</p>
                    <p>On the face of the case, British supervision in Egypt has been a great
                        success, a8 success, in such matters is commonly understood. That! is to
                        say, the finances of Egypt have been placed on footing of security and order
                        which in the last years of Ismail’s misrule may well have seemed past hoping
                        for. The worse than Turkish methods of extorting taxes practiced by Ismail
                        have been from the first dispensed with ; the budget is as soundly regulated
                        as any in the world; and the people, under an equable fiscal system, have
                        reached a prosperity which in Ismail’s day seemed irrecoverable. So far as
                        most of as can tell, the ordinary operation of law suffers only from the
                        evils inherent in the anomalous system of cousular courts; and the social
                        peace of the country is well maintained.</p>
                    <p>Yet, from the responsible British officials themselves, there come latterly
                        the gravest assurances of ground for disquiet ; and there is no lack of
                        non-official confirmation. There is something equivocal, to be sure, about
                        the offi- cial testimonies. In connexion with the la- mentable episode at
                        Denishwai, we were as- sored at the outset that there was on foot a
                        “fanatical movement” so serious as either to make any fall discussion of the
                        trials in he House of Commons highly undesirable, or to constitute a special
                        reason for due delay in criticism—it was not clear which was the meaning to
                        be conveyed. All the while, how- ever, the majority of the heads of depart-
                        ments, including Lord Cromer, were absent from Egypt on leave, apparently in
                        the ordinary course of vacation. Finally, the statement as to “fanaticism”
                        has been formally withdrawn by Sir Edward Grey, apparently as a result of
                        the indignant protests against it in the Egyptian press. We are led to
                        understand, however, that a feeling amounting to “disaffec- tion” is
                        nevertheless common. The official des- patches on the Denishwai affair set
                        it down, in the immemorial official fashion, to the work of “unscropulons
                        agitators,” who are credited with creating the atmosphere which made
                        possible the original attack on the British officers. In saw, Lord Cromer
                        insists that the restoring of the army of occupation to its former strength
                        was the least that could be done with safety ; and that the entire situation
                        is to be understood in the light of the now| celebrated anonymous letter
                        published by him, proclaiming the unchangeable disposition of the Egyptian
                        people in the mass to support the Sultan, as Head of the Faith, in any
                        conflict between him and a European power.</p>
                    <p>For the purposes of oar inquiry, the genuine- ness of that letter need not be
                        discussed. It is odd that each a statement as it makes should have to be so
                        established; and Lord Cromer’s course in publishing it would seem to be a
                        rather oblique way of accepting a propo- sition which he has been sometimes
                        accused of disregarding. Such a method is, however, intelligible in view of
                        the fact that the main significance of the letter is as a warning against
                        the danger, not of watchful supervision of Egyptian affairs is Parliament,
                        but of any confilct between Britain and Turkey. Such a warning was expressly
                        offered by Mr. Wilfrid Blant while the Tabab dispute was unsettled ; and no
                        responsible official seems then to have admitted {that there was anything in
                        the argu- ment. Now that Lord Cromer in eff of endorses it, its force may be
                        better recognized But it is important that its real bearing should be
                        understood. As a plea for prudence in regard to Turkey, the Pan-Islamic
                        argument has obvious force. As a justification tor violent and irregular
                        methods of administering justice in Egypt, it is simply
                        self-destructive.</p>
                    <p>But we are concerned first and last with the Proposition that after a quarter
                        of a century of British supervision of Egyptian affaire, the mass of the
                        people of Egypt show no general attachment to, or gratitude for, the British
                        connexion. That view of the situation, indeed is not new, though recent
                        writers express themselves as if it wore. Lord Milner offered</p>

                    <p>in 1892 simple explanation of the “unpopa larity” of the English of which we
                        hive lately heard so mach. To Englishmen at home, he wrote, “the
                        demonstrations made against of have been a matter of surprise. ‘How is it,’
                        they not unnatarally ask, ‘that, if we have done so much good to the
                        country, we are not popular there?’ Yet the answer is easy. As strangers of
                        an alien faith, possibly of unsym- pathetic manners, we shall never be
                        popular in the sense of being personally beloved. But neither are we
                        unpopular—at least with the great mass of the people—in the sense that they
                        desire to be rid of us.” Even then, the same writer admitted, there were
                        certainly some, and those amongst the most able and vigorous of the party of
                        progress,” who were “sincere in their desire to see the backs of the British
                        troops and of British officials.” The difference now seems to be that the
                        minority of the latter way of thinking has in the last! fourteen years grown
                        much larger. Such 6 state of things, testified to by the official and the
                        non-official elements in Anglo-Egyp- tian opinion, surely calls for the
                        careful shaping of a policy. The ordinary tendency in such situations is to
                        state the facts more or less bitterly, and leave them, with an avowed
                        determination to “put down” anything like active disaffection. The situation
                        is chronic in human affairs, and not at all-special to English
                        administration. There is no reason to suppose, for instance, that France
                        would have managed better in Egypt than England has done. Not only as
                        between England and Ireland, Britain and India, Austria and Italy, Russia
                        and Poland, bat as between masters and men in the industrial field, the
                        situation in question has underlain much of the political strife of the past
                        century. In all such cases alike, “agitators” are accused of setting up
                        factitious discontent ; and “ingratitude” is charged upon the discontented.
                        If we are not to see the same sinister sequence here as has filled the
                        histories of political and industrial strife, it behaves us to face the
                        issue in another temper than that of ordinary racial oppugnance and class
                        hatred. And if any order of men are committed to rising above that way of
                        looking at things, it is the Liberals of Britain.</p>
                    <p>II.</p>
                    <p>A few general principles should in these matters be by this time above
                        dispute. Firstly, for instance, the principle that when “agita- tors” can be
                        the proximate sources of any grave disquiet, there mast be s quantity of
                        suitable material them to agitate. Given such material, the denunciation of
                        the agitators is one of the standing futilities of human history. Men in
                        Russia are at this moment taking that way of meeting the vastest social
                        upheaval seen since the French Revolution. Bat the folly is one in respect
                        of which me and times different only in degree: and to re- ognize it in
                        Russia and fail to detect it is Egypt is only a folly the more. We have the
                        express assurance of Lord Milner, concerning the people of Egypt, that, as
                        long ag they are not grossly abased, as long as the great duty of government
                        in the matter of water is not too scandalously neglected, there is no fear
                        of widespread public discontent.” Is it in the power, then, of “agitators”
                        to transform the character of a race in a dozen years?</p>
                    <p>Secondly, the whole political history of the world should serve to prove the
                        vanity of demanding gratitude at the hands of any race towards a race which
                        rales it. British politi- cians have lately been forced some way towards
                        acknowledging that in matters of sectarian difference it is idle, to
                        demonstrate to any sect that they ought to be satisfied with a given
                        treatment of their claims of conscience. It is time that we should begin to
                        apply the same principle to the relations of peoples. La the days before the
                        recovery of Italian Inde- pendence, the people of Italy were «often told, by
                        others than Austrians, that they ought to be grateful to Austria for the
                        trouble she took to make them happy, and the pains she was at to save them
                        from themselves and from other nations, With Italians, however, the
                        demonstration never succeeded. It is probable that when Edward I. imposed
                        his rale on Scotland he was entitled to Scottish gratitude on various
                        counts. Some Scots, indeed, felt it, and paid him fealty in consequence. Bat
                        the more vigorous spirits did not and would not: and for every ground of
                        gratitude that could be urged on them, they found at least one ground for
                        hate, So, looking to the history of Poland before the partition, we may, if
                        we please, argue that the Poles ought to have been grateful to Russia for
                        saving them from the anarchy of their own vicious political system. Bat the
                        Poles in general have never been for a moment persuaded to that effect ;
                        and, taking a whole era of history for testing purposes, we are shat op to
                        the conclusion that no people that needs convincing of such indebtedness
                        will ever be convinced. Sines, then, it is the business of statesmen to deal
                        with nations as they are and not as they ought to be, it would seem the
                        plain coarse of political common +e28e to recogniz3 that if the Egyptians or
                        the Hindoos are not properly grateful to Britain for what she has done for
                        them, they will never be lectured into the proper frame of mind. Some even
                        say that Britain owes some gratitude to India and Egypt as sources of a
                        multitade of British income: ; and that their, in tarn, makes no British
                        converts.</p>
                    <p>Strictly speaking, gratitude is not absent in either of the other cases. Many
                        Hiodoos re- cognize that British rale is better, not only than what would
                        probably ensue if it were saddenly withdrawn, bat than what might
                        conceivably be subsisting now if it bad not be a set up. And a number of
                        Egyptians probably go as far. Bat when this acknowledg- ment is made a
                        ground for charging either ingratitude or unreasonableness upon dis-
                        contented Hindoos or Egyptians, there takes place 8 moral blander on grave
                        that only the omnipotence of human ego can account for</p>

                    <p>it. Did any Englishman, let us ark, ever admit the possibility of gratitude
                        on his part to aliens who should enter his country in order to govern it
                        better than it had been governed Perhaps in the period of the French
                        Revolution a few visionaries might conceive of a liberation of England from
                        feudal tyranny at the hand- of invading French republicans ; but certainly
                        no party ever held by such a programme. he men who most emphatically affirm
                        the need for reforms are precisely the kind of men who most entirely take it
                        for granted that their nation shall be free to reform itself. And in our
                        nation, in whose history for many hundred's o! years there has not been a
                        day on which multi tudes did not declare their own country to be misgoverned
                        by their own countrymen, how can it be decently accepted as 4 principle of
                        policy towards any subject nation whatever, that it is iv no sense
                        misgoverned by men of our own race That this principle to commonly proceeded
                        upon in our politics is a deadly proof of the profound insincerity of our
                        relation towards subject peoples. A Tory party which daily denounces liberal
                        misgovernment in Britain, and a Liberal party which confidently affirms the
                        in capacity of Tories to govern Britain properly, are in large part ready to
                        unite in insisting that either Tories or Liberals can be trusted to govern
                        either India or Egypt with practically complete justice is the absence of
                        any system, of parliamentary supervision or constitutional check. It is one
                        of those aspects of life which at times seem to reduce all human existence
                        to the plane of farce.</p>
                    <p>The most economical way to answer the above reasoning, I suppose, would be to
                        retort upon me that in politics we mast take mankind as it is and not as it
                        ought to be, and that it is as impossible to lecture racial egoism into the
                        spirit of reciprocity as to lecture discontented peoples into gratitude.
                        Perhaps it is: who can say? I am not affirming that it is easy to induce
                        this or any other nation to do as it would be done by. But go long as
                        nations do maintain the convention of respect for justice and righteousness,
                        : or, in other words, for con- sistency, we are bound to hope on. It is
                        fitting, therefore, to submit-to the attention of Britons this axiomatic
                        truth, that Egyptians and Hindoos must in the nature of things have about as
                        mach cause for resenting misgovern- ment at English hands as Englishmen can
                        ever have for their own part. And there is yet another general political
                        truth which ought to need no pressing, yet is habitually ignored—the truths,
                        namely, that where one race or polity dominates another, whatever goes ill
                        is sure to be aground for special discontent on the part of the ruled -
                        towards the rulers. Englishmen often indig- nantly protest against being
                        saddled with the responsibility for Irish poverty and Indian famine.
                        Ireland, they are sure, would be poor and India famine-stricken under any
                        rule. But what would they have? Are not they in com- mand? Can they
                        rationally expect to meet with nothing but polite acknowledgment of their
                        good intentions in evil times? Do they so treat their political opponents at
                        home ? Cannot they master the elementary law that les maitres ont toujours
                        tort? Do they really expect to carry on the empire business to an
                        accompaniment of votes of thanks? It would seem to be super- fluos, among
                        practical men, to point oat that the first condition of anything like poli-
                        tical content, among men capable of energetic discontent, is that they
                        should have only them- selves, or men of their own race and polity, to blame
                        for their collective troubles. But nothing needs oftener to be urged. Ill By
                        some who do not dispute these proposi- tions as abstract truths, it may be
                        replied that, as regards Egypt, we must be content to reduce the question to
                        one of simple action. Granting that Egyptians may be expected to be dis-
                        contented, whatever be the net benefit to them of British supervision, there
                        is nothing to be done, it may be said, but maintain the present balance.
                        Egyptians must go on being discontented; and the British control most go on
                        controlling. To withdraw it would mean the revival of the direct control of
                        Turkey, the return of the seven devils to the cleansed and ravished house.
                        That Egypt should pass from the present tate- lage, straight to
                        self-government, is as impos- sible as that India should. Such is the sort
                        of general answer commonly thrown at any is who suggests a reconsideration
                        of Egypt’s case. but such general answers either mistake’ lor evade the
                        issue. Nobody in British politics is now suggesting simple withdrawal from
                        neither Egypt or Indias. We are there ; and no criticism of the process of
                        entry by our fathers can solve or affect the problem of ‘our present action.
                        But there is all the differ- ence in the world between the old attitude of
                        Austria to Italy, or of Russia to Poland, and the attitude dictated to
                        British Libe- rals by their own principles in regard to Egypt and India no
                        less than in regard to Ireland. The difference is determined by an
                        acceptance of the principle of evolution. After ages of reciprocal hate and
                        contempt, Englishmen</p>

                <div type="item">
                    <p>look forward to an adjustment of Irish claims that shall mean a lasting
                        trace. Henceforth they can no more apply to Ireland the methods of the
                        autocracy towards Poland than they can accept absolutism for themselves They
                        have renounced the principle of uncovenanted domination. And what they have
                        to do in regard to India, is simply to apply ‘to their relations there the
                        principle of criticism they have latterly brought to bear on the case of
                        Ireland. Not that they can take the same coarse. The cases differ by all the
                        present political distance between the West and the East. But as the
                        reversion to the principle of sympathy and reciprocity was necessary to
                        create any healthy relation between England and Ireland, even 80 is it
                        necessary elsewhere. If tor ages men were so desperately far from that
                        principle as regarded people speaking their own language, intermarrying with
                        them, reading and writing their literature, is it to be supposed that
                        without circumspect revision of their problem they will deal wisely and well
                        with races alien in blood, speech, traditions and faith? In this matter
                        British Liberalism is at the parting of the ways. It has to face the vital
                        issues of imperial no less than of domestic policy. Those issues hang
                        together ; and if either is burked there is no salvation for the party as
                        such. Those who are determined that Liberalism shall go to the root of the
                        social and industrial problem are merely pre- paring their own frustration
                        if they think to elude the other. To fold the hands as regards Imperial
                        responsibilities, leaving the event to routine and the chances of
                        bureaucracy, is to paralyses the very forces of conscience on which they
                        rely for grappling effectually with domes- tic concerns. To ask how far this

                        issues. But the more fre- quently the danger presents itself, the mote
                        argent become: the need for provision against it. ln a word, the Liberal
                        party most make up its mind about India and Egypt no less than about the
                        Trade Disputes Bill, the Taxation of Land Value, and Old Age Pensions.</p>

                    <p>The competitors in the final of this match, on Saturday, 15th inst., most
                        have been very glorified by the intense interest shown by the numerous
                        ladies who assembled to witness their pl. The teams left in are as
                        follows:</p>
                    <p>Reds. Whites. Capt. Dapbar. Major Putterson. Mr. Bentinck. Capt. Leigh.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Tollemache. Capt. Hedow. Bir Walter Barttelot. Mr. Aldam.</p>
                    <p>The matches throughout the week have been very level, the final proving the
                        most evenly contested of the tournament. At the call of time one goal all
                        was registered. °</p>
                    <p>After the 5 minutes interval, the game was renewed with untiring vigour, and
                        although two extra periods were played neither side were able to assert
                        their superiority, the match eventually being postponed to next Saturday, Io
                        the fiat chukker Reds seemed to have the best of the game, Major Patterson
                        only barely saving his gal on two occasions, and Capt. Dunbar making some
                        very fire strokes. In the second Chakker Whites played better together, bat
                        a clever piece. of Mr. Bentinck and Capt. Dunbar gave the lead. This seemed
                        to pat the Whites on their metal ands goal was nearly scored oat of a front
                        of goal by Capt. Leigh. The third chakker Whites were attacking throughout
                        and Capt. Leigh scored a clever goal. They were unlucky not to score &amp;
                        second, Capt. Dunbar bringing off an excellent save on the goal line.</p>
                    <p>During the fourth chokker there was s good deal of give and take. Major
                        Patterson, showing great dash, had bad lack not to score for his side.</p>
                    <p>The two extra periods produced no goal to either side, and the match will be
                        replayed on the 22nd -inst.</p>

                    <p>VERSUS</p>
                    <p>DUBLIN FUSILIERS.</p>
                    <p>The above teams met at Ghezireh in a friendly encounter. The Dubs were
                        strongly represented, while the Inniskillings were not so strong as when
                        they met last. The Dublins were in special training all the week, and the
                        way the Skins beat the Lancashire Fusiliers on the same ground, a good game
                        was expected. The Dabs guessed the spin of the coin; and Dougan, starting
                        operations for the homesters, before 3,C00 spectators, play went towards
                        Rice, bat Mullan relieved by sending into touch, The ball now travelled from
                        one goal to another without any result. Higginson now</p>
                    <p>initiated a good run. His pass to Kenny was I sent over the line. The Greens
                        then made good headway towards Branagh, who times out of number spoiled
                        their combination. Maloney once gut within shooting distance, and stesdy-
                        ing himself he sent in a terrific shot, which was well saved by Howlett amid
                        cheers. The Inniskillings were playing &amp; good game, and considering the
                        odds against them, they were given as much as they got. Walsh scored a goal
                        for his side, but previous to this the whistle had gone for offside. The
                        free let the boys from the south well up bat Tale, when nicely placed,
                        hended the ball. The homesters got</p>
                    <p>away per Hatton, who gave to Higginson, the F latter missing by inches. Play
                        owas in the</p>
                    <p>visitors’ end when half-time came with no score.</p>
                    <p>After the usual interval and refreshments play was resomed, and the ficst
                        item of any importance was Howlett saving twice in Fsaccession from Tale.
                        The Green and Baff brigade now took play in hand. Higginson and Walsh,
                        combining well, got close to Rice, who h fsaved with mach di:ffizalty. The
                        Dabs, who were playing the combination, got close to Howlett, where Tale
                        opened the avoring with ano unsaveable shot, which Ceebteke had no chance
                        with. The training of the Dabs was baginning to tell, certainly the
                        Loniskillinge feltthe loss of Canningham and Green. Play fhovered in
                        midfiald, and Doagan, getting the sphere, dashed away and gave to Walsh, who
                        joa well into goal. A corner resalted, which was sent past by Ward. The
                        Dablins now forced sthe play, and Howlett was ressiving some “hot ones.”
                        ‘The visitors added a second goal from a corner. Both teame after this made
                        strentooe efforts to add more goals to their side, bat all to no avail.
                        Higginson headed over the bar close on time. From this to full time, play
                        was even, and the end of a good game was :</p>

                        <p>To THE EDITOR OF THE Egyptian Gazette.”</p>
                        <p>Dear Sir,—Now that the canals are being closed fur cleaning out, the same
                            sights will be witnessed—and in fact are now—of natives washing and
                            exposing themselves in the river, also making a W.C. of the banks,
                            without any sense of shame or decency, and no one appears to take any
                            notice whatever. Now and again one or two policemen are placed at
                            different parts, but they soon disappear after a day or two and the same
                            disgusting performances go on. One naturally wonders who is responsible
                            for this state of affairs, evidently some one not conscious of their
                            duty and whose olfactory nerves are badly ont of order. Cannot this
                            state of affairs be altered ? An energetic shawish with instructions to
                            take up any caught in the act and the often der punished by a fine or be
                            made to sweep streets- for so many days, would soon put a stop to the
                            nuisance. The same trouble exists on both sides of the canal, also the
                            some- times filthy condition of the railway line running through the
                            town from the goods station passing by factories up to the pas- senger
                            station.</p>
                        <p>Might one ask, too, why the lamp at the rail- way crossing, opposite the
                            International Club, is not ligh‘e1 every night for the safety of pede-
                            strians. This was attended to for a time, bat now I suppose it is like
                            the usual state of things if left to natives, maksoor, or mafeesh gaz,
                            or shereet ; surely when an improvement has been started it ought to be
                            kept up.</p>

                    <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                        January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so warm as
                        Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm
                        than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in
                        the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest
                        place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                        sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on each of
                        the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="3"/>
                    <p>They are as follows:-</p>
                    <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southhampton,
                        London or Liverpool—occupy about 4 days. The short ones are as follows:—</p>

                    <p>The steamers, of the P.&amp;O. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageriea
                        Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines are
                        also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by travellers to
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made without change
                        in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp;O.
                        Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna
                        express from Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail Steamers “Osiris" and “Isis” to Brindisi. One of these leaves port
                        Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian <cb n="6"
                        />mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                    <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                        attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats" having
                        been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi.
                        If you are going straight through to England you will find the train waiting
                        at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete
                        arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in
                        London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <head>SICILY.</head>
                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.’s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMENA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is the
                        station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful,
                        occupying about one hour. In and around the town is much to interest the
                        visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but restored under the Romans.
                        CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of Etna and here also is a fine
                        Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all over
                        the island, are an endless sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting
                        history, having been a Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C.
                        413, and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb
                        is to be seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                        about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                        delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The
                        Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S.
                        Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral,
                        Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also worth a
                        visit.</p>

                    <head>CENTRAL ITALY.</head>
                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.’s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                        bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento
                        [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                        City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence itself the churches
                        and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local promenades and
                        excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and
                        fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea
                        level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero,
                        thence by cog-wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks
                        takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; hero there is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                        and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                        house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                        and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                    <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                        the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and deliciously cool
                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy’s most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                        SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal springs,
                        change trains at Borgo San Donino and in half-an-hour you are at

                    <head>NORTHERN ITALY (Continued) and The ITALIAN LAKES.</head>
                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea port.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                        lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza :</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo, Cadenabbia,
                        and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio opposite. The walk
                        from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio is most enjoyable. A
                        steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake Lugano in three-quarters
                        of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                        the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San

                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>

                    <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                        January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so warm as
                        Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm
                        than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in
                        the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest
                        place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                        sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on each of
                        the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>

                    <p>The steamers, of the P.&amp;O. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageriea
                        Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines are
                        also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by travellers to
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made without change
                        in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp;O.
                        Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna
                        express from Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail Steamers “Osiris" and “Isis” to Brindisi. One of these leaves port
                        Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian <cb n="6"
                        />mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                    <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                        attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats" having
                        been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi.
                        If you are going straight through to England you will find the train waiting
                        at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete
                        arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in
                        London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.’s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMENA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is the
                        station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful,
                        occupying about one hour. In and around the town is much to interest the
                        visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but restored under the Romans.
                        CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of Etna and here also is a fine
                        Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all over
                        the island, are an endless sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting
                        history, having been a Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C.
                        413, and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb
                        is to be seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                        about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                        delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The
                        Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S.
                        Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral,
                        Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also worth a
                        visit.</p>

                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.’s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                        bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento
                        [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                        City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence itself the churches
                        and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local promenades and
                        excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and
                        fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea
                        level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero,
                        thence by cog-wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks
                        takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; hero there is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                        and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                        house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                        and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                    <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                        the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and deliciously cool
                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy’s most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                        SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal springs,
                        change trains at Borgo San Donino and in half-an-hour you are at
                        Salsomaggiore.</p>

                    <head>NORTHERN ITALY (Continued) and The ITALIAN LAKES.</head>
                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea port.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                        lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza :</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo, Cadenabbia,
                        and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio opposite. The walk
                        from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio is most enjoyable. A
                        steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake Lugano in three-quarters
                        of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                        hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated on
                        the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San

                        excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated above the
                        town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings, “Entombment,"
                        by Ciseri, and ‘Tho Flight into Egypt,” by Bramantion.</p>

                        excursions on the lake can be made by steamer, and the ever-changing scenery
                        on the trip from Lucerne, to Fluelen is a source of delight to the lover of
                        nature.</p>
                    <p>BRUNNEN, charmingly situated on the most beautiful part of the Lake of

                        from here, and the panoramic view of the Alps is grand; extending from Monte
                        Rosa to the Black Forest, and from the Santis to the Matterhorn.</p>
