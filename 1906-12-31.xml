                    <p>Amid the contradictory reports referring both to the illness of H.I.M. the
                        Sultan and to the question of the succession to the Ottoman throne, one fact
                        stands out pre-eminently: [COLUMN BREAK] the imminence of a diplomatic
                        struggle be-tween Germany and Great Britain for the first place in the
                        regard of the Ruler of the one great Moslem State. In the preliminary bouts
                        Germany has undoubtedly been successful. It remains to be seen whether the
                        per-sonal influence to the Kaiser will be equally potent with the next
                        Sultan and Khalif as it has been with Sultan Abdul Hamid II. The question is
                        one of the greatest difficulty, and our diplomatists will need to walk with
                        the utmost circumspection, stepping cautiously, per ignes suppositos cinero
                        dolopso. [PARAGRAPH BREAK] A false step may be productive of the ut-most
                        danger to the British Empire, and our opponents will do their utmost- and
                        rightly, too, from their point of view—to lead us into some pitfall from
                        which we shall emerge in very sorry plight. To guard against this danger we
                        require not only diplomatists and consuls, men of political discernment and
                        special local knowledge, in the Levant, but statesmen at home who are
                        something more than the mouthpieces of a party or the con-ciliators of a
                        discordant Cabinet. To the vigour with which it has almost always seconded a
                        “spirited” foreign policy the British public has seldom united the minimum
                        of discretion, and its love of the sentimental, its occasional flirtations
                        with the impracticable, and its mar-vellous readiness to believe all that it
                        hears, make it a peculiarly dangerous creature—to itself. [PARAGRAPH BREAK]
                        A few years ago the pro-Armenian campaign was in full swing. There was much
                        to be said on behalf of the Armenians, and their punishment, attended as it
                        was by revolting barbarities, was altogether out of proportion to the
                        offence. But we cannot help thinking that had the public, instead of calling
                        for war and the creation of an independent Armenia, urged, nay, commanded
                        the Government not to rest till it had brought about the adoption of a
                        respectable police organization in Kurdistan, we should have won the
                        gratitude not only of the Armenians, but of the vast majority of decent
                        Moslems who dislike being robbed by Kurds and Circassians as much as
                        Christians, and we should not have fallen between two stools. Had we gone to
                        war we should have run some risks, but should at least have won the respect
                        of the Turk, of the Eastern Christians, and of some of the Great Powers. As
                        it was, we exasperated Turkish sentiment and gave the Kaiser his chance. We
                        sympathized vastly with the Armenians, and we failed to afford them any
                        assistance—a few sonnets by Mr. William Watson and some charity bazaars
                        excepted. [PARAGRAPH BREAK] The Armenian troubles over, we sympathized most
                        enthusiastically with the Greeks,--the upholders of civilization against the
                        barbarous Turk. After the Greek Army had sustained a series of lamentable
                        disasters, which culminated in the catastrophe of the Furka Pass, we
                        realized that we had gone rather too far. The exploits of the Greek bands
                        and of Bulgaria komitajis in Macedonia caused some of the loudest denouncers
                        of Moslem intolerance to wonder whether the “unspeakable” Turk, of whom they
                        had constantly spoken, really had the monopoly of outrages in the Balkans.
                        Then came the stirring of Pan-Islam=ism and the discovery that the Ottoman
                        Government was not actuated by the friendliest sentiments to the British
                        Empire. [PARAGRAPH BREAK] There was another school among us. To its
                        followers the Turk was a marvel of intelligence, the possessor of every
                        Moslem and Christian virtue. True he was a little rough at times, but wild,
                        manly races were a trifle rough when they dealt with rebels. They said of
                        the Turkish Empire “Preserve it”—their opponents, “End it” but as yet no
                        middle school has arisen (we refer not to statesmen, of the publicists but
                        to the average man) that will have the courage to say—“Help to mend it.”Amid
                        the contradictory reports referring both to the illness of H.I.M. the Sultan
                        and to the question of the succession to the Ottoman throne, one fact stands
                        out pre-eminently: [COLUMN BREAK] the imminence of a diplomatic struggle
                        be-tween Germany and Great Britain for the first place in the regard of the
                        Ruler of the one great Moslem State. In the preliminary bouts Germany has

                        the Levant, but statesmen at home who are something more than the
                        mouthpieces of a party or the con-ciliators of a discordant Cabinet. To the
                        vigour with which it has almost always seconded a “spirited” foreign policy
                        the British public has seldom united the minimum of discretion, and its love
                        of the sentimental, its occasional flirtations with the impracticable, and
                        its mar-vellous readiness to believe all that it hears, make it a peculiarly
                        dangerous creature—to itself. [PARAGRAPH BREAK] A few years ago the
                        pro-Armenian campaign was in full swing. There was much to be said on behalf
                        of the Armenians, and their punishment, attended as it was by revolting
                        barbarities, was altogether out of proportion to the offence. But we cannot
                        help thinking that had the public, instead of calling for war and the
                        creation of an independent Armenia, urged, nay, commanded the Government not
                        to rest till it had brought about the adoption of a respectable police
                        organization in Kurdistan, we should have won the gratitude not only of the
                        Armenians, but of the vast majority of decent Moslems who dislike being
                        robbed by Kurds and Circassians as much as Christians, and we should not
                        have fallen between two stools. Had we gone to war we should have run some
                        risks, but should at least have won the respect of the Turk, of the Eastern
                        Christians, and of some of the Great Powers. As it was, we exasperated
                        Turkish sentiment and gave the Kaiser his chance. We sympathized vastly with
                        the Armenians, and we failed to afford them any assistance—a few sonnets by
                        Mr. William Watson and some charity bazaars excepted. [PARAGRAPH BREAK] The
                        Armenian troubles over, we sympathized most enthusiastically with the
                        Greeks,--the upholders of civilization against the barbarous Turk. After the
                        Greek Army had sustained a series of lamentable disasters, which culminated
                        in the catastrophe of the Furka Pass, we realized that we had gone rather
                        too far. The exploits of the Greek bands and of Bulgaria komitajis in
                        Macedonia caused some of the loudest denouncers of Moslem intolerance to
                        wonder whether the “unspeakable” Turk, of whom they had constantly spoken,
                        really had the monopoly of outrages in the Balkans. Then came the stirring
                        of Pan-Islam=ism and the discovery that the Ottoman Government was not
                        actuated by the friendliest sentiments to the British Empire. [PARAGRAPH
                        BREAK] There was another school among us. To its followers the Turk was a
                        marvel of intelligence, the possessor of every Moslem and Christian virtue.
                        True he was a little rough at times, but wild, manly races were a trifle
                        rough when they dealt with rebels. They said of the Turkish Empire “Preserve
                        it”—their opponents, “End it” but as yet no middle school has arisen (we
                        refer not to statesmen, of the publicists but to the average man) that will
                        have the courage to say—“Help to mend it.”</p>

                    <p>ROCKEFELLER’S GIFT-</p>
                    <p>The multi-millionaire, John D. Rockefeller, has sent word to the officers of
                        the Board of Foreign Missions of the United Presbyterian Church at
                        Philadelphia that he would give $100,000 toward educational work in Egypt
                        and the Sudan. The announcement was made at a meeting of the board, and a
                        message of thanks sent to Mr. Rockefeller. Part of the Standard Oil
                        magnate's money will go toward a college for young men and part toward a
                        school for girls. It was nearly six months ago that the United Presbyterian
                        Board wrote to Mr. Rockefeller, calling his attention to the rapidly
                        increasing demands being made by the young men and women of the Nile Valley
                        for education and western knowledge. Mr. Rockefeller took the letter abroad
                        with him, and in the course of his trip took occasion to visit the two
                        schools for which his aid had been asked. That he was favourably impressed
                        by the work being done was shown by the receipt of this message. Rev. Dr. C.
                        R. Watson, corresponding secretary for the board, said regarding the gift to
                        the society : “Announcement was made to-day at the poard meeting of Mr.
                        Rockefeller's gift of $100,000. The greater part of the gift will go toward
                        the erection of new buildings for Assiut College.’’ </p>
                    <p>DEATH OF AN ARABIC SCHOLAR.</p>
                    <p>We regret to announce the death of the distinguished Syrian scholar, Sheikh
                        Ibrahim el-Yazigi, Editor of “Al Zia,”an Arabic liter¬ary magazine published
                        in Cairo. The 8heikb, who died at Zeitoun, was the eon of a wall- known
                        Syrian poet. The funeral took place on Saturday afternoon, the service being
                        held at the Catholic Cathedral at Fagallab. The late Sheikh devoted a great
                        part of bis life to improving the text of the authorised Arabic translation
                        of the Bible used by the Oriental Catholics. He was also a great authority
                        on Arabio calligraphy and did much to improve the Arabic characters used in
                        print¬ing. At the time of his death he was engaged on an important Arabic
                        lexicon. </p>
                    <p>THE CRUISE OF THE ARABIC.</p>
                    <p> All arrangements for the visit of the S.S, Arabic to Egypt have been
                        completed. Mr. H. C. Clark, brother of Mr. Frank Clark, who has chartered
                        the leviathan, has been in Cairo in connection with the oroise, and has gone
                        to Rome to complete arrangements there. Book¬ings for the cruise have been
                        excellent, every available berth being taken. The Arabic will arrive at
                        Alexandria on March 13. There will be 630 tourists on board, of whom about
                        350 will go up river in different group by steamer and rail. The vessel will
                        sail again for Naples on March 25. </p>
                    <p>HELLENIC CONSULAR COURT. </p>
                    <p>To-day began before Judge Papadopoulos, assisted by Counsel Dr. Lazaris and
                        Livadaris, the trial of Psathopoulos, Sersphimide", and Messaris, who are
                        accused of manufacturing false diplomas of the University of Athens. There
                        was a grand jury of twelve, headed by Dr. Constantinos Tambakos. Counsel for
                        defend-ants are Drs. Limbrites, Salamanos, Saltabassi and Katelnsos. The
                        session lasted two hours and a-half, the Public Prosecutor being M. Yeleli,
                        greffier of the Athens Criminal Court. The first- witness, by special
                        request of Dr. Salamanos, was Mr. George Thomson, cotton merchant of Msn-
                        sonra, whose evidence is most weighty against accused. </p>
                    <p>THE ALEXANDRIA SHOW. </p>
                    <p>A number of notables of Alexandria met yesterday at the Governorate to deal
                        with the measures to be taken for opening the forth-coming agricultural show
                        at Alexandria. Abd¬el Hamid Bey Abaza, who represented the Khedivial
                        Agricultural Society, of which he is an Inspector, delivered a speech
                        stating that having been authorized by that Society to call public attention
                        to the benefits of a show being held at Alexandria, he would begin the work
                        by asking the inhabitants to support the scheme. Abaza Bey was seconded by
                        Hassabo Bey Mohamed, mechanical engineer, who also delivered a speech on the
                        subject. A committee was formed to arrange for the show. </p>

                    <p>With regard to the question of railway construction from Abyssinia towards
                        the Nile, which, according to the recent Abyssinia agreement, is to be under

                        1894, the right to construct railways from Adis Abeba to the Nile or to
                        Kaffa belongs to the Ethiopian Railway Company, but there will be no
                        difficulty in making the necessary arrangements for a subsidiary English

                    <p>Every Saturday evening sees a larger as-sembly at the Savoy, and the season’s
                        dances there are now in foil swing. There were the usual number of dinner
                        parties in the restaurant last Saturday, Capt. and Lady Muriel Beckwith
                        entertaining a party of eight; and Mrs. Saunders also having a party of the
                        same number. Major and Mrs. Wynne also had guests, and BO had Lady David
                        Tennant; and Captain H. A. Chandos Pole Gell and Dr. Wm. Armstrong both were
                        acting hosts at bachelor tables. Colonel and Mrs. Churchward (nee
                        Montgomery) who were last in Cairo some six years ago were also dining with
                        their friends. Mrs. Collison, Baron von Vietinghoff, Major Walters, Captain
                        Anderson, and Mr. Curphy were among the other hosts and hostesses. Dancing
                        was kept up merrily to the music of the Ladies’ Orchestra till a late boor,
                        and though there were various complaints as to the damage to pretty frocks
                        caused by the spurs of the officers, no one allowed such minor troubles to
                        discountenance them at the moment. There were the usual number of pretty
                        toilettes to be seen, and certainly none were more becoming than those worn
                        by the two beautiful Miss Andersons ; the elder of whom was in a lovely
                        blank and white striped silk muslin and wore a huge Paradis in her coiffure,
                        while the second was in blue with white lace underdress. Mrs. Blythe was
                        also much admired in a wonderful dress of soft rose satin oriental with
                        which she wore ornaments of coral, and Mrs. Wynne was looking quite her
                        best, in spite of her accident, in a long trailing frock of some soft creamy
                        material with silver emroideries on the corsage. Everyone Was glad to
                        welcome back Mrs. Yorke and her pretty daughters who are looking fairer and
                        prettier than ever, and the Misses Shaar also came in for their fair share
                        of admiration. Mrs. Saunders was in a brilliant frock of soar let with a
                        fashionable head dress of the same colour,and Mrs. Hooter was in yellow,
                        though perhaps these two last-mentioned colours ought not to have been
                        mentioned together. Mrs. Nolan was wearing a very pretty frock which suited
                        her well, and Miss Moore was in white with a touch of bine on the corsage.
                        Miss Joseph and Miss Fearon were dancing indefatigably as usual, and Miss de
                        Codt, Miss Rees and Miss Johnston found many partners awaiting them. Mrs.
                        Burdekins with Mrs. Hay and the remainder of her family were present, and M.
                        Klobukowski, the French Diplomatic Agent, was also there with a party of
                        friends, and naturally all those who were present during dinner spent the
                        evening either in the dancing room or in the salons near at hand. A goodly
                        proportion of the guests formed fresh parties for supper, one large table
                        for fifteen being presided over by Messrs. Cuthbertson and Swan, and Major
                        and Mrs. Wynne having a party of eight or so guests. Another dance at the
                        Savoy has been arranged for New Year’s Day. The band of the Scottish
                        Borderers will be in atten¬dance and doubtless there will be many officers
                        from the various regiments present. There is a rumour that these Tuesday
                        dances with military bands may be continued through¬out the season, and if
                        they are so they will add immensely to the long list of its attractions. </p>
                    <p>THE NEW KHEDIVIAL HOTEL</p>
                    <p>We understand that the New Khedivial Hotel in Cairo is now under the sole
                        management of Mr. J. Vocles, who for many years has been connected with
                        hotel management in the hear East. The Hotel, which is quite new, and
                        replete with every modern comfort and convenience, lift, etc., has already a
                        long list of season visitors, and under the energetic and intelligent new
                        management ought to be very successful and rank among the most comfortable
                        family hotels of the Capital. </p>

                    <p>"CENDRILLON"</p>
                    <p>"Cendrillon" is a most harming and delicate opera, full of the most delicious
                        phrases and effects and with plenty of humour. It is not of every kind of
                        music that one can say that. M. Massenet evidently set himself to write a
                        real fairy story, and he most have taken the keenest pleasure in it. The
                        overture and the opening we missed, — so did most people. The honse was
                        practically empty for that matter till about 9.15. My trouble, though, was
                        not so much lateness as the animated discussions in the middle of the
                        theatre. Alas ! all protests are useless. A discreet "sash" provokes
                        laughter, and any touch of exasperation calls up blind fury in several
                        languages ; and the raucous discussions arise again, Antoeus-like. Oh, that
                        M. Escalais could be induced to proclaim nightly "il est defendu de parler
                        affaires pen dant l’Opera” or some such phrases. He might end with oyez,
                        oyez, oyez. The last ez in lit’ alt would be most effective. Bat pardon the
                        digression ! I will only add that the baby in the gallery surely thought
                        noise was the fashion, and strove to live up thereto. The opera
                        opens—"Cendrillon" and her father,before the ball, and a most charming solo
                        by M. Lorec, then followed by the entry and parade to a delightful 3 time
                        trio by the Mother and two wicked sisters, who then go to the ball in all
                        state. Enter then the fairy godmother and her chorus, these last in weird
                        garb that looked as though it would not stand wear and tear : delight,
                        transformation, and the sight of the long road winding up to the palace.
                        Away to the dance, Cendrillon, and remember Midnight ! II Act : The tired
                        prince, his courtiers, doctors and others, then five dances : these were
                        very pretty. The mandoline, and les fiances were, to me, the best, but la
                        Florentine seemed be tetter and more lively than most exhibitions of solo
                        ballet-steps. The Rigodon du Roy was the grand parade of Cendrillon’s step
                        mother and sisters. That and the appear ance of Cendrillon, now a princess,
                        was quite enough for the guests who left her with Prince Charming. Oh ! la
                        desolante aventure -one of the best bits in all the music, taken up in
                        imitation by one after the other, and the chorus. Followed a duet,
                        delightful and pathetic, then her flight 3rd Act: Again Cendrillon and then
                        her father, and again a perfect duet, then re enter the family, disgusted,
                        to the most fascinating heroic music,—Massenet laughing at their depit.
                        Tableau,—the fairie's oak : the queen singing, (Mile Devilloy excelled in
                        parity and sweetness of voice) and then the two lovers petitioning
                        separately, then joined in a dream¬like duet. One perfect touch was the
                        woven chorus on 4 ascending notes, repeated over and over again. Last Act:
                        Cendrillon and her father on the terrace, she ill and he consoling. It was
                        all a sad dream the fanfares below awaken her: delicious duet, and delicious
                        fanfare and chorus below : but it was sorely a dream, for here are the
                        family pretentions as ever,hunting the slipper. Cendrillon had "just invoked
                        spring, delightful, consoling spring. But it ended in brazen fretful summer.
                        Some ex¬cellent entr'acte mnsio—so excellent that my neighbours couldn't
                        help hamming it, brought on the last scene of all. Love triumphant, and to
                        one’s intense delight, the welcome of Cen¬drillon and her father, the 4-note
                        chorus, and the ‘desolate aventure’ were the best inci¬dents where all was
                        good. And all the per¬sonnel were good. Mile Karl as Cendrillon, far better
                        than usual, Mile Devilloy delightful, M. Lorec as good as could be, and Mile
                        Charpentier a most perfect Prince ; the mother and sister also noted and
                        sang excellently. And then the chorus and orchestra were for once up to the
                        mark : there were moments of tunelessness, but far more care and interest
                        was shown all through. Besides, the more raucous of the audience vanished
                        after the second act, and all the finale was paace and charming music
                        undisturbed. Cendrillon is certainly a snores?, well worth hearing more than
                        once. </p>
                    <p>ZIZINIA THEATRE.</p>
                    <p>We left the Zizinia Theatre in a lyrio mood on Saturday night, and to day
                        abandon ourselves to the noble pleasure of praising, tor though we saw this
                        piece twice at CoventGarden last summer, (with Caruso, as yet unadorned by
                        his zoological hats, in his best voice), the Zizinia gave us an even
                        perfection, not easily to be surpassed. "Tosca" is a melodrama written for
                        three persons. These three welded each other together in such wise as to
                        bring out and emphasise, by their infinitesimal deficiencies, each other’s
                        strong points. Thus Scarpia's con¬summate rendering of his unlovely part
                        drew our attention from the fact that his voice is deficient in strength and
                        clearness, at the same time throwing into sharp relief the penetrating tones
                        of Cavaradossi, whom, as an actor, we should be disinclined to praise. As
                        for Tosca, she played and she sang throughout perfectly charmingly, entirely
                        deliciously, and even in the first act, under the disadvantage of her
                        monstrous hat, and hideous pink satin breast-collar (five inches broad
                        against a willowgreen dress) she held the house between her fingers—in so
                        much that we will not deny that the unbridled commandant had onr heartiest
                        sympathy. We pardoned bis ill considered attempt ; it was his failure that
                        we despised and deplored. For the rest, the Sacristau’s buffoon part is a
                        ’bestialita," and nothing can be done with it. The orchestra got out of hand
                        now and again in respect (or disrespect) of time, and again the prompter’s
                        strident tones grated at critical momenta on our unwilling ears. But the
                        evening was for ns a renascence, restoring and regilding those cynical years
                        that had formed the unpalatable diet of the locust. </p>

                        <p>LONDON, December 29. A snowstorm has broken the telegraph lines
                            throughout England. Trains are conveying cablegrams to the ports. A
                            terrific blizzard is raging along the Scot-tish border. Practically no
                            railway communi-cation exists North or South. Many deaths are reported
                            from snow. The first local train since Thursday which left Arbroath late
                            thia afternoon, packed with snowbound passengers, was standing in
                            Elliott junction when an express dashed into the rear shattering two
                            carriages and killing 13 and injuring 37 of the passengers. Mr. Black,
                            M.P., for Banffsire, had both legs broken and amputated and lies in a
                            most precarious condition. The accident is attributed to a signalling

                    <p> LORD KITCHENER AND MAHOMEDANS. </p>
                    <p>Lord Kitchener recently paid a visit the Mahomedan Anglo-Oriental College
                        Aligarh, when an address was presented to him by the trustees of the
                        institution, who, io thanking him for the interest he had taken in Mahomedan
                        education, made special reference to the Gordon College at Khartum. His
                        Excel lency, in reply, remarked that it was true he had taken the greatest
                        interest in all questions connected with Mohamedan education, and he went on
                        to say :— “It is only natural that I should do so, as for many years of my
                        service I have been intimately associated with Mahomedans various parts of
                        the world, and I am glad to say that I am privileged to number amongst my
                        friends many of your co-religionists in Egypt, London, Turkey, and
                        elsewhere. Since I have been in India I have had the good fortune to add to
                        these numbers, as I have had the pleasure of meeting many Mahomedan
                        gentle¬men, both in civil and military positions, who, I hope, will permit
                        ms to call them amongst my friends. ‘It is very satisfactory to see that the
                        education given here tends to increase the feelings of devotion and loyalty
                        to. the King Emperor, and that spirit for military service which
                        distinguished your forefathers in the past. As you are aware, a large
                        proportion the Indian Army consisted of Mahomedan officers and men. These
                        constitute some of the finest and bravest soldiers I have the honour to
                        command, and worthily maintain the credit and reputation of the Mahomedan
                        races of India.” </p>

                    <p>Theodore AI. Davis' Excavations : The Tomb of Hatshopsitu. By Theodore M.
                        Davis, Edouard Naville, and Howard Carter (Con-stable and Co.)</p>
                    <p>One of the first of the important finds made by Mr. Theodore Davis on the
                        concession (the Valley of the Kings), on which he has been at work for the
                        last three years. In the introduction, which forms his contribu¬tion to the
                        book, he tells us how be and Mr. Carter came almost by chance upon a chamber
                        which they had not time to clear, but which they felt certain had in some
                        part of it a tunnel or descending corridor leading the veritable tomb. A
                        literal toss-up decided them to make for the right-hand corner, where they
                        found the tunnel they sought, and were led into the burial chamber
                        containing the sarcophagus of the great queen. As it was empty, Mr. Davis
                        gives excellent reasons for supposing that the priests in 900 B.C. removed
                        the royal mummy to the hole known as the "cachette” at Deir el- Bahari. Here
                        were found many other royal mommies, including that of the queen’s father
                        Thothmes I. and two coffinless fe¬male bodies without wrappings. If Mr.
                        Davis is right, one of these last must the mortal remains of Queen Hatasu:
                        but it is just worth noticing that the Biban el-Moluk sepulchre was never
                        finished, and that the blocks inscribed with the ‘Book of that which is in
                        Hades,’ with which she evidently intended to line it, were found lying in
                        confusion on the floor. It is therefore pos sible either that Hatasu changed
                        her mind at the last and decided on being buried some where else, or that
                        some palace revolution, doubtless headed by her terrible nephew and
                        successor Thotmes III., led to her disrespect¬ful interment in some site yet
                        undiscovered. The chief interest in this volume, however, is provided by a
                        memoir by Prof. Naville, in which this sound and sterling scholar traces the
                        life and monuments of the only woman who in the course 5,000 years ever
                        ruled over united Egypt. Hatasu, Hatshepsut, or H4t- shopsitu, as the
                        vagaries of Egyptian translitera tion have caused her to be successively
                        called, was the daughter of Thothmes I. and Queen Aahmes. As she was of
                        royal blood on both sides, she had claims to the throne superior to those of
                        her half brother, also called Thothmes ; and as she must have early shown a
                        capa city for sovereignty, she was during her father's lifetime associated
                        with him on the throne, and brought up with the masculine name of Ka-ma-ra,
                        or, as M Maspero prefers to read it, Makeri. Yet the Egyptians evi dently
                        did not tike kindly to the idea a female sovereign, and Hatasu found
                        expedient—as M. Naville thinks, while her father was alive—to marry her
                        half- brother, who later reigned with her as her consort under the title of
                        Thothmes II. On her husband's death, which, according to M. Naville, occured
                        about the third year of his reign, Hatasu usurped the throne, though
                        acknowledging the right of her nephew to succeed her husband. For some
                        twenty years she thus reigned, calling herself king and not queen of Egypt,
                        as she had done during her husband's lifetime. Yet she associated her nephew
                        with her on the throne, as her father had done with herself; and when she
                        died, he succeeded her and became the greatest conque¬ror that Egypt ever
                        produced. M. Naville thinks that the relations of the aunt and the nephew
                        were better than is generally supposed, and points out that the wholesale
                        erasure of Hatasu’s name from the monuments did not take place until the
                        close of the conqueror’s sole reign. But all the facts that can be verified
                        about Hatasu are as here stated, and the recent attempt of the Barlin School
                        to establish a series of dethronements and restorations, in the course of
                        which Thothmes III. married his aunt and Thothmes II. allied himself with hi
                        stillliving father and cast the pair off the throne, has been entirely
                        knocked on the head by M. Legrain’s discovery at Karnak of many bas-reliefs
                        showing Thothmes II. as king, with Hatasu, in the dependent position of
                        queen, standing behind him. In other matters, too, M. Naville, with out
                        travelling out of the record of ascer tained facts, gives us much-needed
                        information He points out that Egypt at Hatasu’s accession was still
                        suffering from the waste and ruin of the Hyksos invasion, and that it was
                        probably due to her wise and peaceful rule that Thothmes III. found the land
                        able to support the drain of blood and treasure imposed by his own
                        Napoleonic policy. That she throughout strove with success to establish
                        commercial relations with neighbouring nations is shown by her famous
                        expedition to Punt, and M. Naville explains that much of the treasure which
                        Egyptian kings were io the habit displaying on their monuments as tribute
                        really consisted of foreign goods obtained by purchase or barter. He is also
                        very instructive on the ceremonies attaching to Egyptian royalty, and shows
                        from many examples taken from Hatasu’s monuments that the royal ka, or
                        double, was worshipped during the life of its living counterpart, and that
                        the many corona¬tion scenes where the Pharaoh is depicted as being crowned,
                        baptized, and Installed on different throne? by various animal headed gods,
                        represent ceremonies that were actually per¬formed, the parts of the deities
                        being filled by masked priests, it is curious also to note that the
                        cutting-out of a former king’s name from public monuments—a practice which
                        has de¬scended to modern times—was thought really to lead to his
                        annihilation in the under world, <cb n="4"/> and that the fashion of walking
                        backwards in the presence of royalty seems to be also derived from the ways
                        of the priests in the sanctuary where the royal image was set up. In all
                        these matters M. Naville's along study of the temples that he has for many
                        years successfully excavated at Deir el-Babari makes bis conclusions
                        especially valuable. The book makes a handsome pendant to “The Tomb of
                        Thothmes IV.” from the same excavations, which forms part of the gigantic
                        catalogue of the Cairo Museum. </p>

                        <p>To THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE.” Sir,—I beg through your columns
                            to express the general dissatisfaction and disgust felt by the public in
                            the provinces at the conduct of the doctors there, in whose ranks may be
                            found also some European and some American doctors, who (to their shame
                            or credit be it said, write our their prescriptions under special secret
                            names, the composition of which is known only to them and their pharmacy
                            that supplies “pure and reliable” (1) drugs,and which they consequently
                            "petronite.” It is very apparent that their patients are naturally
                            forced into the spider’s web, where, once entangled, relief and
                            salvation can only ba secured by a further drain upon their pur¬ser.
                            What the personal interest of the doctors in question is, remains a
                            mystery, and likewise is only known to them and those they “patronise”

                        <p>To THE EDITOR OF THE “EGYPTIAN GAZETTE </p>
                        <p>Sir,—I beg to emend an erroneous state¬ment which has found its way
                            through the columns of a leading French newspaper of our town, in
                            connection with the gypsum-bearing deposits of the Mariout, recently
                            bought by M. Emin Karam. Without going back to-dis¬tant antiquity, or
                            referring to the first Bedouin who christened the place with the
                            suggestive name of ouady el gyps, it is to M. Rend Four, of the Egyptian
                            Institute, that we are indebted for any exact information about these
                            deposits. In fact, in 1892, M. Fourtau, then engineer of the State
                            Railways, brought before a meet¬ing of the “Institut Egyptien" the
                            result of his geological observations in the Mariout We give herewith
                            the conclusion of his valuable monograph : "L’industriel pent aussi
                            tronver son profit dans le Mariout. Les carrieres de Ouady el-Gyps
                            penvent fournir on platre an moins egal an plAtre de Paris. L'etendue
                            des bancs de gypse est immense. J’ai constate leur existence sur one
                            longueur ininterrompue de plus da 10 kilometres et je n'evalue pas la
                            quantite a extraire a moins de 50,000,000 de tonnes !” And he added :
                            “Pour redonner an Mariout son antique prosperite none n’avons qu'a
                            faciliter les communications. Donnons lui les moyens des transports
                            faciles et biento 'Egypte possedera une nouvelle source de richesse et
                            de prosperite." i Eight years later, while on a geological
                            reconnaissance in the Mariout, I was charged by two gentlemen, inspired
                            from Fonrtan's memoir, to prospect the above gypsum deposits. Four sacks
                            of specimens that I brought back were assayed by the engineer Koressios
                            and showed to produce an excellent plaster. Two demands were only
                            submitted to the head office of the moudirieh, but received no answer
                            whatever. A month after a coastguards officer informed me that the
                            Khedive took possession of the quarries. The concession of the Mariout
                            gypsum has subsequently been given by His Highness to M. Syrigo, of our

                    <head>On the Purchase of an Old Egyptian Mirror.</head>
                    <p>In Muhassib's shop I found it—there with kindred relics round it— Scrolls in
                        hieroglyphics written, Scarabs, rings and jewels gay— And Muhassib said “My
                        master, thees for ninety-five piastre” So I paid up like a Briton And I
                        brought my prize away. Who were you of Egypt’s daughters, by some city of
                        the waters - You who gazed into it often With frown or with a smile ? When
                        it diagnosed a pimple or divulged a darling dimple, Did you sulk or did you
                        soften, Dainty damsel of the Nile Yes, my fancy loves to paint you, with no
                        tinge of vice to taint you, Yet with charming peccadilloes, As is woman's
                        wont to day. Pleasure's cup was for your drinking ; still Ere you crept into
                        your pillows; still each night when stars were winking, Yon could laugh or
                        you could pray. Dark your looks—a fillet bound them, and the lotus bad that
                        crowned them Served to gratify your passion For the realistic style. Yon
                        were sweet on scents and washes—painted shoe?, bat not goloshes Painted
                        eyes, too, were the fashion In the cities of the Nile. Ab, I've watched yon
                        in the stately temple drop those eyes sedately, As yon listened to the
                        chorus Sang by priests in rich array. Though at times your looks would
                        wander to a head dress over yonder, And the hymn begun to Horns On your Tips
                        would die away. Or at even to your chamber with your lyre I’ve seen you
                        clamber, And you played it supple fingered Listless moments to beguile, And
                        the notes would float and quiver till they reached the shining river- —
                        There were spots where lovers lingered By the reedy banks of Nile. So my
                        fancy loves to limn her—Egypt's child who in the glimmer the Past lived
                        whole and human, Of With her minor for a friend— Lived to make in ancient
                        ages slaves of kings and fools of sages : For woman aye was woman And she
                        will be to the end. G. </p>

                    <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                        January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so warm as
                        Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm
                        than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in
                        the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest
                        place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                        sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on each of
                        the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="3"/>
                    <p>They are as follows:-</p>
                    <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southhampton,
                        London or Liverpool—occupy about 4 days. The short ones are as follows:—</p>

                    <p>The steamers of the P.&amp;O. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageries
                        Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines are
                        also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by travellers to
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made without change
                        in 4 ½ hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp;O.
                        Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna
                        express from Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail Steamers “Osiris" and “Isis” to Brindisi. One of these leaves port
                        Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian <cb n="6"
                        />mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                    <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                        attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats" having
                        been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi.
                        If you are going straight through to England you will find the train waiting
                        at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete
                        arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in
                        London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <head>SICILY.</head>
                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.’s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMENA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is the
                        station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful,
                        occupying about one hour. In and around the town is much to interest the
                        visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but restored under the Romans.
                        CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of Etna and here also is a fine
                        Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all over
                        the island, are an endless sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting
                        history, having been a Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C.
                        413, and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb
                        is to be seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                        about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                        delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The
                        Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S.
                        Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral,
                        Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also worth a
                        visit.</p>

                    <head>CENTRAL ITALY.</head>
                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.’s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                        bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento
                        [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                        City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence itself the churches
                        and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local promenades and
                        excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and
                        fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea
                        level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero,
                        thence by cog-wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks
                        takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; hero there is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                        and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                        house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                        and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                    <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                        the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and deliciously cool
                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy’s most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                        SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal springs,
                        change trains at Borgo San Donino and in half-an-hour you are at

                    <head>NORTHERN ITALY (Continued) and The ITALIAN LAKES.</head>
                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea port.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                        lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza :</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo, Cadenabbia,
                        and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio opposite. The walk
                        from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio is most enjoyable. A
                        steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake Lugano in three-quarters
                        of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                    <head>SWITZERLAND.</head>
                    <p>Switzerland, the heart of Europe, has been described as "A cluster of
                        delights and grandeurs."</p>
                    <p>LUGANO is some 20 miles from Como and reached by train in one-and-a-half
                        hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated on
                        the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San
                        Salvatore, M. de Caprino.and M. Generoso.</p>
                    <p>LOCARNO, may be reached by rail from Bellinzona in forty minutes. This pretty
                        town, situated at the top of lake Maggiore has a mild climate and is an
                        excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated above the
                        town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings, “Entombment,"
                        by Ciseri, and ‘Tho Flight into Egypt,” by Bramantion.</p>
                    <p>LUCERNE—A striking picture on the Lake of Lucerne facing the Rigi and Pilatus
                        and the snow-clad Alps.</p>
                    <p>In and around the town the walks are charming, and the excursions to be made
                        from Lucerne by boat, rail, etc., are very numerous.</p>
                    <p>The Lake of Lucerne abounds in delightful excursions, those to the Rigi,
                        Pilatus, Burgenstock and Sonnenberg needing a special visit each. Other
                        excursions on the lake can be made by steamer, and the ever-changing scenery
                        on the trip from Lucerne, to Fluelen is a source of delight to the lover of
                        nature.</p>
                    <p>BRUNNEN, charmingly situated on the most beautiful part of the Lake of
                        Lucerne, commands magnificent views of lake and mountain scenery. Along the
                        Lake of Uri from Brunnen to Fluelen runs the famous Axentrasse</p>
                    <p>A delightful exeption from Lucerne is that to ENGELBERG. Take boat to
                        Stansstad and from Stansstad it is about 1 hour and 40 min. by Electric
                        Railway, with delightful scenery en route. The ascent of Titlis, is made
                        from here, and the panoramic view of the Alps is grand; extending from Monte

                        from Alexandria ; the climate in April is charming. The best steamers are

                        present at the dancing on the Easter Tuesday festival held at Megara for
