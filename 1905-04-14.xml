                    <head>THE ETHIOPIAN RAILWAY. </head>
                    <p>Abyssinia, our immediate neighbour in the Sudan, must inevitably be drawn
                        nearer and nearer to Egypt by commercial ties, and the recent link that has
                        been forged between the two countries by the participation of the National
                        Bank of Egypt in the new State bank of Abyssinia is destined to bring the
                        two countries into close touch with one another. Another and still more
                        important link between Abyssinia and the Valley of the Nile will be the
                        Ethiopian railway, the third section of which will extend from Adis Abeba to
                        the Nile, and a telegram this morning from the Abyssinian capital contains
                        an announcement of the utmost importance as regards the future of this
                        important line of railway.</p>
                    <p>The object of the negotiations which have been taking place during the past
                        two years, and are still in progress, is to find some means of escape from
                        an intolerable situation, which, while safeguarding the independance of
                        Abyssinia, will secure the construction of the remaining sections of the
                        railway and thus render it possible to develop the mineral, pastoral, and
                        agricultural resources of the Ethiopian Empire. It is natural that Frenchmen
                        should <cb n="6"/> contemplate with extreme reluctance the abandonment of
                        the hope of securing political and commercial predominance in Abyssinia, and
                        hesitate to acquiesce in the rival policy of equal rights for all nations.
                        Three months ago the president of the railway company expressed the hope
                        that the French Government would still be persuaded to make an immediate and
                        powerful effort to obtain satisfaction for the company, and thus make it
                        possible for the enterprise to retain its exclusively French character. More
                        recently the French African Committee adopted resolutions pointing in the
                        direction; but as yet there has been no public indication by the French
                        Government as to whether it is prepared to apply great pressure at Adis
                        Abeba with the object indicated, or whether it intends to accept the advice
                        of the principal French Chambers of Commerce that it should acquiesce in the
                        proposal for placing. the Ethiopian Railway system under international
                        control. Among those who are pressing the former solution on the Government,
                        it is frankly recognised that French influence alone is insufficient to
                        induce the Emperor to change his mind, and the suggestion which is put
                        forward is that since the establishment of the Anglo-French entente cordiale
                        the French Government may reasonably invite the British Government not only
                        to abandon the policy which it has hitherto supported, but to join. with
                        France in inducing the Emperor Menelik to accede to the French demands.</p>
                    <p>Even if the consideration of British interests be for the moment left on one
                        side, it is not clear what advantage, sufficient to justify further pressure
                        being brought on the Emperor Menelik, France can hope to derive, under the
                        changed conditions of to-day, from the maintenance of the railway as an
                        exclusively French enterprise. No doubt if the whole of the railway from
                        Djibouti to the western frontier of Abyssinia, or even to Adis Abeba, were
                        to be exclusively controlled by France, it would be a potential instrument
                        for the furtherance of French interests. A not unimportant section of the
                        French public is still therefore unwilling to abandon the hope that
                        diplomatic action at Adis Abeba may secure the consent of the Emperor to the
                        construction of the remaining sections of the line as an exclusively French
                        enterprise. The advocates of this view suggest that the friendly relations
                        now existing between the British and the French Governments justify France
                        in asking Great Britain not only to abandon the opposition which, it is
                        alleged, Sir John Harrington has hitherto shown to the proposals of the
                        Ethiopian Railway Company, but actively to support those proposals.</p>
                    <p>Such a suggestion implies a radical misconception of the political conditions
                        at the Abyssinian capital. Apart altogether from the atti tude which may
                        have been adopted by the British Minister Plenipotentiary and his Italian
                        colleague, the central fact of the situation is that since he became
                        acquainted with the terms of the railway agreement of 1902 the Emperor
                        Menelik is himself firmly and unalter ably opposed to any part of the
                        Abyssinian railway system remaining under the exclusive control of a single
                        European Power. There are still many Frenchmen who are apparently unable to
                        realise what a colossal political blunder that agreement was. The French
                        Government insisted on the inclusion of clauses which were, in the words of
                        the President of the Ethiopian Railway Company, "obviously incompatible with
                        the Sovereign rights of the Emperor Menelik."</p>
                    <p>None of the numerous attempts which have been made to explain away those
                        clauses, or to give them an innocent meaning, have succeeded in removing
                        from the mind of the Emperor the impression that the ultimate object of
                        French policy was to secure at least a political sphere of influence in
                        Abyssinia. British political and commercial interests, which it is the
                        primary duty of the British Government to safeguard, are opposed to the
                        establishment of exclusively French control over the railway. But even were
                        the British Government to lend its diplomatic support to French pretensions,
                        the only result would be to destroy the influence which Sir John Harrington
                        has succeeded in establishing at the Abyssinian Court. Menelik, would not
                        have far to look for support elsewhere, and his notification to the
                        representatives of the powers, as announced in to-day's tele grams, shows
                        that he is determined to settle the question in his own way, as he is well
                        aware how the influences of European civilisation, when materialising in the
                        form of railways, telegraphs, and financial assistance, all provided by
                        foreigners, may be turned into financial control and industrial domina tion,
                        and finally powerful instruments of political leverage subserving the ends
                        of foreign ambition,</p>

                                his Palace, and notified them that, unless they come to an agreement

                                agreement providing for the maintenance of the independence of

                            <p>This fact is noteworthy in view of M. Deleasse's speech on the 2nd

                        <p>Spring has begun to make itself felt in Cairo, and although the rays of
                            the sun remind one already of the coming summer heat, the weather can
                            only be termed delightful. But with the advent of spring our visitors
                            leave the land of the Pharaohs, and carriage after carriage, bearing
                            passengers and luggage, may have been seen in the Cairo streets during
                            the past few days. In the hotels the furniture of some of the rooms is
                            already being stored away, and oven the number of carriages is being
                            reduced, —all signs that the season is nearing its end. </p>

                        <p>The beautiful weather at Alexandria just now is attracting a number of
                            visitors to the seashore, and the fashionable Beau Rivage Hotel is being
                            well patronised. Under the direction of Mr. G. Runckewitz, formerly
                            manager of the Grand Hotel Weber, in Antwerp, and tho Therapia Summer

                            comfort of the hotel's clients, and splendid accommodation may be
                            obtained for social functions, fetes, and ban- quets at the hotel, where
                            also promenaders may enjoy afternoon tea in the garden or on the
                            terrace. The excellent cuisine is a feature at this hostelry, and a
                            reliable European service throughout has been instituted by the
                            management. </p>

                        <p>The express which leaves Cairo at midday was an hour late yes- terday in
                            arriving at Alexandria owing to a mishap to a child. While the latter
                            was leaning out of a carriage window by Calioub another train passed,
                            and it is supposed the child received a knock and was thrown out on to
                            the line between the two trains. Both the trains were going at full
                            speed and it is extraordinary that the child was not fatally injured.
                            The train was brought to a standstill and reversed in order to pick up
                            the child, who was found close to Culioub. Scander Pasha Fehmy hap-
                            pened to be on the train and showed great energy in directing the
                            operations. When the child was discovered it was found that she had been
                            badly cut about the head. After being bandaged up and receiving first
                            aid the victim was put on the train and conveyod to Alexandria. </p>

                    <p>Water was first struck on the property of the corporation at 25 feet from the
                        surface This continually increased in volume to about 100 feet, where it
                        rose to 15 feet from the surface. Other heavy bodies of water were met at
                        depths between 100 and 300 feet, when the water stood at 10 feet from the
                        surface. At about 320 feet water was struck rising to 2 1/2 feet above the
                        surface. The water in No. 1 borehole at Khargeh, which has been sunk to four
                        hundred feet, is flowing at a height of 12 feet above the surface of the
                        ground, at the rate of about 150 gallons a minute, and increasing. </p>
                    <p>There never has been any doubt to the minds of those acquainted with the
                        locality as to the practical certainty of finding artesian water at a
                        certain depth over the whole area. It has, however, been suggested that the
                        available supply would not suffice to irrigate the vast area of cultivable
                        land known to be available. The discovery of large bodies of water to the
                        strata at moderate depths rising to such a depth below the surface as to be
                        easily accessible to ordinary sakiehs or pumps, is of the highest promise,
                        and if the supplies prove to extend over large areas will remove all fear of
                        the necessity of leaving these areas un- cultivated. Also lands on which it
                        might be dangerous to bore artesian wells for fear of injuring existing
                        supplies can be irrigated if these supplies exist nearer the surface.</p>
                    <p>It appears that these water-bearing beds are well known to the natives, but
                        they in- variably continue to bore until they reach a true artesian
                        supply.</p>
                    <p>The discovery of the ancient Roman irriga- tion works consisting of lines of
                        subterranean channels and wells leading the water from higher to lower
                        levels in the extreme north of Kbargeh, and that this district appears to
                        have a considerable water supply that can be reached by ordinary appliances,
                        is also of importance. This district is some 15 miles in length by 1 to 1
                        1/2 in breadth.</p>
                    <p>A considerable number of new alum beds have been discovered, some portions of
                        which contain workable proportions of cobalt. Cobalic alum had previously
                        been found in Dakhleh only.</p>
                    <p>Considerable beds of phosphates have also been discovered in Khargeh as well
                        as in Dakhleh.</p>
                    <p>The water supply at the Deishar greatly in- creased on being opened up, and
                        so far as can be ascertained the level at which the water now stands
                        corresponds nearly with that of the ancient Roman water channels at the same
                        place. This is of great importance, as it tends to disprove allegations to
                        the effect that the level has sunk since the Roman occupation.</p>

                    <dateline>London, April 7. </dateline>
                    <p>A great lull has generally preceded an im- portant battle. The present lull,
                        however, is, it is confidently hoped, the prelude to a great peace. There
                        are certainly "pourparlers" going on, but the secret is well-kept. As it is
                        long in the hatching, let us hope it will be a well- considered and lasting
                        one. Meantime, finan- cial affairs are still in the expectant attitude, and
                        markets have a halting tendency.</p>
                    <p>Although money has been "wanted," the Bank directors have reflected the
                        general position, and declared no alteration in the Bank rate, which still
                        stands at 2 1/2 per cent. minimum, a good rate for helping commercial enter-
                        prise. It would appear that the Government decline to be frightened by the
                        "Brighton breakers," and intend to continue to navigate the ship of State,
                        at any rate while foreign affairs are in their present liquid position ;
                        hence the ill effects of a prospective General Election came only to pass
                        away.</p>
                    <p>Egyptian Companies which have come out, are hatched more or less "fully
                        fledged," and they all seem likely to be able to survive the early stages of
                        their career. Their future will depend upon the uses to which they put the
                        money the public have entrusted to them. </p>
                    <p>In Egyptian stocks, as stated before, the new issue rush is being overdone,
                        and too many new things are being hurried on the heels of one another. There
                        is no doubt plenty of scope in Egypt for all of them, but a little more time
                        might be given for digestion, or the appetite may be spoiled.</p>
                    <p>There is not much of interest to report with regard to the past week's stock
                        markets, for, although the tone remains steady, business has been on a very
                        small scale. Tho most active point has been the new Japanese 4 1/2 per cent.
                        issue, to which the dealings have been large. The market was somewhat
                        over-sold before the allotment, and found itself short of stock, and the
                        premium has in consequence been well maintained above 2.</p>
                    <p>In Home Government securities the uncer- tainty of the political situation
                        has checked business, and the prices have eased off somewhat.</p>
                    <p>In the Egyptian market the rise in National and Agricultural Banks still goes
                        on, and the Agriculturals, in spite of the coming large increase of capital
                        referred to last week, are firm at 13 15/16, which looks high enough, whilst
                        Nationals are almost 28. Daira Sanieh shares were a feature yesterday,
                        rising to 27 1/2. Other prices are practically unchanged. In the mining
                        section, prices have given way again ; the revival of interest in Kaffirs
                        has usurped the attention of dealers.</p>

                <div type="item">
                    <head>EGYPTIAN MINES.</head>
                    <p>A London correspondent writes :—</p>
                    <p>What is happening in the Egyptian section of the Mining market? It presented
                        on ap- pearance of great strength a week or two ago, and it seemed
                        impossible to fix a limit to which prices might go. Then, with surprising
                        sud- denness, comes a fall in Nile Valleys to 2 1/2, Block E.s to 19/16 and
                        North Niles to 1 1/2, with the rest of the list proportionately weak.
                        Naturally, after the bright promise of the last few weeks, people are asking
                        for an explanation. The suggestions offered are of varied nature. In one
                        quarter it is supposed that a crushing, the declaration of which is expected
                        shortly, is likely to turn out badly. Elsewhere it is said that at one of
                        the properties where rich quartz has been met with, it has now been
                        definitely ascertained that the main body of the ore is barren. There may be
                        some foundation for these rumours or there may not be. The more likely
                        explanation of the fall, probably, is that various dealers have "ratted,"
                        and it has been impossible to continue the pool in certain shares. The
                        position is not a very satisfactory one from the point of view of the
                        general pu- blic, I fear.</p>

                    <p>(du 5 au 13 avril)</p>
                    <p>La semaine avait débuté par une hauss générale, particulièrement sensible
                        pour les valeurs de premier ordre. Forts de nouvelles semi-officieuses
                        répandues pour pousser les cours, certains spéculateurs s'étaient lancés à
                        corps perdu. Le résultat d'une telle imprudence ne s'est pas fait attendre:
                        le marché, surchargé de petits acheteurs incapables de mainten r leurs
                        positions, n'a pas tardé à réactionne; ceux qui s'étaient trop avancés ont
                        dû liquider. C'est ce qui a déterminé, avec l'énervement de la place, la
                        faiblesse de ces derniers jours.</p>
                    <p>La corbeille, une fois débarrassée de ce trop plein, a repris à la suite
                        d'importants rachat; mais une nouvelle réaction est à craindre d'u moment à
                        l'autre. Les hauts cours entraîneront nécessairement des réalisations et de
                        noubreuses positions devront coûté que coûte à quider à la fin du mois.</p>
                    <p>Somme toute, le marché en lui-même n'est pas mauvais et le numéraire abonde
                        ici. La 1 preuve en est qu'à elle seule la souscription da Trust a produit
                        en une journée et demie la jolie somme de 1 million de livres sterling. 111
                        faut dire que le calme plat qui ne cesse de régner sur les contrats depuis
                        quelques mois est un facteur important de prospérité pour la corbeille des
                        valeurs. Bon nombre de courtiers en coton ne sachant que faire à la
                        corbeille des marchandises se rejettent sur les valeurs dont a manipulation
                        leur donne plus de bénéfices. L fermeture de l'après-midi a bien, si l'on
                        veut, un peu ralenti les arbitrages avec Londres et Paris, mais cette mesure
                        a eu en définitive plus d'avantages que d'inconvénients: les esprits
                        échauffés durant la matinée ont ainsi le temps d de se calmer et de
                        réfléchir durant l'après-g midi ; c'est ce qui a empêché d'exagérer le mou-
                        vement sur certaines valeurs, comme cela avait eu lieu récemment. Les
                        contrats suivront d'aii-d leurs le même horaire à partir du 22 courant.</p>
                    <p>Les valeurs qui ont été le plus en faveur b durant la semaine sont
                        l'Agricole, la Daïra et la Banque Nationale sur lesquelles s'est concen-
                        trée toute l'attention du marché. Les voleurs de e second ordre ont été par
                        le fait même un peu négligées.</p>
                    <p>L'Agricole débute à 13 9/16, atteint 14 et clôture à 13 3/8 en bonne demande.

                        attend avec impatience le bilan qui sera communiqué à l'assemblée du 29
                        avril et qu'on annonce comme très avantageux. Les rumeurs mises en circu-

                        rien d'officiel, nous nous abstenons de les publier.</p>
                    <p>La Banque Nationale ouvre à 27 1/2, atteint 28 et retombe à 27 7/16 ferme. On
                        annonce comme probable une nouvelle émission de 50,000 t actions de £10,
                        émises à £20à raison de 1 titre nouveau pour 5 anciens.</p>
                    <p>Un des premiers actes du nouveau comité des courtiers en valeurs a été

                    <p>En Markets les transactions ont été nom breuses et de ce chef le cours
                        remonte de 22/9 à 26/6 pour clôturer à 25/6.Cette reprise est dûe en partie
                        à la diminution de la peste bovine et en partie à une concession d'abattoirs
                        que les Markets obtiendraient dans les villages. La Delta Light, ferme au
                        début à 14 7/16- 14 1/2, fléchit plus tard à 14 3/16 offerte. La Deferred

                        faire sa prochaine émission; celle-ci serait réservée aux actionnaires
                        inscrits dans ses livres, de telle sorte que les porteurs éventuels qui ne
                        seraient pas arrivés à transférer leurs certificats du nom de leurs vendeurs
                        en leurs noms propres ne pourraient souscrire à la nouvelle émission. Mais
                        on espère que, vu les circonstances, la Société fera droit aux justes
                        desiderata du public.</p>

                    <p>De 5,9 les Cotton Mills retombent à 5/6. L'Anglo-American Nile fléchit de 6

                        traitées au début à 5,200, o clôture à 6,900 francs. On attribue cette
                        hausse à une entente entre le Crédit Foncier et la New Daira Sanieh Cy. pour

                    <p>The market has been very quiet this week, and the sales small. Spinners
                        continue their hand to mouth policy, and only buy for im mediate
                        requirements. Prices are in favor of the buyer, but quotations are
                        unchanged. Only a moderate business has been done in futures. The following
                        are the latest values:- April 6.44 June 6.33 Aug. 6.26</p>

                        to-day's closing values are 3 @ 5 points higher than those of last Thursday.
                        Speculation is completely in abeyance pending further information re-
                        garding the progress of planting, the use of fertilizers, and the estimated
