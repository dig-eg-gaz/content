                    <head>THE P. AND 0. MAIL CONTRACT.</head>
                    <p>To expect absolute accuracy in the average newspaper report on mercantile
                        marine affairs, especially in so technical a subject as steamship speed,
                        would be equivalent to expecting to fetch a given port with a compass that,
                        un known to the mariner, was holpelessly wrong in deviation. Probably that
                        is why some con temporaries have recently published half-true or worse
                        statements anent the Peninsular and Oriental Company's new contract to carry
                        mails to Inflia, China, and Australia. This is a part of our overseas
                        postage that has been principally in the company's hands during the past
                        sixty years or more. Thus if any firm of shipowners know best how to carry
                        ocean-borne mails to the east, it should be the P. and 0,</p>
                    <p>As to Ihe new contract, which begins on the 1st of next February, and
                        continues for seven years from that date, for £35,000 less a year than
                        formerly, the company will decrease the outward passage by thirty-six hours
                        and the homeward run by just a nautical day. This increase in speed has been
                        characterised by one of the morning dailies as "very small." Another
                        compared the savings with what would be made on -the Atlantic if the
                        proposed "all red route" should become a fact Complaints have been made that
                        the P. and 0. are not forced by the terms of the subsidy to run twenty-knot
                        boats, instead of their sixteen to seventeen-knotters. It has also been put
                        forward that the Far Eastern and southern routes are better suited for
                        increased speed than the Atlantic is, where the increase during the past d
                        jeade has been about six knots an hour. To answer these matters from the
                        bottom upwards, says the "Pall Mall Gazette": It is the short passage that
                        has the advantage over the longer one in scope for acceleration, simply
                        because every knot per hour put on over fifteen or sixteen means,
                        proportionately, a much larger increase in thecost of propulsion, efficiency
                        of engines, and resistance of reverberation. Whilst the Suez Canal remains
                        in its present condition and continues to be the route to the Far East, it '
                        is next to impossible to rnn even eighteen-knot boats. What is more, the
                        great increase in speed across the Western Ocean has been only on its
                        northern part. No steamer running through the tropics has put on more than
                        half that acceleration in the same number of years. So far from a decrease
                        of from twenty- four to thirty-six hours being a small matter on such a long
                        mn; without holding any brief for the P. and 0., it means a bigdlRMR^ both
                        in the capital cost of vessels and in running them. It most also b0
                        remembered that all acceleration in speed means diminished earning powers,
                        owing to the finer lines needed in the craft, and to the greater amount of
                        coal that has to he carried to gain that increase.</p>
                    <p>If speed and frequency of service are required, whether for mail-carrying or
                        any other purpose afloat, the increase in excess of what ordinary trade
                        conditions warrant must be paid for by subsidy of some sort And it is quite
                        obvious that no shipowner will build vessels for such a service, unless he
                        first obtains a certain fixity of tenure. He cannot be expected to ran the
                        risk of having such cosfily experiments thrown on his hands at the end of a
                        short contract, with no probable employment available for them. For this
                        reason seven years is a short term for a mail contract, with such an
                        acceleration of speed on a long passage. It is so short that any company new
                        to that business would not be content without a much longer term. Besides,
                        as to the comparison of speed on the Atlantic and on the eastern routes, in
                        addition to the physical, the commercial conditions are entirely different.
                        If the public wants artificially fast services, over and above what the
                        usual trade considerations require, then Jhe nation must he prepared to pay
                        the marginal account. The shipowner does not like such artificiality ini his
                        trade, because it means running his busine grts, on an artificial basis. It
                        means the different between garden and hothonse growing, or th which exists
                        between Free Trade and Prote tion. As an illustration of what high spec
                        means, Sir William Lyne told the recent Col nial Conference, apropos of the
                        "all red route actui (which, by the by, is the only concrete ontcona mean of
                        the Conference), that an increase of thre imt knots on fifteen per hour
                        meant actuall runni doubling the coal consumption. Experts ii yiftftl marine
                        engineering and shipbuilding say ths mere this statement is perfectly
                        accurate, and tha imeai it means a comparatively great cost in th meres
                        craft themselves ; the governing rule bein mean that the coal consumption
                        increases at th at 1 same rate as the cube of the speed. With reference more
                        directly to the "all re route," it could not alternate properly wit the P.
                        and 0. service by the Suez Canal. Th two services would be mutually
                        desfcruetivi The distance by the former route is 13,76 miles, taking
                        Melbourne as the port of destin ation, and 10,804 miles by the latter route
                        Thus between the two there is a difference o 2,963 miles in favour of the
                        Suez route, or o 27.5 per cent, and no transhipment of eithe passengers or
                        cargo. An average mail speed o sixteen knots to Australia, which some writer
                        have treated so contemptuously, in favour o the ] an "all red route,"
                        represents a speed that ha* it w&lt; never yet been maintained by a
                        mercantile the ] craft in tropical waters except across the it wc Indian
                        Ocean, and only then with a favouring the ] monsoon breeze more or less at
                        her heels. I&lt; run. must he borne in mind that to keep up such a tt wc
                        rate of speed as is being asked for it would b€ the ] necessary, on certain
                        sections of the passage, trou] considerably to exceed that speed; and that a
                        that ship giving such results would require, when arice built, to be capable
                        of a speed of at least three arme knots faster than the average of her run.
                        As- nat i suming, however, that the P. and 0. run a ice t sixteen knot
                        service throughout, the time the I occupied between the Thames and Melbourne
                        iu&lt;e 1 will be 28 days 19 hours; while to attain an t equally quick
                        transit on the "all red route" a speed of twenty knots would be required on
                        the Atlantic and eighteen knots on the Pacific. This would involve a subsidy
                        of probably double that which is required for the Suez route; and even those
                        Australian Premiers who, at the Conference, talked so well for the proposed
                        way rift Canada, could not promise more than a fifteen-knot service from
                        Vancouver to Melbourne.</p>

                            district of Beba, 1 at Beni-Souef, 1 at Assiont, 1 at Mellawi, 1 at
                            Deirout, 2 at Abou Tig, 8 at Damanhour and 6 at Esneh. From the 1st
                            January to the 1st July of this year a total of 946 cases of plague have
                            been registered, as against 370 cases for the corresponding period of
                            last year. Only one fresh case was reported during the past 24 hours and
                            that at Damanbour. 17 patients are still under treatment.</p>

                        <head>The Pilgrimage.</head>
                        <p>The number of pilgrims expected to visit Mecca this year is 281,000,
                            which indicates that the pilgrimage is not losing its prestige. Out of
                            this number 113,000 are Turkish subjects, 40,000 natives of India,
                            17,000 Moors, 16,000 Russians, 15,000 Persians, 13,000 Sudanese, 12,000
                            from Bokhara, and 4,500 Malays. The sanitary state of these various
                            groups has much improved, owing to more rapid communications by means of
                            railway from Hedjaz, and also, in a great measure, to the very severe
                            sanitary measures adopted at Djeddah, port of disembarkation for
                            Mecca.</p>

                    <head>AQUATIC CARNIVAL.</head>
                    <head>SWIMMING CLUB "AT HOME."</head>
                    <p>Of the many entertainments which have been offered to the Mediterranean Fleet
                        during its brief visit to Alexandria, none has been more successful or more
                        appreciated than the aquatic carnival of yesterday, on which occasion the
                        Alexandria Swimming Club were "at home" to the Fleet. Well over two hundred
                        men of the Fleet were present, and all enjoyed themselves to the full. The
                        Club, too, turned out a fair number of members, from whom an invincible team
                        was selected. The organisation of the carnival was perfect and exceptionally
                        creditable, in view of the fact that all entries were at the post. Great
                        assistance was given to the Club by Lieut. Fullerton of H.M.S. "Queen," who
                        was in command, and brought his men up to the post most promptly. In fine,
                        and to express oneself in the terms of sportsmen, everyone " played the
                        game," all were delighted, and no greater compliment could have been paid to
                        the Club than the rousing and unanimous chorus of "For he's a jolly good
                        fellow," with which the entertainment terninated, and the ringing cheers
                        amid which the men of the Fleet rowed back to duty. It was indeed, a good
                        old British crowd of sportsmen at the height of enjoyment, enthusiastic, and
                        highly appreciative of the Club's effort to give them "a good show."
                        Generally speaking, the Mediterranean Fleet have been well entertained
                        during their visit to Alexandria, and we were proud to overhear the remark,
                        passed by a sailor at yesterday's carnival of the Alexandria Swimming Club,
                        "I wish every port would treat us as these people do." On their part, the
                        Club are greatly indebted to Lieutenant Fullerton, of H.M.S. "Queen," whose
                        organisation of the Fleet's, which was, of course, the greater portion,
                        participation in the carnival very largely contributed to the success of the
                        afternoon. The men, too, are to be thanked for the ready way in which they
                        responded to the calls of their hosts, and for the hearty manners in which
                        they expressed their appreciation.</p>
                    <p>The carnival was opened by a team race of 420 yards, each team being composed
                        of 7 men, each of whom swam 60 yards. The fleet team was composed as follows:—
                        Chapman, "Queen"; Johnson, "Lancaster"; Taylor, "Suffolk"; Laden,
                        "Venerable"; London, "Diana"; Cashen, "Irresistible"; Clark, "Prince of
                        Wales." The Swimming Club team was comprised as follows:—Martin, Lloyd,
                        Howard, Glasspole, Ecclestone, Randall, and Darton. Starting off with
                        Martin for the Club and Chapman for the Fleet a splendid race of sixty yards
                        was witnessed, the former winning by about half a foot. Following Martin,
                        Lloyd took the water very smartly and gained an appreciable lead from
                        Johnson. This was increased by Howard, who followed, and when Ecclestone
                        entered the water a win for the Club was certain. Randall and Darton in turn
                        each materially increased the lead and the Club eventually won by a good 36
                        yards.</p>
                    <p>The next event was the plunging competition for which there were over a
                        hundred entries, and this was divided into twelve heats, the winners of
                        which were as follows:— Heat 1 — Condren, "Prince of Wales"; Heat 2 —
                        Woods, "Queen"; Heat 3 — Smith, "Ir resistible''; Heat 4 — Warren, "Diana";
                        Heat 5 — Gillot, "Queen"; Heat 6 — Laroche ; Heat 7 — Barnes, "Prince of
                        Wales"; Heat 8 — Johnson, "Lancaster"; Heat 9 — Bennett, "Suffolk"; Heat 10
                        — Bignall, "Venerable" ; Heat 11 — Garbodd, ''Queen"; Heat 12 — Woolley,
                        "Queen." The semi-final was plunged in two parts, the winner and swimmer up
                        being Wood and Smith, and of the second Garbodd, with Johnson and Bignall
                        dead level for second place. In the final Smith, of the "Irresistible," came
                        in an easy first with a plunge of 49 feet, and second place was awarded to
                        Garbodd, of the "Queen."</p>
                    <p>After the plunging competition came the polo match, Fleet v. Club, and this
                        proved to be the mosc exciting and besf contested event of the afternoon.
                        The teams were constituted as follows :—</p>
                    <p>Fleet—Chapman, "Queen"; Warren, "Diana"; Green, "Lancaster"; Davis,
                        "Barham," Simpson, "Irresistible"; Mainsbridge, "Venerable"; and Clark
                        "Prince of Wales."</p>
                    <p>Swimming Club.—Martin, Darton, Potts, Ecclestone, Howard, Glasspole,
                        Inglott.</p>
                    <p>From the start the game was fast and exciting, and some excellent play was
                        witnessed before the never-failing Martin scored the first goal for the
                        Club. The fleet, however, soon had their revenge, Mainsbridge of the
                        "Venerable" scoring a very clever goal. Ecclestone drew the Club ahead again
                        and half time was called with the scores at 2 to 1 in the Club's favour. In
                        the second half Martin soon scored the third goal for his side and the
                        second to his credit, and it was not long before Ecclestone made the score 4
                        to 1. The Fleet after this, however, pulled together better and by some very
                        good play, Warren, of the "Diana," and Mainsbridge, of the "Venerable," each
                        added a goal for the Fleet. The play of both sides was good throughout and
                        the Fleet team showed splendid form, but the feature of the match was the
                        play of Martin, who, although not having played a match for four years, was
                        dead on the ball every time it came near him, and shot for goal splendidly
                        at long distances. Ecclestone, Darton, and Glasspole also showed very good
                        form. The final score was Club 4 goals, Fleet 3.</p>
                    <p>The blindfold race, three widths of the bath, was very well swum, but a few
                        of the men were less blind than they should have been, and were consequently
                        disqualified, and two or three fouls were also given for ducking<cb n="3"/>
                        fellow-swimmers. The race was swum off in three heats, resulting as follows
                        :—Heat 1. Laden "Venerable;" Johnson, "Lancaster"; Kingston, "Suffolk." Heat
                        2. Hart, "Queen;" Fuller, "Lancaster"; Simpson, "Irresistible"; Heat 3.
                        Lamb, Perry, Hales, "Queen".</p>
                    <p>For the final the nine men mentioned lined up, and a very good race was
                        witnessed, Hart, of the "Queen" winning by a touch.</p>
                    <p>The blindfold race was followed by the tug-of-war, each of the eight boats
                        sending a team of four. Every pull was most keenly contested and there was
                        little to be chosen among the teams, but the "Venerable" and "Barham" were
                        the two strongest, and in the final the former won by obtaining the first
                        two pulls. Walking the greasy pole caused much amusement, several of the men
                        being in fancy costumes of most original designs. The flag was secured twice
                        out of three times by Loughlin of the "Irresistible" who was most skilful,
                        and came out an easy winner. The prize for the best costume was secured by
                        the wearer of the Turkish lady's dress, and the policeman and olown are also
                        deserving of special mention.</p>
                    <p>After the carnival had been concluded, (all too soon for both fleet and club,
                        but the voice of duty called "clear the bath and get ready for the boats"),
                        Mr. Walter F. Sarjeant, who, as Chairman of the Club and member of the
                        entertainment committee for the visit of the Fleet, presided over the "At
                        Home", generously presented to the winners of the various events monetary
                        prizes. Refreshments and cigarettes were also provided by Mr. Sarjeant Mr.
                        Sarjeant was well thanked for his indefatigability in conducting the
                        carnival, and his hospitality in entertaining all, and the men's farewell
                        chorus of "For he's a jolly good fellow" amply showed their hearty
                        appreciation of his, and the club's generally, efforts to entertain
                        them.</p>
                    <div type="item" status="verified">
                        <head>FLEET v. ALEXANDRIA.</head>
                        <p>The Egyptian XI that turned out on Monday against the Fleet was in
                            reality an Alexandria XI with the exception of Major Liddell, of Cairo.</p>
                        <p>Alexandria won the toss and elected to bat first, Birley and H.B. Carver
                            opening at 11.30, and the former was bowled by Hastings in the second
                            over. Kinder then joined Carver and the score was taken to 28 when
                            Carver was caught off a fast one from Scott which bumped nastily.
                            Liddell then followed and the aspect of the game improved, 119 being
                            registered before Kinder was well caught on the boundary for a useful
                            but distinctly lucky 62. At 1 p.m. an adjournment was made to the Union
                            Club where the Fleet XI were entertained at lunch by the A.C.C. and the
                            game was resumed at 2.30 p.m. Liddell left shortly after being joined by
                            Mainprice, his 40 having taken him longer than usual to obtain. Three
                            more wickets fell quickly, and matters did not look so bright with 6
                            wickets down for 164, when, Hay then joined Mainprice and the score was
                            carried to 242. The latter was dismissed fora well played 75 which was
                            obtained without giving a chance, and the innings closed for a total of
                            255, Hay carrying his bat for a useful 26. Kitcat and Campbell started
                            for the Fleet, but the latter fell in the second over and Elstob who
                            followed was shortly afterwards bowled by Prosser. Yeo and Kitcat were
                            getting settled when the former had bad luck in being run out, and Kit
                            cat was dismissed for a steady 27. Hotham carrying his bat for 28 was
                            the only one to give any further trouble and the last wicket fell for a
                            total of 116, Alexandria thus winning by 139 runs. Prosser bowled well
                            to begin with but seemed to tire, and H.B Carver who went on in his
                            place, took the last 3 wickets for 5 runs only. With half an hour left
                            for play the Fleet followed on and lost three wickets for 51, when
                            stumps were drawn at 6.15 p.m.</p>

                        <head>MRS. MOSS "AT HOME."</head>
                        <p>Yesterday a most enjoyable day was spent at Aboukir by some 50 midshipmen
                            of the Fleet, who were entertained by the British Colony, represented by
                            Captain J. T. Murray; Rev. E. H. Blyth; Messrs, H. E. and F. W. Moss;
                            J. D. Clarke; R. Carver; and J. Wallace. The trip was a great success
                            and hearty thanks are due to Captain J. T. Murray and Mr. E. C. Moss,
                            who were responsible for its organisation.</p>
                        <p>Special trams left Customs Gate No. 14 at ten minutes past eleven and
                            connected with other special trams for Sidi Gaber, where the party
                            caught the 12-25 train, to which special coaches had been attached for
                            their accommodation. On arriving at Aboukir the party went direct to the
                            Nelson Hotel where an excellent luncheon was served, and after this was
                            over they made their way seawards and went out to Mr. G. B. Alderson's
                            "Noah's Ark," kindly lent for the occasion by Mr. S. R. Richmond. From
                            the ark the middies and their guests had a good afternoon's sport in the
                            water. Races were swum, an impromptu polo match was played, there were
                            some excellent diving exhibitions and fancy displays in the water, and
                            the middies enjoyed themselves thoroughly. At 4.55 p.m. the party
                            entrained for Ramleh and on reaching there walked to Schutz, at which
                            station they took tram to Bulkeley. At Bulkeley they were entertained to
                            tea at Colline Moss by Mrs. R. J. Moss, who had returned from the Nouzha
                            Garden party and, after spending an hour there they returned to
                            Alexandria, reaching the quay about 8 o'clock. Before leaving Bulkeley,
                            however, the middies gave a rousing three cheers for their hostess and
                            for the British Colony, the members of which have done so much to make
                            their visit to Alexandria as enjoyable as possible.</p>

                        <p>Yesterday afternoon from four to half past six o'clock the British colony
                            of Alexandria were "at home" to the Admirals, Captains, and Officers of
                            the British Fleet at the Nouzha Gardens. A considerable number of the
                            officers of the fleet were present, and of Alexandrian residents we
                            might mention, Boutros Pasha Ghali, Sir Eldon Gorst, Mustapha Pasha
                            Ibadi, Mohamed Bey Hafez, the Municipal Councillors, Mr. and Mrs. R.J.
                            Moss, Admiral Sir R. Massie Blomfield, Hopkinson Bey, Cobbe Bey, Dr. and
                            Mrs. Ruffer, Chataway Bey, Schiess Bey, Mr. Foster, C.M.G., Mohamed
                            Pasha Mohsen, Mr. and Mrs. Critchley, Baron J. de Menasce, Mr. Abdy, Mr.
                            and Mrs. H. B. Carver, Mr. and Mrs Kenneth Peel Birley, Mr. Paul Cavafy
                            and many others. The guests were received by Mr. and Mrs. R. J. Moss,
                            assisted by Admiral Sir R. Massie Blomfield, R.N., and all present spent
                            a most enjoyable afternoon. In connection with this "at home," however,
                            we would pass one criticism: — We consider that the Municipality might have
                            taken the trouble to water the road leading from the entrance to the new
                            lawn, where the reception was held, and thus avoided smothering onr
                            guests in dust.</p>

                            "Venerable,'4 "Irresistible," and "Prince of Wales" at 9 a.m. The

                        from a tour of Egypt, bearing with him a very ancient relic calculated to

                        B.C. The statue, probably one of the oldest in the world, will be presented

                    <head>"ODERE DU JOUR" VOTED.</head>
                    <p>Although at the forenoon meeting of the Cassa di Sconto a certain
                        manifestation of dissatisfaction not to say hostility was exhibited to the
                        board of directors, their proposals were carried by acclamation at the
                        subsequent meeting in the afternoon. The loan oT £300,000. which it is hoped
                        will be advanced by a syndicate of banks under the leadership of the
                        National Bank of Egypt, will according to the estimates of the Directors
                        enable the Cassa di Sconto to meet all its liabilities in full. It is
                        further hoped that a favourable liquidation may enable a satisfactory return
                        to the shareholders to be made. This prospect, which we hope will not prove
                        as illusive as the mirage, captivated the imagination of the shareholders.
                        Bearing in mind, however, the old adage anent the folly ot swapping horses
                        while crossing the stream we think the shareholders have exercised a wise
                        discretion in vesting full powers ifi the Board for the purpose of
                        liquidation, instead of indulging in heated and acriminons recriminations.
                        Whilst however agreeing that the bast has been done with a bad job we
                        entirely fail to understand on what grounds the Directors received such a
                        flattering demonstration.</p>
                    <p>The following is the report of the meeting</p>
                    <p>At 3.15 o'clock yesterday afternoon the shareholders of the Cassa di Sconto
                        began to assemble for the continuation of the meeting adjourned from the
                        morning. At 4 o'clock the hall of assembly was crammed and the proceedings
                        commenced punctually at that hour. The first step taken was the scrutiny of
                        the shares. For this purpose Mr. Victor Luzzato and Mr. R. Levi were
                        appointed and after forty minutes they were able to announce that the number
                        of shares represented largely surpassed the seventy five thousand necessary
                        to form a quorum. The Chairman of the Board of the Directors, the Advocate
                        Clemente Castro, then officially announced the result of the scrutiny, which
                        gave 95,075 shares represented among those present and deposited either at
                        the Cassa di Sconto or in the other banks of Alexandria and Cairo. The
                        Chairman then proceeded to read the following speech in Italian</p>
                    <p>Signori,</p>

                        di pregaivi a conservare durante la presente seduta la massima calma ed a
                        ricor- darvi la gravity e l'importanza delle deliberazioni che siete
                        chiamati a prendere in questo</p>
                    <p>memento.</p>
                    <p>Lo scopo cornu ne deve essere quello sol tan to di avvisare al miglior modo
                        possibile per sal- vare il nostro Istituto, che, come vi renderete conto dal
                        Rapporto del Consiglio, non meritava la sorte che cosi inattesamente lo ha
                        colpito. Chiunque comprende che qualsiasi recriminazione, qualsiasi
                        attacco, giusto od ingiusto, rivolto contro chicchessia, non potrebbe che
                        recare gravissimi danni all'Istituto, ed appor- tare delle corseguenze
                        gravissime, mentre tutti gli sforzi del Consiglio sc no stati e seguiteranno
                        ad essere, col vostro appoggio, diretti a scon- giurare ogni evento
                        disastroso.</p>
                    <p>Ed invero, se manterremo tutti, in questo frangente un contegno calmo e
                        dignitoso, se affronteremo serenamente la situazione attuale, avendo
                        solamentfc in vista di evitare un danno irreparabile, noi abbiamo la ferma
                        fiducia, coll'ainto delle Bancbe che sono pronte ad assisterci, di evitare
                        una liquidazione giudiziaria e di poter subito riprendere i pagamenti
                        procedendo quindi ad una liquidazione amiche- vole e graduale.</p>
                    <p>Sono sicuro que queste poche parole vi avranno persuasi della necessity di
                        limitare strettamente l'attuale discussione alle deli. berazioni formanti
                        oggetto dell'ordine del</p>

                    <p>Con questi in tendimenti, invito il Signor Amministratore-Delegato di dare
                        lettura all'As- semblea del Rapporto del Consiglio d'Amministrazione.</p>
                    <p>This speech received the plaudits of those present and then Mr. Vannucci, the
                        Managing Director, proceeded to read out the report of the directors, which
                        appeared in our issue of yesterday's date.</p>
                    <p>When this was finished the Chairman asked Mr. Vannucci to read the report of
                        the banking experts of the Anglo-Egyptian, Imperial Ottoman, Deutsche Orient
                        Banks and the Comptoir National d'Escompte de Paris, which we have already
                        published. After this document had been read out, the Chairman read the
                        "Ordre du Jour," which was as follows :—</p>
                    <p>"1. L'Assemble gendrale des actionnaires decide d'autoriser le Conseil a

                    <p> The Chairman then invited anybody present to ask questions, as he declared
                        that the members of the board of directors were perfectly willing to answer
                        questions. Maitre Lombardo then rose and proposed that the question of a
                        friendly liquidation shonld be pat to the vote, | but "sans déposer le
                        bilan." A shareholder | interposed and asked whether the negotiations | with
                        the National Bank of Egypt and the other | local financial establishments
                        had come to any | definite result. Mr. Metaxa answered he could </p>
                    <p> not give any undertaking in the subject, but | that he was in a position to
                        state that the negotiations were proceeding very smoothly and that he was
                        personally convinced that the | hoped for goal would soon be arrived at.
                        Other </p>
                    <p> shareholders then spoke. Maitre Fornario and | Maitre Martino, both of
                        Cairo, rose. The </p>
                    <p> former said that he would vote for the "Ordre du Jour," but he suggested
                        this should be done on the condition that the board of directors should not
                        be thereby free from responsibility in case that proceedings were necessary.
                        Maitre Martino made a declaration to the same effect. The Chairman rose and
                        I proposed that the meeting should vote on the | "Ordre du Jour" in the
                        terms such as had | been proposed by the board of directors. He proposed
                        that the vote should be taken by a show of hands. The vote was then taken
                        and the "Ordre du Jour" was adopted.. This seemed to please the meeting and
                        an ovation </p>
                    <p> ensued. Before the meeting broke up Mr. | Alfred Campos proposed a vote of
                        thanks to | the Union Bank of Vienna, the National </p>
                    <p> Bank of Egypt, and the other local banks, | who had come to the rescue of
                        the Cassa di Sconto. This proposal was carried by acclamation. </p>
                    <p> Mr. Schaar then proposed that the meeting should thank the board of
                        directors, for having come forward in order to extricate the Cassa from its
                        unfortunate plight This proposal was carried by acclamation and the meeting
                        then dispersed. </p>
                    <p> The board of directors afterwards held a private meeting to consider the
                        measures that should be now taken. </p>

                    <byline>(FROM "THE FINANCIER").</byline>
                    <p>Now that the first little shook of the failure of the Cassa is over there is
                        some chance of the investing public looking at the mutter with no near an
                        approach to philosophy as can lx* expected from the average husiness man.
                        Perhaps the first fact it may be useful to Ixmr ^in mind is that, as a
                        consequence of the extraordinary harvest of last year, someting like 6 j
                        millions of pounds English has been added to the monetary wealth of the
                        country. About H millions was sent into Egypt, for the purpose of buying and
                        handling the crops of last season, and not much more, it any more, than U
                        millions has been brought, out again. In these circumstances it seems, at
                        first sight, a little remarkable that there should be any financial trouble
                        serious enough to bring about the crisis which has just come to a head, but
                        to those who have followed the course of events the position is not
                        difficult, to understand.</p>
                    <p>In Egypt, as in other countries, the success of casual speculation, so far
                        from depending upon industrial prosperity, shows a strong tendency to
                        alternate with it. The trouble has come about not by reason of investing
                        capital a little too generously in legitimate undertakings, but through the
                        gambling in shares of all kinds of financial and exploiting companies, whose
                        objects, in many cases, have very slight connection with actual industrial
                        or material progress. In an article which appeared in The Financier some
                        months ago it was pointed out how tho value of agricultural land in Egypt
                        •tad risen out of all pro]>ortion to its worth, )«>oked at commercially.
                        That valuo has not at present sufibred any appreciable shrinkage, and it is
                        very unlikely that. it will do so for an indefinite period. But. laud in the
                        outskirts ot (cairo and other cities has decreased in value for the moment,
                        simply because it has been made the vehicle for speculation to an utterly
                        unwarranted extent..</p>
                    <p>The affairs of the Cassa di Scon to are, of course, not very well known in
                        this country as yet, but in all probability it will turn out that the bank
                        lias placed its money out at very high interest on the security of suburban
                        land com- jianies, or with undertakings of a more or less cognate character,
                        having little connection with agricultural exploitation or manufacturing
                        concerns.</p>
                    <p>It must not, however, be understood that land values in Cairo, for instance,
                        taking the city itself, are necessarily much inflated. The demand for hotel
                        accommodation, which is a fairly good criterion of how things are going in a
                        rapidly developing city, is better than ever. As has been pointed out, the
                        fellah—no longer the poor fellah, but usually the rich fellah— comes to
                        Cairo from time to time, and is by no means content to put up with the
                        hugger- muggering accommodation provided for him in the last century.
                        Frequently he goes to quite an expensive hotel, particularly if he has
                        handsome daughters, and takes great delight iu making the acquaintance of
                        Europeans. His IlimberK are increasing, and he is slowly beginning to
                        realise that in these days it is quite possible to find a more satisfactory
                        and quite as safe a place for his hoard as the foundations of his house or
                        the soil of his garden; but still he remains with the ineradicable lust of
                        land, and the greater part of his surplus will be invested in land—if his
                        neighbours'so much the better—quite irrespective of what he can get out of
                        it in the way of commercial return.</p>
                    <p>From two or three points of view the situation in Egypt somewhat resembles
                        that which * oapie about in Australia at the time when the banks,
                        panic-stricken by drought, were frantically foreclosing on the farmers'
                        assets, regardless of the fact that they themselves were responsible, to a
                        large extent, for the farmers' difficulties. But in Egypt the difficulties
                        are not with the farmer, nor with the banks which have confined themselves
                        to financing anything so solid as agricultural development. The difficulties
                        are with the people who have lent money at 15, 20 and 25 per cent, on
                        securities which they must have known from the first were of a highly
                        speculative character. So long as the boom lasted they were eager to lend
                        more money, and now that a considerable assortment of bubbles has been
                        pricked there seems a disposition to scramble for the assets, quite
                        regardless of their own share in the crisis, or of the future that has been
                        discounted a little too soon, and a little to# heavily. It is not impossible
                        that the stoppage of the Cassa di Sconto may be followed by that of one or
                        two other houses who have been doing more or less similar business.</p>
                    <p>Yet, nothing would be easier than to exaggerate the significance of these
                        failures—if failures they can be called. The whole affair is one that
                        concerns speculators and the Bourse, but does not concern, to any
                        appreciable extent, the sound banking business of Egypt, or the merchant*
                        who are really merchants, nor the shares in soores of Egyptian undertakings
                        which have devoted capital to material improvements and manufactures of one
                        sort or another. The trouble is at the surface, and does not affect the real
                        commercial life of the country. It may well be that the crisis is rather a
                        blessing than otherwise. It will draw particular attention to the actual
                        state of affairs, and will be a note of warning to a certain somewhat
                        numerous section of financial operators, that they seem to have badly
                        wanted. Otherwise the outlook in Egypt is a* pood a* it can be. The reports
                        of crops are quite satisfactory, and there is not much doubt that,
                        notwithstanding the dimensions of the lest harvest, the next one will
                        surpass it. Meantime shareholders in Egyptian undertakings which have got
                        any backbone in them need not be in the smallest degree perturbed at the
                        happenings of the last few weeks.</p>

                    <p>The gross receipts for 1906 exceeded those of 1905 by L E. 4377.</p>
                    <p>These figures, however, do not accurately represent the results obtained in
                        the year under leview.</p>
                    <p>It should be pointed out that in the figure of L.E. 78,352 receipts for local
                        traffic in 1905 was included a sum of L.E. 9,230 representing the arrears
                        due by the Ottoman Administration, with which this Department was credited
                        in that year. The actual amount earned in 1905 on local traffic was
                        therefore L.E. 69,122 and the increase under this head in 1906 is therefore
                        L.E. 12,247.</p>
                    <p>It will be observed that there is a falling off in the receipts of
                        interchanged (i.e. traffic exchanged with foreign administrations) of L.E.
                        4,892. This decrease is to be accounted for by the reduction in the terminal
                        and transit rates from 25 centimes to 15 centimes per word which came into
                        force on the 1st August 1905, as the result of the new agreement with the
                        Eastern Telegraph Company. Underthe same agreement the subvention is reduced
                        by L.E. 2,844. On the other hand, under the heading of "Railway Telegrams"
                        we have a new item of receipts of L.E. 7.213. This represents the amount
                        paid by the Railways for the Railway Telegrams done by the employees of the
                        Telegraph Department. The amount is calculated on a basis mutually agreed
                        upon from time to time between the two Departments.</p>
                    <p>The expenditure for the year. was L.E 91,714 as against L.E. 74,708 in
                        1905.</p>
                    <p>Of the excess ofL.E. 17,006, L.E. 8,000 was devoted to increases of salary to
                        the staff.</p>
                    <p>Turning to the number of commercial messages dealt with, the figures show an
                        increase of about 304,000 messages, or 15*3% over those of 1905.</p>
                    <p>It has not yet been found possible to alleviate to any extent the arduous
                        duties imposed upon the staff by the ever increasing traffic. The staff of
                        the Department is still considerably below the strength requisite for
                        dealing efficiently with the traffic, and it is therefore impossible' at
                        present to give shorter hours ot duty or to arrange for reliefs in order to
                        give a weekly holiday. It is hoped however that in the course of the present
                        year we shall obtain a sufficient number of new telegraphists from the
                        schools to enable us to make a beginning in this direction. The Telegraph
                        Section in the Arts aud Metiers School is full and a building has been
                        rented temporarily in which to accommodate the overflow and there are dow
                        about 30 boys there.</p>
                    <p>In the meantime the Railway Administration is building a school of its own in
                        which it is intended to give instruction to the Telegraph pupils belonging
                        to the Traffic Department as well as those belonging to the Telegraph
                        Department.</p>
                    <p>The average number of complaints received from the Public of delay to
                        messages is two per ten thousand.</p>
                    <p>The average delay on all traffic between the time of the handing in of a
                        message and its receipt at the telegraph office of destination is fourteen
                        aud a half minutes.</p>
                    <p>The number of "urgent" telegrams this year shows an increase of 20,000, or 40
                        % over those of 1905. This is probably due to the inadequacy of the
                        telephone communication between the Cairo and Alexandria Bourses. When
                        telephone communication is not imme^ diately obtainable the brokers prefer
                        to send urgent telegrams to waiting for their turn at the telephone. It is
                        hoped that in the course of this year this will be remedied by the
                        construction of two new circuits.</p>
                    <p>In the meantime the existing trunk lines have earned over L.E. 1000 more than
                        last year,</p>
                    <p>Two new circuits between Alexandria and Cairo have been built this year and
                        were handed over to the Telephone Company in November, at the same rental as
                        the two circuits already leased to the Company. Telephone communication was
                        also established between Tanta and Cairo aud was handed over on the 1st of
                        June to the Company to work on the basis of half profits, and the result may
                        be considered as satisfactory.</p>
                    <p>The total length of telephone line is now kilom. 3094.555 metres.</p>
                    <p>Five findred kilometres of new telegraph wire have been erected, besides a
                        new line from Suez to Nakhl (Sinai) which has since been, handed over to the
                        War Office.</p>
                    <p>Eight new offices have been opened;—at Agricultural Bank, Cairo; Citadel,
                        Cairo; Katta; Kom-el-Wahal; Mualla; Mit-el-Absi Sahali and Sirrag, and three
                        offices at /1 Sir, Guiza station ami Mallaha, have closed.</p>
                    <p>Quadruplex working has been introduced on one of the Cairo-Alexandria
                        circuits and has proved of great assistance in keeping down delays during
                        the busiest hours of the day. It is intended to extend this system to other
                        circuits as soon as the necessary apparatus is received.</p>

                    <p>The Society for the Relief of Persecuted Jews, 41, Parliament St. S. W., is
                        appealing for assistance for poor Jews in Syria. They state that 5000 Jewish
                        refugees are estimated to have entered Palestine at Jaffa in the last 12
                        months. There is very great distress among them, and the Jews generally,
                        which is aggravated by scarcity of water owing to scanty rainfall. The
                        misery of aged and children, sick and feeble, in the heat of the Syrian
                        summer, who have no money for buying water, can only be understood by those
                        who have seen it.</p>

                    <head>A BROKEN-DOWN SYSTEM.</head>
                    <p>This is a condition (or disease) to which doctors give many names, but which
                        few of them really understand. It it simply weakness—a break-down, as it
                        were, of the vital forces that sustain the system. No matter what may be its
                        causes (for they are almost numberless), its symptoms are much the same; the
                        more prominent being sleeplessness, sense of prostration or weariness,
                        depression of spirits and want of energy for all the ordinary affairs of
                        life. Now, what alone is absolutely essential in all such cases is increased
                        vitality—vigour--</p>
                    <p>VITAL STRENGTH &amp; ENERGY</p>
                    <p>to throw off these morbid feelings, and experience proves that as night
                        succeeds the day this may be more certainly secured by a course of the
                        celebrated life-reviving tonic</p>
                    <p>THERAPION No.3</p>
                    <p>than by any other known combination. So surely as it is taken in accordance
                        with the printed directions accompanying it, will the shattered health be
                        restored,</p>
                    <p>THE EXPIRING LAMP OF LIFE LIGHTED UP AFRESH,</p>
                    <p>and a new existence imparted in place of what had so lately seemed worn-out,
                        "used up," and valueless. This wonderful medicament is purely vegetable and
                        innocuous, is agreeable to the taste —suitable for all constitutions and
                        conditions, in either sex; and it is difficult to imagine a case of disease
                        or derangement, whose main features are those of debility, that will not be
                        speedily and permanently benefited by this never-failing recuperative
                        essence, which is destined to cast into oblivion everything that had
                        preceded it for this wide-spread and numerous class of human ailments.</p>
                    <p>THERAPION</p>
