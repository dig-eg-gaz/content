                <p>Icilma Fluor Cream is the only cream that contains no grease nor oil. Deliciously
                    scented it cleanses the pores of the skin as nothing else can do, makes it
                    pearly white, gives life to the tissues, elasticity to the muscles, and a
                    deliciously cool feeling to the skin.</p>
                <p>Its unique properties are due to Icilma Natural Water so that it may well be
                    called <hi>Nature’s Skin Food </hi> and the skin requires nothing else to give
                    it the necessary vitality, to preserve it from sunburn, heat, cold or the
                    effects of hard water, to prevent and cure the minor irritations due to
                    overheated blood, and to preserve the youthful fresh look to which hot climates
                    are so fatal.</p>
