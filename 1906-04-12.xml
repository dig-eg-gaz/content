                    <p>Icilma Fluor Cream is the only cream that contains no grease nor oil.

                    <p>Its unique properties are due to Icilma Natural Water so that it may well be
                        called <hi>Nature's Skin Food </hi> and the skin requires nothing else to
                        give it the necessary vitality, to preserve it from sunburn, heat, cold or

                        directors would have had ample justification had they main- tained the
                        higher rate, in view of the state of the French exchange cheque on Paris
                        being then very weak at 25.12. In addition to this, all the available gold
                        in the market was being bought on French account, sovereigns were being
                        taken from the Bank for shipment to South America, and the reserve showed a
                        reduction of two millions:</p>
                    <p>The fact that the 4% rate was no longer effective no doubt brought its
                        downfall, aided by the disbursement of Government fands, in. the shape of

                        hardened in the afternoon to 8% and the India Council renewed loans for a
                        month at 23% To-day. loans for the week command 23%, and the discount rate
                        stands at 3% for two and three months bills, with a stiffening tendency.</p>
                    <p>The Bank return, in addition to the reduc tion in the reserve mentioned
                        above, shows decline of 23,672,000 in Public Deposits. This release of
                        Government funds apparently enabled the market to repay its indebtedness to
                        the Bank, se evidenced by a reduction of £3,200,000 in Other Securities."
                        The "Other 00,000 Deposita", are only £869,000 lower, and the proportion is
                        a shade higher at 451%.</p>
                    <p>This is anything but a strong return for this. time of the year, and with the
                        French obeque to-day at 25.11, and call money at 19% in New York, the
                        outlook is not all that could be desired.</p>
                    <p>The Stock Markets,</p>
                    <p>Notwithstanding the réduction in the Bank rate the stock markets have not
                        responded with increased activity. In fact, yesterday was one of the dullest
                        days ever experienced. The truth of it is that very large issues are
                        impending. Not only Rossis, but. Germany also is under stood to be on the
                        point of issuing a big loan. With regard to the Russian loan, it is said
                        that the dealing in this has already began in Paris, and that the bonds are
                        likely to be issued at a very favourable price, and to go off without
                        difficulty. The issue price is spoken of as 89, and this will of course
                        prove very tempting. In addition to these, there have been placed in London
                        very large amounts of American railway bonds. Such transactions have been
                        very unusual of late years, and these are no doubt the result of the
                        bareness of money in the American markets, These new investments are more
                        attractive than many of those which show an excellent security and a good
                        rate of interest, but which have already had their flatter, and are mostly
                        in the hands of disap Pointed underwriters:</p>

                    <p>The settlement in Console commenced on Tuesday, and the making up price shows
                        a further advance on the previous account of thus making an increase for the
                        two months of. The gilt-edged market has moderately appreciated the better
                        conditions now ruling, and Console closed last night at 90 for cash, after
                        being higher. The closing quotation to-day is 90. DA</p>

                    <p>The demand for Japanese stocks referred to in our last letter continued in
                        the early part of this week, bat this has now apparently been satisfied for
                        the present, and interest in the bonds disappeared. Japanese Foura leave off

                        affected by the rumours respecting the new loan, and have lost the good
                        position they had maintained for over a fortnight. The price of the Four per
                        cent is now 83, with little demand for them.</p>
                    <p>Home Ralls,</p>
                    <p>On the subject of home railways there is little to say. The market is
                        lifeless, chiefly Owing to the rumour that the Government. intend
                        establishing an eight-hour day for rail- way employés, a step which would
                        hopelessly cripple the dividenda of many companies. Whilst it is not at all
                        likely that, this will happen, the bare possibility frightens intending.

                    <p>(FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT)</p>
                    <p>London, April 2. The Secretary for War states that the Army Estimates for the
                        financial year on which we have just started bears charges to the amount of
                        £280,000 for the troopa in Egypt and the Sudan. Since 1897, the amount
                        incurred under the Military Works Loans Act is £166,000 in Egypt.</p>
                    <p>The wildly absurd story is going the rounds that Sir Hector Macdonald is not
                        only alive, but was very mach so during the late Russo- Japanese War, and he
                        is credited with being no other than the invincible Kuroki. The story goes
                        that when Sir Hector came home on the journey which was to be his last, he
                        had been asked by the Jap authorities to join their army. Lord Roberts
                        refused bis</p>
                    <p>notion and Sir Hector went away, and pre- tended to commit suicide, and
                        re-appeared as General Kuroki. It may be recalled that Sir Hector's body was
                        never seen by any one who knew him in life, and that Kuroki-never got a
                        public reception after his great victories and that his death has been
                        reported at various times, although he has shown the knack of torning up in
                        action when he was. wanted. Whoever eet this extraordinary yarn. in
                        circulation séema to have forgotten how simple it would have been for the
                        great but unfortunate Sir Heator to have resigned his commission and have
                        joined any army he pleased. Sir Hector was the last man to disappear under
                        the shadow of a shameful charge.</p>
                    <p>With reference to a resolution passed by the Council of the British Empire
                        League urging the Admiralty to place no unnecessary limit on the numbers to
                        be enrolled in the Colonial nával reserves, either in Newfoundland or
                        Australis, and to afford adequate provision in all cases for their service
                        at sea with a warship, Lord Tweedmouth has addressed a letter to the
                        secretary of the League calling attention to the statement explanatory of
                        the Naval Estimates for 1906 7. From that it would be seen, that as far as
                        the numbers were concerned no change of policy has taken place. The letter
                        proceeds: "The original agreement was that this country should only pay for
                        a limited number of Colo nial Royal reservists, and it would be clearly
                        impossible when the seamen of the Royal Naval Reserve at home are being
                        reduced to go beyond the stipulated number. With refe rence to service in
                        men of war, advocated by Lord Goscher, I may point out that a certain number
                        of Newfoundland reserve men are serving in Commodore Paget's squadron which
                        will arrive in this country early in April."</p>
