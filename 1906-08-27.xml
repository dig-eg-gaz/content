                    <head>BRITAIN'S FALLING BIRTH RATE</head>
                    <p>The continuous decline in the British birthrate is the most disquieting
                        sociological symptom of the present day, for the successive reports of the
                        Registrar-General mark the stages of a process as unbroken as it is
                        mysterious. The latest of these reports, dealing with the months April, May,
                        and June just past, is no exception to the general rule. It announces a
                        birthrate of 27.5 per thousand persons living, the lowest ever recorded for
                        the second quarter of the year. It is easy to mistake the urgency of the
                        problem thus presented. It has to be remembered that to some extent the
                        effects of the decreasing birth-rate are counteracted by a decreasing
                        death-rate. And it is practically beyond dispute that the amount of this
                        counteraction could be very much increased if the nation made up its mind to
                        prevent the preventable infant mortality which is responsible for so large a
                        proportion of the deaths recorded. But whatever allowance be made for these
                        considerations no allowance can destroy the profound significance of the
                        declining birth-rate. Thirty years ago over thirty-six persons were born and
                        nearly twenty-one died annually for every thousand persons living; the
                        difference of the two rates or the net increase of the population was
                        15.4.Two years ago the corresponding figures for birth and death were 27.9
                        and 16.2. The net increase of the population was thus 11.7 per thousand. In
                        other words, the nation was in 1904 adding to its numbers at only
                        three-quarters of the rate at which it had been doing so in 1876.
                        This,however, gives only the results of a continuous process taken at two
                        special points. It fails to convey in any way the myste-terious character of
                        the process itself, as astonishing in its sudden beginning in year 1877 as
                        in its almost unbroken continuity. The slow upward movement of the
                        birth-rate before 1877 had been marked by violent fluctuations almost wholly
                        absent from the swifter movement of decline since that year. It is not easy
                        to avoid a feeling of helplessness in the face of this phenomenon. No one
                        can be certain what is going to happen; it is not easy to have or at least
                        to defend any positive opinion as to what ought to happen. Is there any
                        chance of the decline in the birth-rate being checked in the near future,
                        and giving place to a fresh upward movement? Will it on the other hand
                        continue, as its present course suggests, till, spite of all diminution of
                        the death-rate, the population in the United Kingdom reaches the stationary
                        stage familiar in France? If the decline reaches that point, will it stop
                        there? Is there, in fact, anything to guarantee the nation against an actual
                        decrease of numbers ? No one can really answer any one of these questions
                        definitely. Nor, except as to the last possibility, which clearly indicates
                        national decay,can any one really say what would be the most desirable
                        conclusion. For the present, no doubt, there is abundant room for more
                        people in Great Britain, or room could and will be made by further
                        industrial development. For the present there is, and no doubt will be for
                        some time to come, not simply room for more people in the British Empire
                        outside Great Britain, but a vigorous demand for every efficient settler
                        that can be spared. Most Colonial birth-rates are declining as rapidly or
                        more rapidly than those of the Mother Country. In the comparatively near
                        future we may perhaps fairly expect a continuous increase of population,
                        though at a falling rate, and, having the waste spaces of the earth in mind,
                        we may desire a yet more rapid increase. But for a future more distant than
                        fifty to hundred years prophecy of what will happen is impossible;
                        aspiration for what should happen must depend upon the course of the
                        birth-rate in other nations and upon the progress of man's control over
                        nature. </p>

                    <p>SATURDAY'S CEREMONY</p>
                    <p>On Saturday the native population of Cairo was on holiday to celebrate the
                        ancient ceremony of the "cutting of the Khalig." All the Ministries and
                        public offices were closed for the occasion, and native trade was more or
                        less at a standstill.</p>
                    <p>With the filling up of the Khalig and its conversion into a tramway road the
                        ceremony was shorn of most of its former glory, and nowadays it has but a
                        faint remblance to the festival which used to be held.</p>
                    <p>Early in the afternoon the Nile became crowded with craft of various sizes,
                        which collected in the vicinity of Kasr-el-Nil Bridge, and shortly after
                        three o'clock the gaily decorated Akaba passed, firing a salute of
                        twenty-one guns, with the cavalry band of the Egyptian Army on board. All
                        these vessels made their way towards the "fonm" of the nonexistent Khalig,
                        and for many hours they made short excursions to and fro with delighted and
                        noisy burdens of humanity.</p>
                    <p>It was not until nine o'clock, however, that the reception was held by H.E.
                        Mahmoud Pasha Sidky, representing his Highness the Khedive, and at that hour
                        the scene was very animated and did not lack picturesqueness. Several large
                        marquees had been erected on both sides of the old Foum el Khalig, and
                        these, brilliantly illuminated, were crowded with natives, among whom
                        mingled officers of the Egyptian Army and the Army of Occupation, English
                        Government officials and many civilians.</p>
                    <p>The river presented a very pretty scene with the numerous boats passing op
                        and down, lanterns with glasses of various hues hanging from the riggings
                        and decks of the larger dahabiehs. About half-past Dine the firework display
                        commenced and for some time one was deafened by the banging of squibs and
                        similar pieces, mixed with the hissing of rockets and catherine wheels. The
                        fireworks included many "set pieces" of different designs, and though one
                        was at times rather fearful of the rocket sticks—for the rockets were fired
                        off with an absolute disregard of direction,—the sight was excellent and
                        enjoyable.</p>
                    <p>Shortly before ten o'clock the Governor of Cairo left the scene, accompanied
                        by a mounted bodyguard and was again saluted by the fitting of 19 guns. Most
                        of those who had been invited to the reception left immediately after the
                        departure of Mahmoud Pasha Sidky, though the fireworks continued for some
                        time, and as we drove away we were almost choked by the sulphurous
                        fumes.</p>

                        Ibrahim was taken to the Bernay Hospital, where the doctors decided that a
                        trepanning operation should take place when the Prince had rallied a little.
                        The departmental legal officials held an inquiry at Bernay after the
                        accident, and have attributed it to the excessive speed at which the
                        motor-car was driven.</p>
                    <p>Prince Mohamed-Ibrahim was staying at Deauville, and on Friday, after having
                        played in a polo match, he went for the fateful drive. The Prince lived in
                        the Rue de la Faisauderie, near the Bois de Boulogne, in a house formerly
                        occupied by a military attache of the British Embassy. He gave orders six
                        months ago for the construction of a splendid house in the Avenue Kleber,
                        near that of his father-in-law, Prince Ibrahim Hilmi. This place is expected
                        to be ready for occupation towards the end of the present year. The Prince
                        was fond of all sorts of sport, and for some time past had taken up motoring
                        with great assiduity, frequently going on long excursions with the Princess
                        all over the Continent He left, with his family, for Deauville on August 1,
                        having hired there the Villa Coutant and the fine grounds attached.</p>
                    <p>Soon after the Prince was settled at the villa, his chauffeur, D'Arangeon,
                        went down there with a newly-purchased 60 horse power motor-car. D'Arangeon
                        had been in the Prince's employ for nearly two years, and had gone over
                        Italy, Austria, Hungary, and Germany without a hitch. He was a careful
                        driver, and his colleagues in Paris say that he is possibly a victim to
                        obedience, as he had to leave his master to drive, and most of the accidents
                        occur in that way. The chauffeur, it is said, was constantly told by the
                        Princess not to allow her husband to drive, as the Prince lost his coolness
                        when in charge.</p>
                    <p>The Princess—who,with her children, was at Deauville—delayed dinner on Friday
                        night owing to her husband's absence. Later on, fearing the worst, she had
                        the adjoining country searched throughout the night She only heard the fatal
                        news on Saturday afternoon from Paris. The explanation of this is that when
                        the Prince was conveyed to the Bernay Hospital unconscious, no papers giving
                        his Deauville address were found on him. The Paris address, Rue de la
                        Faisanderie, was, however, discovered on a letter, and a telegram announcing
                        the accident was sent there from the hospital.</p>
                    <p>Another account says:--</p>
                    <p>The original accounts of this most terrible of autocar accidents were sadly
                        lacking in some essential details. It is now known that the mishap occurred
                        shortly after seven o'clock on Friday evening. The chauffeur was driving at
                        a rapid rate, and hoped to shoot over the level crossing between Bernay and
                        Cormeilles before the arrival of a train. He saw the train, but went on and
                        the autocar, caught by the engine, was smashed up. The people in the train
                        shrieked with terror as they beheld the collision and saw the two men in the
                        motor car projected along the railway. The train was stopped, and the driver
                        and the stoker got off the engine and went to assist the sufferers.
                        D'Arangeon, the Prince's chauffeur, was delirious. His chest was smashed and
                        his legs and arms broken. The Prince, unconscious, had a fractured skull,
                        and his ribs and left arm were broken. Some of the passengers in the train,
                        which was standing on the line, left their carriages and ran on to
                        Thiberville for doctors and stretchers for the injured men. The chauffeur
                        was carried to a farmhouse, where he was attended to, but he died within an
                        honr. The Prince was conveyed to the Bernay Hospital, where he underwent
                        trepanning, but passed away after it. He had not only been injured in the
                        head, but in the lower part of the body, and his condition from the first
                        was hopeless.</p>

                    <head>EGYPT'S TRADE. GERMAN COMPETITION.</head>
                    <p>The article in the Journal of the British Chamber of Commerce of Egypt re
                        German trade here has aroused great interest in England. Commenting on the
                        article in question, "Commercial Intelligence" of last week mentions a
                        rumour that the shipping companies trading between the Continent and the
                        Mediterranean and Black Sea ports have also arrived at a "mutual
                        understanding," but this point requires confirmation. Supplementing the
                        Board of Trade's extracts, "Commercial Intelligence" adds, on the subject of
                        direct dealing, that the Englishman argues—and with some show of reason—that
                        it is better to sell to a well known home merchant than to run the risk of
                        making had debts through an agent in Egypt. This handicaps the British goods
                        by their having to pay an intermediate profit before being placed on the
                        Egyptian market. The German saves this profit, and though he may make
                        certain bad debts, he trusts to recoup himself by means of a larger
                        turnover. In reference to trade credits, the aim of the German is to get
                        into the country, but the result of the lavish credit is that German
                        failures are largely on the increase.</p>

                        <p>To the Editor of the "EGyptian Gazette." Dear Sir,—The published account
                            of the general meeting of the Egyptian Delta Land &amp; Investment Co.,
                            Ltd., must afford us food for somewhat painful reflection, and, though
                            it is useless to cry over spilt milk, it may be useful to point out what
                            we have lost when enquiring what we are to get in lien thereof.</p>
                        <p>At the moment of writing I have before me the following reply to an
                            enquiry made this morning. It speaks for itself:</p>
                        <p>"Deltas are quoted <unclear>3(1/2)-(3/4)</unclear> there are no sellers.
                            Trusts quoted 1/16 discount to par <hi rend="italics">with no business
                                in them.</hi>"</p>
                        <p>From the speech of the chairman of the Delta Land Co. it is evident that
                            we should not have received the dividend of one shilling a share which
                            the proposed amalgamation agreement provided for if any dividend were
                            paid to the Delta shareholders, but we should have been the better off
                            without it for we should have ranked equally with them in the
                            distribution of accrued profits, and as they have made over £50,000 in
                            the first three months of the year, it looks as if we should have shared
                            in a handsome dividend at the end of the current year or perhaps sooner.
                            We were deprived of the advantages of amalgamation, in my opinion,
                            without sufficient cause and by the decision of a small meeting in
                            London, and the question now is, What is going to be done for us by way
                            of compensation ?</p>
                        <p>In a recent issue of your paper, M.M. de Vries and Boutigny stated in
                            their circular that the amalgamation having .fallen through, rumour said
                            that either our capital was to be reduced or the company to be wound up.
                            I have farther received a circular from our head office that a meeting
                            will shortly be called to consider the accounts to the 80th June last
                            and proposals for the future.</p>
                        <p>What our accounts should show is that we owe to the bank a sum of
                                <unclear>£55,000</unclear>, unless they be closed at a date previous
                            to this debt having been incurred and, with this hanging over our heads,
                            it is useless to consider reduction of capital. Any such reduction,
                            however, would merely free us from our fear of being called upon for
                            more money and it would in no way improve our prospects in regard to
                            what we have already paid.</p>
                        <p>The only thing left to us is to liquidate. Our properties are good enough
                            and quite possibly we might at once get back our money, but, if we
                            continue simply watching them at a cost of some £3,000 a year, with the
                            chance of a reaction in values coming upon us, we may find ourselves in
                            for a very different kind of settlement I have had no previous
                            experience of a company where direction has been so variable and
                            management so wanting, and to this only can I attribute the fact that
                            our present position is what it is. It is high time for shareholders to
                            take action and there is no time to lose. The best thing is to liquidate
                            and to place the matter in independent and strong hands. The
                            alternatives are to effect a complete change or to see whether the Delta

                    <head>THE DATE PALM SCALE.</head>
                    <p>A new and very interesting species, the first African representative of the
                        genus Sphaero coccus, has been discovered by Mr. Walter Draper, F.L.S., who
                        for the last ten years has been in charge of the Government Gardens, Delta
                        Barrage, near Cairo. This new species of scale insect, which is extremely
                        common on date palms in Egypt, occurs in the form of white patches on the
                        base of the leaf-stalks immediately below the head of the palm. It has
                        received the name Sphaerococcus Draperi, Newstead.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Robert Newstead, the expert on Coccidae at the Liverpool University, to
                        whom specimens were sent for identification, states that "the female of the
                        new species is distinguished chiefly by the minute rudimentary antennea the
                        entire absence of legs, and the character of the waxlike covering. The larva
                        is also characterized by the antenna which has the first segment unusually
                        broad. There are also other minute differences."</p>
                    <p>The diagnostic characters of the genus are: Adult females, naked or producing
                        cotton or wax ; anal tubercles absent ; anal orifice without hairs; antennae
                        usually of less than seven joints, but sometimes atrophied ; legs present,
                        atrophied or deformed.</p>
                    <p>Eighteen species are recorded from Australia, nearly all of which inhabit
                        galls on various species of eucalyptus, etc. ; two are described from the
                        United States of America, one from Japan, and the newly-discovered one in
                        Egypt, which has been dedicated to the discoverer, makes a total of
                        twenty-one species.</p>
                    <p>We understand that Mr. Draper, who has had some considerable experience with
                        scale and other insect peats in Egypt, is about to publish a small work on
                        Egyptian coccids. </p>

                        classical scholar in 1888. From Cambridge, where he obtained a First Class
                        in the Classical Tripos, he went as assistant-master to Bedford Grammar
                        School. There he remained till 1903, when he was appointed headmaster of

                        Experience of the kind such as Mr. Furness has enjoyed should be found most
                        useful to him in his new position, and we consider the Ministry of Education

                    <p>AU DIRECTEUR DU TEMPS. </p>
                    <p>Coup sur coup les exécutions de Denchawai les déclarations de sir Edward
                        Grey, le Livre blanc, enfin l'appel véhément du chef nationa liste Mastapha
                        Kamel viennent de révélerà l'Europe étonnée que si l'Angleterre a donné la
                        prospérité matérielle à l'Egypte, elle n'a pas obtenu sa reconaissance en
                        retour. L'Egyptien, quel que soit son rang social, déteste (il n'y a pas
                        d'autre mot, les personnes qui comme moi habitent le pays le savent)
                        l'occupation anglaise. Et lord Cromer était parfaitement fondé à dire, à
                        propos de la récente affaire de Tabah, que si des troupes turques avaient
                        paru sut le canal de Suez, un soulèvement général aurait eu lieu eu
                        Egypte.</p>
                    <p>Quelles sont les causes de cette désaffection, à première vue paradoxale ? </p>
                    <p>Les procédés employés par les Anglais y sont assurément pour quelque chose.
                        Leur personnel, formé aux habitudes de l'Inde, est trop hautain à l'égard
                        des indigènes ; ils n'ont pas suffisamment répondu aux aspirations d'une
                        élite très désireuse de s'instrnire à l'européenne; lord Cromer, homme
                        supérieur, n'a peut-être pas attaché autant d'importance qu'il eût fallu à
                        s'entourer de collaborateurs de mérite ; enfin certains services ont donné
                        prise à des reproches de vénalité auxquels lord Cromer lui même n'a pas
                        craint de consacrer un chapitre dans son rapport de 1904. Mais ces griefs
                        n'auraient pas suffi à eux seuls à faire oublier que le régime anglais a
                        fait disparaitre l'arbitraire affreusement fantasque et tyrannique
                        d'autrefois, établi la sécurité des personnes et des biens et porté la
                        population à an degré de bien-être qu'elle n'avait jamais connu. Le commerce
                        de l'Egypte s'est é evé de 23,371.000 livres égyptiennes en 1896 à
                        41.924.000 en 1905. Aujourd'hui, le fellah mange à sa faim et dote ses.
                        filles ; l'Etat ne lui conteste plus la propriété ni de son champ ni de son
                        âne. Et pourtant, le fellah déteste l'occupation anglaise.</p>
                    <p>Ce qui a effacé dans son esprit l'effet de ces bienfaits, cependant si
                        évidents, c'est ce facteur nouveau, très récemment apparu, et que sir Edward
                        Grey et lord Cromer ont appelé le panislamisme.</p>
                    <p>Que-fuat-il entendre par ce mot? L'expérience noos a appris la défiance du
                        préfixe <hi rend="italics">pan</hi> coolé à des désinences en <hi
                            rend="italics">isme</hi>: nous avons déjà pu apprécier les beautés du
                        panslavisme et celles du pangermanisme. De quelque façon qu'on les traduise,
                        ils éveillent une idée de monopole et de domination. Signifient ils "tout
                        aux Germains, tout aux Slaves" on simplement "groupement, réunion de tout ce
                        qui est slave, de tout ce qui est germain ? " De même panisla misme doit-il
                        être, entendu "tout aux sectateurs de l'islam," ou "groupement de tout ce
                        qui est islamique?"</p>
                    <p>Pour lord Cromer et sir Edward Grey, il n'y a point de doute possible :
                        panislamisme éveille une idée de domination universelle par le groupement de
                        tous les peuples de l'islam, donc un danger également universel pour tous
                        les peuples non musulmans. Mastafa pacha Kamel, le chef de la Jeune-Egypte,
                        se borne à nous donner l'assurance que "panislamisme no signifie point
                        fanatisme." Dans son claironnant "Appel à la nation anglaise et au monde
                        civilisé," il déclare: "La sympathie que nons avons pour les autres peuples
                        musulmans est bien légitime et n'a rien de fanatique.
                            <unclear>Il.a'y</unclear> a pas un seal musulman éclairé qui puisse
                        croire une minute que les peuples de l'islam peuve t se liguer contre
                        l'Europe. Ceux qui parlent d'un pareil esprit sont ignorants oa désireux de
                        creuser un fossé entre le monde européen et les musulmans."</p>
                    <p>Cela est fort bien dit, mais que conclure? En particulier convient-il de
                        prononcer le mot fanatisme en parlant des musalmans d'Egypte? Mustafa Kamel
                        va nous renseigner encore : "Au nom de ce qu'il y a de plus sacré sur la
                        terre, j'affirme que le fanatisme religieux n'existe pas en Egypte." Voilà
                        qui parait positif, surtout à qui ne connaît point Mustafa pacha Kamel. Par
                        malheur, il y a longtemps qu'en Egypte il ne se tronve plus un seul membre
                        des colonies européennes pour croire sur parole Mustafa pacha Kamel. Tant
                        qu'il se borna à défendre "l'Egypte aux Egyptiens par l'instruction et la
                        lumière da progrès", le jeune fellah ne rencontra que sympathies et
                        encouragements. D'où vient qu'aujourd'hui tous ses amis européens l'ont
                        abandonné, comme ce fat le cas cette année pour le ' Journal du Caire" et la
                        ' Réforme" d'Alexandrie, les deux organes les plus importants de la presse
                        européenne d'E gypte? C'est que cessant de se contenter de formules à
                        exécution lointaine, Mustafa pacha Kamel mettait tout son patriotisme au
                        service de la Turquie dont il appelait les troupes pour occuper le pays et
                        le gouverner au nom du sultan. L'Egypte, vilayet turc, tel est le rêve enfin
                        avoué du jeune patriote égyptien. Le malheur veut, ainsi que le faisait
                        pittoresquement remarquer un journaliste français de Caire, qu'il y ait en
                        Mustafa pacha Kamel deux Egyptiens bien différents: le premier porte

                            <p>Hundreds of thousands of roubles are stolen daily from trains and
                                banks and factories throughout Russia. The mail bag from Erivan
                                reached the Capital yesterday with the seals uncut, but the hag was
                                filled with packets of lead, 150,000 roubles having been
                                abstracted.</p>
                            <p>27 persons were arrested yesterday at the powder factory of
                                Schlusselburg, which is at present working at the highest pressure.
                                Enormous quantities of munitions are going to Poland and the

                                (Later). The bomb was thrown in M. Stolypin's ante-chamber by a man
                                dressed as an officer. All persons in the room, including several
                                prominent officials, were killed. The villa is practically wrecked.
                                The casualties amount to about 40.</p>
                            <p>M. Stolypin's 15-year-old daughter had both her legs shattered.</p>

                            <p>During the course of a reception at M. Stolypin's villa, four strange

                                their way into the ante-chamber, and let fall a bomb. The explosion
                                which resulted destroyed a portion of the villa and killed General
                                Zamiatine, who was attached to the person of M. Stolypin, the
                                chamberlain Voro-nine, the four conspirators, and everybody present.
                                It broke the legs of M. Stolypin's daughter, and wounded his son.
                                There are said to be forty killed or wounded.</p>

                                Davidoft, the Gendarmerie-Colonel Felodoff, Prince Nakashidjes, four
                                ladies and two children, and several servants and guards.</p>
                            <p>Later details show that four men, two of whom were disguised in
                                military uniforms and two dressed as civilians, drove up after the
                                visitors' list was closed and were refused admission, which they
                                attempted to force. A struggle with the servants then ensued during
                                which a Terrorist, disguised as an officer, prematurely dropped a
                                bomb concealed in his helmet. The bomb exploded with terrific force,
                                destroying the rooms on the ground floor and the balcony of the
                                first floor where M. Stolypin's children were seated. The Premier
                                was then in his private cabinet; hence his escape, Most of the
                                victims were in the ante-room. Two of the conspirators were killed,
                                and the others wounded.</p>
                            <p>Thirty three persons were wounded, amongst whom are included many
                                prominent personage, in the social and official world. (Later). M.
                                Stolypin's daughter is still alive. She had a quiet night after the
                                injection of morphia. His son is better. The mother is with her
                                children in the hospital. The total number of the dead is 30.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Horne Payne, discussing in "The National Review'' the gentle art of
                        investment, says: No ordinarily intelligent person should invest his or her
                        money to yield less than 3 3/4 per cent., and, on the other hand, not more
                        than 5 per cent should be aimed at ; but a clever investor may set aside a
                        certain portion of his money, say one-fifth (where the loss of income on
                        that one-fifth for a year or two would not seriously embarrass him), with
                        which to buy securities yielding a higher rate, with a view of increasing
                        his capital. When securities, guaranteed by the Government of Canada
                        actually as good as Consols, or guaranteed by Ontario and Manitoba, of
                        scarcely less credit, can be bad to yield 3 3/4 per cent., it is absurd to
                        put money out at lower return.</p>
                    <p>As to the class of investment to be selected, I prefer Colonial Government or
                        State or Provincial Government loans and guarantees, the debentures and
                        preference stocks of railways (other than English), electric railways,
                        electric light and power companies, where the debenture or preference
                        interest is abundantly covered, but there are a great number of other safe
                        and desirable classes of enterprise. The countries that seem to me to offer
                        at present infinitely the best field for investment are Canada, parts of
                        South America, and, subject to political developments, Egypt.</p>
                    <p>I do not like municipal securities, home, colonial, or foreign, as I believe
                        that within ten years, anything from fifty to one hundred million sterling
                        will be lost in them, as a result of the money being launched into
                        enterprises of which the men at the helm know nothing.</p>
                    <p>I am convinced that as city corporations are becoming more and more trading
                        concerns, their credit will shortly go from a 4 per cent. to a 5 per cent,
                        basis, and that eventually an extremely serious crisis must be precipitated
                        all over the world, as the result of a vast sum of capital being placed in
                        the hands of the chosen of the people to waste in attempting enterprises
                        which they lack the special training, life's experience, and frequently the
                        ability to understand.</p>
                    <p>The general investor should not invest in ordinary stocks, and I am convinced
                        that ordinary stocks should never be purchased under any circumstances to
                        yield less than 5 per cent, no matter what their nature, or where the
                        enterprise may be situated, be they English railways, breweries, or anything
                        else, except in the rare instances where, for some clear, definite concrete
                        reason it is practically certain the income of the immediate future will
                        increase, and, in other words, where the future is being bought.</p>

                    <head>DO ENGLISH LADIES DRINK WHISKEY?</head>
                    <head>A DIPLOMATIST'S SURPRISE</head>
                    <p>A diplomatist recently accredited to the Sultan describes in "The Standard"
                        how he once secured an audience of bis Majesty and how he fared.</p>
                    <p>His object was to obtain the confirmation of an already chosen archbishop to
                        a Macedonian see. For weeks he was thwarted by officials of the Court, and
                        then for mere weeks by the Sultan himself, who professed to be too busy to
                        see him. However, at last he was really received, and this is what happened
                        :—</p>
                    <p>His Majesty awaited me in a small but richly furnished room. He stood in the
                        uniform of a Turkish colonel by a low sofa, with his gloved left hand on the
                        hilt of his sword. His rather long, melancholy countenance was curiously and
                        subtly lighted by sort of good humoured latent smile. Even in his dark and
                        usually sad eyes the same strange laughter seemed to lie. In them one could
                        read either suppressed merriment or irony. Probably he was foretasting the
                        humour of the diplomatic transaction which was to follow, and enjoying it
                        quietly !</p>
                    <p>I sat exactly opposite the Sultan, who took a place alone on the sofa. About
                        a yard away on his left the accomplished dragoman of the Palace, Ibrahim
                        Bey, occupied a small chair, and on my left was my own dragoman. Looking me
                        straight in the face, Abdul Hamid said a couple of phrases in musical
                        Turkish, speaking very low. Ibrahim Bey bowed low, made the Temena'a, and
                        began to translate. This he did afresh each time the Sultan spoke, till, at
                        the end of the audience, he was quite weary with the gymnastic exercise. He
                        began thus :—</p>
                    <p>"His Majesty commands me to say how much he regrets not having been able to
                        receive yon sooner. It was a great annoyance to him, as he had a subject he
                        particularly wished to discuss with you. His Majesty is pleased to see you,
                        and hopes that you are ready to enter upon the subject." I replied that I
                        was deeply sensible of the honour conferred on me, the more so as my
                        Government had charged me to bring to the personal notice of his Majesty a
                        question of some importance I was especially delighted to find his Majesty
                        so ready to enter upon details.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="bold">A Sphinx-like Smile,</hi></p>
                    <p>The Sultan bent his head slightly towards me, and murmured a few words with a
                        Sphinx-like smile. "Before his Majesty begins to talk about that matter he
                        wishes to know how long you were accredited to the Court of St.
                        James's."</p>
                    <p>This seemed a curious introduction to the decision of the Archbishopric in
                        Macedonia question, but I replied that altogether I had been about seven
                        years in London.</p>
                    <p>"Then you must be well acquainted with English society ?"</p>
                    <p>I replied that in my modest way I thought I knew something of the
                        English.</p>
                    <p>"Very well ! His Majesty is most anxious to have your opinion on English
                        women."</p>
                    <p>In spite of myself I cried out "What ?" and looked to my interpreter to see
                        if Ibrahim Bey had translated aright. But he nodded, and Ibrahim Bey
                        repeated, "His Majesty would know what a man, like yourself, who is familiar
                        with English society, thinks of the ladies,"</p>
                    <p>"They are good and pretty," I answered briefly, wondering what the qualities
                        of English women had to do with the case of my unconsecrated bishop.</p>
                    <p><hi rend="bold">When the Sultan was in England,</hi></p>
                    <p>"His Majesty says that when he was in England he saw many beautiful women." I
                        opened my eyes wider and wider and ventured to ask, "Was his Majesty ever in
                        England ?"</p>
                    <p>"Certainly ; I and my elder brother, Murad, accompanied our uncle, Sultan
                        Abdul Aziz— Heaven rest his soul—to England to visit Queen Victoria." His
                        Majesty uttered these words scarcely above a whisper, looking very seriously
                        and sadly at the floor. We were all silent for a minute, in deference to the
                        recollections of his uncle and brother awakened in his pious memory,</p>
                    <p>Then, however, he broke into a long speech, which Ibrahim rendered quickly
                        into French.</p>
                    <p>"His Majesty says that a tall and fine officer was attached to his suite; a
                        very agreeable officer. His Majesty fancies to have read or heard that this
                        same officer fell like a brave soldier on the battlefield later. When we
                        were England the officer ordered a bottle of Scotch whisky and soda water to
                        be placed on a little table in the ante-room, and made a speech to my
                        brother and me on the sovereign virtues of this drink. He also tried to
                        convince us that it was impossible that the Koran should forbid its use.
                        When he found he could not over-persuade us he concluded by trusting that
                        though we did not partake ourselves we would not take it ill if he did."</p>
                    <p>Evidently the Saltan understands French perfectly, as Ibrahim Bey had no
                        sooner ended the translation of one phrase than he began another,
                        punctuating here and there with audible laughter,</p>
                    <p><hi rend="bold">The Officer's Whisky</hi></p>
                    <p>"His Majesty says that the officer often repeated these tactics. At last,
                        says his Majesty, when my brother and I saw bottle after bottle of Scotch
                        whisky disappear we said to ourselves, 'The officer is a nice fellow and a
                        fine soldier; he is our friend, and we are his friends. But we are not doing
                        our duty as friends if we don't tell him that he drinks too much' So we
                        remonstrated with him. And what was bis answer? He gazed at us in amazement,
                        and then burst out laughing, 'Is <cb n="4"/> it possible that your Royal
                        Highnesses think that I drink too much of this whisky ? What would your
                        Royal Highness say if you could see how much many of the ladies in our best
                        society drink ?' " and he laughed louder still. "And now, your Excellency,"
                        concluded Ibrahim Bey solemnly, "what his Majesty wishes to know from you is
                        this—Is it really true that English ladies drink?"</p>
                    <p>I answered warmly that whatever may have been the case thirty or thirty-five
                        years ago his Majesty might take my word for it that English ladies did not
                        drink nowadays.</p>
                    <p>His Majesty's ironical smile departed. He looked grave, as if meditating some
                        great problem, and then said, "It gives me great pleasure to hear you say
                        so. You confirm my own view. Often since have I asked myself, Could the
                        English nation be what it is if the, women of England drank more than, or
                        even as much as, the men ?' I am glad that your observations in London
                        support my own theories." His Majesty then went into long praise of English
                        women, referring to the saying Non Angli sed Angeli. I seized this allusion
                        as a drowning man reaches at a straw. </p>
                    <p><hi rend="bold">Defeated,</hi></p>
                    <p>"Sire," I interrupted, rising and bowing deeply, being copied by Ibrahim Bey,
                        "your Majesty's mention of angels reminds me of Heaven, and Heaven reminds
                        me of churches, and so I am brought back to the thought of that excellent
                        man and most true and worthy servant of your Majesty, the Archbishop of
                        Macedonia, whose consecration—"</p>
                    <p>Here his Majesty showed how well he understood French, as he would not let me
                        go on, but broke in with, "Certainly ! But you would never mix up a bishop
                        in our interesting conversation on English ladies. No! no! The time has not
                        yet come to talk about your bishop. Leave it to me to choose the opportune
                        moment! And of a surety our talk then will be as satisfactory as it has been
                        interesting to-day !" And thereupon his Majesty rose, and, with a slight
                        inclination of his head and a suspicious smile hovering round his lips and
                        mouth, I was graciously dismissed.</p>

                    <p>Somewhere in his voluminous correspondence Charles Dickens stated that he had
                        the idea of writing a short story round the romance of the journey of a
                        telegraph message. The passage is recalled by an article in "Cassell's

                        perhaps the most remarkable route in the world. If you were to follow a
                        piece of news transmitted from beginning to end of it you would start from

                    <p>The deep-seated race feud which reigns between Greeks and Russians on Mount
                        Athos has again broken out in violent encounters. Last year there was a
                        senguinary affray, and the Turkish gendarmerie, a Moslem force, had to be
                        called in to enforce peace between the Christian factions. This year the
                        riot has been between the monks of the Stavronikila district on the
                        north-east of the Athos peninsula, and many Russians were wounded. The
                        affair has been carried before the central council of the 20 convents of
                        Athos, at Karyes, the capital. The trouble has its origin in the systematic
                        way in which the Russian monks increase the number of their buildings and
                        cells. This evident determination to acquire a preponderance of numbers
                        which shall ultimately place the general direction of affairs in Russian

                        occupations. La fatigue de la purgation étant annulée par l'effet de la
                        bonne alimentation, on se décide aisément à recommencer autant de fois que
