                        no mention was made in this firman of the Sinai Peninsnla, on the north

                        declared between England and Germany, but they are very significant for they
                        are made by an officer in the Kaiser's army, and the book, where this scheme
                        is advoosted, is finding a large circulation in Germany. The present
                        frontier disputa shows how easily matters might be brought to a grave state
                        of tension. </p>
