                <div type="item">
                    <p>In the House of Commons yesterday, Lord Selborne referred to the great
                        changes in the naval position of the world ; Russia had be- come a naval
                        power, France maintained her building and efficiency, America and Ger- many
                        had evolved navies of equal strength and efficiency; Italy stood still.
                        England, he said, merely recognised facts. In at- tempting a comparison
                        between Great Britain's naval power and that of other nations, however,
                        there is much to be borne in mind besides numerical strength. Of course, in
                        any comparison the number of ships is the chief consideration—their fighting
                        power and fitness or otherwise to operate against the enemy,their age, size,
                        armament, speed, and general equip- ment for service ; but other questions
                        enter into the range of discussion. There is the personnel of the fleet, the
                        organisation and intelligence of the service, and the power of adaptability
                        to circumstances to get the most oat of whatever ships they may happen to
                        possess. Past history teaches on that the vie' tory has not always been with
                        the greatest number of ships, but has been determined largely by the
                        personal element, the genius of the captain, and the worth of his crew. We
                        live, however, in a different age, and history is no longer a safe guide,
                        although the human element will still count for something in the day of
                        battle. Then there is the work the fleet has to do, the geographical
                        position of the nations con- cerned, the seaboard to be protected, and the
                        extent to which a country is dependent for its life upon its control of the
                        sea. The last-named point appeals particularly to Great Britain in view of
                        her insular position, her great popula- tion, and her almost entire
                        dependence upon foreign grain for very life. Napoleon used to say that
                        armies moved upon their bellies. Everybody does so, and a starving civilian
                        population would end a war quicker even than armed legions or fighting
                        ships. Starvation has ever been a strong weapon of warfare, and it is well
                        for Great Britain, therefore, to bear in mind that in wheat she grows only a
                        fifth of what her people eat. Moreover, it is not only food which must reach
                        Great Britain's shores. Raw material must enter her ports, first, to provide
                        work for her people so that they may have the wherewithal to purchase bread;
                        and, second; to keep her works going, say, in manu- facturing steel in its
                        varied forms for the build- ing or repair of ships and engines to carry on
                        the struggle. If Great Britain's supplies of iron ore, for example, were
                        stopped for a mouth her . steel industry would be at a standstill. Another
                        consideration is the possession of colonies—their extent and liability to
                        attack; their loyalty, and the power they would, or could, exert to defend
                        themselves against the enemy of the mother country. In this respect Great
                        Britain has greater responsibilities than other nations, first, because she
                        owns the greatest colonies; and, secondly, because they are either
                        surrounded by water or their sea- board is extensive. Then there might be
                        noted the naval stations possessed by the various countries—geographical
                        positions strongly held, which tend to strengthen the nation possessing
                        them, while weakening the attacking force. Gibraltar may be take as a case
                        in point—a position which should be worth a good many ships to Great
                        Britain, just as the Kaiser Wil- helm Canal is of great value to Germany,
                        enabling that nation to assemble its fleet in either the North or Baltic Sea
                        without going round by Denmark, thus avoiding the risk of an attack in the

                    <p>Our youthful Cairo contemporary calls us to task for our article on the
                        subject of the Assouan Dam. Nothing pleases the youthful and blows him out
                        with self-conceit so joyously as criticising his seniors. Then, too, it
                        looks like penetrating acumen to discover the identity of a writer, but in
                        this case it is surmise pure and simple, and wrong. As for our "pernicious
                        and unwarranted statement,'' and our bringing in question the good faith of
                        the British Occupation, and that, according to our contemporary, not for the
                        first time, it may enlighten our critic to learn that reclamation of land by
                        British capital is the quickest and most certain means of enabling peasant
                        proprietors to acquire small holdings. Land is so sub- divided and so
                        extremely dear in the old settled parts of the Delta, that it is only by
                        opening up tho waste lands of the lacustrine region that the rising
                        generation can find new homes, and become owners of them. We would recommend
                        the reading of Mr. Hogarth's recant paper on the Nile fen lands in proof of
                        this. The young journalist should remember that whilst knowledge of a
                        subject may place bounds to imagination, it will be found very useful
                        adjunct, if be throws down the gauge to a journal focus turned to weigh well
                        its words, and one of seasoned experience.</p>

                                views on the alliance are enunciated. It declares that there is no

                            <p> House of Lords. —Lord Guschen justified the vast increase in naval
                                expenditure during the last 15 years by the changes which had taken
                                place throughout the world. He did not think that the loss of 5
                                Russian battleships justified the decrease made in the British
                                programme. Lord Sel borne referred to the great changes" in the
                                naval position ol the world : Russia had become a naval power,
                                France maintained her building and efficiency; America and Germany
                                had evolved navies of equal strength and Italy stood still. England
                                merely recognized facts. He did not advocate the "three power
                                standard" because he thought that England was unable to afford it.
                                Stability of finances are as necessary as an efficient navy. We must
                                balance one against the other. (Reuter.)</p>

                    <head>ABYSSINIAN STATE BANK. NATIONAL BANK'S AGREEMENT. </head>
                    <p>With regard to the establishment of a State bank in Abyssinia, we understand
                        that the agreement come to between the National Bank of Egypt and the
                        Emperor Menelik comprises:—(1) the monopoly of banking busi- ness for 50
                        years; (2) the monopoly of minting bank-notes, and (3) the monopoly of
                        entrepots. The capital is to be found by the National Bank of Egypt as to
                        one-half, and by Italian and French financiers as to one-fourth each.
                        Referring to the establishment of the bank, the "Financial Times" says: The
                        Egyptian bank which is interesting itself in this matter is the National
                        Bank of Egypt, and its associa- tion in this enterprise is quite
                        understandable in view of the close relationship between it and the Egyptian
                        Government The institution to be formed will be a small one, and, as a
                        consequence of the commercial condition of Abyssinia, must take the
                        character very much ot a trading institution rather than a bank pure and
                        simple. Its objects are semi-political, and it is unlikely that it will
                        assume any financial importance for some time to come. </p>

                    <p>The Khedivial Opera House company select- ed La Tosco as the farewell item on
                        their programme—a wise choice, as it is by far the most agreeable and
                        representative present- ment in their repertoire. La Tosca has already been
                        reviewed in these columns, so we need not re emphasize details. We may say
                        that Signor Girand was better on Friday night than he has been even in
                        previous per- formances of this same opera. Signora Pandol- fini i was as
                        charming as usual, and Signor Polce again showed what a finished actor he
                        is. II Sagrestauo (Signor Galletti) even added to his usual business: his
                        methods in re "la prise religieu8e" of snuff were wholly convincing. Signor
                        Zuccani made the most of that most satisfactory and consistent Leit-motif
                        which pervades this masterpiece of Maestro Puccini from start to finish. He
                        and the composer are alike happy in that this delightful opera has, and
                        entails, none of the confusing variety and gradation which so prominently
                        characterises Ruch writers as Boito, Ponchielli, and Giordano. La Tosca, we
                        may venture to say, was not eminently suited to all the executants, but had
                        its unfailing and direct appeal to the audience; and the consequent success
                        and applause were thoroughly deserved. With this we bid farewell to the
                        company, with every wish for their future success in all their prospective
                        ventures. </p>

                    <p>The past week has been fall of interest in financial circles. The
                        completeness of the Japanese victory is such, that we begin to "see
                        daylight" The position has been ably described by Lord Rothschild, through
                        the columns of the new "Evening Standard and St James's Gazette." France has
                        to all intents stopped the war by refusing further sinews for the
                        prosecution of it A feature in the situation is that the best- informed are
                        the most confident; and while second-class shares have been full and
                        feature- less, first-class investments still find ready buyers; and though
                        the market has a tired week-end feeling for the moment, and Consols have
                        dropped to 91-5/16, there is every appearance of continued activity. The
                        heaviest and most active settlement which has been seen on the Stock
                        Exchange for years has gone through satisfactorily this week, and business
                        can really be said to be on a sound basis at last, after a long period of
                        stagnation which markets have gone through. There has been a slight check in
                        prices in the Foreign market, where the suspension of negotiations for the
                        new Russian loan made dealers in Paris stocks somewhat cautious. As a matter
                        of fact, this mast in reality be a ball- point, tending as it naturally
                        should do towards the conclusion of peace. Japanese Stocks keep steady on
                        the whole, though not quite main- taining the level of their best prices.
                        Russians are still supported up to 88. In the Consol market money is not
                        quite so easy, and the price has steadied down to 9l£. In Egyptians the
                        feature has been the burst of activity in the mining section, which has
                        really cut itself adrift from Kaffirs this week, and been a little boom of
                        its own. Nile Valleys have .been up to2 j bid; Egyptian Mines have touched
                        20s. 6d , and Egypt and Sudan Syndicate, to the value of which we have
                        already drawn attention, are firm at 2. Prices have eased off slightly
                        to-day on profit-taking. It is rumored that Egyptian Mines are to be listed
                        on the Paris Bourse, and it is worth noting that, to be able to do this, the
                        price must stand at a minimum of 25s. They close to-night 19s. 6d. Other
                        Egyptian Stocks are steady on the whole, bat not so active. National Banks
                        stand at 27 ; Agri- cultural are easier at 11, after 11. Darias have also

                    <head>THE UM RUS GOLD MINES.</head>
                    <p>Mr. Oy J. Alford reports as follows:—"I have just returned from the Um Rus
                        mine, where, on Monday, March the 6th, I had the great pleasure of seeing
                        the first 10 stamps of the mill commence crashing ore, the practical
                        resumption of gold production in Egypt after an interval of several thousand
                        years. When I left the mine the mill was running well, the plates were in
                        excellent condition and amalgam was forming on them in a most satisfactory
                        manner. A clean up will take place about the end of the month, when results
                        will be known. At first and for some little time, until the foundations have
                        had time to consolidate and everything falls into perfect working order, the
                        mill cannot be ran to its full capa- city, which,when attained, will be the
                        crushing by these 10 stamps of about forty tons of ore per twenty-tour
                        hours. The mill is planned for thirty stamps and the remaining batteries,
                        with cyan id ing plant, will bo added when found necessary. The electrical
                        hoisting, stone break- ing, and air-compressing plant at the mine is almost
                        completed, the generating station at the harbour with connections to the
                        mine entirely so, and the whole will be, leaning by the end of the present
                        month. Ore stripping ban been commenced in the 245 ft. level and there is
                        sufficient ore available to keep the mill fully employed for at least six
                        months; meanwhile development work will proceed rapidly as soon as the
                        machine drills get to work. Generally I am well satisfied with the condition
                        add pros- pects of the mine and look with confidence to its future." — </p>

                        throughout the present racing season attended the olub till the end.
                        Yesterday's meeting was marred by a cold gale, accompanied -by dost and
                        .threats of rain, and the pleasure of the onlookers.was considerably reduced
                        thereby. This was the more deplorable since there were no more than seven
                        races on the programme, which promised, and indeed gave, some ineresting
                        finishes, but the attendance—an important consideration to every club—was
                        greatly diminished by the unseasonable cold. Among those present were Lord
                        and Lady Cromer, Lady Beatrice Thynne, .the Sirdar, Sir .William Garetin,
                        Sir .William and Lady Wiiloooks, Sir El win and Lady Palmer, Sir Ernest

                        carrying nearly 3 stone mom than the winner. In the Pinal Plate, The Bard
                        won an unexpected and very admirable victory and rewarded his few hackers
                        most handsomely. The winners as,a role paid well, though place betting .was

                        established has received a good deal of attention. The Ministry had two
                        points to take into consideration, viz., the comfort of the students and
                        that of the masters. As far as Egyptian opinion can be ascertain- ed, the
                        need of the country requires that the school should be somewhere within the
                        reach of those who have at present to travel some twenty or even more hours
                        to get to Cairo. Among the students of the Tewfikieh and Khedivieh Schools
                        there is a large number from the far southern parts of Upper Egypt, such as
                        Girgeh, Ketieh, and Assouan. It means money and time for these students to
                        travel a long distance between their native towns and the Capital. In
                        considering these difficulties we must bear in mind that not a small number
                        of these students have not the means to meet the expenses of a Cairo life,
                        added to the cost of travel, and accordingly they have to remain where they
                        are, simply because they cannot be within reach of a secondary school in
                        Upper Egypt near their homes. Assiout is the right place for such a school.
                        Ras-el-Tin School at Alexandria satisfies the needs to the Behera and
                        Gharbieh provinces. The Cairo schools meet the requirements of the remaining
                        provinces of Lower Egypt and the northern part of Upper Egypt up to Beni
                        Souef. There remains thus the greater part or Upper Egypt,from Minieh in the
                        north to Haifa in the south, with its dense population of about three
                        millions in need of a secondary school. Assiout lies in the centre of this
                        region, or nearly so; and no less than two or three hun- dred students now
                        these provinces find them- selves at present within the doors to the
                        Tewfikieh and Khedivieh schools. But there remains a second point to be
                        taken into consideration. This new school naturally needs English masters,
                        who would feel lonely in Upper Egypt. They consider it a curse to be away
                        from the Turf Club, the Ghezireh grounds, the Khedivial bails, the Opera
                        House, and the like. It is certainly much more convenient for them to live
                        in Cairo than in Assiout; and this is the second point the Ministry of
                        Public Instruction had to take into consideration. These two points have to
                        be placed in the scales, and whichever draws the balance has to ba the
                        reason for deciding the place where the school is to be built. It seems that
                        the Minis- try has already performed the operation, as I see in some papers
                        that it has been decided that Ghizeh is to be the site for the new school.
                        If this is true, and I hope it is not, the Ministry has made a giant
                        mistake. The needs of the country and the comfort of four or five hundred
                        students, together with their families, should certainly outweigh the
                        comfort of five or six English masters. A new school at Gbizeh would simply
                        mean the enlargement of the Cairo schools, without adding to their number of
                        pupils. Life in Upper Egypt is not, after all, so tiring?. Inspectors of
                        Pittance and the Interior, Irrigation officers, and bank agents live easily
                        in the provinces. The Sudan is not more com- fortable than Upper Egypt is ;
                        and it is to be remarked that tho school is meant for the students and not
                        for the masters, an . that th > Ministry can easily change its decision if
                        it has already formed one.</p>

                        <head>EGYPTIAN COTTON MILLS.</head>
                        <p>To the Editor of the "Egyptian Gazette." Sir,— The statement in
                            yesterday's "Gazette," that owing to the indebtedness of the Egyptian
                            Cotton Mills to the Government, to the extent of £3,000 to £4,000 for
                            taxes, which the company is unable to pay, the mills are to be closed,
                            will be very serious reading to a large number of investors in this
                            country. Your correspondent, "An Old Shareholder," suggests that to save
                            the industry being strangled by the countervailing duty, Lord Cromer
                            should be approached, but in this case 1 have no doubt that Lord
                            Cromer's hands are tied, and that the only interests concerned are the
                            Lancashire constituencies, which, in view of the approaching General
                            Election, the Go- vernment cannot afford to disregard. Last year, we
                            were treated to pathetic stories of the wrongs done to Lancashire by the
                            wicked operations of Mr. Sully, and of the poor, starv- ing mill hands,
                            who were sacrificed as victims to the Yankee cotton speculators. But
                            Lan- cashire does not consider anything when its own interests are
                            concerned, and to please the powerful interests of that county, a
                            promising Egyptian industry is to be crushed out of existence. The time
                            will come very soon, far sooner than we reck of, when the pressure on
                            the soil will become a very serious question, and the fellah will no
                            longer concentrate all his energies on agriculture. Population in-
                            creases with extraordinary rapidity and land is limited. Industrial
                            development will be one of the great, perhaps the grotest, feature of
                            Egyptian progress in the immediate future, and one of the natural
                            industries of the country should be spinning and weaving. Your
                            correspondent expresses a hope that Lord Cromer will be appealed to aim
                            will hearken to the prayers of this industry, which is doomed to die
                            still-born. But Lord Cromer has a double duty. He has not only the
                            interests of Egypt to look after, but he is also the representative of
                            the British Government, and must take his orders from that Govern- ment
                            We all know that he is left entirely to his own discretion in regard to
                            internal matters, and that the authorities resolutely refuse to listen
                            to the cracks and faddists who attempt to introduce their pet schemes
                            into Egypt The answers to the questions on Egypt in the House of Commons
                            show the implicit confi- dence which the Government has in Lord Cromer.
                            But when it comas to external matters, influences from home are brought
                            to bear, and the perfunctory defense which his lordship makes of the
                            case against the Cotton Mills in the 1901 Keport clearly shows that he
                            did not act of his own free will in the matter. If it was a valid
                            argument that this industry should be shackled, because, if developed,
                            it would imperil the revenue derived from the Customs duties on cotton
                            goods, the same line of reasoning should be applied to the breweries,
                            soap-manufactories, and all the other industries, which are competing
                            with the revenue derived from imports into Egypt. But while new
                            industries are springing up, the products of which decrease tho need for
                            similar exports, they are never shackled by a countervailing excise.
                            There is no need to elaborate the argument. It is hardly necessary for
                            me to write this letter, for the industry is doomed to be crushed out in
                            the interests of Lancashire and no power can save it But the episode
                            will always remain a blot on the history of England in Egypt and, as far
                            as I ran see, I am glad to say the episode is the only case of political
                            immorality of which our country has been guilty in her relations with
                            Egypt. I am not, I may add, a shareholder in the concern, but "A Mere

                        <p>Sir,—One would have thought when two great engineers held different views
                            about the Assouan Dam, that the one who opened the attack would have
                            cited some more recent authority on engineering than the writer of
                            Boclesiastes. The wresting of the words "Afraid of that which is high"
                            to make them apply to a masonry dam, and at the same time prove
                            decrepitude on the part of an adversary, and discredit his opinion
                            officially expressed, is a perfect gem of naive misuse of Scripture. It
                            is : something to live up to one's motto, even if it: is "L'andaoe,
                            toujours randaco." Job XII. 33. tells ns "Upon earth there is not his
                            like, "who is made without fear. He beholdeth all "high things; he is a
