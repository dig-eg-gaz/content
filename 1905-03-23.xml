                    <p>In the House of Commons yesterday, Lord Selborne referred to the great
                        changes in the naval position of the world ; Russia had be- come a naval
                        power, France maintained her building and efficiency, America and Ger- many
                        had evolved navies of equal strength and efficiency; Italy stood still.
                        England, he said, merely recognised facts. In at- tempting a comparison
                        between Great Britain’s naval power and that of other nations, however,
                        there is much to be borne in mind besides numerical strength. Of course, in
                        any comparison the number of ships is the chief consideration—their fighting
                        power and fitness or otherwise to operate against the enemy,their age, size,
                        armament, speed, and general equip- ment for service ; but other questions
                        enter into the range of discussion. There is the personnel of the fleet, the
                        organisation and intelligence of the service, and the power of adaptability
                        to circumstances to get the most oat of whatever ships they may happen to
                        possess. Past history teaches on that the vie' tory has not always been with
                        the greatest number of ships, but has been determined largely by the
                        personal element, the genius of the captain, and the worth of his crew. We
                        live, however, in a different age, and history is no longer a safe guide,
                        although the human element will still count for something in the day of
                        battle. Then there is the work the fleet has to do, the geographical
                        position of the nations con- cerned, the seaboard to be protected, and the
                        extent to which a country is dependent for its life upon its control of the
                        sea. The last-named point appeals particularly to Great Britain in view of
                        her insular position, her great popula- tion, and her almost entire
                        dependence upon foreign grain for very life. Napoleon used to say that
                        armies moved upon their bellies. Everybody does so, and a starving civilian
                        population would end a war quicker even than armed legions or fighting
                        ships. Starvation has ever been a strong weapon of warfare, and it is well
                        for Great Britain, therefore, to bear in mind that in wheat she grows only a
                        fifth of what her people eat. Moreover, it is not only food which must reach
                        Great Britain’s shores. Raw material must enter her ports, first, to provide
                        work for her people so that they may have the wherewithal to purchase bread;
                        and, second; to keep her works going, say, in manu- facturing steel in its
                        varied forms for the build- ing or repair of ships and engines to carry on
                        the struggle. If Great Britain’s supplies of iron ore, for example, were
                        stopped for a mouth her . steel industry would be at a standstill. Another
                        consideration is the possession of colonies—their extent and liability to
                        attack; their loyalty, and the power they would, or could, exert to defend
                        themselves against the enemy of the mother country. In this respect Great
                        Britain has greater responsibilities than other nations, first, because she
                        owns the greatest colonies; and, secondly, because they are either
                        surrounded by water or their sea- board is extensive. Then there might be
                        noted the naval stations possessed by the various countries—geographical
                        positions strongly held, which tend to strengthen the nation possessing
                        them, while weakening the attacking force. Gibraltar may be take as a case
                        in point—a position which should be worth a good many ships to Great
                        Britain, just as the Kaiser Wil- helm Canal is of great value to Germany,
                        en- abling that nation to assemble its fleet in either the North or Baltic
                        Sea without going round by Denmark, thus avoiding the risk of an attack in
                        the Shager Rack and Cattegat</p>

                    <p>Our youthful Cairo contemporary calls us to task for our article on the
                        subject of the Assouan Dam. Nothing pleases the youthful and blows him out
                        with self-conceit so joyously as criticising his seniors. Then, too, it
                        looks like penetrating acumen to discover the identity of a writer, but in
                        this case it is surmise pure and simple, and wrong. As for our "pernicious
                        and unwarranted statement,’’ and our bringing in question the good faith of
                        the British Occupation, and that, according to our contemporary, not for the
                        first time, it may enlighten our critic to learn that reclamation of land by
                        British capital is the quickest and most certain means of enabling peasant
                        proprietors to acquire small holdings. Land is so sub- divided and so
                        extremely dear in the old settled parts of the Delta, that it is only by
                        opening up tho waste lands of the lacustrine region that the rising
                        generation can find new homes, and become owners of them. We would recommend
                        the reading of Mr. Hogarth’s recant paper on the Nile fen lands in proof of
                        this. The young journalist should remember that whilst knowledge of a
                        subject may place bounds to imagination, it will be found very useful
                        adjunct, if be throws down the gauge to a journal focus turned to weigh well
                        its words, and one of seasoned experience.</p>

                    <p>Reuters’s correspondent learns from Gun- tzuling, situated 106 miles to the
                        north of Tieling, that, after four days rest at Tieling, the Russians
                        continued their retreat in a uio-t orderly manner, the pursuit being feeble.
                        Oyama is evidently concentrating his army at Tieling where an enormous camp
                        is now being formed. General Kuropatkin returned on the 21st from Kharbin.
                        lie received an ovation. In addressing his troops, he said he hoped that the
                        army would soon retrieve the reverses. ( Reuter.) Tokio, March 22. It is
                        reported that the Russian rearguard was still 20 miles to the north of
                        Kai-Yuen yesterday. The retreat continues along the main routes in the
                        direction of Kirin and Chang Chun. (Reuter.) St. Peterburg, March 22.

                        expenditure during the last 15 years by the changes which had taken place
                        throughout the world. He did not think that the loss of 5 Russian
                        battleships justified the decrease made in the British programme. Lord Sel
                        borne referred to the great changes" in the naval position ol the world :
                        Russia had become a naval power, France maintained her building and
                        efficiency; America and Germany had evolved navies of equal strength and
                        Italy stood still. England merely recognized facts. He did not advocate the
                        “three power standard" because he thought that England was unable to afford
                        it. Stability of finances are as necessary as an efficient navy. We must

                        the establishment of a State bank in Abyssinia, we understand that the
                        agreement come to between the National Bank of Egypt and the Emperor Menelik
                        comprises:—(1) the monopoly of banking busi- ness for 50 years; (2) the
                        monopoly of minting bank-notes, and (3) the monopoly of entrepots. The
                        capital is to be found by the National Bank of Egypt as to one-half, and by
                        Italian and French financiers as to one-fourth each. Referring to the
                        establishment of the bank, the “Financial Times” says: The Egyptian bank
                        which is interesting itself in this matter is the National Bank of Egypt,
                        and its associa- tion in this enterprise is quite understandable in view of
                        the close relationship between it and the Egyptian Government The
                        institution to be formed will be a small one, and, as a consequence of the
                        commercial condition of Abyssinia, must take the character very much ot a
                        trading institution rather than a bank pure and simple. Its objects are
                        semi-political, and it is unlikely that it will assume any financial
                        importance for some time to come. </p>

                        Opera House company select- ed La Tosco as the farewell item on their
                        programme—a wise choice, as it is by far the most agreeable and
                        representative present- ment in their repertoire. La Tosca has already been
                        reviewed in these columns, so we need not re emphasize details. We may say
                        that Signor Girand was better on Friday night than he has been even in
                        previous per- formances of this same opera. Signora Pandol- fini i was as
                        charming as usual, and Signor Polce again showed what a finished actor he
                        is. II Sagrestauo (Signor Galletti) even added to his usual business: his
                        methods in re “la prise religieu8e” of snuff were wholly convincing. Signor
                        Zuccani made the most of that most satisfactory and consistent Leit-motif
                        which pervades this masterpiece of Maestro Puccini from start to finish. He
                        and the composer are alike happy in that this delightful opera has, and
                        entails, none of the confusing variety and gradation which so prominently
                        characterises Ruch writers as Boito, Ponchielli, and Giordano. La Tosca, we
                        may venture to say, was not eminently suited to all the executants, but had
                        its unfailing and direct appeal to the audience; and the consequent success
                        and applause were thoroughly deserved. With this we bid farewell to the
                        company, with every wish for their future success in all their prospective
                        ventures. </p>

                        Correspondent). London, March 17. The past week has been fall of interest in
                        financial circles. The completeness of the Japanese victory is such, that we
                        begin to “see daylight” The position has been ably described by Lord
                        Rothschild, through the columns of the new “Evening Standard and St James’s
                        Gazette.” France has to all intents stopped the war by refusing further
                        sinews for the prosecution of it A feature in the situation is that the
                        best- informed are the most confident; and while second-class shares have
                        been full and feature- less, first-class investments still find ready
                        buyers; and though the market has a tired week-end feeling for the moment,
                        and Consols have dropped to 91-5/16, there is every appearance of continued
                        activity. The heaviest and most active settlement which has been seen on the
                        Stock Exchange for years has gone through satisfactorily this week, and
                        business can really be said to be on a sound basis at last, after a long
                        period of stagnation which markets have gone through. There has been a
                        slight check in prices in the Foreign market, where the suspension of
                        negotiations for the new Russian loan made dealers in Paris stocks somewhat
                        cautious. As a matter of fact, this mast in reality be a ball- point,
                        tending as it naturally should do towards the conclusion of peace. Japanese
                        Stocks keep steady on the whole, though not quite main- taining the level of
                        their best prices. Russians are still supported up to 88. In the Consol
                        market money is not quite so easy, and the price has steadied down to 9l£.
                        In Egyptians the feature has been the burst of activity in the mining
                        section, which has really cut itself adrift from Kaffirs this week, and been
                        a little boom of its own. Nile Valleys have .been up to2 j bid; Egyptian
                        Mines have touched 20s. 6d , and Egypt and Sudan Syndicate, to the value of
                        which we have already drawn attention, are firm at 2. Prices have eased off
                        slightly to-day on profit-taking. It is rumored that Egyptian Mines are to
                        be listed on the Paris Bourse, and it is worth noting that, to be able to do
                        this, the price must stand at a minimum of 25s. They close to-night 19s. 6d.
                        Other Egyptian Stocks are steady on the whole, bat not so active. National
                        Banks stand at 27 ; Agri- cultural are easier at 11, after 11. Darias have
                        also given way slightly to 25§, a drop of nearly J. Sugar, Salt and Soda,
                        and Egyptian Markets are unchanged. The new Egyptian Estates have recovered
                        again to a premium. </p>

                        follows:—“I have just returned from the Um Rus mine, where, on Monday, March
                        the 6th, I had the great pleasure of seeing the first 10 stamps of the mill
                        commence crashing ore, the practical resumption of gold production in Egypt
                        after an interval of several thousand years. When I left the mine the mill
                        was running well, the plates were in excellent condition and amalgam was
                        forming on them in a most satisfactory manner. A clean up will take place
                        about the end of the month, when results will be known. At first and for
                        some little time, until the foundations have had time to consolidate and
                        everything falls into perfect working order, the mill cannot be ran to its
                        full capa- city, which,when attained, will be the crushing by these 10
                        stamps of about forty tons of ore per twenty-tour hours. The mill is planned
                        for thirty stamps and the remaining batteries, with cyan id ing plant, will
                        bo added when found necessary. The electrical hoisting, stone break- ing,
                        and air-compressing plant at the mine is almost completed, the generating
                        station at the harbour with connections to the mine entirely so, and the
                        whole will be, leaning by the end of the present month. Ore stripping ban
                        been commenced in the 245 ft. level and there is sufficient ore available to
                        keep the mill fully employed for at least six months; meanwhile development
                        work will proceed rapidly as soon as the machine drills get to work.
                        Generally I am well satisfied with the condition add pros- pects of the mine
                        and look with confidence to its future.” — </p>

                    <head>THE NEW SECONDARY SCHOOL (From a Correspondent).</head>
                    <p>The need has long been felt for another secondary school in Egypt. Three
                        already exist, viz, the Tewfikieh and Khedivieh in Cairo and Ras el-Tin in
                        Alexandria. But they have proved incapable of holding the vast number of
                        students, which goes on increasing every year, and it is for this reason
                        that the Ministry of Public Instruction lately decided on the foundation of
                        a fourth. It seems that the question as to the place where it was to be
                        established has received a good deal of attention. The Ministry had two
                        points to take into consideration, viz., the comfort of the students and
                        that of the masters. As far as Egyptian opinion can be ascertain- ed, the
                        need of the country requires that the school should be somewhere within the
                        reach of those who have at present to travel some twenty or even more hours
                        to get to Cairo. Among the students of the Tewfikieh and Khedivieh Schools
                        there is a large number from the far southern parts of Upper Egypt, such as
                        Girgeh, Ketieh, and Assouan. It means money and time for these students to
                        travel a long distance between their native towns and the Capital. In
                        considering these difficulties we must bear in mind that not a small number
                        of these students have not the means to meet the expenses of a Cairo life,
                        added to the cost of travel, and accordingly they have to remain where they
                        are, simply because they cannot be within reach of a secondary school in
                        Upper Egypt near their homes. Assiout is the right place for such a school.
                        Ras-el-Tin School at Alexandria satisfies the needs to the Behera and
                        Gharbieh provinces. The Cairo schools meet the requirements of the remaining
                        provinces of Lower Egypt and the northern part of Upper Egypt up to Beni
                        Souef. There remains thus the greater part or Upper Egypt,from Minieh in the
                        north to Haifa in the south, with its dense population of about three
                        millions in need of a secondary school. Assiout lies in the centre of this
                        region, or nearly so; and no less than two or three hun- dred students now
                        these provinces find them- selves at present within the doors to the
                        Tewfikieh and Khedivieh schools. But there remains a second point to be
                        taken into consideration. This new school naturally needs English masters,
                        who would feel lonely in Upper Egypt. They consider it a curse to be away
                        from the Turf Club, the Ghezireh grounds, the Khedivial bails, the Opera
                        House, and the like. It is certainly much more convenient for them to live
                        in Cairo than in Assiout; and this is the second point the Ministry of
                        Public Instruction had to take into consideration. These two points have to
                        be placed in the scales, and whichever draws the balance has to ba the
                        reason for deciding the place where the school is to be built. It seems that
                        the Minis- try has already performed the operation, as I see in some papers
                        that it has been decided that Ghizeh is to be the site for the new school.
                        If this is true, and I hope it is not, the Ministry has made a giant
                        mistake. The needs of the country and the comfort of four or five hundred
                        students, together with their families, should certainly outweigh the
                        comfort of five or six English masters. A new school at Gbizeh would simply
                        mean the enlargement of the Cairo schools, without adding to their number of
                        pupils. Life in Upper Egypt is not, after all, so tiring?. Inspectors of
                        Pittance and the Interior, Irrigation officers, and bank agents live easily
                        in the provinces. The Sudan is not more com- fortable than Upper Egypt is ;
                        and it is to be remarked that tho school is meant for the students and not
                        for the masters, an . that th > Ministry can easily change its decision if
                        it has already formed one.</p>

                    <p>To the Editor of the “Egyptian Gazette.” Sir,— The statement in yesterday’s
                        “Ga- zette,” that owing to the indebtedness of the Egyptian Cotton Mills to
                        the Government, to the extent of £3,000 to £4,000 for taxes, which the
                        company is unable to pay, the mills are to be closed, will be very serious
                        reading to a large number of investors in this country. Your correspondent,
                        “An Old Shareholder," suggests that to save the industry being strangled by
                        the countervailing duty, Lord Cromer should be approached, but in this case
                        1 have no doubt that Lord Cromer’s hands are tied, and that the only
                        interests concerned are the Lancashire constituencies, which, in view of the
                        approaching General Election, the Go- vernment cannot afford to disregard.
                        Last year, we were treated to pathetic stories of the wrongs done to
                        Lancashire by the wicked operations of Mr. Sully, and of the poor, starv-
                        ing mill hands, who were sacrificed as victims to the Yankee cotton
                        speculators. But Lan- cashire does not consider anything when its own
                        interests are concerned, and to please the powerful interests of that
                        county, a promising Egyptian industry is to be crushed out of existence. The
                        time will come very soon, far sooner than we reck of, when the pressure on
                        the soil will become a very serious question, and the fellah will no longer
                        concentrate all his energies on agriculture. Population in- creases with
                        extraordinary rapidity and land is limited. Industrial development will be
                        one of the great, perhaps the grotest, feature of Egyptian progress in the
                        immediate future, and one of the natural industries of the country should be
                        spinning and weaving. Your correspondent expresses a hope that Lord Cromer
                        will be appealed to aim will hearken to the prayers of this industry, which
                        is doomed to die still-born. But Lord Cromer has a double duty. He has not
                        only the interests of Egypt to look after, but he is also the representative
                        of the British Government, and must take his orders from that Govern- ment
                        We all know that he is left entirely to his own discretion in regard to
                        internal matters, and that the authorities resolutely refuse to listen to
                        the cracks and faddists who attempt to introduce their pet schemes into
                        Egypt The answers to the questions on Egypt in the House of Commons show the
                        implicit confi- dence which the Government has in Lord Cromer. But when it
                        comas to external matters, influences from home are brought to bear, and the
                        perfunctory defense which his lordship makes of the case against the Cotton
                        Mills in the 1901 Keport clearly shows that he did not act of his own free
                        will in the matter. If it was a valid argument that this industry should be
                        shackled, because, if developed, it would imperil the revenue derived from
                        the Customs duties on cotton goods, the same line of reasoning should be
                        applied to the breweries, soap-manufactories, and all the other industries,
                        which are competing with the revenue derived from imports into Egypt. But
                        while new industries are springing up, the products of which decrease tho
                        need for similar exports, they are never shackled by a countervailing
                        excise. There is no need to elaborate the argument. It is hardly necessary
                        for me to write this letter, for the industry is doomed to be crushed out in
                        the interests of Lancashire and no power can save it But the episode will
                        always remain a blot on the history of England in Egypt and, as far as I ran
                        see, I am glad to say the episode is the only case of political immorality
                        of which our country has been guilty in her relations with Egypt. I am not,
                        I may add, a shareholder in the concern, but “A Mere Observer.” Cairo, March

                    <p>Sir,—One would have thought when two great engineers held different views

                        Frightened Mb. What food I ate lay like a load on my chest. I could not
                        digest it at alL I had such in- digestion that 1 was loath to eat the
                        simplest food. “My exhausted and bloodless state I had heard described as
                        Anjcmia. Many of the girls with whom I work had the same complaint, and they
                        told me Dr. Williams' Pink Pills would cure when nothing else could. They
                        wrought wonders. I only round it necessary to purchase a single box. To my
                        relief and joy I felt Well and Strong After These Few Pills. Anaemia
                        vanished, and a tinge of colour quickly came into my face. My appetite came
                        back, and I- can now enjoy a meal without Indigestion." Mrs. Benbow added
                        her testimony to her daughter’s. She said: “Some years ago a young lady I
                        knew suffered very mcch from baa fainting fits. The sufferer used to look
                        sometimes as if she were dying, but since taking Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills
                        she has gathered strength remarkably, and the last time I saw her when had a
                        colour like a rose. She attributed her good health to these pills alone.” To
                        Parents and Guardians. It is criminal to let a pale, amende girl drift into
                        Consumption, merely for want of the New Blood which Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills
                        are proved to supply. They are a safeguard against decline. Mothers know why
                        they and their daughters need new blood more than men ; bat men can be
                        Anaemic, too. The weak back, easy fatigue, i lack of interest in life,
                        indigestion, and general nervous weakness which trouble both men and women,
                        need new blood to cure them, and these pills make new blood. Nerves that
                        need new blood to feed them show their need in Neuralgia, Fits, St Vitus’
                        dance, eventually Paralysis, Locomotor Ataxy, and ntter break- down. But Dr.
                        Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People can cure all these things—the genuine
                        pills. It is important to avoid substitutes, and purchasers should take care
                        to see the full name, as above, on the wrapper, before paying. Sold in Egypt
