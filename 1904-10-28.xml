                    <head>THE RUSSIAN BLUNDER</head>
                    <p>The feeling at home in regard to the North Sea incident, we are told this
                        morning, is at fever heat, and all political parties are united in demanding
                        full reparation for the lives of the fishermen. The decision of the Cabinet
                        Council at this morning's meeting will be awaited with the most extreme
                        anxiety. The telegrams from Gibraltar and Malta show that everything is
                        being made ready for the terrible eventuality of the outbreak of
                        hostilities. The excuses offered for the outrage by Admiral Rodjestvensky,
                        in command of the Baltic Fleet, and by Prince Keretelli, of the Imperator
                        Alex ander, as given in our telegrams of yesterday and to-day, are utterly
                        unintelligible. The</p>
                    <p>Admiral announces in an interview, published in a Madrid newspaper, that,
                        before leaving Libau, he had declared his intention of attack- ing any ship
                        approaching his fleet. This statement is absurd as no trawler can be con-
                        sidered as coming within the category of a vessel likely to attack the
                        Baltic fleet. Trawl- ers, as a rule, steam at the rate of eight knots an
                        hour at their most rapid speed. When in the immediate neighbourhood of the
                        nets on the North Sea fishing grounds the trawlers are either at anchor or
                        heaving in their cable for trawling purposes. But to an ordinary sea- faring
                        man it is well understood that all ships, when prudent, have to keep clear
                        of trawlers, when either at steam or at sail, owing to the fact that this
                        class of vessels are forced to be either permanently or temporarily at
                        anchor. The allegation of Prince Keretelli, which might be construed to the
                        effect that it was possible to mistake a steam trawler for a torpedo-boat,
                        is ludicrous in the extreme. A steam trawler can no more be mistaken for a
                        torpedo-boat than can a dahabieh be mistaken for a first-class battleship.
                        The contour of these two classes of vessels is utterly dissimilar, for a
                        steam trawler is a broad-bottomed boat with a funnel and lights accordingly,
                        while a torpedo-boat is, as a rule, a wedge shaped vessel, of a most abnor-
                        mal, and consequently easily distinguishable, type. The torpedo-boat lies
                        low in the water, while the trawler floats on the bosom of the ocean. The
                        most ignorant landsmen, whose knowledge of ships is only derived from the
                        illustrated papers, could tell the difference between these two classes of
                        vessels.</p>
                    <p>Another extraordinary statement made by Prince Keretelli is that the trawlers
                        were signalled to state their nationality. He goes on to say that they
                        refused to comply and advanced among the battleships. This is absurd,
                        because a trawler should, whether steam or sail, be well known to any
                        qualified naval or mer- cantile officer. Moreover, it is quite easy to make
                        out the nationality of a trawler by the indications of the fishing grounds.
                        Conse-quently, trawlers do not exhibit signals of nationality, save and
                        except those signals enforced by the Board of Trade. Again, it is not even
                        obligatory, nor is it customary, on a trawler to fly a distinguishing
                        national flag either by day or by night. In fact, no vessel can make known
                        its nationality at night, except, for example, the first-class liners, who
                        have their own private codes of signals for the pur- pose, which are well
                        known to all signal stations. But a trawler has no such facilities because
                        there is never any need for these vessels to make their nationality known
                        either by night or by day, as fishing boats are as a general, rule confined
                        to their own fishing grounds and do not move beyond them. The Prince goes on
                        to declare that the report of a gun was heard, and that thereupon the
                        Russian Admiral ordered his vessels at once to form in line of battle and
                        reply to the fire. This also is ridiculous for trawlers do not carry guns
                        except for use as a signal of distress. The report, which preyed on the
                        excitable nerves of the terrified Russians, may possibly have been the
                        detonation of a discharge of dynamite. Trawl- ers are not permitted to, but
                        sometimes do, make use of dynamite in order to kill fish for a better haul.
                        The trawlers hurl the detonator into the water and an explosion follows, but
                        no naval officer could, under any circumstances, mistake such an action for
                        the discharge of a cannon. Even if we assume that the Russians were so
                        stupid as to make such a childish mistake, why then did they sail away
                        without endeavouring to sink these "torpedo-boats" or save the lives of
                        those on board the vessels they had attacked? We need not, however, attempt
                        to continue our analysis of these excuses, for they are evidently made
                        solely in order to hide a most gross error of judgment, induced by sheer
                        nervousness. But this is no excuse in the case of the commander of a fleet,
                        who should be selected for the post in virtue of the soundness of his
                        judgment. The fact that the Admiral believed that Japanese torpedo vessels
                        were infesting the North Sea, 6,000 miles from the seat of war, shows either
                        that he had not a particle of confidence in his Intelligence Department, or
                        that he has been reduced to such a state of tension owing to the Japanese
                        victories, that he has lost even the remnants of that courage and
                        clear-headedness which seamanship always demands as its primary
                        qualifications.</p>

                            <p>LONDON, October 27. The feeling in England is at fever heat. All
                                parties are absolutely united in insisting upon full reparation.
                                Lord Rosebery and Si H. Campbell Bannerman have publicly, declar ed

                                reaches a certain point on its outward voyage. (Reuter.)</p>
                            <p>ST. PETERSBURG, October 27. Admiral Rodjestvensky's official report
                                has reached here. He says that two torpedo-boats were among the
                                trawlers. The Admiral deplores the loss of life.</p>
                            <p>Negotiations are still proceeding. There is reason to believe that no
                                ultimatum has been presented by Great Britain, who has not gone
                                beyond pressing for a definite reply.</p>
                            <p>The opinion in Russian official circles is that England's impatience
                                is not justified, in view of the difficulty of the circumstances. It
                                is suggested that the explanations of Admiral Rodjestvensky, which
                                have been transmitted to the British Embassy, should form the
                                subject of a joint enquiry. (Reuter.)</p>

                            <p>Admiral Rodjestvensky. has telegraphed, concerning the North Sea
                                incident, that two strange torpedo-boats were amongst the fishing
                                boats. He expresses his regret at the death of the English
                                fishermen.</p>
                            <p>Spain has authorised the Russian vessels to take on 400 tons of coal

                            <p>ST. PETERSBURG, October 28. (Official). Two telegrams have been
                                received from Admiral Rodjestvensky. The first one declares that two
                                torpedo-boats, with no lights showing, attacked the leading vessel
                                of the fleet. The latter then swept the sea with her searchlights,
                                and opened fire, whereupon the presence of several small steamers,
                                resembling fishing vessels, was discovered. The fleet endeavoured to
                                spare the latter, as soon as the torpedo boats disappeared.</p>
                            <p>The Admiral declares that no torpedo-boats accompanied his fleet. One
                                of the strange torpedo-boats was sunk. The other, being only
                                slightly damaged, remained till morning near the small steamers. The
                                fleet did not assist the latter because, in view of their obstinacy
                                in crossing the Russian line, they were suspect- ed of complicity in
                                the attack. Several of the fishing vessels showed no lights, and the
                                re- mainder only put them out very late.</p>
                            <p>The second telegram stated that the fleet met fishing boats to the
                                number of several hundreds, and showed them every considera- tion,
                                except where they were in company with foreign torpedo-boats. The
                                Admiral went on to say "If there were also on the scene of the
                                occurrence fishermen who were imprudently involved in this
                                enterprise, I beg, on behalf of the fleet, to express my sincere
                                regret for the unfortunate victims of circumstances under which no
                                warship could have acted otherwise, even in time of profound peace."

                                perception; 3. Teaching the concrete by object lessons; 4. Teaching
                                the abstract by association of ideas; 5. Teaching the grammar
                                through examples. Every teacher teaches only his own language.

                            <p>OFFICIAL STATEMENT.</p>
                            <p>As an erroneous idea seems to have arisen in some quarters as to the
                                scope and objects of the recently-appointed Railway Commission we
                                are authorised by the Ministry of Finance to make the following
                                statement.</p>
                            <p>It has for some years past become more and more evident that the
                                State Railways were unable to cope with the enormously increased
                                traffic, and that sooner or later it would be imperatively necessary
                                to incur some consider able expenditure in order to put them on s
                                proper footing.</p>
                            <p>Now that the paramount claims of the Irriga tion and other
                                Departments have been in part satisfied, and that the burden of
                                taxation has greatly lightened, it may be hoped that the Government
                                may before long find themselves in a financial position which will
                                justify them in dealing with the Railway question and thereby
                                meeting a universally-admitted want. A Commission, therefore, has
                                been appointed charged with the duty of advising the Govern- ment as
                                to the manner in which money could most usefully be employed in
                                extending and developing the Railway system. Incidentally, they will
                                propose any further reforms which their experience may suggest with
                                a view of increasing the efficiency of the existing orga-

                            <p>How far their recommendations will be put into practice must depend
                                upon the amount of funds at the disposal of the Government.</p>
                            <p>The Commission consists of Lord Farrer, Mr. Oliver Bury, and Major Le
                                Breton, all of whom are railway experts in their different lines of
                                the very first rank. Lord Farrer, we may state, is a director of the
                                Midland Railway Company and of the Underground Electric Railways
                                Company of London, and in his younger days he served an
                                apprenticeship in practical railway work on several of the English
                                lines. Mr. Bury has been general manager of the Great Northern
                                Railway since July, 1902, before which date he was general manager
                                of the Buenos Ayres and Rosario Railway. He began his railway career
                                with the London and South-Western Railway, and has had a varied
                                experience both in England and South America. Major Le Breton has
                                been an inspecting auditor under the Indian Government railway
                                administration. He is already in Cairo engaged in completing his
                                examination of the Railway accounts, a task with which he was
                                entrusted by the President of the Railway Administration in the
                                spring. The other two Commissioners are expected in November, and it
                                is hoped that their recom- mendations will be in the hands of the
                                Govern- ment by the beginning of the new year.</p>

                            <p>CAUSE OF THE CABLE TROUBLE.</p>
                            <p>A correspondent writes:-</p>
                            <p>Some two and a half years ago the Alexandria and Ramleh Railway
                                Company applied to the Egyptian Government for permission to lay a
                                nd high-tension cable from Karmous to Chatby. ere The Government
                                consulted with the Alex- ed dria Municipality and a plan was agreed
                                be upon as to how the cable should be laid er and its depth, as well
                                as the street align- nament which the cable was to follow. The
                                company laid the cable according to these ra-instructions, and the
                                work was duly inspected under M. Principe, and also inspected as by
                                Mr. Graham, the then Administrator of the he Municipality. The work
                                was approved by Mr. res Graham and M. Principe and found to be in m
                                accordance with the instructions of the Muni- ad cipality. About the
                                time the work was finished t. the Municipality decided to relay
                                Menasce- ed road, and in some places, in so doing, reduced m-the
                                level of the road to within ten centimetres ld of the cable. At the
                                beginning of this year the company decided to lay a reserve cable y,
                                from Karmous to Bulkeley so as to do away chwith any possibility of
                                breakdowns or of stoppages. The comparty applied to the</p>
                            <p>Government for permission to lay this extra cable. In April, the
                                company commenced to work from Bulkeley and had completed as far as
                                the cemetery adjoining the Rosetta Gate, when work was stopped by
                                the Municipality because, technically, the formal permission to lay
                                the reserve cable had not been granted. This permission was not
                                given until two months later, and the work d had to be suspended
                                during this time. Surely it would be advisable if the Municipality
                                obviated such mishaps by advising the company as to what roads they
                                were going to take up Four or five times the cable has been found to
                                be broken at places where the Municipality have been digging up the
                                roads. If the control of the Ramleh Railway is to be handed over to
                                the Municipality the poor company is sincerely to be pitied, for it
                                will be far better under the Ministry of the Interior, which has a
                                technical and capable electrical engineer to supervise. Only this
                                week it has been discovered that the road at the back of the German
                                Hospital is to be lowered forty centimetres. Therefore the company
                                forced to relay the cable an extra forty centimetres. Owing to this,
                                a few days ago, when the trenches were open for the purpose of
                                lowering the cable, it was struck by lightning and was burnt to the
                                extent of 150 metres. The Municipality is fully aware of all the 1
                                work that is being done. Why, then, does it not advise the company
                                as to what it intends to do with the different streets through which
                                the cable passes!</p>

                                all-round but for the soprano part, which was somewhat lacking.
