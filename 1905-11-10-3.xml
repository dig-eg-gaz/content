                            Tropoff has resigned. The authorities at Kishineff deliberately
                            organised the rabble against the Jews, giving the troops a pretext for

                            Jews were killed at Kalaraech. Similar stories have been received from
                            other towns of Bessarabia. Soldiers and sailors at Cronstadt joined the
                            workmen in pillaging and bnrning. There was desperate fighting between
                            loyalists and revo- lutionaries, and there are pools of blood in the
                            streets. The inhabitants are fleeing. The war- ships have-been ordered
                            out of the harbour. It is reported that a force of lanoers sent from

                        <p>The following note from Berlin on the reoen rtisle by Mastepha Pasha
                            Kamel appears ii be "Megdebotgiche Zeitaeg.” The italicized portions of
                            the article are printed in large type in the paper :— The principal
                            organ of the Social Democratic arty has onoe more made a great "ado
                            about othing." A Berlin paper has inserted an rtiole by the Anglophobe
                            leader of the inde etadent party in Bgypt Mostapha Kama ’aeha, in whioh
                            he Complains that the Raise Vilhelm, who has of tea shown himself a warm
                            riend of Islam, did not step forward at the ight moment to secure tie
                            independence of Egypt. The Pashoda affair would have been tin ight
                            opportunity to assure himself of Fraud assistance against the English
                            protectorate designs. Mustapha Kamel himself Could have given the reply
                            to his article. Germany has never shown any desire to meddle with other
                            nation's affairs, the has alwyas been content with securing her own
                            interests. Only by the desires have we been led into the Morocco affair,
                            which has new been brought to a pacific conclusion. The Vorwaests need
                            not be afraid that in England the suspicion could arise, that Germany
                            intends to betray England owing to he France-English understanding.
                            Regarding Egypt we received a reliable state ment straight from England
                            to whioh German had no need to make any kind of protest She has never
                            intended to go against English cities, because the good administration
                            wkic iat been established in tki Nile Valley unde he English
                            protectorate is undoubtedly useful to German interests. The difficulties
                            which Ingland encountered in Egypt came mor rom other sources. Certainly
                            the appearance a Mustapha Kamel Pasha is of symptomatic im portance, as
                            was also that of Maharqjih Dhu leep Sing, who caused snob a great
                            sensation by his passionate oomplairfta against Boglam o 188'. The
                            English Press acts always as if danger meuaoed the British Empire onl
                            rom without. But here also is true the of proverb about the skeleton in

                            The new proprietors will shortly have to spend a good deal of money on
                            building stations, as all the existing stations are made of wood and do
                            not fulfil the requirements of a modem station. The new company will
                            also have to lay new rails. Six new engines are urgently required.</p>
