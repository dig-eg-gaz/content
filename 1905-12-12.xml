                    <p>The Liberal Cabinet.</p>
                    <p>Our telegrams from London this morning show that the general impression at
                        home is that Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman has made an excellent choice in
                        his selection of the Cabinet. The making of a Cabinet is a most fascinating
                        occupation for those who are not personally concerned in it. Thousands of
                        "arm-chair politicians" have lately been employing their dearest energies in
                        considering what they would do if they were in the place of Sir Henry
                        Campbell-Bannerman, and in placing their opinions with what eloquence they
                        can muster before their admiring, contumacious, or contemptuous friends. </p>
                    <p>For one man, however, the making of a Cabinet, instead of being a sweet agony
                        of confident toil, is a task beset with difficulties and dangers. That man,
                        we need hardly say, is the Carpenter-in-Chief. For many years he has
                        delighted in the comparatively irresponsible delight of criticising the work
                        of the Government manufacturer. His keen eye has been fixed on the warping
                        of the other's wood, his sharp tongue devoted to pointing out the flaws of
                        his design. The rival has now laid down his tools. "see if you can make a
                        better job of it," he remarks. Thus suddenly faced with the necessity of
                        becoming a Cabinet-maker on his own account, the newcomer can claim
                        momentary sympathy from the fellow-workmen who love him least, and the
                        opponents who watch him with an eye for his misdeeds. </p>
                    <p>Consider what a Cabinet really is. The depository, first of all, of the plans
                        of Government, where are to lie stored the ideals of a party--if it be so
                        fortunate as to possess any--and its favorite recipes for bringing peace and
                        prosperity to the land. So far its construction seems easy enough. But when
                        we remember that many of these ideals and recipes are not shared by the
                        whole party, but have to be recognised as the peculiar possession of one
                        member or one group of members, then we arrive at the second and more
                        troublesome purpose of a Cabinet. The method, that is to say, of rewarding
                        honorable gentlemen for their arduous service during weary days and wearier
                        nights in the place of detention known as the House of Commons. Like the
                        Roman soldiers worn out by long campaigns and eager for higher pay and
                        respite from oppression, they show their scars and ask sternly--or perhaps
                        as roaringly gentle as a sucking dove--for the share of glory they have
                        earned. </p>
                    <p>How to leave niches for the most insistent as well as for those who say
                        little but can do much that is unpleasant in the event of neglect; how to
                        combine this minor necessity with the greater responsibility of leaving
                        ample space for the larger and more practical schemes concerning the
                        legislation and administration of an Empire--these are the problems which
                        have confronted the new Cabinet maker, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, during
                        the past week.</p>
                    <p>For the benefit of the Empire,--it must be hoped that the new Cabinet will be
                        as strong as the maker can make it. The government of the kingdom demands,
                        and should receive, first attention. That is the greatest matter with all of
                        us. In the long run it is the greatest consideration even for the mere party
                        man. No party can be made strong and popular wich places the claims of
                        individuals before the call of patriotism. On the other hand, we are afraid
                        no party can gain a due measure of strength if its leader chooses his
                        Cabinet from the men who are intellectually most competent. But as our

                    <p><placeName>London</placeName>, Monday. Dec. 11.</p>
                    <p>The composition of the new Ministry is generally held in political circles to
                        be a clever one, and especially good for election purposes. The presence of
                        Sir <persName>Edward Grey</persName>, Lord Crewe, and Mr. Haldane will
                        afford security of a programme of moderate and wise reform. Lord Rosebery
                        has been quite isolated. The new Lord Chamberlain will be Earl Spencer's
                        bro-ther, the Rt. Hon. <persName>R. C. Spencer</persName>, who will receive
                        a peerage.</p>
                    <p><placeName>London</placeName>, December 11</p>
                    <p>It is agreed on all sides that Sir <persName>Henry Campbell
                            Bannerman</persName> has enlisted the Cabinet from the strongest members
                        of the party, with the exception of Lord Rosebery. Even Unionists admit that
                        it is good and capable.</p>
                    <p>The Ministers will hold the first meeting of the Cabinet in a few days in
                        order to fix the date of the elections. Mr. Balfour is indisposed. His sleep
                        is troubled by internal pains.</p>

                    <p><placeName>London</placeName>, December 11.</p>
                    <p>Presiding at the Council of the Liberal League, Lord Rosebery congratulated
                        Sir <persName>Henry Campbell-Bannerman</persName> upon having obtained the
                        reward of strenuous hard work. He said that we might now expect financial
                        economy and a strong, dignified foreign policy, and might hope to see an
                        army once more. Nobody outside a lunatic asylum believed that Home Rule
                        would be introduced during the next parliament. It was the duty of the
                        Government to maintain the unity of the Free Trade parly, but they must be
                        entirely independent of the Irish vote.</p>

                    <p>A concert of more than usual interest was given in the Merchant Seamen’s Home
                        on Friday last. The piano secured by the exertions of the Woman’s Guild of
                        St. Andrew’s Church was handed over and used for the first time. The
                        presentation was to have been made by Mrs. Ross, of Gordon House the
                        president of the Guild, but she was prevented from being present by a severe
                        chill. Mr. Ross, however ably represented his wife, and congratulated the
                        Woman’s Guild of the Church of Scotland upon the successful issue of their
                        labours and the handsome appearance of the piano. Turning to the men he said
                        that the ladies in every port had a warm heart towards the sailors, and as
                        this piano would testify, <placeName>Alexandria</placeName> was no exception
                        to the rule ; indeed the Guild of St Andrew’s Church had given a very
                        substantial token of their regard for the sailors frequenting this port
                        Calling upon Miss Swan to hand over the piano, he took the opportunity to
                        express the hope that those who visited the Home would spend many happy
                        nights in company with such a nice instrument. Miss Swan then formally
                        handed over the piano in the name of the guild for use in the Seamen’s Home,
                        and the Rev. <persName>Hugh P. Reid</persName> thanked her for the gift and
                        hoped that there would be no discord but much harmony and enjoyment in the
                        entertainments in which this instrument was to play a prominent part. It was
                        a substantial sign of the church's interest in the men. He thereafter called
                        upon Mrs. Munro to “ hansel ” the piano, which she did with a very sweet
                        solo. The usual concert succeeded, and it proved a most interesting and
                        enjoyable one. An indication of the interest in the occasion was given by
                        the numbers who simply packed the ball, and who expressed their appreciation
                        of the fare provided in no uncertain way. The following ladies and gentlemen
                        kindly gave their services Mrs. Munro, Mrs. Reid, Miss Davies Messrs. Byrne.

                    <p>A vote of thanks to Mrs. Ross, who provided the tea, and to the artistes,

                    <head>SUNDAYS DISTURBANCE. PUBLIC FEELING REASSURED.</head>
                    <p>We are glad to state that there has been no repetition of Sunday's
                        disturbances in <placeName>Alexandria</placeName>, and the state of public
                        feeling is becoming somewhat reassured. Everything tends to show that the
                        riot if it may so be characterised, was a purely spontaneous ebullition of
                        feeling, just as was the Hamamil affair of a few years ago. when the natives
                        made a sudden and great disturbance owing to the murder of an Egyptian
                        policeman by a low-class Italian. If the Greek had not accidentally injured
                        the Arab on Sunday no disturbance would have oocurred. This was the spark
                        which, coming as it did amidst the existing state of apprehension, inflamed
                        the passions of the populace and led to what was really nothing more serious
                        than “a storm in a teacup.”</p>
                    <p>The state of public feeling throughout the city yesterday was still nervous,
                        and last night a number of coffee-houses and tobacconists shops and other
                        establishments, which are usually kept open until a late hour of the night
                        were closed by 10 o'clock.</p>
                    <p>Last night the dangerous quarter of the Hamamil, where the worst part of the
                        distur-bances took place on Sunday afternoon, was patrolled by a large
                        number of police. There was no disturbance.</p>

                        <head>THE PROVINCES.</head>
                        <p><placeName>Cairo</placeName> is reported to be quiet hot we regret to
                            state-that matters in some of the provincial districts are not
                            satisfactory, as the following statement from an Englishman, resident in
                            the Behera province, in the neighbourhood of Damanhour, will prove. This
                            correspondent gives us the following information :—</p>
                        <p>It is most sincerely to be hoped that the authorities will send strict
                            injunctions to the moudirs to warn omdehs to pacify the people. The
                            wildest rumours are current It is currently believed by the natives
                            hereabouts that the Army of Occupation has been withdrawn and they
                            believe that a great uprising is to take place by order of the Saltan.
                            They read or have read to them the exaggerated stories in the Arabic
                            papers which make them believe that the European Powers have had to
                            submit to the Porte solely out of fear of the might of the Saltan. The
                            Macedonian Question is keenly discussed and it is believed that the
                            Sultan has determined once and for all to free the Ottoman Dominions of
                            European interference. A few weeks ago the native villagers always need
                            to salute Europeans here. Now they pass by without so doing and with a
                            scowl. Europeans are continually being insulted, by the native youths,
                            and yesterday, while going from my esbeh to the Delta Light Railway
                            station, the cry against the Christians was raised at me by the village
                            boys. They cried out, "Go on. yon Christians, we will see the matter
                            through.” Their elders stood by and never attempted to correct them.</p>
                        <p>Reports of insults to Europeans are very frequent and I understand some
                            Greeks close to <placeName>Atfeh</placeName> have been murdered. In
                                <placeName>Cairo</placeName> and <placeName>Alexandria</placeName>
                            the Europeans are safe, but in the villages the situation of the
                            Christian population is very bad, for even if the moudirieh authorities
                            had the will they would not have the requisite authority to put down any
                            disturbance. I have noticed of late the significant increase in the
                            amount of arms carried by the Bedouins. Youths belonging to that class
                            of the population have of late began to go about with guns, while all
                            the men are armed. As a matter of fact, I have seen boys about 8 years
                            old with guns. The regulations as to bearing arms are laughed at and
                            anybody can get back his gun from the police for a few piastres, for the
                            police only make use of the rule that nobody but a ghaffir and the owner
                            of an esbeh should be armed, to make a profit out of the inhabitants by
                            seizing their guns for a few days and returning them on the payment of a
                            small sum. The only way to overawe the people is to show them that the
                            Army of Occupation is not a myth, and the G. 0. C. ought to order a
                            route march at once through the villages. That would at least act as a
                            temporary alleviation of the present unfortunate state of feeling.</p>

                        <p>It is commonly believed that there will be another disturbanoe on Sunday
                            next, but this is very improbable, as the police have made numerous
                            arrests among the disorderly elements of the population. On Sunday
                            nearly 200 persons were arrested, and yesterday a similar number.
                            Altogether up to midday to day fully 500 arrests had been made of
                            persons who were known to have been con-cerned in the riot and of others
                            who have used threatening language.</p>

                        <head>PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE.</head>
                        <p>As a precaution to prevent the arming of the populace the Alexandria City
                            Police took measures to close all the shop of the gun smiths and dealers
                            in weapons throughout the city. The demand for arms during the past
                            fortnight has been very great, and both Europeans and natives have been
                            purchasing revolvers, etc., in great numbers, so this step on the part
                            of the police comes somewhat late in the day.</p>
                        <p>The date of the reopening of the gunsmiths’ shops has not yet been
                            determined on, but they may be opened to-morrow if the authorities are
                            sufficiently assured that the panic has subsided.</p>

                        <p>The mildness of the observations of Musta-pha Pasha Kamel in "Al Lewa” is
                            significant as in the judgement of many people it is considered that the
                            articles of our Arabic contemporary have in a great measure contributed
                            to inflame Moslem opinion. After briefly recounting the facts of
                            Sunday’s riot he remarks:-- As regards this (the disturbance) we again
                            request native and foreigners alike to avoid Any quarrel or dispute,
                            because public relations can only improve by mutual harmony. Prudent
                            people should be 'enjoined to urge upon the uneducated classes to
                            abstain from any demonstrations.</p>
                        <p>“Al Moayad” says :-- Our readers will notice that Europeans attach great
                            importance to small incidents that occur in Egypt and that is why any
                            disturbance is called a riot. It is their lack of confidence in the
                            natives that creates this fear in their minds. The Egyptians in general
                            hoped that the Europeans, being in this country, would come to a good
                            understanding with the natives, especially with the Moslems, for the
                            Egyptians are all aware that no happiness or progress can be obtained
                            except by peace and harmony. A party of the Europeans of Egypt, however,
                            do not understand this fact or perhaps do not want to grasp its
                            import.</p>
                        <p>The general impression is that the Government is in a great measure to be
                            blamed for the present state of feeling, because it has allowed "Al
                            Lewa” to excite the populace by fanatical articles, when it would have
                            been a very simple matter to have checked all such abuse of the liberty
                            of the Press.</p>

                    <p>Members of the Alexandria Horticultural Society, and others who care for
                        botanical curiosities and are unaquainted with the grotesque "Beard and
                        Moustache Lily,” should take the present opportunity of inspecting the fine
                        specimen of this plant to be seen in fall flower in the dep6t of Mr.
                        Tramontina in Rosetta-road.</p>
                    <p>It is a tropical, tuberous-rooted, perennial, native of Singapore and the
                        Malay Peninsula, belonging to a small American, Asiatic, and Australian
                        “genua” which has a botanical order all to itself—"Taccacese”—.</p>
                    <p>The name of the plant as given to it by the distinguished botanist Dr.
                        William Jack, of the E. India Co., sixty years ago, is ’Tacca oristata,” but
                        it is, generally, cultivated under the name of “Ataccia oristats ’’ It is
                        easily reproduced from its numerous tubers, like the potato ; but it cannot
                        be successfully cultivated in the open air in the climate of
                        Alexandria."</p>
                    <p>The tubers of a closely allied species— “Tacca pinnatifida”—found all over
                        the old world,tropics, and Polynesia, form an important item of the daily f
                        ood of the inhabitants, like the * Qolcas” in Egypt (known in Polynesia as
                        the “taro’’) ; but the "Tacca” has the advantage of being a valuable
                        medicine in cases' of dysentery and diarrhoea. It is. known to the British
                        in the Fiji islands, where it is largely cultivated as well as indigenous,
                        under the name of ”South Sea arrowroot.”</p>

                    <p>The second representation of Fedora was given last night and proved another
                        triumphant success. Once again we tender to Signa. Bellincioni our warmest
                        congratulations on an altogether perfect performance Her superb ringing,
                        seconded by consummate acting, is beyond praise, and leaves captions
                        discrimination without a leg to stand upon. Such powers can only belong to a
                        rara avis in the operatic world, of which fact none are more aware than the
                        Alexandria audience, who, whilst her most moving passages wore in progress,
                        were enthralled even to maintaining a strict silence; need we say more Sig.
                        Jose Palet was again in good voice, and his interpretation of the role of
                        Loris left nothing to be desired. His singing is very true, his manner
                        sympathetic, and he plays up well to Signa. Bellincioni. Signa. Alice
                        Zeppilli and Sig. Giovanni Polese also-rendered valuable assistance. The
                        orchestration was faithfully and delicately. carried out under Sig.
                        Zuccani’s able baton. However, it is a well known saying that he “who
                        praises" everything praises nothing," and we feel bound to steer clear of
                        such an impeachment by remarking once more on the altogether
                        disproportionate length of the entr’actes Surely it is no difficult matter
                        to shorten these protracted waits end bring the duration at the performance
                        within reasonable limits. In the present state of things, we might almost
                        hazard an opinion, daring as it is, that people here go to the playhouse
                        solely for the purpose of meeting their friends.</p>

                        of Hohenlohe Laugenburg, took place in the Chapel Royal, St. James's Palace,
                        to-day at 12 o'clock. His Majesty the King witnessed the ceremony. The
                        little chapel, with its crimson hangings, was decked with white flowers and
                        palms, and the service was fully choral. Lord William Seymour, the Hon. C.R.
                        Spencer, Mr. Hugo Wemyss, and Mr. Victor Seymour Cochrane acted as ushers.
                        The first member of the Royal Family to arrive was Princess Louise, Duchess
                        of Argyll, and with her came the Duke. Shortly afterwards Her Royal Highness
                        was joined by Princess Christian and Princess Victoria of Schleswiz
                        Holstein. They were followed by Princess Henry of Battenberg and Princess
                        Ena, and then came the Duke and Duchess of Connaught and Princess Patrioia.

                    <p>His Majesty the King drove up to the private entrance to the Chapel in
                        Ambassadors'-court. He was attended by Com. the Hon. Seymour Fortescue, the
                        Hon. Sidney Greville, and Major F. Ponsonby. The King looked in excellent
                        health, and as he walked up the aisle, without the aid of a stick, showed no
                        signs of lameness after his recent accident. He sat during the service in a
                        chair at the top of the centre aisle, near the chancel rails.</p>
                    <p>The bride was given away by her brother, Lt. Colonel Count Gleichen. She wote
                        a dress of white and silver moire antique trimmed with silver embroidery ; a
                        veil of beautiful old Brussels lace hung from the shoulders over the train,
                        and she wore a tulle veil edged with silver over her face. Her ornaments
                        were a diamond brooch, the gift of H.S.H. Princess Victor of Hohenlohe,
                        Langenburg, and an antique diamond cross, the gift of the Hon. Mrs. Machell.
                        She was followed by four children : Miss Lavinia Spencer, Miss Loelia
                        Pnsonby, Master Derrick Heathcoat Amory, and Master Patrick Holme, who were
                        dressed in white satin Vandyck costumes. The little girls carried bunches of
                        lilies of the valley and wore gold chains with emerald drops, the gift of
                        the bridegroom, while his gift to the pages were green jade and diamond
                        links.</p>
                    <p>The ceremony was performed by the Archbishop of Canterbury, assisted by the
                        Chaplain in waiting. Before the entrance of the bride the St. Anne's fugue
                        by Bach was played and as she walked up the aisle the Wagner Chorale "Wachat
                        Ant" was sung. A short but impressive address was given by the Archbishop
                        and during the signing of the register Brahm's anthem "How lovely is thy
                        dwelling place" was sung and the "Meistersinger" march was played as the
                        bride and bridegroom left the chapel. The bridegroom was supported by the
                        Hon. Harold Willoughby as "best man."</p>
                    <p>There was no reception after the wedding as H.S.H. Princess Victor of
                        Hohenlohe Langenburg had held one the previous afternoon in the Armoury, St.
                        James's Palace. Later in the day Mr. and Lady Valda Machell left London for
                        Wollaton Hall, Nottingham, lent by Lord and Lady Middleton, where the
                        honeymoon will be spent. Lady Valda Machell's going away costume was of pale
                        blue cloth with a pale blue moire hat edged with a band of fur and trimmed
                        with an ostrich plume. She also wore a long white cloth coat trimmed with
                        velvet and fur and a Russian sable boa, the gift of Lady Mount Stephen.
                        H.S.H. Princess Victor of Hohenlohe Langenburg wore a gown of amethyst
                        velvet with a bonnet of violets and old lace and a sable boa. Countess
                        Feodora Gleichen wore peach-coloured crepe de chine with a violet velvet hat
                        and a palerina and muff of stone marten. Countess Helena Gleichen wore a
                        white cloth costume with a toque pelerine and muff of cormorant. The Hon.
                        Mrs. Machell wore grey corded silk trimmed with chiffon, velvet and old
                        Brussels lace, and a white chiffon bonnet trimmed with Brussels lace and an
                        ostrich feather.</p>
                    <p>SOME OF THE PRESENTS.</p>

                        hexagonal amethyst in the centre, surrounded by eight pearls, between each
                        of which were set two small diamonds. The gift of the Princess Royal was a

                        given by the Princess Victoria of Wales. From it depended little chains of
                        platinum, studded with pearls, and finished with amethyst drops. The Duke
                        and Duchess of Connaught gave a pair of three-branch silver candelabra of

                <div type="item">
                    <head>HIS EGYPTIAN CAREER.</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian career of Sir Clinton Dawkins is sketched by the "Times" in the
                        following passage in its obituary notice :--</p>
                    <p>In 1895 he was liberated from this doubtful post, and took the appointment of
                        Under Secretary for Finance in Egypt previously held by Sir Alfred Milner
                        and Sir Eldon Gorst. The history of the next three years he himself has
                        written in the appendix to the ninth edition of his friend's book on
                        "England in Egypt." They were years of crisis, and his part in them was
                        brilliantly played. The statistics of revenue and expenditure tell their own
                        story : the former rose from L.E. 10,698,023 in 1895 to L.E. 11,624,000 in
                        1898, and the latter from L.E. 9,637,900 to L.E. 10,248,000, the surplus in
                        the last year being no less than L.E. 1,376,000. It would have been much
                        greater had not a sum of L.E. 1,700,000 been spent in three years on the
                        reconquest of the Sudan and the laying of railways--a permanent asset.
                        Clinton Dawkins was the moving spirit of the Egyptian Treasury at a time
                        when necessary expenditure and international interference were at their
                        highest point. Those were days before the "entente," when French politicians
                        still thought it their highest duty to thwart English arrangements for the
                        wuiet government and the industrial development of Egypt. In spite of them,
                        the Assouan dam was founded, and the powere of barbarism broken at
                        Omdurman.</p>
                    <p>HIS CITY CAREER</p>
                    <p>The following criticism of the City career of Sir Clinton is from the same
                        newspaper :--</p>
                    <p>Dawkins was often in a commanding position in the firm, which, at that
                        moment, was not very popular in the City of London ; and it was therefore
                        rather an unfortunate time for a man hitherto unconnected with the City to
                        enter on his new task. Dawkins, whose work had been chiefly Government
                        finance, in which he showed himself a master, was not altogether successful
                        in adapting himself to the ways and habits of thought which characterise
                        that remarkable body of shrewd and experienced men of business who constitue
                        "the City." Those who knew him best, however, were of opinion that, if his
                        career had not been cut short, he would have succeeded in suiting himself to
                        his environment. He was in no sense responsible for the new policy
                        "combines," especially to the Atlantic Shipping Trust ; but he had much to
                        do with the details of some of them, and he helped to push several schemes
                        for electric traction, and gave evidence as to London railways before a
                        Parliamentary committee in 1901.</p>
                    <p>HIS BREAKDOWN</p>
                    <p>The "Times" remarks :--</p>
                    <p>The career which has thus prematurely closed was one of the most varied and
                        successful of modern times. To have passed from Oxford into the Civil
                        Service, as first on the list, to have been transferred from the India
                        Office to the Treasury and at once promoted to be private secretary to the
                        Chancellor of the Exchequer, to habe thence gone to Peru as manager of the
                        Peruvian Corporation, then to India as Financial Member of Council, then to
                        have been made a partner in the richest of Anglo-American business houses,
                        and to have incidentally acted as chairman of a committee which led directly
                        to the modern reform of the War Office--that a man should have done and been
                        all this by the time he was entering the forties is an astonishing record.
                        Physically strong as Clinton Dawkins used to be, this swift succession of
                        high and responsible posts was too much for him. His heart began to fail a
                        year or two ago. This last spring he had to cease for a time from work ; but
                        his rest at Cadenabbia (where he stayed in company with his close friend
                        Lord Milner) was ruined by bad weather, and, though he rallied for a while
                        during the summer, the recovery was not real. A Parisian doctor seemed to do
                        him good for a time, but the amendment was fallacious and the attempt to
                        return to his work had disastrous results. </p>

                    <head>THE LATE CAPT. MEYRICKE.</head>
                    <p>The funeral of Captain Meyricke, late of the Egyptian Army, took place this
                        day week at Ludlow, Shropshire.</p>
                    <p>The inquest upon the late Captain, who died from the result of injuries
                        received while riding in a steeplechase at Aldershot, was held at the
                        Cambridge Hospital on Saturday week by Mr. W.E. Foster, coroner for North
                        Hants. A brother officer of Captain Meyricke expressed some indignation
                        concerning the distorted and incorrect reports which had appeared in the
                        Press concerning the accident and hoped that publicity would be given to the
                        true facts. The statement that the horse which Captain Meyricke was riding
                        bolted with him into a wood was absolutely without foundation. The evidence
                        showed that he was riding his own horse, Wych Elm, in the Open Military
                        Steeplechase on Wednesday at the Aldershot Autumn Meeting. He was riding
                        last in the field, and on reaching the first fence the horse ridden by
                        Lieutenant Sherrard, R.F.A., immediately in front of him, momentarily
                        hesitated in taking the jump and swerved in the air, with the result that it

                    <head>CORPORATION OF WESTERN EGYPT. REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS</head>
                    <p>The directors present herewith to the Shareholders their Report and Balance
                        Sheet for the period dating from the incorporation of the Company to the
                        30th September, 1905, accompanied by the Auditors' Report in compliance with
                        the requirements of the Companies Act, 1900. The above period is short of a
                        full financial year, but completes and important stage of the Company's
                        operation, and is a convenient date for summarising the position of the
                        Company's affairs, which, as no prospectus has been issued, the Directors
                        consider the Shareholders will desire to have placed before them with as
                        little delay as possible.</p>
                    <p>The task entrusted to the Directors has comprehended the direction of
                        distinct undertakings, namely, the cultivation and the sale of irrigated
                        lands, the boring of wells, the construction of the Railway from the Nile to
                        Khargeh, and the exploitation of the earthy and other minerals of the
                        Western Oases--all these several undertakings being interdependent and
                        contributory to the successful working of the whole.</p>
                    <p>The operations of the Corporation are, in the opinion of the Directors,
                        calculated to prove highly remunerative to Shareholders, by bringing about a
                        state of prosperity, which competent observers of the conditions obtaining
                        in the Western Oasis of Egypt have long recognised as practicable, and which
                        will result in the repeopling of the large areas comprised in the
                        Corporation's Concessions, and render the communities dwelling therein not
                        as at present, merely self-sustaining, but capable of the large production
                        of commodities suitable for exchange with those of Western Europe.</p>
                    <p>While assured of the public utility of their work, and of the beneficial
                        results which must accrue from a policy so conclusive to the prosperity of
                        the Western Oases and the country at large, the Directors are no less
                        assured of the continuance of the benevolent assistance of the Egyptian
                        Government, which hitherto has been extended both spontaneously and upon
                        occasion when it has been invoked.</p>
                    <p>With a view to economy by a judicious and discriminating selection, both of
                        personnel and material, the Chairman and three Directors visited Egypt in
                        the early part of the year to study local conditions and confer with the
                        Government and with the Local Board. As the result of this visit and of
                        subsequent deliberation, they have placed the construction of the
                        Nile--Khargeh Railway under the supervision of Messrs. Kincaid, Waller,
                        Manville and Dawson, Civil Engineers, and have entered into an agreement
                        with Messrs. Lake and Currie for their retention as Consulting Engineers in
                        London in connection with the water-boring operations and the exploitation
                        of the earthy and other minerals of the Oases. They have also appointed as
                        General Manager in Egypt Mr. W.T.C. Beckett, M. Inst., C.E., who has left
                        the service of the Bengal-Nagpur Railway (in the course of his connection
                        with which he had acted in the capacities of Chief Engineer and of General
                        Manager), to take up this appointment, and have placed the operations in the
                        Oases in the immediate charge of Mr. H.J.L. Beaduell, F.G.S., F.R.G.S., an
                        official of ripe experience, intimately acquainted with the Oases, where he
                        has served the Egyptian Government for a term of some nine years. The duties
                        devolving upon Secretary of the Local Board being somewhat more than
                        secretarial, they have selected to fill that post Mr. Edward J. Scott, late
                        District Commissioner and Political Officer in Nigeria, a Colonial official
                        of considerable experience. The Directors are confident that these
                        appointment will favorably commend themselves to the Shareholders. </p>
                    <p>Considerable care has been exercised in the selection of the suboridnate
                        staff, who have been provided with the latst and best equipment. For the
                        working of the American steam drilling plant, experienced drillers have been
                        brought over the United States to supervise each machine ; but the
                        Consulting Engineers report that in succeeding seasons, when extensive
                        boring operations are continued on the tested areas, "one drill foreman will
                        easily control from three to four machines, each machine being run solely by
                        native mechanics and labour," thus reducing the cost of boring. </p>
                    <p>The Egyptian Government determined that at least two-thirds of the Share
                        Capital of the Corporation should be Working Capital ; and that no Shares
                        were to be issued as fully or partly paid up. The balance covers payment for
                        the land grants, railway, mineral and other rights granted by the
                        Government, and the plant, machinery and other benefits existing as the
                        result of the exploratory work effected by several expeditions, and covers
                        also the preliminary and other expenses (exclusive of costs of registration)
                        incidental to the formation of and the providing of Working Capital for the
                        Corporation.</p>
                    <p>The accounts show the Corporation to occupy a strong financial position. The
                        final call of 5s per share, that was due on the 15th June last, was
                        postponed, and will not be called except upon three months' notice. The
                        invested funds of the Corporation are in thirty-four securities, all of
                        which are quoted in the London Stock Exchange Official List and have been
                        taken into the Balance-Sheet at cost, thought the Market price represents a
                        substantial profit. The resources of the Corporation are ample both to build
                        the Railway to Khargeh and to successfully irrigate such large stretches of
                        country as should ensure adequate revenue in the comparatively near
                        future.</p>
                    <p>The Directors will cultivate cloe trading relations with the Oases, since not
                        only will profit accrue from the actual transactions effected, but the
                        produce dealt in will furnish additional carrying traffic for the Railway.
                        Advantage will be taken by opening stores for the supply of the
                        Corporation's employes to ascertain the classes of goods most in demand by
                        the local population. Purchases of dates will be made with a view to placing
                        them upon the London and Continental markets. They are of a very high class
                        and excellent prices (5 P.T. per lb. tin being realised last season) are
                        obtainable in Cairo, where the dates of the Oases, brought thence in the
                        past exclusively by the Bedouin on pack camel, always command a ready
                        market. As the Oases are developed and their populations increase, they will
                        afford and extensive market for British and other European goods, in the
                        handling of which the Corporation will possess peculiar advantages. Special
                        attention will be given to the Cairo market, with a view to meeting such of
                        its requirements as the Oases can supply. </p>
                    <p>During the past season a detailed survey was made of a considerable portion
                        of Central Khargeh, some 400 square kilometres in all being surveyed, the
                        cultivable areas in which are now located and accurately mapped. An
                        examination has also been made of this Oasis to its Northern limits, and to
                        the South as far as Boulac.</p>
                    <p>LAND RIGHTS.</p>
                    <p>In the land rights possessed by the Corporation a primary asset is held
                        which, apart from the prospective value of the earthy and other mineral
                        rights, is capable of returning many times over the capital of the company.
                        The Corporation is entitled during 30 years to take up land not exceeding
                        20,000 feddans per annum, i.e., 600,000 feddans of land in all, with the
                        object of irrigating and selling the same. The large areas of land available
                        in the Khargeh Oasis are composed of a purplish loamy clay and are similar
                        to the ground at present cultivated in that Oasis. On the Gubari Road also,
                        which leads from the Khargeh Oasis to the Dakhla Oasis, there are numerous
                        tracts of very rich loamy land, quite as good as that found in the Nile
                        Valley. The directors anticipate a considerable demand for the newly
                        irrigated land on the completion of the railway, when it is reasonable to
                        suppose that high prices will be realised for land in the vicinity of the
                        line. Land in the Nile Valley has already sold at over £30 per feddan, and a
                        reference to Lord Cromer's last Report will show that prices have still an
                        upward tendency. Consequently no difficulty should be experienced in
                        obtaining say up to £20 per feddan in the neighborhood of the Railway, and
                        up to £10 in more remote districts. The Corporation will make advances to
                        purchasers upon conditions mutually advantageous, as is done by Agricultural
                        Banks. </p>
                    <p>Applications for considerable areas of land have already been received by the
                        Directors, but appreciating the importance of the early sales in their
                        bearing upon those effected subsequently, they have deferred the question
                        pending completion of the first section of the Railway when the maximum
                        prices obtainable can be more approximately ascertained.</p>
                    <p>EARTHY AND OTHER MINERALS.</p>
                    <p>The directors report that the results of investigations made in the Khargeh
                        Oasis have been of a distinctly encouraging character. Aluminous deposits of
                        vast extent have been disclosed, and these are available for the manufacture
                        of aluminium sulphate by a simple process recommended by the Corporation's
                        chemist, which can be undertaken by the natives alone. Numerous tanks are
                        now being constructed for this purpose. A large sample bag of the crude
                        material was forwarded to London and passed intact for the purpose of
                        ascertaining its commercial value to Mr. Bertram Blount, who reported upon
                        it, "the sample consists substantially of aluminium sulphate. It is a
                        valuable material." With the alum deposits, the consulting engineers report
                        that nickel and cobalt are generally found associated and these can be
                        recovered after formation of alum, as a bye-product. In addition to these
                        aluminous deposits phosphates have been located at El Deir in three parallel
                        beds, and have been shown to extend both south and far to the north of that
                        place. A sample taken from one of the beds proved to be auriferous, and
                        further investigations are being made. These phosphates when pulverized will
                        be available for use locally as superphosphates, a matter of considerable
                        future importance when the large areas of land in the vicinity are brought
                        into cultivation. </p>
                    <p>NILE--KHARGEH RAILWAY.</p>
                    <p>The railway concession granted by the Egyptian Government is for a period of
                        seventy years, during which time the company has a monopoly of railway
                        communication between the Valley of the Nile and the Oases. During the first
                        twenty years of this period no other railway can be made within the area
                        served by the line under construction without the Corporation being first
                        offered the right to construct. The Government guarantees interest at the
                        rate of three per cent. per annum on the cost of construction for twenty
                        years, unless in any year the total net profit earned by the Company are
                        sufficient to pay 3 per cent. on the total Share Capital of the Company. The
                        interest is payable out of surplus revenues of the Oases, as defined by the
                        Concession, over a period of twenty-five years. The Corporation has also the
                        right to construct further Railways within the same area, upon application
                        at any time within twenty years. The original intention was to effect a
                        junction with the State Railway at or near Abou Shusha. Advantage, however,
                        was taken of the willingness of the Government to widen the Hod Samhod
                        Embankment for the purpose of carrying the Corporation's line ; and as a
                        necessary sequence to the adoption of this route the actual point of
                        departure from the State Railway is now made from near Abou Tish, a little
                        north of Farshut. The directors have taken all possible steps to ensure the
                        completion of line at an early date. </p>
                    <p>THE WATER SUPPLY.</p>
                    <p>Mr. H.J.L. Beadnell, F.G.S., F.R.G.S., the Corporation's geological expert
                        and manager in the oases contributes a note on the water supply of the
                        Khargeh and Dakhla oases, in which he says that the present output of water
                        from the wells of these oases may be taken as approximately 200,000,000
                        cubic metres per annum. This water is sufficient to irrigate 30,000 acres,
                        the duty being some 6,600 acres per cubic metre per second. The underground
                        artesian supply being practically inexhaustible, the ouput at the surface
                        may be almost indefinitely augmented, provided the wells are sunk in
                        suitable localities and kept sufficiently far apart to avoid any appreciable
                        reduction of the hydrostatic pressure.</p>
                    <p>The Oases lands have one great advantage over those of the Nile Valley in
                        that they are not dependent on the time, volume, and duration of the Nile
                        flood. With proper care and attention the output of wells remains constant,
                        and in several instances wells, sunk thousands of years ago by the Romans
                        and early Egyptians, are still yielding over 500 gallons a minute.</p>

                    <head>EGYPT'S REMARKABLE PROSPERITY.</head>
                    <p>In commenting on the announcement of a penny post to Egypt the "Globe" says
                        :--A welcome announcement is made with reference to the postal service
                        between the United Kingdom and Egypt. Hither on the rate was that applying
                        to all foreing countries, but for some time past it has been felt that the
                        close connection which exists between the Khedivial Government and our own,
                        together with the growth of trade and the development of Egypt as a health
                        resort, rendered it necessary that the high postal charges should be
                        dimished. Accordingly, in a few days, the rate in force will be the same as
                        that whith the colonies and dependencies of the Empire. The progress of
                        Egypt has been continual since the British reluctantly assumed control of
                        affairs, and the contrast between the position there to-day and what it was
                        twenty years ago is marvellous. It is, indeed, a standing testimony to the
                        far-seeing wisdom of our administrators that a land which was still recently
                        bankrupt should now be able to show such satisfactory budgets. A
                        considerable amount of capital is sunk in Egyptian enterprises, and the
                        country may be expected to advance still further from year to year. It will,
                        therefore, be a great advantage to that considerable number of persons who
                        are in communication with Egypt that their correspondence is no longer to be
                        restricted by heavy charges. Mr. Henniker Heaton has shown that a reduction
                        in postage means no loss to the revenue. It is, in fact, rather the contrary
                        ; the greater facilities more than compensate for the smaller profit on
                        individual letters. Almost all the colonies of the Empire have consented to
                        the change, and have found the advantage of it ; and although Egypt is
                        nominally independent, the connection with England is so close that her
                        admission to the Imperial Penny Post naturally forms another link in the
                        chain which unites the two.</p>

                    <p>Our premier shipping company was probably never in a stronger financial
                        position than is displayed in the rport just issued. After having proposed
                        the distribution of 13 per cent. upon the Deferred, or the same as that paid
                        for the four years previous, the directors were able to make a further
                        provision for depreciation of ships of £170,000, in addition to the nominal
                        allowance of £366,040, thus raising the sinking fund for the year to
                        £536,040. This sum represents just over one seventh of the book value of the
                        fleet, which now stands at £2,960,148 in the balance sheet. As the
                        registered tonnage of the ships in service with the attendant steam tugs and
                        tenders, amounts to just over 370,000 tons, it appears that the fleet is
                        valued in the books at only £8 per ton, whilst in actual practice the weight
                        of this capitalisation is reduced still further by the fact that the company
                        possesses reserves amounting to £1,500,000. If these sums were deducted from
                        the book value of the fleet it is brought down to under £4 per ton. These
                        figures are, of course, only the outcome of years of patient saving, and go
                        far to explain why the dividends are so large and well maintained. </p>

                    <head>TO OUR VISITORS.</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe. This
                        depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in January
                        may be a little warmer than Riviera, and possibly not so warm as Sicily, but
                        in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm than many
                        other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in the year,
                        for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest place to
                        go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily. Some will want to take into consideration
                        the number of days to be spent at sea, and we therefore subjoin a list
                        showing the time occupied on each of the various routes between Egypt and
                        the Continent of Europe. </p>
                    <p>They are as follows:--</p>
                    <p>The long sea routes--from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southampton,
                        London or Liverpool--occupy about 14 days. The short ones are as follows
                        :--</p>
                    <p>Port Said or Alexandria to Brindisi : 3 days</p>
                    <p>Alexandria to Messina : 3 days</p>
                    <p>Port Said or Alexandria to Marseilles : 5 days</p>
                    <p>Alexandria to Venice and Trieste : 4 days</p>
                    <p>Alexandria to Naples : 3 days</p>
                    <p>Port Said to Genoa : 5 days</p>
                    <p>Port Said to Naples : 4 days</p>
                    <p>Alexandria to Constantinople : 4 days</p>
                    <p>Alexandria to Piraeus : 2 days</p>
                    <p>Port Said to Gibraltar : 7 days</p>
                    <p>The steamers, of the P. and O. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageries
                        Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines are
                        also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by travellers to
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made without change
                        in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg</p>
                    <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by P. and O.
                        Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste-Vienna
                        express from Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis" to Brindisi. One of these leaves Port
                        Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian mails from
                        the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                    <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                        attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry boats," having
                        been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi.
                        If you are going straight through to England you will find the train waiting
                        at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete
                        arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in
                        London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <head>SICILY</head>
                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMINA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is the
                        station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful,
                        occupying about one hour.In and around the town is much to interest the
                        visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but restored under the Romans.
                        CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of Etna and here also is a fine
                        Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all over
                        the island, are an endless sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting
                        history, having been a Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C.
                        413, and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain - his
                        tomb is to be seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO,
                        with about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                        delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The
                        Palazzo Reale is of S. Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque
                        cloisters. The Cathedral, Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal
                        Park are also worth a visit.</p>

                <div type="item">
                    <head>CENTRAL ITALY</head>
                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                        bay--Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento
                        [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                        City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence itself the churches
                        and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local promenades and
                        excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and
                        fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea
                        level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero,
                        thence by cogwheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks
                        takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; here there is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made, in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                        and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient halfway
                        house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                        and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                    <head>NORTHERN ITALY</head>
                    <p>GENOA (La Superba)--The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                        the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature--warm in winter and deliciously cool
                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn to Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Nilan is
                        SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal springs,
                        change trains at Borgo San Dorino and in half an hour you are at
                        Salsomaggiore.</p>

                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage, or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other seaport.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going nothwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                        lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza.</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot ; then come Tremezzo, Cadenabbia,
                        and Menaggio with the prettily situated town of Bellaggio opposite. The walk
                        from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio is most enjoyable. A
                        steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake Lugano in three quarters
                        of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in two and three quarter hours.</p>

                    <p>Switzerland, the heart of Europe, has been described as "A cluster of

                    <p>LUGANO is some 20 miles from Como and reached by train in one and a half
                        hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated on
                        the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San

                    <p>LOCARNO may be reached by rail from Bellinzona in forty minutes. This pretty
                        town, situated at the top of Lake Maggiore, has a mild climate, and is an
                        excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated above the
                        town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings, "Entombment,"
                        by Ciseri, and "The Flight into Egypt," by Bramantion.</p>

                        from Lucerne by boat, rail, etc. are very numerous.</p>
                    <p>The Lake of Lucerne abounds in delightful excursions, those to the Rigi,
                        Pilatus, Burgenstock and Sonnenberg needing a special visit each. Other
                        excursions on the lake can be made by steamer, and the ever-changing scenery
                        on the trip from Lucerne to Fluelen is a source of delight to the lover of
                        nature.</p>
                    <p>BRUNNEN, charmingly situated on the most beautiful part of the Lake of
                        Lucerne, commands magnificent views of lake and mountain scenery. Along the
                        Lake of Uri from Brunnen to Fluelen runs the famous Axentrasse.</p>
                    <p>A delightful excursion from Lucerne is that to ENGELBERG. Take boat to
                        Stansstad and from Stansstad it is about 1 hour and 40 min. by Electric
                        Railway, with delightful scenery en route. The ascent of Titlis, is made
                        from here, and the panoramic view of the Alps is grand ; extending from
                        Monte Rosa to the Black Forest, and from the Santis to the Matterhosn.</p>

                        avenue of walnut trees the chief resort of visitors. Interlaken is also not
                        far from the famous waterfalls, Giessbach, Trummelbach, and Staubbach. Then
                        also the glaciers of the Grindelwald and view from Murren and the Schynige

                        from Alexandria ; the climate in April is charming. The best steamers are
                        those of he Khedivial Mail Co. and the Russian Steam Navigation Co.</p>
                    <p>If possible tourists should arrange to be in Athens for the Orthodox Easter
                        in order to witness the Good Friday and Easter Eve ceremonies, and to be
                        present at the dancing on the Easter Tuesday festival held at Megara for
                        which a special train is run from Athens.</p>
