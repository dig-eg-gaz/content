                        tastefully furnished homes. It is made in 70 artistic tints, and only
                        requires the addition of water to make it ready for use. It is quickly and
                        easily applied with a whitewash brush, with half the labour and at one third
                        the cost of paint. HALL’S DISTEMPER ensures cleanliness, and is pleasing to
                        the eye. It appeals alike to artistic and practical house decoration.</p>
                    <p>HALL’S DISTEMPER is of special value in hot climates. Owing to its cool,
                        pleasing colours, great weather-resisting and germ-destroying properties, it
                        lends itself to every kind of wall, wood, brick or stone coating, possessing
                        all the advantages of paint, colour- wash, and disinfectant at one third the
                        cost of oil paint. It never blisters in the hottest sun, and the fact that
                        it can be washed adds greatly to its sanitary advantages.</p>

                    <p>In reference to the great rise within the past year or so in the price of
                        land for building purposes near Cairo, in localities that have of late
                        greatly appreciated in public estimation, we may instance that in the
                        neighbourhood of Ghezireh Palace Hotel. No plots heeo can now be had under
                        P.T 3on per square metre. The sites belonging to the Ghezireh Land Company,
                        which purchased three years ago some 81 feddaus in this locality, are
                        selling at from P.T. 62 to P.T. 156 per square metre, the latter price being
                        asked for the more attractive lots bordering on the Nile. The land was
                        divid- ed into 133 lots, of which 65 have already been disposed of. To the
                        south of the above property the War Office owns a small one, whilst between
                        the latter property and the public gardens, in which is situated the grotto,
                        the lands belong to the Government, one side of these lace the road running
                        parallel with the Nile branch or canal, and the other the Ghezireh Palace
                        property, which is also being rapidly built over.</p>

                    <head>THE YEMEN CAMPAIGN.</head>
                    <p>Renter's Agency states that the reinforce- ments for the Yemen have also
                        arrived at Hodeida with the exception of the Malaria Red if (Reserve)
                        Brigade and will, according to the latest advices,ad vance on SanAt by
                        Menakha, while the other will move by Tais. The Otto man authorities wish to
                        recapture Sanaa, lbb,- and the other towns in the possession of the Imam’s
                        forces before treating with the rebels. It may be presumed that their real
                        aim is the complete destruction of the insurgent forces, after which
                        pourparlers will be greatly simplified. Another telegram states that the
                        insurgents are on the march to Mecca and that Faizi Pasha, who has arrived
                        at Hodeida, declares that it is absolutely impossible to stop their advance.
                        It this statement is reliable it point# to an extension of the revolt from
                        the Yemen province to the Azir district, which is inhabit ed by the Beni
                        Kahtan, Beni Thakif, and Beni Otaiba Bedouins. Tais, from which one of the
                        Turkish co- lumns is to start, is close to the frontier of the Aden
                        protectorate and about 70 miles from the coast Menakha, which it about the
                        same distance from Hodeida, is only 40 miles from Sanaa, but an army
                        advancing to the recapture of the headquarters of the Vllth Army Corps will
                        be obliged to fight its way across a formidable mountain range whose highest
                        peaks are over 7,000 feet above sea level.</p>

                    <head>1SMAILIA.</head>
                    <p>Last year, with the view of encouraging owners of vessels, after discharging
                        coal at Port Raid, to load at Ismailia, and to prevent, if possible, the
                        complete decadence of the latter town, which is practically owned by the
                        Baez Canal Company, the latter adopted a very wise measure to try and
                        counteract the injury to the place brought about by the opening of the new
                        through line from Cairo to Port Baud The measure was that such vessels
                        should pay only the very reduced tax of 2 frs. 60 c. per registered ton for
                        the double journey from Port Said to Ismailia and back, instead of the usual
                        rate of 4 francs each way, the through rate from end to end, i.e., From Port
                        Said to Suez, or vice versa, being now 2 Ir 5o c. per ton. The advantage to
                        exporters from the districts near, like Zagazig, Tantah, and even Benha, was
                        great, since ship- pers from Ismalia economise the heavy railway freigbt
                        from the latter station to Port Said, which is more than the very moderate
                        charge ot 2 fr. 60c. fixed by the Canal Company. The company furthermore
                        proposed,should the experiment prove remunerative, to construct moles and
                        jetties for the accommodation of vessels, and do all it could to facilitate
                        loading operations. From what we hear, it does not seem that the result so
                        far has come up to expectations, and the town appears to be languishing for
                        want of some enterprise that will stimulate its gradually dying trade, which
                        was however never of much account The decision taken two years back by the
                        P. and O. and other large com panies to embark and disembark their local
                        passengers at Port Said instead of Ismailia, as formerly, was another nail
                        in the latter's coffin, for we hear that tho management of Shepheard's
                        Hotel, who rented formerly the Hotel Victoria at Ismailia from Mr. Marini,
                        the proprietor, has decided not to renew the lease of ten years which has
                        just expired.</p>

                    <head>COLONEL MARCHAND</head>
                    <p>Colonel Marc recently contributed to the "Matin" an important and most
                        interesting account of the origin of the Fashoda expedi- tion. It was on
                        Nov. 16, 1895, that M. Ber- thelot, Minister of Foreign Affairs, signed and
                        approved of his plan for French intervention in the Bahr el-Ghazal and on
                        the Nila The scheme, however, lay dormant until the follow- ing spring, when
                        the Sudan expedition was announced by England. The attitude of the French
                        Government changed immediately. M. Guioysso, the Minister of tho Colonies,
                        im- plored the writer to start as soon as possible, and if he had obeyed he
                        would have left within forty eight hours, vompletely unpre- pared for a
                        journey over 10,000 kilometres of country. M. Barthelot, who bad so for-
                        gotton himself as to) tell Lord Salisbury that he declined all
                        responsibility for the consequences to which the Sudan expedi- tion might
                        lead, quitted the Quai d'Orsay a few days after he had used such peculiar
                        language, and as M. Leon Bourgeois, the Pre- sident of the Council, could
                        not find anyone to succeed him he took his place. About the first thing that
                        M. Bourgeois did was to send for Colonel Marchand, preparations for whose
                        journey were then hurried on. This was in March, 1896, and a few weeks later
                        the Bourgeois Ministry fell, and was replaced by the Meline Cabinet, with M.
                        Hanotaux at the Ministry of Foreign A Hairs. M. Andrfi Lebon, the new
                        Minister of the Colonic-, was not so generous in the matter of resources as
                        M. Bourgeois would have been, but the writer was again enjoined to start as
                        soon as he could. The first convoy sailed from Bordeaux on April 25, the
                        others being transported in the steamers that followed. Colonel Marchand
                        himself left Marseilles on June 25, 1896, at which date the troops which
                        were to accom- pany him across Africa for the occupation of Fashoda, if they
                        arrived there before the British army, were completing their movement from
                        Timbuctoo on Dakar and on Libreville, in the French Congo. The writer says
                        that his officers and his own companions in the expedi- tion were not aware
                        of its destination until eighteen months afterwards, when they were in the
                        very heart of Central Africa. It has often been affirmed that M. Delcasse
                        had something to do with the organisation of the Fashoda expedition. Colonel
                        Marchand, how- ever, terminates his instructive explanation with the
                        following emphatic words which close "M. Deloasec, whom I hardly knew, and
                        who from February, 1895, to July, 1898, had no share in the Government-the
                        very reverse, indeed, was the case—had nothing, absolutely nothing, to do
                        with the consideration, the pre paration, and the execution of an expedition
                        of which he only became informed to pot an end to it in October, 1898. All
                        that has been said contrary to this affirmation, which 1 make on my honor,
                        and which is based on history itself, which can easily be examined, is only
                        e tale, which 1 wish now to demolish with one blow, as 1 think that the time
                        has come for me to do so." Thus does Colonel Marchand dispose of one of the
                        charges brought against the late Minister of Foreign Affairs, which was to
                        the effect that, although be had been an active promoter of the Fashoda
                        expedition, he deserted Colonel Marchand when England adopted a resolute
                        attitude. Colonel Marchand's explanation has created quite a sensation in
                        political circles.</p>

                    <p>During a performance at Minieh of an Arabic drama bearing the thrilling title
                        of Love and Revenge, by Sheikh Salema Hegazi and his company, a dentist
                        suddenly rose from bis seat and rushed upon one of the occupants of a box
                        with drawn dagger. The victim of the dentist's onslaught shouted for help,
                        and the police, aided by the cooler-headed spectators, disarmed and arrested
                        his assailant. An Arabic contemporary states that the dentist, whom we will
                        call Mr. X, had been very intimate with Y, the individual whom be attempted
                        to stab. The two lived in the same house, and X eventually was trustful
                        enough to leave his wife in Y’s charge while paying a visit to his old borne
                        in Syria. The dentist returned in due course and found neither his wife nor
                        the furniture. The ingenious Y had informed X's father and mother in- law
                        that he had fled the country owing to debts caused by the extravagance of
                        his wife. They promptly sold the furniture and took B their daughter away
                        with them. Y then brought in other lodgers, whom he considered more
                        profitable acquaintances than the luckless X. whose resentment at the brutal
                        practical joke played upon him was, no doubt, too violently expressed, but
                        can easily be unders- tood.</p>

                    <p>(From our Correspondent). Nicosia, June 22. Several storm* have been reported
                        daring the last few day* as having occnrred in various parts of the Island.
                        Yesterday it was learnt that a portion of the road leading to Mt Troo- dos
                        had been rendered impassable to traffic owing to debris that had been washed
                        down by heavy rains. Unfortunately this road will have to be much used this
                        week, in consequence of the departure today of his Excellency and the
                        Secretariat for the summer quartan on Troodos. The summer season may now be
                        said to bare commenced, and will probably continue, as usual until about the

                    <p>A public garden has been laid out at Limas sol this winter. This was a pet
                        scheme of the late High Commissioner, Sir William p. Haynes-Smith, and is
                        likely to add largely to the attraction* of that town. . It it gradually

                        the residents. The Government Nursery Garden adjoins it, where a number of
                        plants are raised and can easily be transplanted. There is also a Govern-
                        ment Nursery Garden at Larnaca, and both a nursery end an experimental
                        garden at Nico- sia. Forest end trait trees in large nursery are raised in

                        pots, which are sold to the public at very low cost. Grafts and buds are

                        encourage tree planting and the cultivation of good kinds of fruit Similar

                    to the Marioat steppe at the end o' April. There was the same burnt grass and
                    grey boulders, but if the ground was les stony on the data it was far more rocky
                    o the slopes of the low hills which we passed from time to time. On the west the
                    hill cou:: try of Edom was marked by low rounded summits. Eastward stretched
                    immonso open plains that gavo the same impression of spa ciousness as the
                    Arabian desert soon from the Canal near el Kantara or from tho railway at
                    Zeitoun. The foreground was yellow brown, relieved by t>c visional grey patches
                    anj dotted with the dark green desert scrub, tho background was an almost
                    uniform fawa co- lour which deepened to a dull red wheu the sun began to set. As

                    lino was a ‘perfect and absolute blank.' There were hills, it is true, but their

                <p>At night fell wo began to enter close, brokon oountry, full of low stoay hills
                    covered with boulders and withered grass, and aoimod by dry wadis near which tho
                    vegetation was still fairly fresh. The comments of a London daily on the good
                    that the Hodja* line will do by "opening np ths country to trade" recurred to me
                    just then and I felt that the writer of the article I had >n mind oonld nover
                    have seen this part of the world, which looked incapable of supporting any
                    indnstry but the raising of an inferior breed of goats. There were pockets among
                    these low hills where I expected to see signs of a rain crop, but either the
                    soil was bad or the Bedouins did not tronblo to sow barley a* thoir cousins do
                    in the Marioat district. At about 7 p.m. 1 opened a tin of meat, which, by the
                    way, disagreed with me mightily, and was rather annoyed at the in- tense
                    cariosity shown by the occupants of the carriage, who believed—so 1 afterwards
                    learnt from the guard,—that 1 was eating pork. After all I bad no reason for my
                    annoyance. Do not snme Englishmen wbo have, not left their island still hold
                    that the Frenchman subsists on salads, frogs, and snails, and does not the
                    nntravelled Haul ascribe an unchanging diet of "pellel" and "biftock" to the
                    carnivorous Saxon ? Still 1 felt inclined to make a diversion and having a big
                    of lemons and some soda water 1 stood lemon squash to the occupants of my end of
                    the carriage, who seemed highly satisfied therewith and always thanked me most
                    po'itely. After my meal I tried to sleep ou my boards and a conch made of a
                    greatcoat and a rug but the carriage required a thorough disiDfeotion and insect
                    powders were poworlres, all the wingless and irritant species being well ropre

                    ou terrific 1 tourists with the aid of 1 the venal dragoman. The arrival of the
                    Circas- 1 sians has changed all this, though I gather 1 that the Tcherkeia can
                    be a more expert and 1 redoubtable highwayman than the most piotu- 1 the air by

                    I 1 walked about ths Amman station and the | steep bill above it for some time,
                    bat the grouud was full of holes, and the attentions 1 received from the dogs of
                    the placo were so I persistent that I returned to tho oarriage and 1 triod to

                    had broken a window in trying to shut it and was being reviled by tho guard. Wo
                    were far less crowded on this part of the journey—Hamdulillah I —so that, the
                    atmosphere produced by the closing of all the unbroken windows and tho nse of
                    quantities of tobacco was jost boarablo. 1 awoke ot about 3 am. feeling very
                    aoro and unhappy and found the train running tbrongh a steppe which was a littlo
                    yellowor bat otherwise an exact replica of the oountry whioh wo had paasod
                    between Dents and Amman. At about 6 a.m. we passed a caravan (lying two Osmanli

                    women and children and a soldier riding slowly on a bay Arab. From the camels to
                    the children ovary member of the caravan seemed to be walking in his sleep. Tho

                    Mr. Ben- nett Burleigh writes to the "Daily Telegraph" on the subject of rifle
                    shooting "I have seen most of the fighting in Egypt and tho Sudan between the
                    years 1882 and 1898. Indifferent as was the shooting of onr soldiers in those
                    days, it was their great supe- riority in marksmanship overtbatof the enemy that
                    won ns so many victories withbutahandful of troops. We ought to have been eaten
                    np or drivon into the sea more than onoe, say as at El Magfar, Hassassip, and
                    Tamai. The Marine*, by their steady fire discipline, had much to do with saving
                    the situation at all three of these actions ; and at the surprise at Hassassin
                    lock, the 60th Rifles, who deployed to the front at the ‘ double’’ out ol camp,
                    instantly checked the further advance of Arabi Pasha’s horse and foot. They were
                    pounded with Krupp cannon- shells, but the riflemen never budged, except to
                    creep nearer to the foe. Wheu the machine- guns were temporarily lost at Tamai,
                    Genera' Sir Gerald Graham ro formed Davis's broken brigade, uot in square but in
                    line, and order- ed them forward to recover the groond and the battery. That
                    day, at Colonel Tuson’s (of the Marines,! request, 1 acted for the nonoe as gal-
                    loper. Firing steadily as they advanced, stage by stage, the Dervish Fcny-Wuizy,
                    who is the finest fighting-man the world over after his methods, was slain in
                    heaps, and driven from the guns across the nullah, or khon. It is the lead
                    rather than the steel that piles np the butcher's bill in ail modern wars. If
                    the Der- vishes had pat more trust in their Remington rifles, what a different
                    story there wonld have boon to tell of £udan warfare ! la their, famous charge
                    at Omddrmtn, the 21st Lanoers inflicted relatively little hurt upon the enomy,
                    until, Wheeling to the left, they dismounted and opened fire with their
                    carbines. It was then that the Dervishes decamped out of the nnllah. Our
                    casualties at Abu Kra came from tho good shooting of a few of the Mahdi's black
                    Kordofan hunters. General Stewart, 8t. L*g*r, Cameron, and others being killed

                    in the neck, and it was only by poshing forward and oocnpying a knoll, from
                    which we oonld get at these deadly marksmen, that farther loss was avert- ed and
                    the situation saved. We had with ns not a few excellent rifle-shots, including
                    ser- geants in the Berkshire and other regiments who ware in the m mated

                    psny of the Oases. We have rooeiitly met an Egyptian engineer whb has resided
                    nearly SO’ years in Australia and was. engaged‘m gold digging and other mining
                    in that oOuntry. He has sinoe been seat by gold'mining companies to Um Rns and
                    elsewhere to superintend Egyptian miners and teach them their srortr in those
                    mines and has been sent by the Oases Company into the oases to prospect for
                    mine1 rals there and remained there three months till he became fully acquainted
                    with what was going on. His name it Shimi Bat ran. We askod him what ho saw
                    there, and he replied,1 "So far as search for mines, which was an important part
                    of my work^ is oonoorned, I saw many traces of old workings which may some day
                    be again profitable. I was down 147 fret in one old shaft ahd fotnid affjofti-'
                    ing it, 100 yards asJa^i traces of connect- ing workings, bat was' obliged to
                    give up for the time owing to the heat and sand after digging about 12 feet into
                    it. "I found, however, many andentalmn work- ings white and rose colour and all
                    colours in veins up to 18 incites thick. I marked the various beds by flags. I
                    found a bod of (coal) lignite at about 16 to 20 foot deep, 3 to 6 inches thick,
                    and 1 sunk below it to 85 feet hopiog for another vein, and I am of opinion that
                    it Is absolutely necessary to make farther search before anyone can fay whether
                    there is or is not plenty of coal there; also proper prospecting should bo done
                    for gold. Four or five prospectors should be sent ont through all the oases, for
                    there is certain to be plenty of valuablo minerals." We asked him about the
                    land, and he said the soil was liko that of Nile Islands. He himself saw north
                    of Um Dabadib a vast tract of land with tracos of houses and trees showing that
                    it had boon cultivated, and had no doubt that if cnltivutod again it wonld be
                    equal to any land in Egypt. "Also ^heikb Mnstapha Hanadi, Omdeh of Khorgoh, told
                    me that cotton would grow there as well as in Egypt, and all the land, once
                    water is brought to it, produces as well as the best -land in Egypt, and thought
                    the oases land jost as the land in Egypt."</p>
                <p>And we asked him whether there was water enough and he said that every proof
                    exists and every experiment that had been tried shows that there is plenty of
                    underground water. And the water rise* in artesian wells, and all the
                    cultivation is done by them. The oompany sank an artesian well between Khargeh
                    and the Deir, and another well in the Derr, and the water is flowing from both
                    day and night and the laud around is being cultivated. "I dug S’x wells
                    (ordinary) between Khargeh and the Deir and Mehriq and in moit of them found
                    sweet water, some at 4 metres and sOme at 6 metres. Each well c let about 300
                    piastres to sink and the oases water is generally as sweet as the Nile, in fact
                    I think there is plenty of sweet svater in the oases, and an enormous extent of
                    land can be cultivated by boring iells."</p>
                <p>We asked if there were many inhabitants in the oases. He answered, "They are not
                    many and they do not pay proper attention to their cultivation, being lary and
                    indolent. When I returned to the Nile Valley I met many people of Upper Egypt
                    who said they wished to go and take op lands in the oases if the railway went
                    there."</p>
                <p>We asked about the railway, and be said : "All I know is that the company means
                    to make one and is going about it, and it is poiitively certain that oine tho
                    railway goes the oases will thrive and prosper exceedingly, but without the

                <p>This fact' lends absorbing interest to the history ol a poor Scottish boy who was
                    recent- ly treated’ in the Glasgow Children’s Hospital. He had had scarlet

                    spine'began to be deformed : it had curvature and there were abscesses, for
                    which he sras operated upon by the very ablest surgeons- the same men who would

                    He oould hardly eat, and only walkod with great difficulty. "If you only knew
                    what he suffered from the pain in his back," said his father, "and how the
                    abscesses seemed to be sapping the fife out of him, you srould not wonder I am
                    thankful to see him so well to-day. It is all due to Dr. William*’ pink pills

                    that I grew alarmod. But I gave her Dr. Williams' pinlr pills, and she soon

                    <p>In principle war indemnities may be regard- ed as "the coAts ol the action" ;
                        in practice they are apt to become confounded with the object ot the
                        quarrel. This was emphatically m tlie case of the ransom extorted from K-
                        'ine by the Gauls after the battle of the Allia ,,,330 B.' When Brennos
                        tlsng bis sword and shield into the scales and cried, "Vn- victia," be
                        atbnned a principle which is pro Kibly as ancient as human uature, and which
                        has been tairly steadily maintained ever since. The amount of a war
                        indemnity often depends iiite as much upon the auxiety of the van , ashed to
                        escape further homiliation as upon ;Le victor's precise bill of expenses,
                        tin the , ther haud, the sum is frequently reduced tlirough the sheer and
                        manifest inability of the crushed combatant to pay the price of his own
                        overthrow. Indeed, it is almost impossible to find an example in which some
                        disturbing factor does tot interfere with the precise operation of the
                        general law. Napoleon, for instance, cost Great Britain alonp the greater
                        part of £831,000,000 before he was finally suppressed at Waterloo , but
                        under the TREATY OF PARIS (1815). France paid only ........ £28,000,000 to
                        England, Pmssia, and Rnssia together. In the impoverished condition of Lonis
                        XVIII.'s dominions, however, it »as thonght advisable to spread even this
                        comparatively modest reimbursement over a period of five years, and it was
                        divider! into fifteen instalments of £1,.110,000 each, one of which fell due
                        every four months. Coming to more recent times, we find in 1^71 what is
                        always regarded as the supreme exaiup’e of a war indemnity. Under the TREATY
                        op FRANKFORT, 1871, France paid a ransom of . . £200,000,000. In demanding
                        this colossal sum Bismarck had in bis mind two distinct intentions; They
                        were to replenish Germany's emptied war chest and by crippling her
                        antagonist financially to pre- vent her from reviving to a condition in
                        which she could have renewed boAilities before time bad soothed her wounded
                        pride and assuaged the desire for "la revanche." That the latter purpose
                        might more completely be fulfilled, payment in cash, and over a very short
                        period, was imposed. The first instalment was £20,000,000, and it was
                        provided by the stipu- lations of the treaty that it should be banded over
                        one month after the French Government had obtained possession of Paris from
                        the Commune. A further £40,000,000 was to be liquidated before the end ot
                        the year, £20,00o,imore on May 1, 1872, and the balanoo of £1801000,000 on
                        May 2, 1874. Moreover," interest at the rate of 5 per oent had to be paid
                        until tho money had actaally changed hands. The manner in which France
                        discharged this enormons debt is one of the most remarkable displays of the
                        latent wealth of a nation to be found in history. To the astonishment of the
                        whole world, the entire £2u0,O00,OO0 was placed at the disposal of the
                        conqueror six months before the expiry of the prescribed term.</p>
                    <p>Another large indemnity of recent times was that exacted by Rnssia from
                        Tnrkey in 1878, aftet the Tsar’s armies had fought their way to the gates of
                        Constantinople. The terms agreed to at San Stefano underwent consider- able
                        modification at the subsequent Interna- tional Congress, bat under the
                        TREATY OP BERLIN, Turkey undertook to pay..£32,000,000. It was stipulated,
                        however, that the Otto- man Government, never a very prompt settler of
                        accounts, should be allowed a long period of years in which to find the
                        money. Some of it is still owing. Japan has a precedent of her own in this
                        matter, an indemnity having form- ed an important feature in the fruits of
                        her triumph over China in 1895. The amount demanded was considerably
                        increased after the intervention of Russia, Germany, and France had deprived
                        the victorious islanders of the Liao-tung peninsula and the fortress of Port
                        Arthur. Under the eventual TREATY OP 8HIMONOSBKI, China paid 200,000,000
                        taels. This woald beequivalent toabout£26,000,000 in English currency.
                        Turkey was very anxious to obtain a substantial indemnity from Greeoe in
                        1897, but a financial commission appointed by the Powers reported that the
                        defeated bel- ligerent oould not arfford to satisfy the Otto man demand, and
                        £4,000,000 was in'theend fixed upon as the outside limit of the pecuniary
                        compensation in this case. At the conclusion of hostilities between the
                        United States and Spain was seen the nnosual spectacle of the victor paying
                        an indemnity, as a kind of sb change in return for territorial concessions
                        that seemed rather more than the circumstances of he case required.</p>

                    <p>As printed, this list is calcnUted in some respects to produce a slightly
                        wrong impres- sion of the status of the various lines. Por example, the Hall
                        Line and the City Line are both owned by the Ellerman Lines, Limited, and if
                        these two totals were added together, as they Bhonld properly be, that
                        oompany would rank third on the list, as against the total tonnage of any
                        other—British or foreign—and teoond if compared with British lines only.
                        This mast be regarded as a highly satisfactory rooord for a combination
                        which has been in existence only about four years. Of the list as a whole,
                        it may be said that it is most credit- able to British shipowners, and shows
                        very clearly their greatly preponderating share in the business of the

                        the Prench Colonial Service aud Director of the Nigor-Konakiy Railway, made
                        the following observations on his visit to the Upper Nile, Uganda, and
                        British E. Africa.</p>
                    <p>"Haviog been kindly supplied with letters commendatory by M. Dolcassc, I
                        visited Egypt, and at Cairo wi s received by Lord Cromer and Lord E-lwaid
                        Cecil, Agent General for the Sudan at Cairo, to both of whom I am most
                        grateful—as, indeed, to the British officials everywhere--for many
                        kindnesses.After having inspected the Egyptian railways with the aid of M.
                        Barois, the French administrator of Egyptian railways, I was able to see the
                        Assouan dam, thanks to Sir William Gantin. It is magnifioent; a groat work.
                        At Wady- Halfa I inspected the workshops of the Sudan Government Railways,
                        through the kindness of Captain Midwinter, the assistant manager of the
                        line. A railway U being Uid from Atbara to Sheikh Bxrgut, now called Bandar
                        Sndan, and fifty mile* of the work had already been completed. At Khartoum,
                        in the Sirdar's absence, 1 »oi received by Colonel Henry. Khartoum looks
                        well. It is astonishing how much has been done in so short a time. It U said
                        that the country between KassaU and Khartoum and the banks of the Blue Nile
                        is exceedingly rich and good ooontry. I left Khartoum by steamer for
                        Gondokoro. There are four steamers at work clearing the sudd, a work which
                        is indispensable for the navigation of the White Nile. After visiting Lado
                        and Gondokoro I was provided by Mr. Spire, Col- lector of Gondokoro, with
                        forty carriers, and traveled tho Uganda Protectorate on foot, visiting the
                        posts ot Nimnle, Wadelai, and Bulraba (on Lake Albert Nyanza), Hoima and
                        Kampala, and finally Entebbe, on the shores of the Victoria Nyanza, the main
                        town of Uganda. 1 saw on this part of my journey very many buffalo,
                        elephants, harts boost, oribes, waterbneks, and some baheoiceps of Schwein-
                        furth. At Entebbe 1 was the guest of Mr. Wilson, the Acting Commissioner of
                        the Uganda Protectorate.</p>
                    <p>UGANDA PROSPECTS. "I found the ooontry looking very well and prosperous. The
                        people are chiefly oatives, but there arc also Indian traders and a few
                        Euro- peans. The natives are peaceable, a fine race physically, and not very
                        difficult to govern. I think it is a wise policy to have built the Uganda
                        railway, and that several other lines should be bnilt rather than money be
                        spent on outting new roads, inasmuch as horses and mules die, and the
                        country is too wet for oamels. Prom Butraba to Entebbe the climate is
                        perfect, and I think the country is van suitable for Europeans. It is the
                        land of the elephant. Thera is much trade in ivory, and they have good hopes
                        for rubber. I believe it would pay the country to build two railways, the
                        first trom Gondokoro to Nimule, 100 miles, and the other from Butraba to
                        Entebbe, 200 miles. There is a sufficiency of good native labour, and the
                        oost would not be great, if the management were intelligent. 1 left Entebbe
                        and crossed the Viotoria lake by the steamer • Winifred," oalling at Jinja,
                        where I saw the Ripon Palls, that is, the beginning of the Nile, At Kisomu
                        (Port Florence) I took the Uganda railway, and stopped at Nairobi, where I
                        had the pleasure of meeting the general manager of the line, Mr. Currie, to
                        the excellence of whose direction I wish to testify. The line is well bnilt
                        I believe, ss 1 have said, that fur* ther railway construction in Uganda is
                        necess sary, and that when Uganda is folly develop* ed, both it and the East
                        African Protectorate will be successful colonies. The climate of the East
                        African Protectorate is admirably suited to Europeans. It is astonishing to
                        see ante- lopes, giraffes, zebras, gazelles, ostriches, and more
                        occasionally lions and rhinoceroses along the line. Leaving Nairobi I
                        reached Mombasa, where I crossed Lord Milner, who had oome from Durban, and
                        was inspecting the Uganda railway.</p>
                    <p>THE COST OF AN ARTIFICIAL SEA. EGYPT EXPLORATION PUND. In seeking for a
                        reservoir for the supply of Egypt during the dry season, it is not to be
                        wondered at .that the reconstruction of the ancient Lake of Moeris should
                        have been care- 1 fully considered. As, however, in the bed of tho lake is a
                        fertile province, with a cultiv- able area of 400,000 acres and a value of
                        80,000,000/., its construction on its original site is oat of the question ;
                        but there exists a tmailer depression in the Libyan hills immediately to the
                        sooth, to which no suoh objections apply. This depression is' known ss the
                        Wady Rayan ; and Mr. Cope Whitehouse, the disooveror of Lake Moeris, ' has
                        for yean insisted that in taming theWady . Rayan into an artificial lake or
                        reservoir lay the true solution of the problem of Egypt's ! water supply. In
                        area at a level of 29 metres j above that of the sea would be about 700
                        square kilometres, or 270 square miles When full, its greatest depth would
                        be 70 metres, though only the upper 4 or 5 metres would bo used annually,
                        giving a possible supply cf some 3 milliards of oubio metres out of a total
                        contents of 20 milliards. Mr. Cope Whitehouse maintains that the entire work
                        necessary can ho done at a oost of 600,000/ He has offered many times to
                        undertake the contract for the work on the basis of this estimate, or to
                        carry it oat as a private speculation, subject to equit- able terms of
                        purchase by the Egyptian Go- vernment when oompleted. It is unpleasant to
                        know that these offers have been rejected again and again ; not because of
                        any engineer- ing reasons, but that the Government preferred to leave a
                        great part of Egypt trows tored until they possessed the inclination and
                        money to do the work themselves. However, whether it is to cost 600,000/. or
                        2,600,000/., the estimate of Sir W. Willoocks, the outlay will bring an
                        enonnons and immediate return, and the names of those who have assisted in
                        bringing it to completion will deserve remembrance among the greatest
                        benefactors of Egypt. ("Engineering.")</p>
                    <p>A PIGMY TRIP. The pigmies who have temporarily exchang- ed Darkest Africa for
                        Dampest England had their first motor ride yesterday, says Monday week's
                        "Pall Mall Gazette," bat there seems to be no means of obtaining a
                        satisfactory state- ment of their impressions. Their only remark on the trip
                        was, "Umgari," which is supposed, we are told, to be Pigmyeae for "good."
                        But it seems just as likely to be the equivalent of the "No pusbee, no
                        pollee, go like bailee," which is the first rooord ed sooonnt by a Chinese
                        descriptive reporter ot an electric tramway. The majority of the party spent
                        the journey in slumber, bat the yoangest made np for this stolidity by
                        tasting the lubricating oil and emptying the remainder over the vehicle,
                        after which be overhauled the machinery to inch purpose that the homeward
                        trip was completed m a cab. Understanding that they were to traverse the del
                        ole te mileage of the Brighton road, the distinguished tourists were allowed
                        to wear their full equipment of spears and arrows, but, as there were no
                        signs of the Marquis of Queensberry being on the warpath, the expedition was
                        fortunate enough to return scatheless.</p>

                        suspended by mutunl consent, he has during the past nine yean not only

                        IN THE WEST INDIES.</p>
                    <p>Evidence of the confidence that is felt in the fntnre of ootton growing in
                        the West Indies is afforded by the announcement in the "Agricultural News,"
                        the official organ of the Agricultural Department of the West Indies, that
                        it is proposed, in view of the progress made in oonoeotion with the Sea
                        Island ootton industry in the West Indies, to ereot a small plant at
                        Barbados for sx tree ting and refining the oil to be obtained from the seed.
                        The project is receiving the support of the British Cotton Growing
                        Association. The establish- ment is expected to be ready to begin opera-
                        tions early next year, and it will be the first Ootton oil factory to be
                        orected in the British West Indies. As to its immediate outlook, it is
                        estimated that the total crop of Sea Island ootton for the current season
                        will be about 8,000 bale*, which will probably yield some 1,660 tons oi
                        seed. The yield of crude oil is about 45 gallons per ton of reed, so that if
                        the whole of the seed were available for the factory the ontpat of erode oil
                        woald be eboat 74,900 gallons.</p>
