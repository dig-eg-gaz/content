                        The opening of a new harbonr at Genoa, or rather the completion of its fine
                        system of docks and tarbours, is not calculated to re-assure those who see
                        with a disquieting eye the Italian port gradually euoroaohing upon the
                        interna* tional traffic of the Mediterranean seaports. At one time
                        Marseilles had it practioally all her own way, that is to say, Marseilles
                        had the traffic without any trouble. Nature had given her certain advantages
                        which, with a little exertion on the part of her oititans, were sufficient
                        to \m*ke her a flourishing seaport. But as time went on Qenoa commenced to
                        pat in a claim for a portion of the com- merce, which up till then had
                        arrived and de- parted from the Mediterranean via Marseilles as a matter of
                        oourse. Then Socialism began to make its pernicious effects felt at the
                        French port, the Municipality became absorbed in local politios, and the

                        the "comrades’' at Qenoa, What is the result ? Simply that to-day, while
                        Marseilles is losing the pre-eminent position she onoe held, Qenoa is making
                        gigantio progress. At one time Marseilles as a commercial seaport was in
                        advance of Hamburg, Antwerp, and Botterdam. To-day she has let those ports
                        get ahead of her. She is still in front of Qenoa, bat how long will that be
                        true 1 From the last statistics published we learn that the annual "move-
                        ment" at the port of Marseilles shows a total tonnage received and
                        dispatched of 8,636,000, against 6,630,000 tons for Qenoa, Bat whereas
                        Marseilles remains stationary; or is losing ground, Qenoa is advancing by
                        leaps and bounds. When Marseilles pro- gresses one point Qenoa goes ahead
                        five. Daring the past fourteen years the increase of traffic at Marseilles
                        has been at the rate of 136 per cent, at Qenoa it has been 630 per cent.
                        Suoh a course can only end one wav: in the ultimate defeat of Iffwiii— There
                        are certain geographical reasons for the amaz- ing growth of Qenoa, whioh in
                        justice to Marseilles one must not lose sight of. The piercing of Mont Cenia
                        quintupled Genoa’s traffic in five years, and the opening of the Simplon
                        Tunnel will immediately transfer two or three hundred thousand tons of mer-
                        chandise from Marseilles to the Italian port. But if the powers that be at
                        Marseilles were to sit down calmly and consider the situ- ation, if they
                        were to exolude from their cal- culations everything but the oommeroial in-
                        terest of the port, if they were to put on one side their miserable quarrels
                        and their looal jealousies, it would not be too late to adopt an energetio
                        policy of intelligent enterprise, whioh woald once more ensure to Mar-
                        seilles the position and the predominance to whioh her natural advantages
                        entitle her. CALENDAR OF THE WEEK. (Coptic andldokamtdan.) Nov. 8un. 6. The

                    <p>The Grand Cadi of Egypt has wired to his household in Cairo, informing them
                        that he has arrived at Constantinople in safety. It is said, declares “Al
                        Moayad,” that the Grand Cadi promised his family before his departure that,
                        if no troubles were in store for him in the Capital,he would let them have
                        each a telegram. Although the Saltan's summons to the Cadi is still a
                        mystery,continues “A1 Moayad,” the romoor to the effect that he had been
                        called to Stamboul in order to go into the question of the Caliphate, in
                        other words, the question of the succession to the Ottoman Throne is quite
                        baseless. The Cadi of Egypt has nothing to do with such a question so long
                        as the Sheikh-ul-Islam and the other Ulema of high standing reside in
                        Constantinople. If the Sultan wishes the succession to pass to the sons
                        instead of to the eldest Prince he matteresn be settled at once by a single

                    <p>From the latest returns of the Statistical Department in Cairo we find that
                        the total number of births in that city during the week ending 28th Ootober
                        was 563, including 7 of foreign parentage; this being equal to a rate of 47
                        per thousand of the estimated population. For the week ended last Saturday
                        the births were 527, of which 9 were of foreign parentage, the rate being
                        44.3 per mile. The deaths for the first week under review numbered 411,
                        inoluding 24 of foreign nationality; this is equivalent to a rate of 32.7
                        per thousand for the native and 35.4 for the European portion of the inha-
                        bitants. For the week ending the 4th instant the deaths were 402, which
                        included 16 foreig- ners, and the ratios 33.0 and 23.0 per mile for the
                        native and foreign portions respec- tively. At Alexandria the births for the
                        first week were 295, which was inclusive of 15 children of foreign
                        parentage, the rate per thousand being 46.0. Last week there was registered
                        329 births, of which 17 were of the latter category. During the week ending
                        the 28th ult. the mortality returns were 202 natives and 12 foreigners and
                        the ratios 33.2 and 13.5 per thousand. For the week ending on Saturday last
                        the figures were 207 natives and 18 Euro- peans, the rates being 34.4 and
                        20.3 per mile respectively. For the guidance of those of our readers who are
                        interested in statistics, we may men- tion that according to the official
                        table recently published the native population of Cairo and its suburbs was
                        estimated on the 1st July last at 615,152. No exact esti- mate can, however,
                        be made of the foreign resident inhabitants of either Cairo or Alex- andria,
                        as no returns are obtainable from the Consulates. The last census of June
                        1897 gave the foreign element at 25,219 and 46,118 for each of the above
                        cities respectively but, of course, these figures must have been
                        considerably augmented since then by im- migration and excess of births over
                        deaths. The same tables give the estimated number of the native population
                        of Alexandria on the date above mentioned as 316.639.</p>

                        devastated. I presume that nothing will be done to remedy this deplorable
                        state of things until the palatial residence of some Municipal Councillor or
                        of one of the Kbedivial Princes is completely gutted. Then, and not till
                        then, will pressure be brought to bear on the Alexandria Water Company.
                        Meanwhile, all the inhabitants of Ramleh must go to bed every night with the
                        apprehension that if their home does gat on fire, all they can do is to
                        watch it burn—Truly yurs, A Ramlehite. Balkeley, 7th November.</p>

                    <head>CAIRO STREET PERILS.</head>
                    <p>Dear Sir,—I was recently told the following story by a friend, which I repeat
                        in the hope that those to whom we vaguely refer as “the proper authorities”
                        will read, mark, and learn. My informant was walking slowly one after- noon
                        along one of Cairo’s streets—and by no means its meanest—and found time to
                        pause for an instant and admire the demeanour of two Arabs who were walking
                        along the pavement hand in hand cleanly dressed, silent—for a wonder—and
                        their faces illumined with an abject and ruatio happiness which was worth
                        going miles to see. Suddenly a loud gargling noise came from overhead, and
                        from a spout that project- ed apparently aimlessly from a third story a jet
                        of soapy water descended on the pair. They first exhibited a wild surprise
                        and then in- dulged for a couple of minutes in excusable, if unrestrained,
                        profanity, after which they wiped their garments and moved on, still
                        cursing, amid demonstrations of amused sym- pathy from the passers-by. Now,
                        Sir, I like a harlequinade as much as any man—the spectacle of a policeman
                        falling through a trap door or coming in contact with a red hot poker has
                        always and will always please me. There is a strenuous humour ia the
                        oartoons of eighteenth century caricaturist that also appeals to me, and the
                        decent of a tub-full of soap suds on an immaculately dressed passer-by has
                        been immortalised by their pencils. But I frankly admit that I dslike
                        practical jokes when they are directed against me ; my motto is flat ex-
                        perimentum in corpore vili, and I now make a detour whenever I notice one of
                        these projecting spouts which, I hear, carry away the overflow of baths and
                        washhouses. If our city authori- ties can do something to prevent their
                        being need in this way they will earn the gratitude of many besides.

                    <head>THE SUCRERIES CRASH. M. Poutrel v. Hon. A.J Davey</head>
                    <p>On Monday the action brought by M. Poutret against the Hon. A.J. Davey came
                        before the Cairo Mizel Tribunal the hearing wu put back to the role special.
                        M. Poutrel claims one franc damages costs and the in- sertion of the verdict
                        in three Egyptian and three French newspapers, on the ground that the Hon.
                        A. J. Davey dismissed him unjus- tifiably from the service of the Suceries
                        Company on the charge of having kept him in ignorance of the Say operations,
                        and that there is no foundation whatever for the charge. Tbe plaintiff's
                        assignation contains an elaborate summary of the reasons go to prove his own
                        innocence in the matter. We extract the* following passages from the
                        assignation:-- Attendu que par lettre du 29 septembre 1905, le sieur Davey a
                        licencie le sieur Poutrol du service de la Societe des Sucraries. Attendu
                        que les motifs mis en avant par Davey consistent en des imputations de plu-
                        sieurs faite ayant tous eu pour but an dire de Davey, de le tenir lui Davey
                        dans l'ignorance de operations Say (io)... Attendu que si ion comprend tres
                        bien I'in- teret que pent avoir. Davey dane les ciroons- tances sotuelles a
                        se faire considerdere comme etant reste dans lignorance deadites opera-
                        tions, il est impossible pourtant qu'il cherche a faire cela an detriment
                        d’un employe dont la eonduito a toojours e e absolument correcte, et a se
                        constituer ainsi les elemnts d’un “alibi moral” preventif. Or attendu que
                        Poutrel ne pouvalt avoir I’idee de tenir Davey dans l'gnorances de ces
                        operations (acceptions on antres) par la rai- son toute simple qu’il ne
                        pouvait venir a l'ide de personne que Davey put les ignore. Attendu quo pour
                        supposer que Davey les ignonorait, il aurait tallu supposer ches ledit Davey
                        une dose d’ingenuite equivalant a l'in- conscience. Attendu en effet que ces
                        operations out toutes e e passeces regulierement en comptabi- . lite et
                        figurent en toutes lettres ettons chiffres dans les livres de la societe.
                        Attendu, en consequence qu'a moins de ne pas saior lire ou de ne pas vouloir
                        voir, toute pereonne jetont les yeux sur les livres (et Davey avait ce
                        pouvoir et ce devoir) etait ne- cessairement mis au courant des dites opera-
                        tions. Attendu que dans ces conditions, suppose Davey non au courant des
                        acceptations Say, ce serait admettre ohez lui ou bien la desertion abeolue
                        de son devoir et la meconnaissanbe eotiere de son mandat, ou bien une
                        attitude speciale a la plus invetere et a la plus son- pable des ignorances.
                        Attendu qne bien loin de vouloir cacher a quiconque ces operations Say, que
                        Davey repudie maintenant, cest Pontrel lui-meme qui, entre en fonetions, a
                        donne personnel- lement des ordres pour que ces operations, tenues
                        jurqualora en dehors de la compta- bilite se ent desormais passees
                        reguliere- ment et integralement dans la comptabilite generale. Attendu
                        qu'ainsi passees integralament ces operations ni rien de ce quis’y rap-
                        portait ne ponvait etre cache qu’il fant done pour pretendre avoir ete tanu
                        dans l’ignorance et recourir a de si pauvres pre- textes faire appal aux
                        ressources fertiles d’une imagination complaisante plutot quiaux saines
                        lumieires de la raison. Attendu d’ailleurs que Davey est reste siul
                        administrateur present en Egypte en l'ete 1903, (le requerant etant aussi
                        absent a cette epoque); que dans ces conditions personne n’etant la pour lui
                        maintenir de force le bandeau sur les yeux, il eat impes- sible que Davey
                        u'ait pas ete mis par M, Boinet, son securiaire particulier, choisi per
                        lui-meme et charge depouillement de la correspindance sinon au courant da
                        moine aur la piste de ces operations qu'il ignorait et core apres 5 ans
                        passes par lui a la Di- rection de la societe. Attendu que dans le courrant
                        de la presente. annes, dans une instance engages contre la Societe, il a ete
                        depose par le sieur Talbot, l'adversaire de la societe, un memoire dont les
                        echos meme affaibliset aisent encore assez suggestifs. Que ce meme memoire a
                        sans doute ete au moins parcouro par l’avocat de la Societe, pui que ledit
                        ayocayat a demande dans ses con- clusions qu’il ful ecarle des debata comme
                        iejurieux (sic), a certainement ete communique par cet avocat aux
                        administrateura delegues (dont M. Davey) a moins que de ce chef encore ce
                        dernier n'accuse l'honorable Me Carton de l'avoir lui aussi maintenu dans
                        son etat d'ignorance chronique. Attendu done que Poutrol ne pouvant meme pas
                        soupenner que Davey put ignorer les ope- rations Say, il a'envuit qu’il
                        n’alien pa faire pour eotretenir une ignorance qui, a ses yeux, n’existant
                        pas. Attendu que dans ces conditions le licen- ciement dont Poutrol a ete
                        victime est aussi arbitraire qu’injustice. Attendu que ce
                        licenciement,injuriex pour Poutrel, est deriicA k raisra durir^buioea ' nn
