                        <p>
                           Great battle, whioh has been raging for
                            the last few days, is going in favor of the
                            Japanese, and a Reuter's telegram, despatched
                            from Niu yesteroday, declares that the                           i are burning the station and stores at
                            Mukden preparatory to retreating. Mukden
                            falls into the hands of the Japanese, it will be
                            the crowning defeat of thirteen months of un-
                            broken disaster, and Will render the task of suing
                            for terms of one of a nondurable humiliation.
                            A single transitory gleam of victory on the
                            Russianeagles would restore the national self-
                            respect. In well-informed circles in Paris, it
                            is believed that any suooess, however inde-
                            cisive, on  the part of Kuropatkin would pave
                            the way to peace. However, the latest news
                            from the front seems to show that such a con-
                            summation is a long way off. The oonfused re-
                            port reach us indicate that anotber Russian 
                            defeat is in progress, and that the Russian flank	
                            is in serious danger of being turned, if, indeed,
                            that hasnot already taken place. There is
                          nothing which indicates that the Russians
                            have reversed, or are  likely to reverse, their
                            proved inferiority in the field. They lost heavi-
                            ly in the murderous battles of September and
                            October last and we have no reneon to sup-
                            pose that thereinforcements which have reach-
                           ed them are better in quality than tbe men
                            whose place they supply. Indeed, the Russian<cb/>
                            Army, numbers apart is a less formidable
                            fighting machine than when Kuropatkin first
                            took the field. The lamentable dissensions
                            which followed the last battle make it diffi-

Many of the Russian positions ares so strongly

St. Petersburg, March 4</p><p>
General Kuropatkin reports tie loss of part
of the Gaotuling defences on the 3rd inst. The
attack continued all yesterday. The fighting
on the left flank was generally of a most
severe and desperate character. The Japanese
attacks were again repulsed. In some places
the enemy made ramparts with their own dead. 
Over 20. Japanese battalions were yesterday
repuised at Kandolisan terrible losses.   (Reuter.)

The right arm reaches a point east of Fushu

</p>
<p>
The train which left Cairo last night at 6.15
and should have arrived here at 11 p.m., did not
arrive until a quarter to six this morning. The
delay was due to the strong wind and heavy
sandstorm which was sweeping across the line.
The train was detained at Ismailia for four hours
as it was thought dangerous for it to continue
in face of such a storm. Much delay is also
anticipated again this evening, as although the
storm abated daring the day, it is raging now
with renewed force.

GROUNDING OF S S. “CAIRO.”
</head>
<head>RUBATTINO STEAMER
IN DANGEROUS POSITION.
</head>
<head>RESCUE OF PASSENGERS </head>
<p>
The Florio-Rubattino Company'jS. 8. “Cairo,"
which was due at Alexandria from Italy at
8 am. yesterday, was not signalled until 7.80
p.m. yesterday. At 8.10^p.m; the vessel entered
the Boghaz Pass steaming quite slowly. Daring
her passage through the pass she twice stopped
her machines and when she arrived near the
red lighthouse, she again, stopped. At length
she made a sadden tarn and appeared to
be trying to go back to sea through the
Boghaz. For some minutes she steamed in this
direction, and then stopped short suddenly at
9.10 p.m., having run on a bank or a rook. Her
right side is under water, her bow facing
N. W. The point where she has struck, is
known as the Agame shoal.
</p>
<p>
When the steamer struck,the first officer
went pff in a small boat and informed the port
authorities of the disaster. No tug was able
to get near the vessel’ during the night
owing to the high sea running, and the passen-
gers and crew were only taken off this morning
at 7.15. Some of the passengers were up to the
ire breast in water when taken off, as the waves
on beat against the vessel with terrific force,
rolling her terribly, and it is considered
extraordinary that no lives were lost. The
mails and cargo have not yet been recovered,
and nothing can be done until the weather
gets better. If the sea continues high nothing
will be saved.
</p>
<p>
The “Cairo” had encountered very bad
weather since leaving Messina. Captain De
Marchi states that he came to the pass ex-
pecting to find a pilot, but after looking about
for one in vain, he was trying to get to sea
again, when the vessel struck.
</p>
<p>
An enquiry has been opened at the Italian
Consulate.
</p>
<p>
The great Italian actor Novelli was on board,
and he and his company have lost all their
baggage.
</p>
<p>
There were about 100 passengers on board.
</p>
<p>
The following is an eye-witness’s account —
I happened be at Mex last night, and
between 8.30 and 9 o’clock I saw a steamer’s
lights in a very unusual position close to the
coast. Soon after the vessel fired off several
rockets, and continued to do so until past 
midnight. At 10.30 o’clock I noticed the 
lights of the Port tug going out to the wreck,
but apparently she could not get very close. A
heavy sea was running and the steamer rolled
heavily. From the portion of the fights one
could see that there was a heavy list, which
apparently got worse and worse. At about
11.30 I thought that all was over, for she rolled
right over and the fights disappeared. But
she righted herself later and the lights again
came into view. At about 5.30 a.m. the
position of the boat was clearly discernible.
Four tugs were around her, taking off passen-
gers, and at 7 a.m. the togs left the wreck,
which seemed to be sinking - fast by the stern,
and steamed towards the harbour. The wreck
is half-way between Mex and Dekheleh and
the steamer to all appearances was a mile out,
of her ‘course when she struck.

CAIRO SOLDIERS' CLUB.
</head>
<p>
A most successful smoking concert was
given in the above club last Friday evening, a
large amount of talent being discovered
amongst the new members, while that of the
older members was as enjoyable as ever.
Among the new members, the songs given by
Sergt. Malyon, R.A.M.C.,Corpl.Royle, M.M.P.,
and Sapper Newton, R.E,, were extremely
well rendered, While that of Mr. George
Holmes, amongst the older members of the
club, was given in his usual delightful manner. 
</p>
<p>
During the interval, the prizes tor the bil-
liard handicaps were presented by Major-
General Slade, C.B, who gave to each recipient
a few well-chosen words of praise and encourage-
ment. In acknowledging a vote of thanks
proposed by Capt. Bayley), the General spoke 
a very feeling manner, referring to his early
departure from the command and from the
Service, in which he had spent forty-four years.
He advised the men not to leave the Service,
but to persevere and go on in a straight line
doing their duty, which he assured them would
bring a prosperous and happy time.
</p>
<p>
The General’s remarks were receiverd with
hearty and prolonged cheering, the whole of
the audience rising spontaneously and singing
“For he's a jolly good fellow," the cheering
being continued as the General took his 
departure.	
</p>
<p>
All ranks feel the less of General Slade, who
at all times has taken a keen interest, not only
in the Soldiers' Club, but in they of every one
under his command.

NOTES FROM SUAKIN.
</head>
<head>
THE SIRDAR’S VISIT.
</head>
<head>
(From Our Correspondent).
</head>
<p>
Suakin, February 24.
</p>
<p>
The weather here during the past few
months has been very odd, but there has been
no rain worth mentioning.
</p>
<p>
Great preparations are being made here for the
reception of H. E. the Sirdar and Governor-
General of the Sudan, Sir R. Wingate Pasha,
who is expected here about the first week
in March. Several Government buildings will
be decorated for the occasion and triumphal
arches are being erected at several places
through which his Excellency will pass in
making his entry into Suakin. Inspector
Bailey, Suakin Railways, has been entrusted
with the erection of a new railway platform
150 feet long opposite the Shata Gate, where
his Excellency will alight from the train and
then ride to Government House.
</p>
<p>
The Sirdar will come overland vii Athara
to Railheed and from Railhead by special
train to Suakin, so that his Excellency will
be enabled to inspect the new line. The
Suakin Cosmopolitan Orchestra are preparing
a special entertainment to be given during
the Sirdar’s short stay here, and it is
hoped his Excellency will honor this
entertainment with his presence. It is feared
that Sir Rudolph von Slatin Pasha, Ins-
pector-General of the Sudan, will not be
able to accompany the Sirdar to Suakin, as
he has only just toft Khartoum for Kordo-
fan on a very important mission.
</p>
<p>
Mr. George Urquhart, bridge contractor,
Suakin-Atbara Railways, has just completed,
the erection of the first bridge of 105' span at
Nambok station. The 2nd, 3rd and 4th bridges
to be erected at Sallom station are also well
advanced. These bridges are also of 105' span
each.
</p>
<p>
El Minim Macauley Bey, R.E., Director,
Sudan Rail ways, went by special train on the
20th inst. as far as Railhead, which is now by
Komobsana, and made a general inspection of
all the stations and work on the lines. He re-
turned to Snakin on the 23rd inst.
</p>
<p>
The Khedivial mail steamer “Gharbieh”
arrived here from Suez on the 23rd inst. and
landed Mr. Guido Corbetta, the contractor of
the National Bank of Egypt and the Quaran-
tine Camp, at Suakin. He has come in connec-
tion with some important contracts for Suakin
Barghoot Port. Several workmen also arrived
by the "Gharbieh” for the Suakin-Atbara
Railways.
</p>
<p>
The Khedivial mail steamer “Mahallah”
arrived from Suez on the 11th inst, having on
board Miralai Howard Bey, Moudir of Suakin,
also Messrs. Pearlman and Howe, both of them
formerly in the employ of the Behera Land
Company. Mr. Pearlman has been appointed
Assistant District Traffic Manager, and Mr.
owe Inspector of Bridge work, Suakin-
Atbara Railways. Mr. Howe is well known at
Sidi-Gaber, Alexandria.
</p>
<p>	
Captain Brooke-Smith, of the Sudan Govern-
ent steamer ‘ Mukhbir,” has been transferred
to the Sudan Government steamer “Tyra,” to
to alter the pearl fishing around Suakin.
The "Tyra” left Suakin on the 13th inst. for
the purpose of supervising the pearl fisheries
and returned here on the 18th inst.
</p>
<p>
Those unlucky condensers again ! Mr. May-
lor, the erecting engineer of the Suakin Rail-
way condensers, has been in hospital with
blood poisoning, but is now completely cured,
and hopes to have the condenser ready for
trial in a week or so. The old condensers, which
were saved from the wreck of the S.S. "Afghan-
istan,” have now been taken over by the
Suakin Railway from the insurance agents,
and are being thoroughly overhauled. They
will be erected either here or at Sheikh Bar
ghoot, but most probably at Suakin, as a 
second condenser here is necessary to provide
against an accident, or the need of repairs to
the one already erected.
</p>
<p>
The Suakin International Club have remov-
1 to another building, formerly occupied by
the branch of the National Bank of Egypt
The honorary president is Mr. G. C. Kerr,
Deputy Inspector, Suakin Moudirieh, and its
members now number over 30. The new club
contains a large billiard-room, reading-room,
concert-hall with piano, etc., a splendid bar,
gymnasium etc.

diphtheria. The funeral took place

It is desirable to' separate tirely the inwards from the outwards goods, l to increa'O the sired accommodation lor -.sang with outwards good', it will probably 1 e loiind most convenient to use the old pas-, -muon exclusively for the outward Mods to Cairo and l pper Egypt, andtoeu- iose sotue of the existing open sheds ou the • wn side of the yard for the remainder of the i .twards tridlic. ‘lire inwards tralhc is dealt ' with at several dilierent places in a somewhat M.m-cd and expensive manner. This work should be concentrated and etlorts marie to mload the wagons moie rapidly and avoid any unnecessary detention. In this connection it is suggested that the whole of the unloading oi the wagons in these yards be done by contract or piecework, so that the men employed may be distinctly interested m liberating tiie wagons. As 4» hours' free storage has to l-e allowed for the cotton ami cotton seed ■■••riving from the interior, an economy miglrt effected d sullicicnt storage room were ided on which to deposit the tonuuge d to 4s hours' jnward cotton and cotton tralhc.
                    </p><p> A visit was paid to the gravitation -idtngs recently completed at great cost, ver one million cubic metres of earth having befcn usecLJn their construction.
                    </p><p>As those sidings have only just come into ■,se, it is too early to judge of their working. it was noticed that uoue of the wagons were provided with brakes but that a shoe or slipper was used to control them when descending the grades.
                    </p><p>Considering the heavy wagons now employed all over the system, it would probably be wise to tit gradually a suitable hand brake to all wagou stock. Judging by the number in the repairing shop with their ends broken, the working at the gravitation .'tilings will be very expensive unless brakes l-e fitted.
                    </p><p>Wagons were not being sorted for stations but only for districts, and it would be a H-rcnt improvement if the trains before leaviug these sidings were made up in such a luanuer as to avoid, as far as possible, sorting and remurshalling when they arrive at the various junctions. This is the object of the second "grid” w hich has not yet been brought into tt'c. but may require re arrangement lor such >se.
                    </p><p>e sidings and connections at the Gabbary i department, and the Hues leading to ’ort were carefully examined. They should direiy remodelled, and it is necessary a complete and carefully thought-out plan and scheme should be made. The plan 'hould be designed with a view to future extensions.	)
                    </p><p>Considering that over two million tons of traffic pass through these yards per annum, und Laving regard to the enormous increase u the trade of the Port of Alexandria, it is desirable that money be spent on the sidings close to' the Port, and it will be found neces- •ary to construct some additional lines under the masonry road bridge which passes over >he goods sidings between the Port and the old passenger station.
                    </p><p>It may be quite possible, that for all the improvements required, the expenditure will approach the sum of L.E. 100,000.

To meet with one of these in a day’s journey is to lose many auhouriusoekinga ford through the deep’silt from one crumbling bonk to another, aud to endure no mean discomfort stripped urtder a noonday suu for the benefit of moi-quitocs. Only too rarely will y,ou obtain passage in tbo log boat ol a marsbmau, descended from some outlawed reiugee, who spends his days in fishing and his nights prone under a beehive of reeds and mud, which might have sheltered a lake dweller of the Neolithic age. Heliodorus mentions boats ‘rudely hewed out of the rough tree’ which crept about the channels, and ou his excursions from Alexandria about the year 400, he probably saw scenes little diflerent from those which offer themselves in the fenland in the present year of grace.

                        That I was able in tu,. 'ong run to visit every spot to which 1 had a mind, In a country where the obvious road is usually the least possible, 1 owed mainly to the guides, horses, mules -even steam launches—put at my disposal by the ijocieta Anonyme du Behera. The j advent of this great co'poration is the modern ] event of most importance in these wilds. With a seat in Alexandria, a Board composed of most of the nationalities represented iu that polyglot city, a British managing director, formerly in high place in the Egyptian Department of Public Works, and a stall'of young Britons, Frenchmen, Italians, Greeks, Copts, Armenians, Jews, and what not, this company is achieving the recouquest of the marsh land, I and '’every year the smoke of its traction-1 engines rises nearer the lagoons. Its work is 1 worth the notice of every geographer interested I in the niodification ol the world's surface by I man, aud the approval of everyone concerned I with the ecouomic development of weaker races through the capital and enterprise of the I stronger. The Society began where the local magnates of Ivafres-Sheikh anil Belkas, once called ‘Little Kings of Bcrari,' had been forced to leave off, in despair of the sourness and I saturation of the soils.
                        </p><p>A GREAT WORK.</p><p>
                        </p><p>The larger canals and drains had been cut I and embanked through the oozo by Govern rnent labour; but the Society had to construct I the lesser, and, that done, to attack certain I of the nearer and higher-lying lands with great I harrows, which tear and distribute the soapy hummocks, and with steam-ploughs, which open the surface to the drying wind and suu. I Washed with sweet Nile water, the slime was found capable ol bearing rice and barley for I one year or two, aud, purged by such crops, would send up here aud there clover in the I third season, and even a remunerative yield of I cotton. Presently the local husbandmen living I in villages to southward were induced to I take leases, aud ere long to buy. whilo I the steam-engines moved ou into the marsh. I In ten- years the company has built three great model farms and many smaller ones ; J levelled and restored to cultivation thousands and thousands of acres ; abolished a I third of all the marsh in Berari, and caused I population to return to a region where, a generation ago, the lone Coptic Convent of the Apparition of Uur Lady to St. Guemiana was I the last outpost of man. Moreover, native laud-1 owners have now learned something of the I society’s methods, aud far out hi the swamps I many a farm-oasis has been called iuto being I where till lately all was salt and ooze and sand. RECLAMATION.
                        </p><p>The process of reclamation is a rapid one, designed to secure a quick return, and the land I is made rather a possible than a very sound sod, for there is little fall and the draining is hardly more than superficial Bat so much amelioration is enough for the native hnsband- inen, and it seems as much as, in a phrase of economics, the 'local traffic will bear.’ Not because it was designed to that end,nor because it is prosecuted with any but a strictly com-1 mercial purpose, to make cent, per cent for I shareholders, this sort of reclamation does, I indeed, effect more for local civilisation than I any Western enterprise with which I am familiar in the Nearer East By its knowledge I and capital this Bclilra Society raises large tracts of land out of a desolation in I which small agriculturists would have had to leave them for over ; and since it aims, I not-to retain these, but to hand them over I to the native, improved up to the point at which he will be capable of dealing with them, it creates no alien latijundia. Small holdings multiply in the wake of its steamers, a fact I which in itself implies no Bmall economic and I social gain, and native human effort is enoonr-1 aged to continue and achieve the local con- quest of natural conditions. The civilisation I so promoted remains one of purely native I spring and character. An indigenous popula I tion is attracted at last into a region long lapsed to wilderness, and there it is induoed I by the building of hamlets, the making of roads and bridges, and the establishment of periodic I markets, to form a settled, stable, and self helping society—all, if you will, to the groat I profit of an alien corporation, but obviously to I the still greater profit oi the land of Egypt.

                    the Nile fen, nevertheless, is full of hums memorial' There are few sights more astonisl iug than that of mounds, covering nearly tw score of buried towns, in that water-logge desolation ; and I am still at a loss to explai how so large a population, dependent pn sumably for the most part on agriculture,cam to settle and subsist there iu an age to wbic pumps and any but the simplest methods  drainage were uukuown. That it practise agriculture, and did not live by fishing alone, i abundantly proved by the maze of old irrigi tion channels anddrainsaboutthemounds. Yo may even descry here and there, on the bight (tarts of the present marsh,a trace of ridge an furrow. In the main the culture must hav been of cereals. Since Egypt, as is well knowi was long the main feeder of the city of Rorni it need furprisc no one that every arable iuc in the Nile Valley should have been pressed t produce. Wheat, and doubtless on the saltt lands barley, must have paid the Delta cu tivator in those days at least as we as cotton does now. But it should not b forgotten that he made a profit also in Imperii times out o‘t other oultures long forgotten i Egypt, such as those of the vine and olivi From the first was produced, in the. mars! land of Mareotis, a wine celebrated in th Roman w->rld : and there are sufficient remain of oil presses lying on the surface of th Berori mounds to prove the former existenc of olive groves in the locality. But how t explain such cultures in such a district 1 Th experienced Europeans now eugaged in re claiming it are convinced that they would b impossible now, owing to the excessive satura tion and saliuity ; and, indeed, one can liardl; avoid belief in some subsequent subsideno of the land, such as, indeed, may be provet to have actually taken place not very far away where the foundations of Ptolemaic palaces an to be seen awash in the eastern bay of Alex andria.
                        ANCIENT towns.</p><p>
                       It is certain, however, not only as mj tentative digging proved, from the elevatioi of the towns on artificial mounds, but alsc from the very little that can be learned of the district in ancient writings, that it was alwayi to some extent a fen. More tlian once ic history rebels against the Egyptian Pharaohi found security in the northern swamps ; and the holy city Buto, whose oracle and festival are mentioned by Herodotus, is said tc have lain on the edge of a great marsh. Its site, perhaps the most important still not certaiuly identified in Lower Egypt, was somewhere in the 6outli wext of the fen region ; and a probable site has been found on the great mounds ol Farain, a low miles north of the Bcrari railway and ten from the east bank of the Rosetta Nile. Moreover, there is that actual desdription of a great tract of swamp and islands in this part of Egypt left by Heliodorus. His dainty romance of the loves of Theagenes and Charicleia, the best and almost the only novel in ancient Greek, which is said (probably without truth) to have drawn down on its episcopal author the censure of a startled syuod, thus describes the marshes (I quote the rendering of the Elizabethan translator, Uuderdown):—
                        </p><p>THE PASTURE OF THE EGYPTIANS
                        </p><p>“The whole place is called the Pasture of the Egyptian', about the which is a lowe valley, which receivetli oertaine exuudations ofNylus, by means whereof it becometh a poole, and is in the midst very deepe, about the brimmes whereof are mar! ihes or fenues. For looke, as the shore is to tho Sea, such is the Fennea to every great Poole. In that place have the theeves of Egypt, how many soever they bee, their common wealth. And for as much as there is a little land without the water, some live iu small cottages, others in boates which they use as wel for their house as for passage over the poole. In these doe their1 women sorve them, and it need require, be also brought to bedde. When a child is borne first, they let him sucke hismother’.siiiilkawhile.butafter they feede him with fishes taken in the lake and roasted in the hoato suniie. And when they perceive that lie beginnes to goe, they tie a cord about his legs, and suffer him but onely to goe about the boate... Moroovertliegreat plenty ofreede that groweth there in the Moozy ground is in a manner as good as a bulwark to them. For by- devising many orooked and cumbrous wayes, through which the passage to them by oft use is very easie, but to others hard, they have made it as a sure defence, that by no sudden invasion they may be endammaged.”

                    <p>To the Editor op the Egyptian G lzktte.</p>
                    <p>Sir,— A visitor to Alexandria, who knew the town before 1862 and has not seen it since, will be justly astonished, on viewing it again now, at the great progress that has been made, not only in building up what bad been wantonly destroyed, but also in enlarging and embellishing the town. One of my friends came here some days ago for the first time, so he could not have this experience ; but having been firet to Upper Egypt, be was encliantod with what he bad seen, and spoke a good deal about the splendour of the effects of light iu the Nile Valley and the majestic grandeur of the ancient monuments. I told him that I would show him, iu modern Alexandria, a feat of modern construction, and took him to the old port to let him have a look over the new quay, which is well worth seeing.^ Arrived there, we glanced over the great extension of the semi-cirole effected by that extensive work of modern engineering art, but when 1 looked to the West I rubbed my eyes, for that old fortress of Kait Bey, that offered such a fine view with its solid mass against the evening sky, was deprived of its tower, and traces of further destruction were to be seen at a great distanoe. I told my friend that some accident must have wrought this devastation. On inquiry, however, I found-out that this was only an example of what we may well call “Modern Vandalism. The old fort, which so picturesquely stood out against the western sky, the green waves dashing up against its walls,—the majeotio old fortress, marking the spot where once iu the olden times one qf the seven wonders of the world had been erected, is being pulled down so that the stones may be used for buildings for the Coast Guards. Why 1 this is about as bad as the destruction of the Pyramids and the other old Egyptian monuments which have been used as quarries by people who did not know better and whom we to day indiguantly call “Vandals'.	„
                    </p><p>It is true, the price of building material has gone up daring the last few years, but has the sense of the a*sthetio gone down in proportion 1 How is it tjiatthe City Fathers, who have been entrusted to look alter the town's welfare, have not understood wHkt they have allowed to be done 11s there not one amongst them to point out that one ol the very few views thistownhas, is being destroyed for futile reasons 1 Must the old ifert by-and-by cometo look like an immense bath-tub of cement T
                    </p><p>They are speaking of building a promenade- pier. What are the promeuadere going to look at 1 Other towns would erect a monument there t-j/imrk in a picturesque way the western end of^the bay and the spot where the old ‘ Pharos” fltood, which made the name of Alexandria famthttf^nTblden times, when millions were apeut by a population which had a keen sense of the beautiful. Now, for a question of perhaps not even-a thousand pounds, it is decided at the green table, which does not even stand in this town, that Fort Kait-Bey must be pulled down to use the btoues, not considering that many parts of the old landmark also have an architectural and historical value. While this is beingdone still the question is not decided whether the Roman Tower, that horrible and uuinteresting heap of stones, -hall be built up again at great cost. The “Comity pour la conservation des monuments de Part arabe" has tqken the Roman Tower under its wings. It is neither “art nor arabe ; Where is this “Comittf” now, when it might stepinto protect what is of much more interest l Why does the Municipality not send in the most energetic protest it can form! Because the fortress is not under its jurisdiction 1 • Has the town no right to demand that its •esthetic outlines be not disfigured in the interests of an administration which, on the other hand, is created to protect its material intereits VYet it is perhaps time, and I am sure that if nothing else will help, Lord Cromer will certainly find by his calculations that (pr the Coast-Guards the money for stones can be found without destroying one of the few views on which the eyes of those like to rest, who take their pleasure not only in looking at figures. Lord Cromer would certainly help the Municipality in doing what I think is its duty if only ho knew. Believe me, Sir, yours truly,

                    <p>n'hésitent pas à se purger, quand elles en ont besoin. Elles ne craignent ni
                        le dégoût ni la fatigue, parce que, à l'opposé des autres purgatifs,
                        celui-ci n'opère bien que lorsqu'il est pris avec de bons aliments et des
                        boissons fortifiantes, telles que vin, café, thé. Chacun choisit, pour se
                        purger, l'heure et le repas qui lui conviennent le mieux, selon ses
                        occupations. La fatigue de la purgation étant annulée par l'effet de la
                        bonne alimentation, on se décide aisément à recommencer autant de fois que
                        cela est nécessaire.</p>

                </p>
                <p>This Company is formed for the purposes set oat in its Memorandum of Assoui
                    ition, and in particular to oonduct business in Egypt and the Soudan, as
                    opportunity affords, and more particnlarly:—'</p>
                <p>To purchase, lease, hire and secure concessions of land eithor in town or
                    country.</p>
                <p>To reclaim, improve, cultivate, develop, lease, or otherwise deal with Properties
                    when acquired.</p>
                <p>To develop building land by the erection of houses or otherwise.</p>
                <p>To advance money on mortgage or otherwise, to acquire mortgage or other
                    securities either individually or jointly with others.</p>
                <p>To instal irrigation works, supplying the necessary plant for the purpose; to
                    construct canals, drains, roads and tramways, and to carry on industries
                    connected with Agricultural enterprises.</p>
                <p>To carry on any business whiob may be profitably or conveniently worked in
                    connection with any of the foregoing enterprises.</p>
                <p>Egypt presents a large field for profitable employment of money in lending on
                    safe mortgage. The gross value of land in Egypt is put by expertsat
                    £300,000,000, an average value of £50 per fed dan on 6,000,000 feddans.</p>
                <p>The advance in prosperity of the country owing to British Administration, the
                    Anglo-Frenob Agreement, and the recent proposed official introduction of the
                    English language into the Mixed Tribunals is well known. The value of land in
                    Egypt for agricultural and building purposes is shewn by innumerable sales and
                    ro-sales at c instantly enhanced prices, and by the market quotation of Land
                    Companies operating in Egypt, and it is believed that opportunities will occur
                    of securing lana which should greatly increase in valuo within a short space of
                    time</p>
                <p>Owing to the increase in the population of the larger towns of Egypt, there is a
                    very healthy and steady demand for well-boilt houses, and in the purchase
                    development and resale ot estates for residential and other purpose, ample soope
                    for remunerative business is afforded; it is considered that from this source
                    the Company sh.iuld derive a fair income.</p>
                <p>The opening of Government lands in the Soudan should not oTiTy afford favourable
                    opp irtunity for investing large Capital amounts on mortgage for many years to
                    come, bnt also offer favourable opportunities for purchase and development. The
                    conversion of burin land to ca- nalistd tummer cultivation in Middle Egypt, the
                    regular reclamation and improvement of salt Iona in Lower Egypt offer additional
                    oocasion for profitable business.</p>
                <p>The c'imate of Egypt is such, and the richness of the soil is so great, that
                    crops can bo grown continuously, the land not requiring to lie fallow. The land
                    in Lower Bgypt grows a winter crop of beans, wheat, barley, clover, &amp;c., and
                    again a summer crop of cotton, rioe or mmte, besides minor crops of numerous
                    kinds of vegetables. The chief products are ootton, wheat, maize, barley, rice,
                    beans, lentils, peas, rape, lettuoe, mustard, saffron, capsicum, aniseed, sugar
                    cane, figs dates, oranges, lemons, melons, mandarins, limes, &amp;c.,
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The Articles of Association provide as follows</p>
                <p>' As remuneration for his services as a Director, the Chairman shall receive
                    remuneration at the rate of £250 per annum, and the other Directors shall eaph

                    sufficient to provide a dividend ot 7 per oeht upon the amount paid up or
                    credited as paid up on the Ordinary Shares for the time being, having regard to

                    Managing Director or a Director or Directors acting as managers shall from time
                    to time be fixed by the Directors, and may be by way of salary or oommission, or
                    participation in profits, or by any or/and all of these modes. If any Director,
                    being willing, shall be called upon to perform extra servioe, or to make any

                    purposes of the Company, or act as Trustee for the Company or its DebJutu re
                    Hplders, and shall ao so, the Company may remunerate snob Director, either oy a
                    fixed sum or by a percentage ot profits, or otherwise, as may be determined by
                    the Directors, and suoh remuneration may be either in addition to or in

                    returned to tho Applicant.</p>
                <p>Failure to j>ay any instalment when due will render the previous payments liable
