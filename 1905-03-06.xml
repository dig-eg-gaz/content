                        <p>
                           Great battle, whioh has been raging for
                            the last few days, is going in favor of the
                            Japanese, and a Reuter's telegram, despatched
                            from Niu yesteroday, declares that the                           i are burning the station and stores at
                            Mukden preparatory to retreating. Mukden
                            falls into the hands of the Japanese, it will be
                            the crowning defeat of thirteen months of un-
                            broken disaster, and Will render the task of suing
                            for terms of one of a nondurable humiliation.
                            A single transitory gleam of victory on the
                            Russianeagles would restore the national self-
                            respect. In well-informed circles in Paris, it
                            is believed that any suooess, however inde-
                            cisive, on  the part of Kuropatkin would pave
                            the way to peace. However, the latest news
                            from the front seems to show that such a con-
                            summation is a long way off. The oonfused re-
                            port reach us indicate that anotber Russian 
                            defeat is in progress, and that the Russian flank	
                            is in serious danger of being turned, if, indeed,
                            that hasnot already taken place. There is
                          nothing which indicates that the Russians
                            have reversed, or are  likely to reverse, their
                            proved inferiority in the field. They lost heavi-
                            ly in the murderous battles of September and
                            October last and we have no reneon to sup-
                            pose that thereinforcements which have reach-
                           ed them are better in quality than tbe men
                            whose place they supply. Indeed, the Russian<cb/>
                            Army, numbers apart is a less formidable
                            fighting machine than when Kuropatkin first
                            took the field. The lamentable dissensions
                            which followed the last battle make it diffi-
                            cult to believe that the generalissimo still
                            retains the unbroken confidence of his men.
                            A discouraged army is an army already poten-
                            tially defeated, and the continuous reverses
                            which tbe Russians have sustained, empha-                           
                            sized as they are in this latest conflict
                            inevitably tend to weaken them in this, per-
                            ps the final struggle.

<p>
The train which left Cairo last night at 6.15
and should have arrived here at 11 p.m., did not
arrive until a quarter to six this morning. The
delay was due to the strong wind and heavy
sandstorm which was sweeping across the line.
The train was detained at Ismailia for four hours
as it was thought dangerous for it to continue
in face of such a storm. Much delay is also
anticipated again this evening, as although the
storm abated daring the day, it is raging now

GROUNDING OF S S. “CAIRO.”
</head>
<head>RUBATTINO STEAMER
IN DANGEROUS POSITION.
</head>
<head>RESCUE OF PASSENGERS </head>
<p>
The Florio-Rubattino Company'jS. 8. “Cairo,"
which was due at Alexandria from Italy at
8 am. yesterday, was not signalled until 7.80
p.m. yesterday. At 8.10^p.m; the vessel entered
the Boghaz Pass steaming quite slowly. Daring
her passage through the pass she twice stopped
her machines and when she arrived near the
red lighthouse, she again, stopped. At length
she made a sadden tarn and appeared to
be trying to go back to sea through the
Boghaz. For some minutes she steamed in this
direction, and then stopped short suddenly at
9.10 p.m., having run on a bank or a rook. Her
right side is under water, her bow facing
N. W. The point where she has struck, is
known as the Agame shoal.
</p>
<p>
When the steamer struck,the first officer
went pff in a small boat and informed the port
authorities of the disaster. No tug was able
to get near the vessel’ during the night
owing to the high sea running, and the passen-
gers and crew were only taken off this morning
at 7.15. Some of the passengers were up to the
ire breast in water when taken off, as the waves
on beat against the vessel with terrific force,
rolling her terribly, and it is considered
extraordinary that no lives were lost. The
mails and cargo have not yet been recovered,
and nothing can be done until the weather
gets better. If the sea continues high nothing
will be saved.
</p>
<p>
The “Cairo” had encountered very bad
weather since leaving Messina. Captain De
Marchi states that he came to the pass ex-
pecting to find a pilot, but after looking about
for one in vain, he was trying to get to sea
again, when the vessel struck.
</p>
<p>
An enquiry has been opened at the Italian
Consulate.
</p>
<p>
The great Italian actor Novelli was on board,
and he and his company have lost all their
baggage.
</p>
<p>
There were about 100 passengers on board.
</p>
<p>
The following is an eye-witness’s account —
I happened be at Mex last night, and
between 8.30 and 9 o’clock I saw a steamer’s
lights in a very unusual position close to the
coast. Soon after the vessel fired off several
rockets, and continued to do so until past 
midnight. At 10.30 o’clock I noticed the 
lights of the Port tug going out to the wreck,
but apparently she could not get very close. A
heavy sea was running and the steamer rolled
heavily. From the portion of the fights one
could see that there was a heavy list, which
apparently got worse and worse. At about
11.30 I thought that all was over, for she rolled
right over and the fights disappeared. But
she righted herself later and the lights again
came into view. At about 5.30 a.m. the
position of the boat was clearly discernible.
Four tugs were around her, taking off passen-
gers, and at 7 a.m. the togs left the wreck,
which seemed to be sinking - fast by the stern,
and steamed towards the harbour. The wreck
is half-way between Mex and Dekheleh and
the steamer to all appearances was a mile out,
of her ‘course when she struck.

and Sapper Newton, R.E,, were extremely
well rendered, While that of Mr. George
Holmes, amongst the older members of the
club, was given in his usual delightful manner. 
</p>
<p>
During the interval, the prizes tor the bil-
liard handicaps were presented by Major-
General Slade, C.B, who gave to each recipient
a few well-chosen words of praise and encourage-
ment. In acknowledging a vote of thanks
proposed by Capt. Bayley), the General spoke 
a very feeling manner, referring to his early
departure from the command and from the
Service, in which he had spent forty-four years.
He advised the men not to leave the Service,
but to persevere and go on in a straight line
doing their duty, which he assured them would
bring a prosperous and happy time.
</p>
<p>
The General’s remarks were receiverd with
hearty and prolonged cheering, the whole of
the audience rising spontaneously and singing
“For he's a jolly good fellow," the cheering
being continued as the General took his 
departure.	
</p>
<p>
All ranks feel the less of General Slade, who
at all times has taken a keen interest, not only
in the Soldiers' Club, but in they of every one
under his command.

NOTES FROM SUAKIN.
</head>
<head>
THE SIRDAR’S VISIT.
</head>
<head>
(From Our Correspondent).
</head>
<p>
Suakin, February 24.
</p>
<p>
The weather here during the past few
months has been very odd, but there has been
no rain worth mentioning.
</p>
<p>
Great preparations are being made here for the
reception of H. E. the Sirdar and Governor-
General of the Sudan, Sir R. Wingate Pasha,
who is expected here about the first week
in March. Several Government buildings will
be decorated for the occasion and triumphal
arches are being erected at several places
through which his Excellency will pass in
making his entry into Suakin. Inspector
Bailey, Suakin Railways, has been entrusted
with the erection of a new railway platform
150 feet long opposite the Shata Gate, where
his Excellency will alight from the train and
then ride to Government House.
</p>
<p>
The Sirdar will come overland vii Athara
to Railheed and from Railhead by special
train to Suakin, so that his Excellency will
be enabled to inspect the new line. The
Suakin Cosmopolitan Orchestra are preparing
a special entertainment to be given during
the Sirdar’s short stay here, and it is
hoped his Excellency will honor this
entertainment with his presence. It is feared
that Sir Rudolph von Slatin Pasha, Ins-
pector-General of the Sudan, will not be
able to accompany the Sirdar to Suakin, as
he has only just toft Khartoum for Kordo-
fan on a very important mission.
</p>
<p>
Mr. George Urquhart, bridge contractor,
Suakin-Atbara Railways, has just completed,
the erection of the first bridge of 105' span at
Nambok station. The 2nd, 3rd and 4th bridges
to be erected at Sallom station are also well
advanced. These bridges are also of 105' span
each.
</p>
<p>
El Minim Macauley Bey, R.E., Director,
Sudan Rail ways, went by special train on the
20th inst. as far as Railhead, which is now by
Komobsana, and made a general inspection of
all the stations and work on the lines. He re-
turned to Snakin on the 23rd inst.
</p>
<p>
The Khedivial mail steamer “Gharbieh”
arrived here from Suez on the 23rd inst. and
landed Mr. Guido Corbetta, the contractor of
the National Bank of Egypt and the Quaran-
tine Camp, at Suakin. He has come in connec-
tion with some important contracts for Suakin
Barghoot Port. Several workmen also arrived
by the "Gharbieh” for the Suakin-Atbara
Railways.
</p>
<p>
The Khedivial mail steamer “Mahallah”
arrived from Suez on the 11th inst, having on
board Miralai Howard Bey, Moudir of Suakin,
also Messrs. Pearlman and Howe, both of them
formerly in the employ of the Behera Land
Company. Mr. Pearlman has been appointed
Assistant District Traffic Manager, and Mr.
owe Inspector of Bridge work, Suakin-
Atbara Railways. Mr. Howe is well known at
Sidi-Gaber, Alexandria.
</p>
<p>	
Captain Brooke-Smith, of the Sudan Govern-
ent steamer ‘ Mukhbir,” has been transferred
to the Sudan Government steamer “Tyra,” to
to alter the pearl fishing around Suakin.
The "Tyra” left Suakin on the 13th inst. for
the purpose of supervising the pearl fisheries
and returned here on the 18th inst.
</p>
<p>
Those unlucky condensers again ! Mr. May-
lor, the erecting engineer of the Suakin Rail-
way condensers, has been in hospital with
blood poisoning, but is now completely cured,
and hopes to have the condenser ready for
trial in a week or so. The old condensers, which
were saved from the wreck of the S.S. "Afghan-
istan,” have now been taken over by the
Suakin Railway from the insurance agents,
and are being thoroughly overhauled. They
will be erected either here or at Sheikh Bar
ghoot, but most probably at Suakin, as a 
second condenser here is necessary to provide
against an accident, or the need of repairs to
the one already erected.
</p>
<p>
The Suakin International Club have remov-
1 to another building, formerly occupied by
the branch of the National Bank of Egypt
The honorary president is Mr. G. C. Kerr,
Deputy Inspector, Suakin Moudirieh, and its
members now number over 30. The new club
contains a large billiard-room, reading-room,
concert-hall with piano, etc., a splendid bar,
gymnasium etc.

We regret to announce the death of Mr. 
Clinton Baker, who died at Cure on Saturday
diphtheria. The funeral took place
yesterday. Mr. Baker was a member, of the\
English Bar and only recently came to Egypt

ment in order to practice at Khartoum. He,
however, returned to Cairo, as the climate in
Sudan did not agree with him.

place at Alexandria yesterday, of M. Nicholas
Zananiri, of the well-known and respected Za-
naniri family. The funeral will take place this
