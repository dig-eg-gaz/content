                    <p>The programme of the founders of the proposed National University should have
                        the effect of modifying the criticisms passed in advance upon that
                        institution. The fears to which some of our Egyptophobes—for there ar:
                        Egyptophobes as well as Anglophobes to be found in Cairo and Alexandria-gave
                        utterance, presaging a "Nationalist" University with Miata as Pasha Kamel or
                        some vigorous and intolerant member of the olema class as its R:otor, are
                        shown to be groundlees, and the pronouncement of the committee that the
                        doors of the new University shall be thowa oj on to all, whatever their
                        origin and their religion, who desire to learn, and that its constitution
                        shall be entirely independent of political ir flaenops, is reassuring. Nor
                        is the programme of the University courses too restricted, while none can
                        accuse it of a lack of idealism. In fact, even some of the sympathisers with
                        the movement may feel a certain doubt whether those who have drawn up the
                        programme may not have sought to soar, like Icarus, too near the sun on
                        their first flight. But we should like to remind our readers that Kassim Bey
                        Amin's letter does not contain a definite programme : the University will
                        not open to-morrow, nor will students crowd to Cairo this winter to attend
                        its lectures. Some years of patient work are required before the University
                        can be finally established. Funds must be raised and a site must be
                        chosen.</p>
                    <p>The constitution of the governing body must be determined, and professors
                        discovered, who are capable of teaching Oriental students. We will refer
                        later to some of these points, Mean- <cb n="6"/>

                        </floatingText> time, we must realise that we have to do with a very
                        admirable and public-spirited proposal made by men who ze spirit ia
                        progressive, whose enthusiasm is unbounded, and whose aims are free from the
                        taint of self interest. To those who assert that the motives of the
                        promoters of the scheme are interested, we reply that if the University is
                        to be a successful and well-organized foundation, there will be no room for
                        private profit. The founders will, indeed, obtain some of the immaterial
                        rewards of public spirit--the criticism of the ignorant and the praise of
                        the enlightened : but, even should their first essay be unfruitful, their
                        names will be famous among their compatriots and also among all men whom
                        love of knowledge and admiration of a genuinely patriotic spirit render
                        indifferent to the distinctions of creed and race. And in the days to come
                        such men will abound.</p>
                    <p>Our critics--we foresee their appearance--may deny our premises. But, after
                        all, if they assert that the scheme will founder through disunion, they must
                        remember that the newborn zeal for education may yet carry Egyptians safely
                        past the Scylla of jealousy and the Charybdis of intrigue, and if they want
                        that the scheme is doomed to fall into dishonest hands, we--can only reply
                        that if the University Committee diverts the subscriptions it will receive
                        into improper channels, and not only we but all Egypt--are absolutely
                        mistaken in our judgment of the honesty and single-mindedness of its
                        members.</p>
                    <p>We have remarked that the programme which Kassab Bey Amin bas suggested and
                        outlined may not meet with the approval of all the world. But it is capable
                        of modification, and if the public to which it is addressed has criticism to
                        offer, none can doubt that ita criticisms will have weight. Bat we should
                        like to point out that till now the corse of Egyptian education has been the
                        view taken by <!--[illegible]--> and Moslems alike, that education exists b
                        enable young men to obtain positions order Government or to crowd certain
                        professions that once were lucrative but are now over-crowded by the
                        multitude of competitors. Wo admit that education in the present state of
                        society must be for most a means to such an e.d. Batman shall not live by
                        bread alone. "The nations have succeeded best which have aimed as far as
                        possible at a wide training—the training of the mind and of the body, and
                        the training of the will. China is the classic instance of failure, dae not
                        so much to the predominance of a purely literary education, as to the
                        prevalence of the idea that the be all and end-all of education was the
                        supply of mandarins. France and England at the present day, Rome and Greece
                        in the past, have realised that such over-specialisation is almost as
                        dangerous as neglect to the body politic, that education when possible must
                        be something more than a means to wealth.</p>
                    <p>Et propter vitam vivendi perdere causas applies too well to an education that
                        is concentrated on the production of money-makers.. A modern State does not
                        require citizens turned out like coin from a mint-aniform, stamped with the
                        same pattern and the same milling. It needs numbers and variety, specialists
                        and handicraftsman, active workers and watchful critics ; even the idle
                        rich-pace our Socialista -have their value once their intellects or their
                        characters or both have been disciplined or trained. A millionaire may
                        devote his wealth to the advancement of knowledge ; a poor man may become a
                        leader in the councils of his people.</p>
                    <p>Thus far neither the Egyptian Government nor the Egyptian people have had the
                        time or the means to create a University. A system of secɔndary "and
                        technical education has achieved much, bat it hus not given-por in the
                        nature of things could it give-the opportunity to zealous students of
                        acquiring a wider knowledge. The young Egyptian of means has too often
                        fallen a victim to his own indolence. His secondary studies completed, he
                        has seized on the absence of any system of higher education as an excuse for
                        apathy, has learnt nothing new, and forgotten all be has already learnt. The
                        unemployed (or ill-employed) rich abound among as. If the new scheme finds
                        intellectual employment for even a section of them, it will have done
                        much.</p>
                    <p>It will have done more if it succeeds in imbuing the average man with the
                        idea that his education is not necessarily finished because he can make L.E.
                        5 a month; it will have fulfilled the aspirations of its founders is it can

                    <head>EGYPT'S DEMAND FOR MONEY.<lb/>LONDON OPINION.</head>
                    <p>The way in which the London money market has been drained to meet the
                        Egyptian demand lead the "Statist" to remark :- "It is too early yet to
                        estimate with any confidence the probable Egyptian demand. Until recently
                        that demand was expected to be emall, because speculation is much less
                        active than it was at this time last year. Now opinion has changed, and it
                        is feared that the demand will be large. Quite possibly, in a little time
                        farther we may see another change of opinion, or the Bank of France may
                        decide upon supplying Egypt freely. It would not be wise, however, to depend
                        upon that. Ever since 1870 the policy of the Bank of France has been to keep
                        as large an amount of gold as it possibly can. Just now there are many
                        reasons why the Bank of France should think it desirable to maintain that
                        policy. The State of Russia, the general distur. bance of the political
                        equilibrium in Europe, the uprost among the Mohamedans, and the uneasiness
                        at home, pre-all reasons why the Bank of France should think it desirable to
                        part with very large amounts. It is true that there has been a very
                        considerable decrease in the gold held by the Bank of France. But then it is
                        not possible from the returns to ascertain to what extent that decrease is
                        for internal and to what extent for external requirements. Therefore for the
                        present it would be best to assume that the Egyptian demand upon this
                        country - will be nearly as large as in recent years."</p>

                        on that the Egyptians have not changed and never will, but the charge
                        brought against them after the Denishwai incident was a bitter pill for

                    <p>The Mahomedan community in India, as represented by their delegates at Simla,
                        since presenting their memorial to the Viceroy, have been discussing the
                        best means for safeguarding their interests. It has been decided, in the
                        first place, to organize provincial associations which should send
                        representatives to a central body. The further organization of the scheme,
                        particularly with reference to that body and its functions, will be
                        discussed at Dacca, where the annual Mahomedan educational conference
                        assembles in December. The main object is to keep the Government
                        authoritatively informed as to local Mahomedan feelings and aspirations.
                        Methods of agitation such as those employed by the National Congress will be

                    <p>Yesterday morning, the hearing of a summons brought by Mr. Marburg,
                        proprietor of the St. James's Hotel, against Mrs. Adams took place at
                        H.B.M.'s Consular Court, Cairo. The defendant was represented by Maitre
                        Geoffrey Miward.</p>
                    <p>It appears that a few days ago, Mrs. Adama's little daughter entered the St.
                        James's Hotel, where she fell into conversation with a couple of officers,
                        who gave her ices, sweets, etc. And appears to have become , rather excited,
                        and eventually began to throw ices from the window of the hotel on to the
                        beads of those who were having supper below. This conduct naturally provoked
                        a scene, and the child - was requested to leave the hotel, the proprietor of
                        which giving orders that she should not be admitted in future.</p>
                    <p>On the following evening Mrs. Adams appeared, and sitting down at a table
                        which was already occupied, began to talk loudly, to the diners, who seem to
                        have objected, and Mrs. Adams was ordered to leave the hotel. At about three
                        o'clock in the morning, she re-appeared, driving up in company with her
                        husband and daughter, and entered the, hotel, where she created considerable
                        distarbanos, violently abusing Mr. Marburg, who was eventually obliged to
                        send for a policeman. Mrs. Adams was then removed, loudly protesting, and
                        drove away. She afterwards returned, however, and for some time drove up and
                        down in front of the hotel, uttering loud and free comments on the conduct
                        of the proprietor. Her defence was that she had sent her daughter on the
                        previous day to find a doctor, who she believed was having supper there, to
                        ask him to come at once to visit her husband, who was seriously ill. The
                        Court criticised the defence on the grounds that Mr. Adams's illness was not
                        so serious as to prevent him from going on a moonlight drive with his wife
                        and daughter. Mrs. Adams was fined £2.</p>

                    <head>"AL MINBAR."<lb/>REPLY TO OUR CRITICISM.</head>
                    <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE."</p>
                    <p>Sir,--I hope I shall not be trespassing unduly on your valuable space by
                        replying to the arguments adduced to support the view that "Al. Minbar" is
                        of a "dangerous character," and that by reason thereof the authorities were
                        justified in prohibiting its entry into the Sadan. I should in the first
                        instance point out that the term "suppressed," in that relation, was
                        erroneously employed, seeing that no copy of our publication had ever been
                        sent into the Sudan. Permission' was asked soon after our journal made its
                        appearance to authorise its transmission in the Sudan; and that permission
                        has recently been refused upon no stated grounds, though it is clear that
                        those responsible thought it inexpedient to let the paper into circulation.
                        With this decision I do not quarrel, because I have no doubt that it was
                        sincerely arrived at, but what I do regret is that the authorities should
                        not have taken care to be better informed. Had they been able to read our
                        articles in the original instead of being obliged to trust to others less
                        scrupulous and honourable than themselves, it would, I doubt not, have been
                        patent to them that "Al Minbar," far from being inimical to their interests,
                        has from the first initiated a policy favourable to them. Speaking at the
                        dinner given by the Press to Major Owen Bey on the occasion of our return
                        from the opening of the Nile-Red-Sea Railway, and subsequently on more than
                        one occasion in print, I expressed the opinion that the Sodan should be
                        regarded as part and parcel of Greater Egypt and that the interests of the
                        two are indissolubly bound ap together. So, too, as regards the question of
                        Egypt's contribution towards the expenditure in the Sudan. "Al Minbar” bas
                        invariably upheld the present arrangement on the grounds just stated,
                        namely, that the two countries should be regarded as forming an integral.
                        Can those views be regarded as in any sense "dangerous ?” But to come to
                        matters more immediately at issue. "Al Minbar” is accused of having
                        disseminated a statement by an anonymous German attributing to the English
                        the invention of cholera and plague without at once contradicting it. The
                        answer is simply this: The report was that of an interview with A well-known
                        German Orientalist who did not wish his name disclosed. Now I would ask. Is
                        it necessary to criticise in every such casei I should say not. To take the
                        most recent instance : "The Pall Mall Gazette" published a lengthy report of
                        an interview between its Paris correspondent and the editor of "El Lewa"
                        containing maný statements, which, from the English point of view, were
                        "exceedingly dangerous" and the report of the interview was reproduced in
                        "The Egyptian Gazette" on the 12th inst. In neither instance was any
                        editorial comment appended thereto. I could oite hundreds of other instances
                        of an identical description. It must, therefore, I think, be taken as clear
                        that an editor is not bound to deny every statement published in his paper
                        on the authority of a third party, which he knows or has reasonable grounds
                        for believing to be untrue, and hence that accusation falls to the ground.
                        But "Al Minbar" is farther charged with unduly eulogising the Ottoman
                        Empire. All that I ogn say, in reply, is that whilst acknowledging H.I.M.
                        the Sultan as the Khalif of Islam, and expressing our loyalty to the
                        Khalilate, we have never forgotten to point out the reactionary tendencies
                        of the present Turkish Government, which like other governments will have
                        its time and pass away. And how could it be possible for any mind endowed
                        with a semblance of logio to ask in one breath for perfect, liberty and
                        equality on behalf of the Egyptians without at the same time condemning the
                        autocratic Government in Turkey? The thing is manifestly absurd.</p>
                    <p>"Al Minbar's" policy has throughout been "Egypt for the Egyptians." To show
                        that we have maintained that view I beg leave to quote from a leading
                        article in "Al Minbar” of the 24th July last in which the following passage
                        occurs :- "The Egyptians desire to be independent without being under any
                        autocrat either in Yildiz, Abdin, or Kasr El Doubara.” Of course we at the
                        same time defend the integrity of the Turkish Empire and desire to see it
                        regenerated and strong again amongst the nations of the world. Again we say
                        that no one who has a grain of political sense or experience can doubt that
                        for Egypt to become again a Turkish vilayet, as it was before the time of
                        Mohamed Aly, would be the graves of all misfortunes for one country. The
                        legation that our journal charged British cons and missionaries with
                        instigating the Armeans to rebel is without foundation. The rmeniang -wore
                        dover referred to by ng at all a this connection.</p>
                    <p>The last of the suggestions made against "A Minbar," namely, that it is not
                        allowed to enter Turkey, is in reality an answer to a previous criticism,
                        viz, that "Al Minbar” has Turkish proclivities. Our journal has never
                        been<!-- [illegible]--> circulation in Turkey from the very fact that we do
                        not send any copies unless required by subscribers and newsvendors. The same
                        is the case as regards Tanie, Algeria, etc.</p>
                    <p>I think I have now dealt with all the points raise. It only remains for me to
                        add that in writing the above and the previous letter which you did me the
                        honour to insert I wish to be understood that the explanations giver are not
                        intended to conciliate anybody or win a view to make it appear that our

                        misunderstandings and remove erroneous assumptions engendering friction
                        which it is in the interests of all to avoid. In conclass I wish to express
                        the gratitude of my co e for and myself for the invaluable support Recorded

                    <p>A very important essay relating to the primitive art and culture of the
                        ancient Egyptians is that of M. George Fouoart, "Sur la Decoration des Vases
                        de la période dite de Naggadeh," read by him before the French Academy.</p>
                    <p>The subject, as stated by M. Foucart, does not include all the pictorial
                        ornamental styles upon this primitive pottery, but is restricted to an
                        explanation of the meaning of a tableau frequently found, in more or less
                        modified form, and well known to Egyptologiste.</p>
                    <p>This is a sort of panorama depositing a boat, with elevated prow and stern,
                        containing a kind of naoo, looked at oursorily, appearing to be merely two

                        of the masses of freight or elsewhere on the vessel projects a flagstaff, or
                        guidon pole, bearing emblems; whilst one or more pålma extend from the
                        stern.</p>
                    <p>In the field of the picture are people with their arms uplifted, or carrying
                        boomerangs, gazelles and large birds, and a few small pyramidal objects,
                        which have been thought to indicate hillocks.</p>
                    <p>M. Foucart's theory, which is a most in, teresting one, is that these scenes
                        indicata a time when Egyptian writing had not passed out of the pictorial
                        stage. Thøge scenes upon the pottery are in fact trae hieroglyphs, and are
                        really a primitive panoramio display of what subsequently became the verbal
                        proscynom of the funeral stele, which in itself, when for private
                        personages, was but a copy of worship offered daily to the deities in their
                        temples ; and with extra splendour, in these edifices or outside them, at
                        thọ special fêtes of the gods.</p>
                    <p>The following is M. Foucart's interpretation of the scenes depicted, and it
                        will immediately appear how appositely his theory accounts for them. The
                        boat with its long rows of oars is the "barque divin” which every Egyptian
                        god had in his temple for the purpose of conveying him in a procession on
                        land, or if used only as a symbol of the deity's voyage -across the
                        celestial ocean or river, he embarked upon it and proceeded in procession on
                        the Nile.</p>
                    <p>The boat emblem therefore conveyed the idea that the fate of a god was
                        intended. Then the double connected pieces of ourgo are a representation of
                        the temple pylons, indicating, therefore, a religious festival proceeding
                        from the deity's earthly mansion.</p>
                    <p>The pole, or flagstaff, with its particular emblem Alsating from it, explains
                        which god's fête was intended ; and it is most rạmarkable that M. Foucart
                        hus beən able to select from these boat banners at least ten guidons, whose
                        figures he shows are the sacred symbols of as many divinities. These, as
                        might be expected, correspond in most cases with the ancient pome Totem gods
                        we know from other ralios of the very earliest Egyptian art. The one or more
                        palms at the prow or stern of the vessel, indicate the number of days'
                        duration of the festival, whilst the people with hands and arms uplifted
                        acclaim the passage of the sacred barque.</p>
                    <p>Finally, the deer, † birds, and triangular objects all refer to the great
                        festival sacrifices, and stand, pictorially, for the well-known rubric
                        inscribed, as it was recited, upon the funeral stelæ and temple rituals of
                        later date, which it will be remembered commence by promising a feast of
                        "thousands of gazelles and of birds and loaves, or cakes," these, latter
                        being represented in the vase talleans by the little pyramidal objects.</p>
                    <p>The stele, texts also inolade (as does the "Pancarte" or "Table of offerings
                        formalæ," a derivative from them) stuffs and vestments, and thậge M. Fougart
                        sometimes finds shown upon the vase drawings standing in bales, especially
                        on pottery found at Naggadeb. So these pictures are the prototypes of the
                        tomb paintings and reliefs; and, which is even more important, they are the
                        pictorial symbolic representation before, the later hieroglyphs developed
                        into the determinatives, and letters of the literary inscriptions upon the
                        funeral stelæ, and finally of the same texts whøn engrossed upon the
                        sepalohral papyri.</p>
                    <p>JOSEPH OFFORD.</p>
                    <p>†There appear to be four species of gazelles depicted on the Naggadeh
                        objects, and these therefore correspond to the four gazelles said, in a tomb
                        text at Hieraoonopolis, to be the canonical number to be utilised for
                        sacrifices</p>

                    <p>51 Nous détachons d'ane lettre de Paris, en I date du 9 Octobre, le passage
                        suivant :</p>
                    <p>Il semble que notró marché abase un peu de la santé da Sultan pour déprimer
                        los cours, de la Rente tarque, ainsi que cotx des va illeurs ottomanes en
                        général. Que le Padischab soit malade, cela ne fait pas de doute ; que, pour
                        ce fait, on impose à cos valeurs one certaine réserve, cela se comprend ;
                        mais de lle à faire de la baisse il y a un abime. Ea effet, en admettant
                        même l'hypothèse que l'on semble redouter le plus, qu'y aurait-il de changé,
                        même en Tarqoie ? Un homme, oai ; ane institation, non; un système financier
                        encore moins. Il est impossible qu'en finance, ou tout au moins pour ce qui
                        regarde les porteurs de la Dette Ottomane, il y ait quelque chose de changé.
                        Le décret de Mo. harrem a mis cos porteurs à l'abri de tous les aléas:
                        caprices de Saltan, ordres de succession au trône ou révolations de palais.
                        La Commission internationale de la Dette fait simple. ment respecter eos
                        droits, exerce, ane surveillance constante sur la perception des taxes et
                        des impôts qu'elle administre et dont elle eat chargée de faire la
                        répartition. Par conséquent, quoi qu'il arrive, aucune crainte sérieuse pour
                        les portears, que le Sultan soit jeane on vieux, fils, on neveu de son
                        guzerain bien portant og malade. Bref, pour les détentears, la santé du
                        Padischah feat être considérée comme on accessoire ; leur "Saltan á 80x,
                        c'est l'administration internationale de la Dotte."</p>

                    <head>REPORT FOR 1905.</head>
                    <p>From the statistics given at the end of the report by the Ports and
                        Lighthouses Administration for 1995-issued nearly nine months after the
                        close of the year--we gather that, during the period in question, the
                        arrivals at the port of Alexandria were 1,817 steamers (3,296,237 tone) and
                        2,794 sailing vessels (295,044 tons) whilst the clearances were 1,816
                        steamers (3,274,842 tons) and 2,702 sailing vessels (278,145 tons). Compared
                        with the year 1904.the increase was as follows:</p>
                    <p>Arrivals 81 steamers 313,943 tons</p>
                    <p>496 sailing vessels 69,347 ,,</p>
                    <p>Clearances 86 steamers 298,648 ,,</p>
                    <p>421 sailing vessels 52,867 ,,</p>
                    <p>The British arrivals numbered 801 steamers (1,521,879 tons) against 786 ships
                        (1,340,439 tons) in 1904. The German arrivals showed an increase of 38
                        steamers and 140,875 tons, whilst the French returns were 31 steamers and
                        61,088 tons greater than in 1904. The Austrian figures were 145 steamers
                        (310,668 tons) against 160 steamers (334,851 tons), being a decrease of 15
                        ships and 24,183 tons.</p>
                    <p>From the manufacturer and agent's point of view, we assume the most important
                        parts of the report are those relating to the provision of new berthing
                        accommodation, and to the steps which are being taken to lessen the
                        congestion in the barbour. We, therefore, give the following particulars of
                        certain work done during 1905. </p>
                    <p>Additional Quay Berths,</p>
                    <p>These berths, which are to form a continuation of the import quaye, will be
                        each 120 metres long, with ample shed accommodation and railway facilities
                        for the handling and storage of goods discharged from ships lying at them.
                        The sheds will be 6 metres high, and 25 metres long, and capable of
                        supporting a second story. About 65,200 cubic metres---out of the required
                        700,000 c.m.----had been dredged by the 31st December. It is expected that
                        two of the new berths will be ready by July 1907, and another one in January
                        1908. </p>
                    <p>Now Collier Berths Quay A.</p>
                    <p>The greater part of the sea reclamation for redeeming the mole and throwing
                        out an arm where the four collier berths were to be created was completed by
                        the end of last year. In this connection the Director General states "As the
                        credit of L.E. 50,000 accorded in 1903 is nearly exhausted, and that of LE
                        38,000 in 1905 will be spent daring the summer, I am asking for a farther
                        credit of LE 40,000 tur 1906 to enable two more collier berths to be added
                        to the four now in hand, and to prolong the arm so as to afford better
                        protection to the colliers bertbed at Quay A. </p>
                    <p>Six Timber Berths at Gabbary.</p>
                    <p>In view of the length of time occupied in the discharging of timber ships and
                        in the removal of the cargoes from the quays, it was decided to have all the
                        work done in the outer harbour at Gabbary wberè 'not only can suffi. "cient
                        berths for the discharge be provided, I"bat, what is of equal importance,
                        ample space " for the handling of the timber ashore with "Means of transport
                        by road and rail, as well "as for the necessary Customs operation of "
                        measurement and valuation."</p>
                    <p>The contract for the new timber quays was 1st in October 1905 at LE. 137,000.
                        By the 31st December 70,000 cubic metres of sea reclamation was effected. </p>
                    <p>New Cattle Port and Quay.</p>
                    <p>"This work has proceded rapidly, in spite of "the great difficulties
                        encountered in placing " quay blocks by means of divers at a spot "exposed
                        to the fall force of the seas and swell. " About 160 metres in length of the
                        elbow "shaped quay,sixty feet wide, have been completed." </p>
                    <p>New Pass.</p>
                    <p>The new pass into the harbour-for which a grant of L.E. 100,000 has already
                        been accorded—is to be 35 feet deep at low water with a width of 600 feet,
                        thas being double the width and five feet deeper than the existing entrance.
                        The work was commenced in June 1905, and should be fini-hed by the end of
                        1907 or even earlier. </p>
                    <p>General Maintenance.</p>
                    <p>"We have carried out in 1906 extensive repairs to the paving of the Quays,
                        and to the sheds on Quay B. The artificial blocks on the sea side of the
                        Breakwater damaged by sea and weather have been repaired with cement. The
                        gradual substitution of stone quays for wooden jetties in the careening
                        basin has been carried on this year, and will be completed in 1906. Drains
                        to carry off the rain water in winter from the Quays, which were much
                        wanted, have been laid."</p>
                    <p>The value of the work mentioned in the last paragraph will, we think, be
                        fully appreciated by merchants at this end.</p>
                    <p>The observations on the working of the coal hoist installation in the port
                        are sufficiently interesting to warrant us giving them "in extenso." </p>
                    <p>" During 1905, we have discharged 259,000 tons of coal by means of the three
                        pairs of coal hoists as follows. 220,000 tons for the Railway
                        Administration, 39,000 tons for individual marchants. In 1904 the total 80
                        discharged was 266,000 tons, of which 218,000 were for the Railway
                        Administration and 39,000 for individual merchants. The working of the
                        machines has been most satisfactory, but the question of relative cost per
                        ton discharged as compared with that of manual labour is not very greatly in
                        favour of the hoists. The 259,000 tons discharged by the hoists cost L.E.
                        3,190, equivalent to the rate of L.E. 0,123 per ton ; our</p>
                    <p><cb/></p>
                    <p>uniform charge to Railway Administration "and merchants has been L.E. 0,025
                        por ton; the cost of discharge by hand is from L.E 0,015 to L.E. 0,025,
                        according to the distance to which the coal has to be carried from the "ship
                        to the coal store or railway wagon. The comparative rapidity is, however,
                        greatly in favour of the hoists, and, consequently, the avoidance of
                        demurrage in the</p>
                    <p>case of railway colliers, which according to charter party must be discharged
                        at the rate of 750 tons per day ; whilst the constantly increasing
                        difficulty of obtaining manual labour promises soon to bring the hoists into
                        popular use, and we shall require to add to their number next year.</p>
                    <p>Sundry Works.</p>
                    <p>Amongst sundry works executed by the Chief Engineer of the Port on behalf of
                        the Customs Administration were the following :</p>
                    <p>The building of a large magazine for the storage of oils -- other than
                        petroleum-covering an area of 36,000 square metres and situated on the site
                        of the old petroleum store.</p>
                    <p>The erection of a magazine covering an area of 600 square metres on Quay
                        F.</p>
                    <p>The building of an annex to the inflammable store at Gabbary.</p>
                    <p>During the summer of 1905, Berthe Nos. 13 and 14, with two large sheds, were
                        handed over to the Customs for general import purposes. When the work on
                        Quay A-previously mentioned - is completed, the four berths and two sheds on
                        Q 1ay B now used for coal will be rendered available for the general
                        purposes of commerce.</p>
                    <p>The Director General ends his report thus : </p>
                    <p>" In conclusion, I may say, without fear of contradiction, that owing to the
                        liberal grants made by the Financial Adviser for the facilitation of the
                        general business of the Port of Alexandria, very extensive improvements have
                        been inaugurated during the past year both as regards shipping and commerce,
                        the results of which will become largely apparent in 1907, 1908, and 1909.
                        By that time we shall have an excellent cattle port, six more collier
                        berths, and four new general commerce berths with sheds, railways,
                        machinery, etc., besides a complete protection for our outer harbour, with a
                        now and easy pass through the reefs available in all weathers for ships of
                        the largest class.”</p>

                        <p>Sir.—Referring to "Musica's” letter in a recent issue of your valuable
                            paper, may I trespass on your space and say that I have been told by old
                            residents that the Khedivial Hymn is the Neapolitan Royal Hymn. An
                            Italian offered this hymn as his own composition to Said Pasha, and was
                            splendidly rewarded by him. In 1862, when Said Pasha went to Naples, it
                            happened that his band played the Khedivial Hymn, and was arrested by
                            the police for playing a forbidden Bourbonic tone, as ore may see in the
                            papers of that time. I beg leave to remain, your obedient servant,</p>

                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE.”</p>
                        <p>Sir, I have of late penned a few lines under the above heading, and
                            to-day I contribute this letter to your venerable paper for the perusal
                            of the Böglish-reading world. </p>
                        <p>In my previous letter I had stated that the charitable Society, Orwa
                            Woska, had decided to dismiss all the non-paying papile, and I allege
                            to-day that the matter has been put into force. The mothers and fathers
                            of the miserable pupils made many endeavours that their children might
                            be taken back to the schools, but their efforts were fruitless.</p>
                        <p>To illustrate the orgelty of this body of men who have taken over
                            themselves the duty of teaching the community, I cite a story concerning
                            the father of a papil. This msd, seeing that his son would be deprived
                            of going to school, went to the members asking for their mercy. He was
                            asked about his work as well as his pay. He indicated that he is a'
                            daily-paid labourer of P.T. 8 in the Customs. He was told that it would
                            be much better for him to tear his son an art or employ him in some
                            place. The man, seeing that it was impossible to send his son back to
                            the school, left them in despair.</p>
                        <p>How, my dear venerable reader, can a poor boy learn industries before
                            knowing how to read and write, and where are the industrial schools for
                            the poor. The Mobamed Ali industrial school is as yet in the lap of the
                            nursery. How can such a boy be attached to any work, especially in the
                            present day.</p>
                        <p>I turn now to our National Prese, which kept the secret from the public,
                            and which feigns to be the only organ of reform. Instead of dealing in
                            idle discussions like that which occurred between the "native" "Al Lewa"
                            and the "professor" "Al Mosyad," it would be more interesting to convey
                            to the public such important news. Such serious matter spread in all the
                            parts of the city would at least attract some attention of the
                            correspondents of these national journals, who, alas ! tarn a deaf ear
                            to those who accused them.</p>
                        <p>I marvel at their silence ! Are they chloroformed or duped ? Or what?</p>
                        <p>If such were our case we would be sure of our retrogression.</p>
                        <p>Where is "Al Minbar” who feigos to be independent, free in his views and
                            acting for the progress of the country ? Everyday we notice that the aim
                            of these papers is to exaggerate matters whether wrong or right. Bat how
                            in such &amp; prodigious matter they are dumb I : If we tarn and have a
                            glance at the past, we immediately perceive that the charitable
                            institutes are becoming legs and less.</p>
                        <p>The Earl of Cromer, knowing the mainstay of our progress, invited the
                            fellaheen to create kuttabs and establish elementary schools. No one can
                            doubt that this is the only path to our happiness.</p>
                        <p>We hear now of the scheme of the University and the lavish subscriptions
                            for it. I advise those who are holding the reins of the scheme to change
                            the name of the "University" into the "Education of the Poor," who are
                            the greater part of the people.</p>
                        <p>In conclusion I consider it most necessary that the Ministry of Public
                            Instruction should lay its hands on the Orwa Woska Society and give as
                            an explanatory note of its accounts.</p>

                    <p>This pretty Matron has headache and backache, and her condition was
                        serious.</p>
                    <p>PE-RU-NA CURED.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. M. Brickner.</p>
                    <p>99 Eleventh Street, Milwaukee, Wis.</p>
                    <p>"A short time ago I found my condiiton very serious. I had headahces, pains
                        in the back, and frequent dizzy spells which grew worse every month. I tried
                        two remedies before Peruna, and was discouraged when I took the first dose,
                        but my courage soon returned. In less than two months my health was
                        restored." – Mrs. M. Brickner.</p>
                    <p>The reason of so many failures to cure case ssimilar to the above is the fact
                        that diseases peculiar to the female sex are not commonly recognized as
                        being caused by catarrh. </p>
                    <p>Catarrh of one organ is exactly the same as catarrh of any other organ. What
                        will cure catarrh of the head will also cure catarrh of the pelvic organs.
                        Peruna cures these cases simply because it cures the catarrh.</p>
                    <p>If you have catarrh write at once to Dr. Hartman, giving a full statement of
                        your case, and he will be pleased to give you his valuable adivce
                        gratis.</p>
                    <p>Address Dr. Hartman, President of the Hartman Sanitarium, Columbus, O.</p>
                    <p>For special directions everyone would read "The Ills of Life," a copy, of

                    <p>The Sudan Government will shortly dispose by Tender of about 400 Building
                        Sites at Port Sudan.</p>
                    <p>The sites will be Leasehold held at Annual Rents on Building Lease for Eighty
                        Years from 1st January, 1907. Rents will be payable only from date of
                        acceptance of Tender.</p>
                    <p>The Lease will be Perpetually Renewable at Revised Rents fixed in default of
                        Agreement by Arbitration at the end of each term of years.</p>
                    <p>In fixing the revised rents the value of Buildings erected by Lessees will

                        depression of spirits and want of energy for all the ordinary affairs of
                        life. Now, what alone is absolutely essential in all such cases is increased
                        vitality—vigour--</p>
                    <p>VITAL STRENGTH &amp; ENERGY</p>
                    <p>to throw off these morbid feelings, and experience proves that as night
                        succeeds the day this may be more certainly secured by a course of the
                        celebrated life-reviving tonic</p>
                    <p>THERAPION No.3</p>
                    <p>than by any other known combination. So surely as it is taken in accordance
                        with the printed directions accompanying it, will the shattered health be
                        restored,</p>
                    <p>THE EXPIRING LAMP OF LIFE LIGHTED UP AFRESH,</p>
                    <p>and a new existence imparted in place of what had so lately seemed worn-out,
                        "used up,” and valueless. This wonderful medicament is purely vegetable and
                        innocuous, is agreeable to the taste —suitable for all constitutions and
                        conditions, in either sex; and it is difficult to imagine a case of disease
                        or derangement, whose main features are those of debility, that will not be
                        speedily and permanently benefited by this never-failing recuperative
                        essence, which is destined to cast into oblivion everything that had
                        preceded it for this wide-spread and numerous class of human ailments.</p>
