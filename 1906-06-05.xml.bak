                    <p>"Count co man happy until ha is dead," said the sage of old. ‘Cjunt no Gsven

                        legislative assembly until honourable members have been safely pxoked off
                        home for the summer Reoess," a <cb n="6"/> cynioal politician might say at
                        the prWer.t time; for, so long as Parliament .is si ting, you never know
                        what s-orvy trick the’‘Out, may have up their sleeve for the confusion of
                        the "Ina.” It is in consequence of * that particular phase of the
                        uncertainty of human affsirs that the German Government has been badly
                        beaten in the Reichstag, jqgj whea that body was looking forward to
                        adjourning, until November. The cause of the trouble was the demand of the
                        Government for certain votes of credit for the military opera- tions in
                        South West Africa, and.the proposal to create a separate Colonial Department
                        to be oontJbiled by the Colonial Secretary of State. Now, although we
                        certainly do not know any- thing approachirg the sum total of the losses in
                        purse, in personnel,, and ih prestige which Germany has saffered in the
                        troublesome oolohial war in which she has been so long engaged in the vast
                        traots. cf South wbtt Africa o which her 11 tg Hi s, yet enough has leaked
                        out—in spite ot official precautions -to create a strong current of popular
                        feeling against the wh He colonial policy of the Empire. The remit was that
                        the Reichstag practi cally refused the whole of the credits required, Lr
                        black troops in East Afrioa,'Compeusafoi for losses to colonists, and
                        railway extension. Furthermore, the depities peremptori'y de- manded a
                        redaction in the numbers of the forces ia the field, and the complete
                        evacua- tion of the southern portion of the Colony, and refused the vote to
                        establish a Colonial 8scre- tary. This thoroagh-going policy - your Ger- is
                        nothing if not thoroagh—might pos- have been modified at the request of the
                        IXrector of the Colonial Department had not the government’s evil star shot
                        a ray of 8uggestion\|nto the brain of Colonel von Daimling, Government
                        Commissary, and suc- cessor-designate the tracalentVon Trotba. The gallant
                        ColoneNw a Prussian officer of the true ramrod school^^ho would have been
                        dear to the heart of the grb^t Frederick. Was the health of the troops bad
                        asked. Why certainly; it was simply terrible^wmrse than it had ever been
                        before. Bat that wsjSaHjthe more reason for not leaviug the railway in the
                        mud at Kabab." As~to the proposed evacuation of the south : “SJ long as I
                        have "lie honour to hold the command the south- “ern districts will not be
                        abandoned unless "my Emperor issues a command to that effect, "and it is he
                        alone who has to decide, and no “one else." Jast cmceive the effect of that
                        i>jup de cravache upon the oivilian shoulders of the deputies in general and
                        for the Social Democrats in ^rticalar! The game was up, the demands were
                        refased, and the House aljoarn ed. It is, of course, clear that Colonel Von
                        Deimling’s challenge to the Reichstag has resulted in a oonnter-chal’enge by
                        that assembly to the Kaiser and his Chancellor. The Imperial Diet challenges
                        the Imperial Colonial polioy, and, we may safely say, the entire policy, of
                        the powers that be for all matters not of a purely dome J tic nature. There
                        can, indeed.be no doubt that there is grave disodatent with the policy of
                        Qnrest and adventure which in the diploma- tic, as in the colonial, sphere
                        ha9 not tended to enhance the prestige of Germany, or to foster good
                        relations between her and other Powers. More than that: Colonel von Deimling
                        has gra- tuitously raised the whole question of the rela- / tions between
                        theCrown and tbelmperial Diet. By a onrioos coincidence we find the agent cf
                        the German Government praotioally paraphrasing the reply of the Russian
                        Government to the Dnma. There is the same note of absolute autooracy, the
                        same assertion of the ultimate snpremaoy of the Imperial will Now, if the
                        new-horn Russian Duma is not disposed to tolerate that pretension, it is not
                        to be sup- posed that the German Reiohstag, which is in the full vigour of
                        its five-and-thirty years’ life, will prove more submissive to a crude and
                        bratal assertion of the dootrine that the last word lies with "my Emperor."
                        Here, then, we have a situation which involves much larger questions than
                        any connected with the re- tention or abandonment of any portioL of a barren
                        and costly possession which is not so * much a jewel in the Imperial crown
                        as a cock's oimb on the cap of a Conrt fool. It really matters little
                        whether Germany retains her South-West Afrioan oolony or not j for, if there
                        is any jealousy in the Cape Colony of her presence on our fiink, that is due
                        rather to the sentimental feeling in favour of the geogra- phical unity of
                        British South Africa from the Zambesi to the sea, Thanks to drought, fever,
                        and the Kalahari desert, there is practically no strategical importance in
                        theGermanpossessicu of those regions as a menace to the Cape Colony. The
                        Garman?, therefore, may please them- selves as to what they keep or let go
                        in that luarter, and it is not surprising that they doubt whether the
                        present game is worth the vary costly candle. But Colonel von Deimling
                        —simple Prussian martinet that he is—has raised the whole question of the
                        constitutional ight of the German people to have a say in any matter of
                        world-polioy, small or great. He has thrown down a challenge which the
                        Reiohstag has taken np—promptly and hotly —and, though nothing, we suppose,
                        cf aoy vast importance will come of that challenge for the moment, yet
                        reoent proceedings in the Reiohstag may, some day, be looked back upon as a
                        milestone in the progress of the supreme struggle for the evolution of full
                        constitutional government for Germany, of the sort which is "nnderstanded of
                        the people" in lands where o'diers do not talk to the people’s represent-
                        atives about "my Emperor,”—"Pall Ma’l Ga-Zette. </p>

                    <p>Lord Cromer has sent the following reply to the delegation of the inhabitants
                        of Damietta, who laid their grievances before him :— Gentlemen,—I have
                        carefully considered the representations which yon have made to me on the
                        subject of the proposed admini¬strative changes afieoting the town if Da
                        mifctta, and I li.ve been made acquainted with the views entertained on this
                        question by His Excellency the Minister and by the Adviser to the Interior.
                        It is to be remembered that, in dealing with this matter, it is not 'only
                        the inte¬rests of the town of Damietta which have to be considered ; those
                        of the inhabitants of the rural districts in that neighbourhood have an
                        equal claim on the attention of JHis Highness’s Government. «It is hoped and
                        believed that the arrangement at which the Ministry of the Interior baa now
                        arrived, after a careful examination of the facts of the case and of the
                        arguments adduced, will he found to satisfy the very well- founded claims of
                        the latter, without in any way inflicting ii jury on the commer¬cial
                        prospects of yonr ancient and cele¬brated city. I have therefore expressed
                        my full concurrence in this arrangement, of the details of which you will be
                        informed in^ communication which is now being addressed to yon by the
                        Ministry of the Interior. I have little doubt that in a short while the
                        results of the system now to be inaugurated will have proved them¬selves
                        satisfactory, and that the inhabitants of Damietta will reoognise that the
                        fears which they have recently expressed were groundless.—I am, Gentlemen,

                        Bouth of Kordnfan Moudirieh, and the local garrison. Two Egyptian officers
                        and some men of the 12th Sudanese are reported to have been killed. No
                        particnlars explaining the incident, haw been as yet received, but a large
                        reinforce-ment has been despatched to Talondi from El Obeid, under the
                        command of BimbaQji, O’Connell Bey. White troops frontKhajftonm have been
                        sent to replace those oeqmtched from El Obeid. We understand that no
                        importance is attach¬ed to this affair by official circles. A riot between
                        black troops and Arab villagers is all that is believed to have occurred,
                        but troops are being sent to the spot to gnard again* t any farther
                        disturbance, and an enquiry will be held into the causes of the outbreak.

                    <head>THE PORTE AND TRIPOLI ANOTHER POSSIBLE CAUSE OF FRICTION </head>
                    <p>In a message from Constantinople a cor-respondent of the "Manchester
                        Guardian” points out another possible canre of cor A ct with Egypt which he
                        avers the Sultan is secretly preparing. The Porte has received,
                        he-tftates?\fron) the Tnrkish authorities in Tripoli, a report'whioh says
                        that Jarabub, in the frontier region be¬tween Egypt and the Benghazi
                        district, forms an integral part of that district, and farther that so far
                        the Kbedivial Government had not exercised there >any effective
                        adminis¬trative powers. The Saltan has therefore ordered the autho¬rities of
                        Benghazi qnietly to fend to Jarabub a small contingent of troops to take
                        possession of the district before Egypt taker steps to oconpy it. The
                        Benghazi authorities have received or-ders to act qniokly, because,
                        according to the information of the Porte, the Sennssi Sheikh has quitted
                        the oasis of Kufra and is return-ing to Jarahab, which the Turks obviously
                        wish to occupy before he gets there. When the Sheikh has abandoned Kufra the
                        Saltan has thoughts of oooapyiug the oasis. The Ottoman Government attaohes
                        so much importance to keeping these movements secret that the authorities iu
                        Tripoli and Benghazi have been instructed to refuse the usual permits to
                        foreign explorers and travellers. The frontier line between Tripoli and
                        Egypt is uncertain, bat in praotioe it appears to be generally accepted that
                        Jarabub is in Tripoli. Jarabub is important both as a strategic point ar.d
                        as the saored place of the S9nussi, for the founder of the society, Sidi
                        Mohamed, lies boned there. His son is now the head of the sooiety, and in
                        1894 moved with several thonsand followers from Jarabub to the oasis of
                        Kufra, from which the correspondent now describes him as returning. The
                        Senussi are bitterly opposed, to Europeans and their civi¬lisation. </p>

                    <p>CHEAPER POSTAGE. REDUCTIONS MADE BY POSTAL CONGRESS. </p>
                    <p>In the House of Commons last Tuesday, Mr Bux’ou informed Mr. W. Benn that,
                        al-though the British de'egates failed to obtain a redaction in the initial
                        postage rate of 2|d. to foreign countries, they were successful in
                        persuading the congress to adopt two con-siderable concessions to the
                        public—the one as regarded the initial weight allowed for foreign letters
                        and the other as regarded the ohargea on heavier letters. In reference to
                        the first point, wlnn~the new Postal Union Convention of Rome took effect
                        next year the unit of weight would be doubled, so that the existing postage
                        of 2$d. to foreign countries would prepay a letter weighing up to one ounce,
                        instead of up to only half an onnee as at pre¬sent. This concession would
                        embrace all letters sent under the Imperial penny post to any part of the
                        British Empire and to Egypt, which letters at present most not exoeed half
                        an ounce for a penny. Thna a letter, say, to France, weighing an ounce,
                        wonld in fntnre cost for postage 2|d. instead of 5d., and a similar letter
                        to India and the Colonies would cost Id. instead of 2d. As regarded the
                        seoond point, at present an additional 2jd. was charged for every additional
                        half an onnoe after the first. In fatnre the postage on foreign letters
                        exceeding an ounce would be reduced to l|d. foreaoh additional onnoei after
                        the initial rate of 2}d. on the first ounce had been paid. Thus a letter to
                        France weighing 2oz. wonld be chargeable with a postal rate of 4d.—namely,
                        2|d. plus ljd.—instead of lOd. as at present. Similarly a 2oz. letter to
                        India, the Colonies, and Egypt would cost only 2d. instead of 4d. A further
                        usefal postal reform which was adopted on the motion of the British
                        delegates was the introduction of a reply ooup'on, a little postal order to
                        bearer, exchangeable in any country for a union postage Btamp. Farther, the
                        transit rates had been reduced and sim¬plified. He thought the British
                        delegates were to be congratulated on the general success which had attended
                        their efforts.</p>

                        CORRESPONDENT). </p>
                    <p>Beyrout, May 28. Since writing last we have had two events of public interest
                        : 1st, the Kermesso given ip the garden of Rnstem Pasha, under the patronage
                        c f the Governor General of Mount Lebanon and Madame Muzaffer Pasha, in aid
                        of the hospital for the Baabda prisoners ; 2dly, the grande fote organised
                        by the Socfotd Fran^aise de Bienfaisance in favour of its works, and in aid
                        of the victims of the Coorrfores oatastrophp, under the patronage of M.
                        Fonqae\ Daparo, the French Consul- General, and the Deputies of the French
                        com-munity The f irmer was a snccess financially— over 12,003 frs. having
                        been collected—bnt otherwise was a failure for various reasons, amongst
                        which was the olondy and rainy weather, which many of the well-known members
                        of sooiety, who felt dnty-bonnd to make an appearance, took as an exouse for
                        non-attendance. The latter ffite was a snccess in every way, and ended with
                        a ball. I had not the pleasure of attending this fote, but I am told that
                        the monologoes were one of the most successful features of the function, and
                        I do not wonder at the fact, for I had once before heard Mr. Wiet, the
                        French Vioe-Consnl, deolaim at a private soiree, and the warmth, life, and
                        enthusiasm he puts in his recitals, and the music d intonation of his voice,
                        were delightfully inspiring. The Talk of tho Day. The talk of the day hero
                        is the eleotrio tramway for Beyroat and the supplementary project of making
                        of the Bandy tracts, about three miles south of Beyrout, within the Leba¬non
                        frontier, a second Helonan. A rumour with some element of seriousness in it
                        has been in oircnlation for some weeks past that Nejib Pasha Melhanfo had
                        obtained the concession for an electric tramway for Beyroat, and disposed of
                        it to a Belgian company for 900,000 francs.The figure does seem exorbitant,
                        but it has been actually affirmed to ma by the receiver of the telegraphic
                        mesiage, who is a well-known man, and who has the management of an important
                        concern which is apt to be vitally affeoted by the realization of the
                        eleotric tramway scheme. It is stated that the Gas Company of Beyrout has,
                        according to its firmaD, the exclusive right ami monopoly of lighting the
                        town, and if this' is so it may make a good round sum from the tramway
                        company against the cession of this right to it. It is said that despite the
                        very able management and initiative of the present director, and the running
                        of the company’s business on striotly economic lines, the concern is not yet
                        a paying one, so that a mutually profitable entente with the electrio
                        company should be welcomed by the shareholders of the Gas Company. Indeed,
                        the principal shareholder (who praotioally owns the concern) left a few days
                        ago for Constantinople, apparently with this object in view. Much as we
                        sympathize with Mr. S. Eid for his possible failure in his initial attempt
                        at obtaining/the concession we welcome the news^of Nejib Pacha Melha- nfo’s
                        reported snccass/’Uofar, however, it is said that the Imperial iradd has not
                        been pro-mulgated, and in fact the official gazette of Constantinople has
                        not yet published the news. Egyptian Financiers Interested. The rumour about
                        the supplementary pro-ject of transforming the sandy dunes of the Uzai into
                        a garden oity started in the following shape? An Anglo-Egyptian company was
                        said to have bought the vast property there owned by the Tabet brothers and
                        their partners, with the view of slotting them on the same lines as the
                        Meadi of the Delta Land Co. Since then a modified version of the story has
                        been ourrent. The Tabets and their partners were to under¬take the
                        allotment, interesting in the scheme at the same time a set of Egyptian
                        financiers. There is co donbt that, were the eleotrio tramway to extend a
                        line to that well-known 8nbarban district—and the extension would not cost
                        muoh, in view of the short distance — the scheme would prove a brilliant
                        success. The exceptionally healthy climate—the place being surrounded by
                        vast pine forests, olean sandy tracts, and the sea beyond—the superb
                        panoramio views commanded from every spot, and last, but cot least, the faot
                        of the land being within the Lebanon frontier, enjoying a peaceful rule and
                        a practical exemption from taxation, all these should constitute manifest
                        advantages that every sensible oitizen of Bsyront should be quick to
                        appreciate. Recrudescence of Lawlessness. The repeated commission reoently
                        of lawless aots in the shape of nootnrnal assaults and murders on innocent
                        and respeotable Christians, makes a residence in the Lebanon within a lew
                        minutes ran from Beyroat a universal desider¬atum. People are wondering at
                        this sadden recrudescence of lawlessness, and some talk of designs on the
                        part of Moslems to repeat the bloody drama of Raohid Bey’s time and love to
                        associate thesehostile anti-Christian manifesta¬tions with the Akaba affair.

                    <p>BXCITINO FINISH. This cricket match—the fourth between Cairo and Alexandria
                        this year—was'clayed on the A. C. C.’8 ground yesterday. Coniiddrable
                        in¬terest was taken in the game, the Alexandria' XL being very strong in all
                        department*. Cairo had not quite their best side, but\ere also abla to put a
                        good XI. io the field\ Play began at 11.0 a.m. and off the firsts, ball
                        bowled—a bad longtop—Capt. Palmer, ' who opened the innings for Alexandria
                        with MacLaren, was well canght at square fog. Off the next Deans was missed.
                        Play then ruled quiet till 20, when Deans was caught at mid-off. H. P.
                        Carver aud McLaren then took the score op to 44, when Capt. Bostock relieved
                        Wyatt, who had bowled well but with bad luok and got MacLareu oaught at •
                        extra cover off his3 first ball. Marsden offered a stubb ire defence and the
                        score rose slowly to 70, when Carver was oaught in trying to hook. At 78
                        Graves-’going on at lha top end got Marsden canght at the wicket and Capt.
                        Laing fog before. • Peel and Jltreet kept up their wickets till lanch-time
                        Wien the soore was 106 for six wiokets. The Cairo fielding was good and the
                        bowling steady. After lnnch Street and Mastard made a good stand of 55 runs
                        when Mastard was oat l.b.w. He played a good forcing' innings, hitting one
                        six, nine fours, aud two singles. Street was out direotly afterwards for a
                        very good effort of 42 and Barnard being well canght by Wyatt, the innings
                        closed for 181. Sergt. Simpson, Capt. Bostook, and Graves met with most
                        enooesR with the ball. Wyatt, whose fielding" was remarkably good, had no
                        look as a bowler. Cairo began badly to the bowling of Deans and Capt. Laing,
                        bat Capt. Bostook and Stoat improved matters, bringing the soore . to 67,
                        when Bostook was brilliantly canght by Marsden at mid-on. A collapse
                        followed in spite of some free hitting by Capt MoMurdo and Wyatt, and with
                        nine men out 118, owing to some good work by Mastard and Capt. Laing, the
                        match eeemed over. Sergt. Simpson and Drawer, how¬ever, refused to be
                        intimidated by the situation and scored as freely as if they had gone in
                        first and when at 155 Drower gave a hard chance to Carver at deep square leg
                        which was not accepted and followed up with several foars it sedmqd that
                        Cairo hada chance. Sergt Simpson made some fine leg hits and with the score
                        at 177 Drower with a strong on-drive tied the soores. In the next over
                        Sergt. Simpson played the ball si iwly to the off and oalfod.his partner for
                        a short ran which came off and Cairo had won a desperately close and
                        exoiting game. The innings closed for 195 when Drower was bowled. He had
                        eight fours to his credit in a remarkably good innings. Sergt. Simpson, who
                        was not ont for 44, hit a five and seven fonrs and played good, free and
                        confident cricket all throngh. Soore and analysis :— ALEXANDRIA. Capt

                        Attendu que les demandeors modifiant les motifs invoqnds par eux dans leur
                        demande, ddolarent qu’ils BO revendiquent pas la propridtd actne'.le des
                        biens Daira, qui a dtd transfdrde b l’Etat, etc Omissis. Attendu que cette
                        reconnaissance du droit de propridtd de l’Etat exclut toute idde de
                        con¬fiscation et qu’il y a lieu d’dtre tout surpris qa’aprds avoir reooflnu
                        qu’il n’y avait pas eu de confiscation, les demandeors avancent qu il y a eu
                        one vdritable expropiiation pour oauss d’utilitd publique. Attendu qu’il n’y
                        a euy ni confiscation ni exportation pour cause d’utilitd publique, d’autant
                        plus que la Commission qui a mani- festement montrd son intention de

                        confiscation ni d’exportation, rien ne l’empechant de laisser les biens

                        restant propridtaire de sea biens. Qu’en ddolarant l’E:at propridtaire des
                        biens de S A. Ismail paoha et en mettant b sa charge toutes les dettes de ce
                        dernier, elle n’a agi que dans l’jntdrct personnel de S. A. le Khddive et de
                        ses ordanciers personnels. Attendu que les demandeors soutiennent en qae'que
                        sorte, b titre subsidiaire, que l’Etat ayant fait un bdndfice dnorme par
                        suite de la plus value des terres il n’est pas dquitable qu ’il s’enrobissa
                        indument et qu’il y aurait lieu de fairo application i lear dgaid des
                        dispositions de Part. 11 du code oivil mixte. Attendu que depuis la
                        promulgation de la loi de liquidation, l’Etat est devenu proprid taire des
                        biens des D liras Sanieh et Khassa, et est devenu auaei le vdritable
                        ddbiteur des ord¬anciers de ces Dairas. Qu’il sensuit que si la valeur de la
                        propridtd foucidre avait baissd, le gouvernement n’aurait pu avoir aucun
                        recours contre Ismail pacha et ses hdritiers, qu’en outre comme propridtaire
                        et ddbiteur il a tout le droit de bdndficier de la plus value dont s’agit.

                    <p>ARCHITECTURE AND PROGRESS</p>
                    <p>Mr. Williams Lecture (Continued from Saturday)</p>
                    <p>The great architectural works of the ancients whi-h have come down to ns are
                        mainly butUingB that were erected in honour of the religion of the builders
                        or perhaps as much to their own glory as that of the religion ,-h they
                        practised. Iu later times two great rjigi.,11" of the world, rame’y the
                        Chris’iar. aLll the Mohamedan, have left to ns some master monuments in
                        organic architecture. '1'he appointment of Christianity as the’ state
                        religion of the Roman world aud the subse- 4 ient fall of the Roman Empire
                        gave Bcope for new thought. The meo of the north and -t the mountains came
                        upon the effete Roman world with new vigour and a fresh, untu¬tored,
                        robrsti.ess of thought and action. The old formalism was dead, the Greek
                        architec- t ral shackles, forged by the Roman?, had fallen off, and
                        architeotarally men were free. Tho new religions required buildings, and
                        forthwith there were born the Byzantine and Romanesque, which later on were
                        followed by the Arabio, Saracenic or Moorish, and Gothic. ‘ {’he Christian
                        art of the deoliuing empire,” aays Ruskin, ‘ was divided into two great
                        branches: ‘Western and Eastern.’ One oentred iu Rome, the other at
                        Byzantium, of which the one is the early Christian Romanesque, properly so
                        called, and the other, carried to a higher imaginative perfection by Greek
                        work¬men, is distingu’shed from it as Byzantiue.” Here at last we see the
                        Greek workman unshackled and at the confines of the east and the west they,
                        in the 6th century, rear their splendid church, dedicated, very properly, to
                        the Holy Wisdom, commonly known as Santa Sophia, and now filling the useful
                        office of a splendid Mohamedan mosque. The Byzantine style spreac into
                        Venice and even to Alexandria. St. Mirk’s, Venice, was erected at the end of
                        the 10th century, over the body of St. Mark, which had been obtained from
                        Alexandria, perhaps, a hundred years before, when the Caliph of the day,
                        wanting marbles for a mosq’ie or a residence, ordered the destruction's/ tqe
                        then St. Mark’s chnroh, probably a fine Byzantine building. The Arahs were
                        thus unconsciously led to work in the style of the Bjzantiie3 and, in turn,
                        the Byzantine workmen and Venice gave the architecture there an Arabio
                        flavoar, as may be seen by the remains of horseshoe .and 'pointed arches.
                        There are vestjges of Byzin- tine architecture to be seen in the Alexandria
                        and Cairo Museums, and the other day basket-work capital in marble was dug
                        out of a foundation near the rue Adib, the ornamen; tation of which is
                        singularly like some capitals to be found at Ravenna. The development of
                        architecture continued to progress, the Arabs developing, in Spain and
                        Cairo, and wherever they settled down to build, a style which has become
                        pecu¬liarly their own and in time there arose suoh beautiful mosqaes as
                        these of Sultan Hassan and Kaid Bey. In the 12tb, 13tb, &amp; 14tb
                        cen¬turies orgauic architecture had free play and reached its zmith. In
                        Britain it was distin¬guished b78traighttorwardne3S in construction, honesty
                        in the use of materials, and purity and beauty of form. At first the work
                        WAS heavy and massive. Its eolnmns were great piers built up of small
                        stones, as at Malvern and Tewkesbary.Its tower?, loopholed and em brasored
                        standing fonr square to^storm and enemy alike and its heavy defensive work,
                        in tirpe, gave place to delicately veined and rib bed vaulting which covered
                        tl}3 great nayes of chnrohes like thebroidered veil of a fairy. The
                        ornamentation WAS as trne as it was often profuse. It was organio, tfiat is
                        to say, not applied rr pasted ornament. The mason revelled in his
                        work,Whatever drawbacks the madimval times presented to the lives of the
                        worker, bis work was full of pleasnro, There is not a moulding, that the
                        working of L, in the best Gothio period, did not give joy to tin worker. If
                        at any period in our history there was a time wli3n tho work was worth doing
                        and a source of happiness the woiker as well as to the user, then that time
                        was the 18th century— in building certainly. </p>

                    <p>PITCH OF THE PRESS</p>
                    <p>THE EDUCATION BILL CLAUSES. The Government oan now congratulate them selves
                        on havieg carried through Committei what Mr. Birrell calls the “spinal
                        oorAUfcfif the measure. On paper it is not a ver instalment, but then as we
                        have been rernin el, it affirms great principles. The Govern- ment have
                        ca-ried it unaltered, as it was to be expected that they would do. They have
                        not indeed, made much attempt to treat the amendments seriously.'preferring
                        to say as a rule, that they were more appropriate to the clauses that came
                        next. It is, no donbt, a feature of the Bill that very similar issues can be
                        raised oo all its early clauses. (“Times.”) No Secularism. People do not
                        want the elementary ducation of this country to be purely secular ; they do
                        not wish to break the old association between the State .and the teaching of
                        religion to the young. Of oonrse, it was open to Mr. Maddison and his
                        friends to say, as they did say, that religions instruction might still be
                        given in the schools, despite their amendment, though not in sohool hours,
                        and cot at the public expense. Bot it was universally allowed that for all
                        practical pur- poses the carrying of Mr. Madditon’s amend- ment won’d have
                        banished religious teaching from the schools of the people, inasmuch as
                        instruction not given within sohool hoars is sure to languish. (‘
                        Telegraph.”) Tho Endowment of Nonconformity, Thodebatoon the first clause of
                        the Educa- tion Bill has fully justified ths hardest things which have been
                        .-aid about the Bill. It is no mit-use of words to speak of the ‘endowment
                        of Nonconformity’ or ‘the destruction of Church schools.’ The Bill effects
                        both these objeots, so dear to that section of the Government’s supporters
                        which in this matter of education it fears most. . . . Tin passage of the

                        deolino of religious belief. (“Morning Post”)International Arbitration. The
                        oongrefs of members of Parliament and others favourable to international
                        arbitration, which is to meet in London in the last week of July, will have

                        Germany are growing more and more sceptical of the advantages of the system
                        which has produced the protracted and in¬glorious war in German S. W.

                        peculiar, certainly. Stunsel had not surrendered, he might have been there
                        yet. (“Qlobe.”) The Colonial Conference. It is evident that Lord Elgin has
                        nothing to propose. Therefore, he must be calling the Conference for the
                        purpose of learning what the Colonies have to advise for the common good
                        Wore they to respond by sending delegates to urge the establishment of
                        preferential trado relations with the Mother oountry, the Confer ence would
                        be embarrassing to the British Government, although it would probably evoke
                        a sympathetic feeling in the British people. (' Mail and Empire,” Toronto.)

                    <p>Charles Dickens's yonnger. daughter, Mr?. Perngini, has set ber?elf io the
                        Jane- number of the “Pall. Mali Magazine” to throw very welo me light upon
                        the one enigma of her father’s works, “The Mystery of Edwin Drood,’’ the
                        story he left ha’f told at the time of his Mrs. Peragini’s first husband
                        designed the cover for the novel, and she herself helped to tend the
                        novelist when the labour of the book was bringing his life to an untimely
                        end. She now explains that the story was so in- eparablc in her mindfrom her
                        father’s memory that she coaid never bear to look on it until lately; bat
                        finding that so much gnesawork has been expended on the invention of a
                        sequel,]: ?he gives her reasons for believing that tfie theory of John
                        Forster, the biographer, is the right one, and that all others suggesting
                        Drood’s resurrection are futile and uqreaeoi able. My father, she writes,
                        told his plot to^Mr. Forster, as he had been accustomed to tell his plots
                        for years past ; and those who knew him must feel it impossible to believe
                        that in this, the last year of his life, he should suddenly become
                        underhand, and we might say treacher¬ous, to his old friend, by inventing
                        for his private edification a plot that he had no in¬tention of oarrying
                        into execution. That he did not write to Mr. Forster to tell him of any
                        divergence from his second plan for the book we all know, and we know also
                        that my eldest brother, Charles, positively declared that he had heard from
                        his father’s lips that Edwin Drood was dead. Here, therefore, are two very
                        important witnesses to a fact that is still doubted by those who never met
                        my father, and werentfver impressed by the grave sincerity with which
                        hewould\have given this assurance. Havieg known both Mr. Forstor and my
                        brother intimately, I oannot for a moment believe that either of them would
                        speak or write that which he did not know to be strictly true : and it is on
                        these grounds alone that I think I have a right to be heard when I insist
                        □pun the assertion that Edwin Drood was undoubtedly murdered by his uncle
                        Jasper. Upon reading the book once more, as have already told, after an
                        interval of a great number of years, the story took such entire possession
                        of me that -for a long time I could think of nothing else j and one day, my
                        aont, Miss Hogarth, being with me, I asked her if she knew anything more
                        definite than I did as to how the ending was to be brought about. My aunt
                        Baid that she knew absolutely nothing, but she told me that shortly before
                        my father’s death, and after he had been speaking of some difficulty he was
                        in with his work, without explaining what it was, ?he found it impossible to
                        refrain from asking him, "I hope yon haven’t really killed poor Edwin Drood
                        I” To which he gravely replied, I call my book the Mystery, not the History,
                        of Edwin Drood." And that waa all he would answer. ... y That my father’s
                        brain was more than usually dear and bright during the writing of1 Edwin
                        Drood,” no one who lived with him could possibly doubt; and the
                        extraordinary interest he took in the development cf this story was apparent
                        in all that he said or did, and was often the subjeot of conversation
                        between those who anxiously watched him as he wrote, and tearel that he waa
                        tiying his strength too far. Any attempt to Btay him, however, in work that
                        he had undertaken was as idle as stretching one’s hands to a river and
                        bidding it cease to flow ; and bey end a few remon strances now and again
                        urged, no such attempt was made, knowing as we did that it would be entirely
                        useless. And so the work sped on oarrying with it my father’s few remaining
                        days of life, and the end came all foo soon, to one who never oeased to
                        labour for those who ware dear to him, in the hope of gaining for them that
                        which he was destined never to enjoy. And in my father’s grave lies buried
                        the seoret of his story </p>

                    <p>TURCO-PERSIAN FRONTIER DISPUTE.</p>
                    <p>BASIS OF THE SETTLEMENT. Lord Reay asked the Under secretary for Foreign
                        Affairs in the House of Lords last week, if he could give any information in
                        regard to the settlement of the frontier dispute between Turkey and Persia
                        near Vazueh and Soj-Bula. Loid Fitzmaurice, in the course of bis reply’ said
                        a diepute had arisen between Persia and Turkey in regard to the boundary in
                        the neighbourhood of the place3 mentioned by the noble lord, in the Knrd
                        districts, on the borders ot those two countries. Negotiations were now
                        proceeding, and there was eveiy reason to believe that an amicable
                        settlement of the question would be arived at. The Government understood
                        that the question would now be decided locally between the two Governments,
                        and they had received informa¬tion that a Persian Commissioner bai left to
                        meet the Turkish Commissioner on the iron tier. This evidently was a most
                        desirable solu¬tion. The question had been -.treated at Con stantinople, and
                        the Persian Ambassador there had had the benefit of receiving advice from
                        the British and Rastian Ambassadors in regard to the matter. In J 851 Lord
                        Palmerston proposed that the general line of frontier between Turkey and
                        Persia should be traced by the agents of those two Powers at Constantinople,
                        assisted by Commissioners, in conformity with the stipnla •iir.s of the
                        Treaty of Etzeronm cf 1847 8, having doubtful localities to be settled in
                        detail in the future. The Russian Govern-ment agreed to this propose1, and
                        the work of surveying the o >untry from Moont Ararat to the Persian Gulf wvs
                        then commenced. When this was done the preparation of a ap of the Tarco
                        Persian frontier, embraoing territory 700 miles in length by from 20 to 40
                        miles broad, was put in hand. This work lasted from November, 1857, to
                        March, 1865 aud would doubtless be the basis of the present settlement </p>

                    <p>THE “OPTIONAL” PROPOSALS DEFEATED.</p>
                    <p>’The voting on the second report of the Stu¬dies and Examinations Syndicate,
                        proposing a bifarcafion of studies info scienoe and letters, and making
                        Greek optional for science men, was continued in the SenateHouee, Cambridge,
                        last week, and the result was declared as under:— Non-Placet 747 Placet 241
                        Majority against 606 The vote on the first report in March, 1905,
                        wasNon-Placet, 1557 ; Placet, 1055. Two senior wranglers and two brothers
                        were seen voting in opposite ways. The Master of the Rolls paired for the
                        Non- Placet, whilst Mr. Justice Kennedy would have come np to vote against,
                        if votes had been wanted. The following were among these who voted :—-
                        Placet.—The Bishop of Ely, the Master of Christ’s, the Master of Corpus, and
                        Professors Sir George Darwin, V. H. Stanton, Howard Marsh, and Sims
                        Woodhead. Non Placed. - Lord Macnagh‘er, Lord Bray brooke, the Master of
                        Clare, Mr. R. Horton Smith, K.C., Mr. J. £. P. Rawlinson, K.C., M.P., S. W.
                        Qcayle Jones (late Chief J aBtioe of Sierra Leone), and Professors Swete and
                        ald^teib. It is understood tint unless the oounoil submita^a_£race for . the
                        oontinuanoe of the life of the Studies Syndicate it will lapse. Now that the
                        Studies Syndicate and its proposals no longer stand in the way, the
                        Non-placet party will at once push forward the soheme of reform which they
                        have inau¬gurated—namely. a joint Oxford and Cam-bridge matriculation
                        examination, in which shall be inolnded compulsory scienoe and compulsory
                        Greek. There is a pretty universal feeling that reform is possible, but not
                        the partionlar reforms which have been advocated by the Studies Syndicate on
                        the last two occasion reforms which would aot up'oo thc schools as well as
                        the university — a mattefi entirely neglected in both the proposals wnich
                        have lately been before the Senate. It is held to be most important that
                        whatever is done should be calculated to raise the standard of every average
                        boy in all the schools which can be influenced by the university.</p>

                        celui-ci n'opère bien que lorsqu'il est pris avec de bons aliments et des
                        boissons fortifiantes, telles que vin, café, thé. Chacun choisit, pour se

                        occupations. La fatigue de la purgation étant annulée par l'effet de la
                        bonne alimentation, on se décide aisément à recommencer autant de fois que
