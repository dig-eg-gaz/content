                        sole object of assisting British trade in the country. The services of the
                        Chamber are always at the disposal of any member desiring information on
                        trade matters generally, including the question of appointing suitable
                        agents. As no fee is charged for such advice, it is obviously in th
                        interests of all British traders here to become members, especially when it
                        is remembered that the annual sub- scripting is merely the nominal one of

                    <p>Has the recent beat wave, which has visited most of the European capitals,
                        affected the judgment and the temper of politicians and publicists ? It
                        would really seem as if such were tho case, for never within our
                        recollection has a “silly season” been marked by the arrival of such
                        enormous flocks of the political and journalistic canard. And the canard is
                        a canard sauvage, this summer—and an uncommonly savage duck at that. The
                        atmosphere is lurid with wan in being, and with rumours of wars to Ke:
                        everybody is crouching for a spring at somebody else’s throat, and, if
                        things do not quiet down a little, it will be impossible for Edwin and
                        Angelina to take a trip in a Margate pleasure-boat this August, without some
                        sapient German scribe discovering that the British Navy is about to seise a
                        naval base on the coast of Switzerland or of Bohemia. The pother which is
                        being made about the owning visit of a British fleet to the Baltio ia the
                        most curious case in point. Things hare certainly come to a pretty pass when
                        we find a r esponsible Berlin newspaper suggesting that a combination of the
                        Northern Powers should issue a ukase — no, not a ukase (ukases are not
                        exactly the mode just nowX but the same thing in German — f orbidding entry

                        the new "combine." We should hare thought that Europe had had trouble enough
                        with one mare clasusum - the Black Sea ; but no. Such is the "impishness of
                        circumstances" that no sooner has Russia left off trying to break out of the
                        Black Sea (having no tools left wherewith to effect that operation) than lo
                        I up jumps the. "Reiohsbota,” and proposes that a similar preserve should be
                        created for the benefit of the Powers which lie "contagious,” as they say in
                        Ireland, to the Baltic waters. And, inasmuch as Russia, Sweden, Norway, and
                        Denmark have no navies worth mentioning, it is for tha benefit of Germany
                        alone that this delightful arrangement is to be called into existence. All
                        this because a British fleet is going to take a summer cruise where it has
                        often cruised before, and will, no doubt, often cruise again in time to
                        come. We are glad to find, however, that a little consideration of the
                        mattes' has not impelled the majority of our German comtemporaries to join
                        in the cry. They have, no doubt, the sense to see that the pretension to
                        make the Baltic a</p>

                    <p>German lake i^praposterous ; that the many millions of British-borne British
                        trade in these waters has the right, if necessary, to British protection ;
                        that any attempt to forbid it such protection could only be successful by
                        force of arms ; and that such force is, aa yet, conspicuoos by its total
                        absence. We may take it for granted that we shall hear very little more of
                        the appearance of this particular sea serpent in the Baltic Sea.</p>
                    <p>This pretension to divide the world's waterways into "spheres of influence”
                        for the benefit of particular nations is, obviously, one by which our German
                        neighbours would have nothing to gain and very much to lose. For, if British
                        warships were forbidden to go into the Baltic, German warships would have to
                        be forbidden to come out Again, if Germany and others were to dose the
                        Baltic, what would there be to prevent England and France from standing as
                        sentinels over the Straits of Dover? In short, the more one looks at the
                        Baltic sea- serpent the more impossible does it appear that the creature
                        should ever materialise. He should, therefore, he at once relegated to the
                        Maseom of International Absurdities, and should take his place therein cheek

                        the same time, it is impossible not to feel a certain amount of irritation
                        at the way in which this myth has been allowed to oome into being.</p>
                    <p>It is easy enough to demonstrate, afterwards, that all thwo “alaruuu aod
                        axoarsions" are much ado about nothing; but the fact remains that they breed
                        bad blood, and leave bad effects behind them. Thanks to all this foolish
                        talk, the German people are in danger of forgetting the hospitable reception
                        which the German squadron received last year, at Plymouth, and the previous
                        year at Here haven, and the perfect freedom with whioh German warships were
                        allowed to disport themselves in the waters of the Shetlands. It would be
                        well for Germany and England, and for the peaoe and prosperity of the
                        nations in gen oral, if Germans would lay to heart the solid £act that
                        England has no quarrel with Germany—for the simple reason that Germany

                    <p>The Hon. Whitelaw Reid, the new Amer ican Ambassador in London, ia a famous
                        ex editor and war correspondent, and his views and experience* of newspaper

                    <p>Imitate Lord Baoon, and take all knowledge for your province. The average
                        newspaper man on the great dailies is far better educated to day than twenty
                        yean ago, but the standard of qualification* is likely in the next twenty to
                        be higher still. Like moat of my oolleaguee on the Press, 1 hare little
                        faith in the “schools of journalism,” or in ”coarses in journalism,” or in
                        “leotures on journalism" either. The only place to learn the newspaper
                        business is in a newspaper office, and you have to be oanght tolerably yonng
                        to learn it at alL But the plaoe to aoquire some of the qualifications for
                        the work is the plaoe where oue gets the best general education the world
                        affords. Above all, it must be an oduoation that teaches you to see straight
                        and to think straight, and therefore its very foundation most not be
                        undermined by too eager a search for easy electives.</p>

                        and next know how to interest people in your way of telling these things,
                        and in your reasoning about them. Knowledge, real know ledge, not a
                        smattering of ths history of your oountry, ia indispensable, and no
                        historical knowledge will oome amiss. Constitutional and international law,
                        at least, one must know, and if one oan take a fall oourse, so much the
                        better. Modern languages will be most helpful, and in onr great newspapers a
                        reading know ledge of at least three of them—Prenoh, Ger man, and
                        Spanish—beoomo* every year more desirable. The literature of your own

                        express to the best advantage a nd in the fewest words whatever yon have to
                        say. You should know your own oountry. You should know foreign oountrie*,

                        and intelligence hardly exist else where. Yon should know the people, tho

                        condition, his needs, his ideas, and his notions—and yon should learn early

                        will be held at H.B. M's/ Consulate with a view to forming a committee which
                        will direct the Britsih Manufacturer;s Exhibition of Egypt, to which
                        refernce has already been made in our columns. The principle importers or
                        their representatives in Alexandria, have promised to be present and any
                        members of the British community who are interested in the aims of the
                        exhibition are cordially invited to attend. We hope that the exhibi- tion
                        will meet with the hearty support that it deserves.</p>
                    <p>Alhambra Theatre.- The Della Gaur- dia Italian dramatic company, which opened
                        at the Alhambra on saturday last, fully came up to the expectations which
                        had been formed of it. The piece chosen for representation, Sardou's Fedora,
                        does not perhaps give much scope to the whole of the caste, the burden of
                        the play fallin on the two principal interpreters. Signa. Clara della
                        Guardia and Sig. Andres Maggi were however quite equal to their task and
                        though here and there a few weak points were discenible in their delineation
                        of their roles, their performance was on the whiole deserving of all praise.
                        Signa. Dell Guardia was especially successful in the last act. She was here
                        as perfectly natural as one could be in similar circumstances. Her Fedora
                        was if notpowerful at least convincing as was the Loris Ipanoff of Sig.
                        Maggi.</p>
                    <p>Vitality Statistics.- From the last returns of the Statistical Office i Cario
                        we find that the births registered there for the week ending Saturday 29th
                        July, were 475. In the corre- ponding week of last year they were 534, which
                        was at the rate of 45.4 oer thousand of the population. The deaths during
                        the same period totalled 540, including 21 persons of European nationality.
                        Last year these latter numbered 533 of which 16 were Europeans, the rate
                        being 44.7 per mile for the native and 23.6 for the European portion of the
                        inhabitants. According to the last census of 1st June, 1897, there were then
                        35,219 European residents in the city and vicinity but in the absence of
                        consular statistics it is difficult to estimate the increase in the num- ber
                        of Europeans which it is weel known, has considerably augmented since that
                        date. In Alexandria the births during the week under review were 271,
                        against 259 last year, and the deaths totalled 283 including 22 Europeans
                        being at the rate of 50.2 per thou- sand for the former and 28.2 for the
                        latter portion of the inhabitants of our city the populattion of which was
                        estimated on the 1st January at 312,670 natives and 46,118 of European
                        nationality according to the last census.</p>

                        companied by M. Nicolopoulo, legal adviser to the patriarch. He announced
                        the approaching arrival at Constantinople of a new Abyesinian Mission headed

                    <p>THE YEMEN RISING</p>
                    <p>H. E. Shakir Psaha, President of the Inspec- tion Commission in the Yemen
                        telegraphs under date of the 30th ult. that according to the orders of
                        MArshal Feeizi Pasha three batta- lions with two gund left Menakha in July 6
                        for Burj-Zahid, where the agitators were concentrated. The Immperial troops
                        vigorously attacked the position occupied by the agita- tors on the road to
                        Sansa, which extended over three kilometres. About a thousand of the
                        agitators were driven on Mfhak leaving a great numebr of killed and wounded
                        behind them. On July 17 Marshal Feizi Pasha arrived ay Beit-el-Mehdi and
                        gave orders for the road to Salfour to be opened. Three battalions with two
                        guns advanced on this road and occupied the vilage of Beit-el-Nejd, one of
                        the most important positions on the road</p>
                    <p>Several points in the defile were gaurded in view of taking Beit-el-Jeride a
                        strong position where Said Hashim cheif of the rebels has entrenchedhimself.
                        Three battalions with two guns advanced on the enemy's line of defense which
                        extended over four kilometres and after a fierce fight, the rebels were put
                        to flight leav- ing a great number of dead on the feild, among them being
                        some of the leaders of the revolt. The losses to the Imperial troops are
                        quite unimportant. This last success of the troops has completely
                        demoralised the agitators.</p>

                    <p>Industrial business are not well organ- aed in Egypt, and there is rom in
                        this branch. for the adoption of western ways in the management and
                        financing of goos industrial concerns. Many of the shops and trading
                        bbusinesses can be amalgamated and controlled to the advantage of all
                        concerned. There is a need for estate and building companies who with good
                        management in CArio should earn very large profits.</p>
                    <p>All the catering businesses, hotal, res- taurants, flour and bread companies
                        aerated water manufactories and similar concerns require extension and

                        stores of all kinds. It is the duty of fincance to organise the matter and
                        to provide the necessary captial. The Cairenes will welcome such efforts,
                        and the success of trading concerns, if properly capitalised and properly
                        managed, will be colossal during the next decade.</p>

                    <p>A correspondent writes:- The Museum of Antiquities has just added to its
                        priceless collection some gold and solver ornaments and jewellery of the
                        Ptolemaic epeah which actual- ly wieigh L5oo in gold sovereigns but in value
                        exceed the sum of L4,000 according to a modest estimate made by one of the
                        Museum officials. (A very modest estimate if our list of the antiquites
                        discovered is accurate, Ed. D.G) An interestinf and perhaps unique discovery
                        is a full dinner service in silver.These treasures were brought up to CArio
                        uder a special gaurd and have arrived warly. They will be shown in the new
                        jewel-room which ahs been enlarged and most tastefully arranged by Brugech

                        remembered by CArio music-lovers for his exquisite rendering of the parts of
                        Guillaume, in Ambroise Thomas Mignon adn of Alfredo in La Traviata not ot
                        mention many other roles which he filled with consis- tent success. Some of
                        out contemporaries found a certian affection in jis methods. We can only say
                        that we have seldom or never heard a tenor whose voice possessed mroe

                    <head>NOTES FROM CYPRUS</head>
                    <p>REDUCED TELEGRAPHIC RATES</p>
                    <p>(From our correspondent) August 2 The Eastern Telegraph Company notifies the
                        fact that on and after the 1st August, the charge for the tansmission of
                        telegraphs from Cyprus to Europe will be reduced to one shilling per word.
                        Thsi should prove to boon to English residents in Cyprus as the cost of
                        sending telegraphms home falls heavily upon the not too highly paid official
                        who constitute almost the whole of the Englsih community in this island. It
                        is quite prrobable that the Eastern Telegraph Company is also acting wisely
                        in its own interests and it is not unlikely that the reduction reffer to
                        will be more than counterbalanced by the increased number of telegrams
                        transmitted.</p>
                    <p>NEW APPOINTMENTS</p>
                    <p>Mr. George Smith, REistrar General has been appointed British Delegates of
                        Evkaf in the place of Mr. Willfred Collet, C.M.G who has left Cyprus. Mr.
                        George Smith is not acting as REceives General asn also as Director of
                        Agriculture. A new English Chaplian is expected to arrive shortly. For some
                        time past the services of the Anglican Church have been taken by Rev. P.
                        Newham who as Inspector of Schools, is a resident official here and whose
                        help, most willingly given on many occasions and for long periods is
                        sincerely ap- preciated by members of the congregation. It is however
                        regrettable that for the last three years, no permanent chaplin has been
                        found. The Ven. eresford Potter who is Archdeacon in Cyprus has been able to
                        reside in the Island for only six monthd every year and there has been much
                        difficulty in finding a suitable chaplain to continue the regular work ofthe
                        Church throughout the year. It is hoped that a permanent and satisfactory
                        arrangement will now be made. The little English Church at Nioosia was
                        greatly im- proved this spring by the addition of an altar piece and the
                        reredos and the decoration of the chaucel in memeory of the late Archdeaon
                        Spencer. The work was designed and execut- ed in a most artistic and
                        tasteful manner by Mr. G. E. Jeffery, F.R.I.B.A and has given general
                        satisfaction.</p>

                        pleasant afternoon was spent A pontoon some 14 feet in height was available
                        on the occasion and some good diving was witnessed. Darton making the best
                        show. Some polo practice was afterawrds in- dulged in a plunging competition
                        followed. Vaccari the holder of the Club Championship cup won by him at the
                        last Aquatic Sporrts maintained the record but was closely followed by Mace.
                        The first trial proved a tie between these two, but eventually Vaccari won

                    <head>"FOR ONE NIGHT ONLY</head>
                    <p>It is seldom that the theatre pays us a visit down here beside Sedgemoor, but
                        this last day or two sundry, cheaply printed bills. posted at the forge on
                        gates, stiles, telegraph poles, and other placs of public resort, have
                        announced that "Miss De Courcy, direct from the London Theatres," and
                        supported by a "powerful No. 1 London Company, will present the pathetic
                        domestic drama "east Lynne" positivley for one night only". The news has
                        aroused bu tlittle discussion in the village to tell the truth, play-acting
                        does not appeal to us greatly- but we are surprised and some of us a little
                        indignant, we we hear that the viear has raised no objection to the of the
                        village schoolroom as playhouse in this occasion</p>
                    <p>The preformance is to begin at eight o'clock precisely, but it is a
                        quarter-past before I can get there, the sky is still full of the sun- set
                        and it seems a pity to go in. But, even as I hesitate, from the room, which
                        has been illuminated as brightly as may be, comes the tinkle of a piano amd
                        some one bursts into song. Not wishing to be late, I make with all speed for
                        the big door. It is locked. I kick it gently to arouse attention, and ask to
                        be let in. "Very sorry, sir" says a voice- the voice of the sexton and
                        clerk- "they've got the key; there's some o'us in here as wants to get out,
                        but we can't"</p>
                    <p>There is another small entrance round the corner serving the evening, I
                        suppose, for stage door. In answer ro my knock a tout middle- aged lady with
                        golden hair opens the door halfway. I explain my plight and that of my
                        friends who seek to escape; wherest she is profuse with apologies and gives
                        me to unders- tand that they are short-handed and have no one to keep the
                        door; hence the only plan is with a reasonable number of people have en-
                        tered to lock it. Again I repair to the big door. This time it is open.</p>
                    <p>Could you be true to eyes of blue If you looked into eyes of brown,</p>
                    <p>sings a lady younger than my friend of the stage door with seductive glances
                        at the audience while the piano bangs after her as hard as it can. The
                        listeners-composed of our stopkeeper, his wife, and little daughter, dressed
                        in their best, five farm labourers, the blacksmith and his small son, the
                        policemans's wife, adn the clerk together with some tiny children who ought
                        to have been in bed, as they are now sleeping soundly-are unexpensive. The
                        pro- blem does not seem to interest them; still they have paid their money
                        (some as much as sixpence) and sit on stolidiy. The songcomes to an end. THe
                        concert of which it formed part is apparently rendered necessary by the con-
                        densed nature of the pathetic domestic drama nest to be preformed. Otherwise
                        the entertain- ment might have failed to satisfy, in quantity at least those
                        who had paid sexpence. The stage is not very high; it is draped with ancient
                        hangings some of which had once, obviously, been white, and otehrs probably
                        blue. To the left, behind a screen, is the piano.</p>
                    <p>The curtian creaks up very slowly. and we settle ourselves to watch the play.
                        As I for one, have never seen it performed before and possess but a hazy
                        rememberance of the work on which it is founded I am naturally interest- ed
                        adn attentive. But, looking back on it now, it seems that very little could
                        have happened. It was in five remarkably brief acts and four phenomenally
                        long intervals, during the second of which three of the labourers arose and
                        plodded heavily out, only to find the door locked and escape impossible. One
                        of them returns to inquire of me what is best to be done. I make a dive at
                        the piano-which is playing feverishly-and beg for the loan of the key. The
                        tinkling stops, they key is handed over to me, I release the prisoners and
                        return to my seat to meditate on the play. THe policeman's wife is
                        explaining to her neighbour that she must not consider this as in any way
                        resmebling the London plays. The shopkeeper is staring up at the ceiling,
                        his wife is asleep and his little daughter is getting restive.</p>
                    <p>Up goes the curtain. The dialouge is scrappy and not very illuminating. There
                        is a stout lady whom I take to be Miss De Courcy. She wears blue spectacles
                        and so nobody seems to know who she is. This is confusing. Further confusion
                        arises from one person being liable to appear in two or three different
                        characters without our knowing it, for from exigencies of wardrobe it may
                        be, the changes of attire are trifling in such cases, and discrimination is
                        well-nigh impossible. Some- where near the end of the play the clothat the
                        back of the stge was pulled aside and revealed "little Willie" in heaven; at
                        least he was standing on a little pedestal with festoons of dingy blue
                        around him.</p>
                    <p>"God Save the King" is thumped out on the piano; the small children wake
                        suddenly and one begins to cry; then we make our way slowly to the door.
                        Outside the air is cool and refreshing and the full moon shines over the
                        wide plain, with it curious tree-clad island springing up here and there. At
                        the gate stands the policeman; waiting for his wife, who has stopped to
                        exchange theatrical reminiscences with the grocer's lady in the porch. I
                        inquire of him as to the legality of holding dramatic preformances in a
                        building not licensed for them and with such preacrious exists. He admits
                        that, of course, some- thing might be said-be would not deny that-but there
                        it was, and he did not suppose anyone was the worse for it. In which he
                        shines rather as a man than as an officer of justice. But askin' your pardon
                        sir" he says, "what did you think of the play ?" I reply that is seemed very
                        interestinf and he goes on "Yes that is a good play if you like; I mind
                        seeing it years ago at the Elephant and Castle. My wife's gone to-night. She
                        thinks a lot of the </p>

                        o'acting. I wished I could ha' gone to-night-it makes a bit of change for us
                        country folk, don't it, sir?"</p>
                    <p>I go slowly homewards past the school, now dark, with its slate roof gleaming
                        silver in the moonlight. A dog barks far away, and is answered by a circle
                        of barks near and far. I climb on to a stile and sit there for it is a shame
                        to turn in on a night like this. Presently, along the moonlit road, comes
                        trudging a little group of persons-five all told-two men, one of them
                        pushing a little loaded handcart, two women and a little boy. They are
                        talking to each other in low tones; as they pass me I recognise the "No. 1
                        London Company." They seemed tired-and no wonder; apparently they are
                        looking for somewhere to sleep. They wish me a cheery "Good night" and pass
                        round the bend. So our brief dramatic season is over.</p>

                        taken root in 22 States. Both yesterday's sittings were devoted exclusively
                        to the proposal to establish a Zionist settlement in British East Africa
                        Prof. Warburg (Berlin) submitted a report on the subject. THe report of the
                        committee of inquiry, composed of Major Hill Gibbons, Prof. Kaiser and Dr.
                        Wilbusche- witch the engineer who went out to East Africa last year to make
                        an investigation locally was unfavorbale tot he scheme and recommended that
                        the general commitee should take no action in the matter. Mr. Israel
                        Zangwill, on the other hand favored the acceptance of the offer of the
                        British Govern ment but only on condition that a district both of larger
                        extent and more suitable for settlement should be applied for. As over 100
                        delegates had given notice that they wished to speak on this question, a
                        long discussion en- sued as to the order of procedure. This led to such
                        great uproar that the president had several times to suspend the sitting and
                        leave the hall. In the afternoon the general debate continued. A majority in
                        favor of the rejec- tion of the British Government's offer is assur- ed.
                        Among the vice-presidents of the congress is Sir Francis Montefiore".</p>

                    <p>History selects quaint places for some of her notable scenes. A waysie inn
                        upon the weldt serves for the opening of peace of pourparlers in the war
                        between ourselves and the Boerse; the tiny courthouse of a Virginian village
                        is the setting of the scene in which ended the bloody war between North and
                        South America. Tilst famous still because of the peace which Napoleon and
                        Alexander signed there, remains an insignificant town; Waterloo has not four
                        thousand inhabitants; Malplaquet remains a tiny village; and Austerlitz is
                        in population no more than a parish. Bjoerkoe where the two Emperors have
                        been meeting is an island of whihc previously not one man in ten thousand
                        has heard.</p>
                    <p>If there had not been an island available for a background the German Emperor
                        would have beeen equal to the task of getting one establish- ed. For the
                        opening of the Kiel Canal the Kaiser is said jestingly to have declared that
                        he would like to drink a cup of coffee on an island in the middle of the
                        lake while watch- ing the fireworks. The stolid Hamburgers took him at his
                        words, and built him an island and there he drank his coffee and saw
                        fireworks wnough to statisfy even his appetite for the pyrotechnic. We have
                        an island which would have pleased his Majesty for his meeting with the
                        Tsar-an island owing no submission to the laws of England, to which it
                        belongs. S'eep Holm, in the Bristol Channel, is the spot; and there lived a
                        man and a bear. THe latter made an attack one day upon a tripper, who sought
                        damages in court. But there was no redress.Steep Holm belonging to no county
                        no sheriff had any jurisdiction over it.</p>

                    <p>Sir John Wolf Barry, presiding last week at the sixty-sixth half-yearly
                        ordinary general meeting of the Eastern Telegraph Comapny, said the increase
                        of traffic with India had been very satisfactpry. He attributed his, not to
                        the reduction of tariff, but to the late general prosperity of the Indian
                        Empire. As a result of the increased traffic, the reduction in the rate
                        referred to would be brought into opera- tion on August 1. The total
                        expensesfor the half-year exclusive of income tax amount- ed ot L232,00 as
                        against for the cor- responding period of 1904, L216,000 or an in- crease of
                        L16,000. THe net result of working for the year ending March 31 was that the
                        com- pany were able after making provision for reserve funds, to pay the
                        usual dividend of 5 per cent and a bonus of 2 per cent, and to carry forward
                        a small balance.</p>
                    <p>Mr. John Newton enquired whether the Tele graph Conference which was sitting
                        would be satisfied with the substantial reductions in the tariffs which the
                        company were going to make on the 1st inst.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman said the Conference had nothing to do with the reductions which
                        had been brought before the meeting. THe reduc tion in the tariff to India
                        was under a definite contract with the Indian Government, with which the
                        Pacific Cable Conference had nothing do do; nor had they anything to do with
                        the other reduction to Egypt.</p>

                            feet; they enclose some fine old palazzos of the fifteenth and sixteenth

                            the Palazzo Municipale and Cathedral recently restored. The Etruscan
                            tombs near Chiusi should certainly be visited; in one of them are some
                            curious painting of gladiatorial subjects. Etruscan antiquities have
                            also been found in the immediate neighbour- hood of the baths at

                            suppressed but still famous Benedictine Convent of Monte Oliveto Mag-
                            giore. As the distance is considerable, over two hours by trian and
                            about the same time is occupied in the drive at each end, it is
                            desirable and also very interesting to spend the night at the monastery
                            which can be done by obtaining permission beforehand. The fres- coes of
                            Luca Signorelli and Sodoma on th e walls of the monastery court are
                            world-famous in art circles; and athe convent of the four0 teenth

                            nieghbourhood, and one night entered an East-end pit, bristling with
                            pugnacity and pre- sumably with revolveres and knives. Before the first
                            curtain there was a lurid scene and the Tiddler was ejected after many
                            casualties. Some nights afterwards he returned penitent and was refused

                            During the pathetic scene the policeman, already deeply affected by the
                            dramatic conversion, broke down completely, left the theatre in tears,
                            and has been unable to face "East Lynne" since. Report has it the

                        <p>A few poignant letters by Shelley appeared at Sotheby's last week. Their
                            chief burden was the need for financial assitance, and the poet could
                            not have foreseen that these appeals would be worth money in the
                            twentieth cen- tury. The begging letters of poets would doubt less fill
                            as many volumes as would theri irascible communications with their
                            publishers. The series, consisting of about a dozen notes, fetched L115

                            ccountry where no one willl give us credit for a farthing." When
