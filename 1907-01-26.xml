                    <p>Trains run alongside the steamers on the quay, and passengers can be conveyed
                        to Famagusta, Nicosia, Morphou and intermediate stations. Good hotel
                        accommodation for tourists is provided at Famagusta, at the Savoy Hotel (Mr.
                        Najem Houry proprietor). Olympus Hotel, Mount Troodos, 6000 ft. above the
                        sea. Magnificent Scenery. Perfect climate. Season May to end of October. For

                        Army Contractor, Limassol, Cyprus. There is a good carriage road from Kopia
                        (on Railway) to Troodos. At Famagusta may be seen the fine old Latin
                        Cathedral (now a mosque) begun in 1300 and finished in 1312, together with
                        other ancient ruins and the Venetian fortifications, the finest in the
                        world. Also the tower or palace, the scene of "Othello'' and of Ford's
                        "Lover's Melancholy.'' The climate of Cyprus in the winter months is
                        delightful and the Island will well repay a visit.</p>

                    <head>THE RUSSIAN AGITATION. ACTION OF AUTHORITIES.</head>
                    <p>Alexandria has ever since Sunday preserved a most tranquil appearance, and
                        there seems to be no sign that there will be any recrudescence of the
                        turbulent scenes such as disturbed the public peace of Egypt's commercial
                        capital on Saturday and Sunday last. The Alexandria City Police are,
                        however, perpared for any eventualities, and all the mouonted police and all
                        the guard company are kept constantly under orders in case of trouble and
                        are ready to be turned out in the short space of three minutes. But it is
                        most sincerely to be hoped that in the interests of the whole country
                        tranquillity may be considered to be completely restored. It is still
                        thought advisable, however, to have a strong guard of police at the Russian
                        Consulate. </p>
                    <p>Lord Cromer has replied to the members of the committee who presented his
                        Lordship with the petition which we published in our issue of Thursday last.
                        Lord Cromer's reply is unfavorable, as was only to be expected.</p>
                    <p>"I do not see my way," his Lordship said, "to advise the Egyptian Government
                        to abstain from the surrendering of the Russian subjects to their Consul to
                        be treated in accordance with Russian law. the treaty of 1774 does not seem
                        to me to be applicable to the case in question and the Government are only
                        doing their duty. </p>
                    <p>"My personal opinion is well known, and I deem that none of the privileges
                        conferred by the Capitulations for the protection of foreigners should be
                        abolished, but I consider that certain modifications should be introduced
                        into the present regime. </p>
                    <p>"At any rate is is clear that until such modifications are approved by the
                        Powers and put in force, it is necessary to enforce the law just as it is in
                        every respect." </p>
                    <p>The Russian Consular authorities at Alexandria will send off the three men,
                        Botsoff, Shureen, and Vopula, to their own country as soon as it is
                        considered necessary. </p>
                    <p>In all probability the Russian Consulate here will lodge a formal complaint
                        at the French Consulate against M. Raoul Canivet on the grounds that he
                        excited the agitation by publishing misstatements. The Russian consular
                        authorities declare that the allegations that the men are accused of
                        plotting, and whatever punishment be moved out to them when they reach their
                        native land they certainly will not be condemned to capital punishment. </p>
                    <p>If any definite evidence is obtained by the Russian consular authorities by
                        the other persons who are considered to have been the ringleaders, they will
                        also lodge complaints agaisnt them at the consulates on which they
                        depend.</p>
                    <p>It was announced by the leaders of the agitation that the enquiry was already
                        closed, and that the men were to be "despatched at once to Russia." This
                        statement wasm we understand quite false as it reposed on no foundation of
                        fact at all.</p>
                    <p>The authorities of the Alexandria Gonvernorat intend to take proceedings at
                        the British Consular Court here against Mr. William Patrick Foley, a British
                        subject, who was arrested for having taken part in the outrage at the
                        Russian Consulate last Sunday. Foley was arrested, but has been released on
                        bail. The Alexandria City Police accuse this man of being at the head of the
                        demonstrators and of having encouraged them. He is also said by the police
                        to have been one of the men rushed upon the door to the consulate and pulled
                        down the coat-of-arms above the door, and also attempted to break it. When
                        Yousbashi Mussa Effendi and Constable John Iken tried to prevent him, he
                        turned on them and assaulted them.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Paul Manse, the editor of "L'Orient," in a leading article on the recent
                        demonstation, makes the following just observations: "The extraordinary part
                        of it is that all this disturbance should be organised, fomented, and kept
                        up for forty-eight hours by those who under all circumstances have insissted
                        on the integral maintenance of the Capitualtions... It is a matter of deep
                        regret that the Egyptian Government should be held responsible, and be
                        obliged to demand excuses for the faults of unauthrosed persons instigated
                        by those who sought an object particularly inadmissible in this land where
                        respect of the faith of others must be the first rule. But it would be so
                        easy to say that the thousand, and one manifestants of Alexandria and Cairo
                        do not represent any serious opinion in Egypt, and that they do not even
                        represent their own. Don't talk of an immoderate love of liberty, or of a
                        burning passion for equity. Where were these orators, these enegetic
                        manifestations of last week when Egyptians were being hanged at Denishwai:
                        Without judegment or criticism, it was then that they mighht have carried
                        out their philanthropy in pleading for the pardon or poor devils no less
                        worthy of their attention.… The real victims of all this noise are the three
                        Russian prisoners themselves who will not evidently benefit by special
                        leniency after all this to-do organised by our Egyptian liberals.</p>

                        Italian colony in honour of H.R.H. the Prince of Udina was an unqualified
                        success. A large number of invitations had been issued, and the alrge and
                        fashionable gathering that was timed to commence at 4 o'clock and that hour
                        his Royal Highness arrived at the hotel, in company of the Marquis di
                        Soragna. Italian Consul, being greeted by the strains of the Italian
                        national anthem, played by a band stationed at the entrance. Shortly after
                        the Prince's arrival, the members of the Consular Corps were presented to
                        him by the Marquis di Soragns, and afterwards dancing commenced in the
                        magnificent ballrooms of the hotel, his Royal Highness opening the ball with
                        Miss Stagni as his partner. Dancing continued all the afternoon, the Royal
                        guest remaining an interesteed spectator almost to the end. A well stocked
                        buffet was provided in the dining-room, which, as also the adjoining
                        ante-room, was tastefully decorated and illuminated. The music for the
                        dancing was furnished by Heckmayer's orchestra, and the hotel orchestra also
                        played selections downstairs. The committee are to be congratulated on the
                        success of the arragnements of what was altogether a charming fete.</p>

                    <p>Helouan, Friday.</p>
                    <p>Though small, Helouan boasts of a thoroughly sporting community; and in these
                        days of Beyram when every hotel has been full, there has been a continual
                        round of amusements among the inhabitants and visitors. In fact, life is
                        Helouan is a very socialbe business, for people stay there long enough, as a
                        rule, to become thoroughly acquainted with each other; and the rivalry
                        between the hotels is of a very friendly nature. Miss Tottenham and Miss
                        Moore have been two of the leading spirits in the organizing of the long
                        programme of sports and amusements which has kept all the more youthful and
                        energetic members of society but these last few days. A tennis tournament
                        has provided interest during the day, while a bridge tournament has occupied
                        the evening hours. The donkey paper chase has been well, attended, and a
                        picnic to Wady HOf provided a reason for another outing. </p>
                    <p>The Grand Hotel was the scene of a most enjoyable dance last night, the
                        handsome dining hall being transformed into a very roomy and beuatiful
                        ball-room with a parquet floor in the very pink of condition. Music was
                        supplied by the Sextet orchestra, which was so much appreciated at Mena
                        House the preceding night, and to its performance on both occassions must be
                        attributed much of the success of these dances. There was a delightful air
                        of friendliness over the whole proceedings, and never a trace of boredom
                        from first to last: and though the last few dances had to be somewhat
                        hurried (time and trainns waiting for no one) there was no trace of fatigue
                        visible in the movements of those who had filled their programmes.</p>
                    <p>It is not possible to give a complete list of all of those who were present;
                        but among those who were present were noticed Mr. and Mrs. Beasley, Mr. and
                        Mrs. Sharman, Mrs. Charlton (who came with a party from Cairo) Mrs.
                        Mackintosh Walker, Mrs. Ashley Cock, Mrs. Murch, Mrs.Logan. Miss Hobson,
                        Miss Key, Miss Reid, Miss White, Miss Carter, Miss Ashuret, Miss Paytono,
                        Miss Moore, Miss Tottenham, Miss Broderick, the Misses Bentley, Miss Hazel,
                        and Miss Darley. As it is still more difficult to enumerate the gentlemen
                        who graced the occasion with their presence, perhaps they will excuse any
                        mention of their names. They did their duty manfully and well and with a
                        vigour that must assuredly be the result of the wonderful air and healthy
                        life of Helouan.</p>
                    <p>There is to be a second dance at the Tewfik Palace Hotel on Saturday which
                        promises to be an equal success, and will doubtless prove a very fitting
                        termination to a very delightful week's enjoyment.</p>

                    <head>ZIZANIA THEATRE.</head>
                    <p>On Thursday evening there was yet another and meritorious performance of "La
                        Dannezione di Faust." Especially noticeable were the exertions of Sigri,
                        Marcolin, and Berriel, both of whom managed to infuse more colour into their
                        roles; there was much more "go" about Sig. Berriel's Mefistofele, while Sig.
                        Maronlin was quite at his best in the wonderfully inspring "invocation to
                        nature" scene. Signa Grisi again made a satisfactory Margherita. Abundant
                        praise is once more due to the admirable way in which Maestro Zuccani
                        handled his orchestra. Their playing from first to last was a real pleasure.
                        The chorus were a trifle out of hand in the first two scences but the fugue
                        scene 3 was more than ever admirably rendered, and from the onwards they
                        behaved most creditably. We have furthermore to be deeply and humbly
                        grateful for some curtailment iin the entr' actors but we hesitate to dwell
                        upon the matter lest advantage be taken of it and we be mulcted once more in
                        waits of half-an-hour or so.</p>
                    <p>There is little to be said for last night's production of "Gli Ugonotti." A
                        fair mediocrity was maintained, but not without difficulty. The oepra is so
                        very "vieux jeu" that iin order to work up one's enthusiasm it requires to
                        be given in a more artistic and finished style than was the case yesterday.
                        Nearest to this consummation came Signa Chotkowska in her impersonation of
                        the page Urbano, and Sig. Walter, who was again thoroughly convincing in his
                        spirited role of Marcello. Sig de Marchi was jerky and nassal, but we must
                        patiently wait until his cold has left him ere we venture a comment on his
                        abilities. The chorus and orchestra were fair, but on the whole performance
                        fell far short of that of the previous night and often failed to hold the
                        attention.</p>

                    <p>Yesterday, for the second day's racing of the Second Winter Meeting, we had
                        to face another cold day and cold wind, and occasional showers of rain added
                        to the discomfort. Everyone, however, who came seemed prepared for Arctic
                        weatherm and made the best of it. The attendance was considerably better
                        than on the first day; and the racing was mostly excellent. Tokar's win in
                        the Eclipse was a great surprise. This little horse is game the backbone,
                        and has been running very steadily throughout the season. Suleik, in this
                        race tried to cut it in the run in and spoilt Jenkin's chance. This last
                        named jockey rode an excellent race on the same horse in the Galloway
                        Handicap. In the United Service Steeplechase Mr. de Freville rode with great
                        skill and judgment. Making his effort at the right time he won comfortably.
                        Capt Collum, in the same race, had bad luck, Richmond coming down when going
                        strong. The rider escaped with the loss of some skin, but the horse was
                        taken off in the ambulance to the infirmary with a badly sprained shoulder. </p>
                    <p>The handicapping worked out excellently. Not every one knows the difficulties
                        and loss of time connected with this part of racing, and we may congratulate
                        our handicapper on his success throughout the season. About 2,000 changed
                        hands at the pari Mutnel. </p>

                    <head>A SUGGESTION TO EGYPTIANS. NATIONAL EDUCATION.</head>
                    <p>An "Echo" of "Orient and Occident" has been issued as a supplement to this
                        weekly illustrated Anglo-Arabic magazine. Under the heading of the "Problem
                        of National Education," we read:-</p>
                    <p>It is hoped that this review will be of use to those in Egypt who are showing
                        so marked an interest in the more general education of their fellow
                        countrymen. It will be readily seen that the interantional and religious
                        problem is just as pressing here as it is in India and America, while there
                        is in Egypt a national spirit which is making itself felt in a hundred ways
                        from time to time. The puzzle, of couse, consists in how to secure a
                        national sttlement of the educational question, which would be accpetable to
                        both Moslems and Copts, and will respect the fact that Egypt is also the
                        home to many nationalities.</p>
                    <p>It is of the utmost importance, in a small country like Egypt, which has a
                        population not bigger than that of England a hundred years ago, that there
                        should be a growing national spirt fostreefdd by a national educational
                        system. On the other hand it is equally necessary to respect the consciences
                        of the several freligious bodies, and to see to it that mistkaes which have
                        been made in India and in Japan are not reapeated here in Egypt. The only
                        way in which a nation can avoid seeing its sons growing up without morality
                        and religion is to make due provision in its educational system that both he
                        taught. There are only two fair ways discovered, in which a State, which
                        professes to be governed by the principles of libertly, equality, and
                        fraternity to men of all races, classes and creeds, can secure a moral and
                        religious education for its children: neither of which are incompatible with
                        the existence of an established religion such as Islam in Egypt or
                        Christianity in England. The one way is to subsidize all schools of whatever
                        religious foundation which come up to a certain educational standard, by
                        paying for the worht of their secular education given, but not makind
                        distinctions between the merits of anhy particular form of religious
                        teaching. The other method is to allow (what is called0 a right of entry to
                        teachers of different religious bodies into all schools under government
                        inspection in order to teach the children of different denominations in each
                        school the faith of their parents if they so desire it.</p>
                    <p>These two solutions are by no means exclusive, and can be adopted
                        simultaneously n the case of differnty types of schools. For instance,
                        Govern,ent schools in Egypt should, if what has been said is just, admit
                        teachers of Christianity to Christian pupils, just as they encourage the
                        right of entry to Mohamedan teachers for Moslem pupils. And in the case of
                        the many Moslem, Christian, and Jewish voluntary schools in Egypt which are
                        everywhere springing up, the Egyptian Government would if it follow the
                        example of Engalnd and other progressive Eastern nations, encourage the same
                        by means of grants in aid in spite of their particular denominational
                        complexion,</p>
                    <p>The following are some of the beneficial results which are likely to follow.
                        In the first place it would hasten the day when everry boy and girl in Egypt
                        will at least reveive a fair vernacular education. IT would both increase
                        the desire for ecuation among all classes, and the liberality of those who
                        are albe to found schools to meet that desire. It would develop the spirit
                        of patriotism, and yet make all classes of people in Egypt feel that the
                        Education Department is in full sympathy with their aspirations. And finally
                        it would have the practical and desirable effect of rasining up a generation
                        of men, who would be better qualifed and trained for public service and
                        private enterprises.</p>

                    <head>THE EGYPTIAN ARMY. REQUIREMENTS OF THE SUDAN.</head>
                    <p>The ordinary Budget of the Egyptian Ministry of War for 1907 shows an
                        increase of 72,388, while special ore lits amounting to 56,596 are to be
                        opened during the year. It need not be said that the Government of the
                        Sudan, where the greater part of the Egyptian army is stationed has no
                        aggressive intentions. Its relations with Abyssinia are excellent; and the
                        annual rumours, doubtless fostered by mischiefmakers, of an approaching
                        conflict with Dar Fur have at last died a natural death. Sultan Ali Dinar
                        has nothing to fear from Khartoum as long as he pays his yearly tribute and
                        respects the frontier of Kordofan tribute and respects the frontier of
                        Kordofan.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, the gradual extension of Government influence over the
                        wilder and more remote districts of the Sudan cannot be effected without an
                        increase in the forces the disposal of the Sirdar. This is especially the
                        case in South Eastern Kordofan, where tribal warfare still persists between
                        the "Meks," or chiefs, of the numerous isolated mountains that are the most

                        nerveux surexcite, en les faissant battre en retraite d'une facon plutot
                        comique.</p>
                    <p>Dix.</p>
                    <p>La tenue de notre marche pendant la se maine qui vient de fior, a etre du
                        tout au tout differente de celle dout nous avons rendu compte dans notre
                        precedente revue. An lieu de la fern etre qui n'avait cease de regner, aves
                        une finale toutefois peu brillante, c'ete une serie de seances faibles, avec
                        des cours une serie de seances faibles, avec des cours chaque jour en baisse
                        sur la veille, que nous avons eue,, mais avec un revirement soudain a la
                        derniere heure pour ainsi dire accompagne d'une reprise s'elevant a 13 32
                        surle minimum de la semsine pratique ce matin. Le contraste a donc etre
                        compelt. Qiant au resultant materiel a donc etre complet. Quiant au
                        resultant materialobtenn depuis vendredi dernier, il consistre en une baisse
                        de 5/16 en tout et pour etre juste, il font reconnaitre que o'est grace au
                        savoirfaire du parti haussier que l'on doit que les choses se soient
                        arretees a ce point. Les improd onte qui se sont amuses a vendre en blanu au
                        moment du desarrio et qui and tout semblait fini, ont fourni cette fois des
                        armes a leurs adversaires, qui les out retournees contreeux, et comme le
                        Caire qui avait commence a inspirer des inquietudes par son attitiude, et
                        mene encourage les baissiers par son hesitation est revenu anssi tout a coup
                        a la rescousse, le jeu des haussiers a etre facile. Il est toutefois de fait
                        que nons noustrouvons tout bonnement en face d'une chose accidentelle et
                        provisoirs.</p>
                    <p>En offet, la situation en elle meme n'a pas change au fond et nous
                        ajousterons meme que les motifs qui millitaient en faveur de la baisse se
                        sont encore aggraves non par la defection d'un gros faisseur, car il
                        n'existait aucon accord, mais par la liquidiation que l'on dit complete de
                        as position a la hausse, ce qui enleve aux autres l'appui precieux
                        qui'iLleur fournissait grace a l'importance de ses operations.</p>
                    <p>A part cels, il y a aussi de temps a autre des allegemetns, car les personnes
                        qui commencent a se laisser impressionner par lea signes apparents et les
                        assertions d'une prochaine diminuition des exportations comparees a clles de
                        l'annes passee sont nombreuses, sans compter que les arbitragistes
                        continuent a trouver une marge suffisante et amplement remuneratice entre
                        les cours du spot etdes contrats. C'est trop a la fois pour une speculation
                        plus que surchargee et qui ne peut continuer ad libitum a absorber tout ce
                        qui s'offre a la vente. Ce dernier point constitue un danger reel pour le
                        speculateur, qui ne saurait que faire de la marchandise effective on face de
                        laquelle il va se trouver, maia sur cette eventualite nous nous sommes deja
                        assez etendus quand nous avons signa e la chose, et par consequent nous
                        considerous qu'il serait oiseux de nous y arreter de nonveau ou de faire des
                        redites.</p>
                    <p>En somme, notra avis est toujowrs le meme: la situation actuelle est factice
                        et tant que la consommation ne sera pas revenue au marche pour nous enlever
                        la plus grande partie du solde de notre recolte, il ne peut y avoir aucun
                        espoir seriouc pour une hausee basee. Pour la moment elle s'abstient et cela
                        d'autant plus facilement que ses retraits jusqu'ici et ses achata pour plus
                        tard lui permettront d'aller longtemps de l'avant sans avoir besoin de se
                        laisser imposer des cours extrabagants, meme pour des circumstances
                        exceptionnelles.</p>
                    <p>Mainteuant, malgre tout ce que nous venous de dire, nous ne voulons pse
                        pretendre que tout est deja perdu; non, car le parti de la hausse peut
                        encore lutter et il repetera tres probablement ses tentatives, et peut etre
                        meme avec des reussites momentanees: mais comme nous l'avons expose plus
                        haut, il n'y a plus de cohesion ou d'unanimite dans les vues des detenteurs
                        de contrats, et a moins de l'imprevuou du secours efficase de la filature,
                        la finale, a une date plus ou moins e oignes, sera celle que nous avons
                        toujours soutenue depuirs les exagerations de la speculation, c'est a dire
                        mauvaire et tres regrettable pour ceux qui se sont engage dans la voie de la
                        hause a des prix etreves. Du reste, le Caire surtout doit se rappe'er de la
                        famuse annee de l'eau, qui lui semblait si propice et qui a fini par laisser
                        des souvenirs si pen desirables.</p>
                    <p>La tendance du marche est indeciss, mais difficilement il pourrait en etre
                        autrement avec cette lutte acharnee entre haussiers et baisiers; avec la
                        situation de l'americain, la balance semble vouloir pencher du cote de ces
                        derniers.</p>
                    <p>Comme activite la vieille recolte n'a paslaisse trop a desirer; du raste,
                        l'agitation meme du marche a provogue un developpement des affaires;
                        seulement pour ce qui est de la nouvelle il en a ete un peu autrement les
                        acheteurs du Novembre n'ayant trouve l'occasoin d'intervenir et de manipuler
                        qu'au jourd'hui et a partir du moment que les detenteurs du Mars ont
                        serieusement commence a reagir. De la sorte ils ont evite de se surcharger,
                        tout en reusissant a relever le cours, tache plus facile qu'on ne le croit
                        avec le gros decouver existant sur la prochaine recolte. En tous car, le
                        minimum pratique pour le Novembre a ete de 18 9/32 et la cloture s'en est
                        faite ce soir sur la cote de 18 7/16 soit en tout un recul de 3/32 pour la
                        huitaine.</p>
                    <p>La derniere fil ere de janvier s'est eleves a 19,250 cantars et n'a pas
                        exerce le moindre effet sur le marche; elle etait reportes ou classee
                        d'avance et en definitive elle a l'air de n'avoir ete mise en circulation
                        que pour faciliter et completer le reglement de la position en contrats qui
                        existait sur le mois courant.</p>
                    <p>Le janvier donne lieu a quelques receptions, mais, cemme deja dit, il ne
                        s'agit pas dans l'estace d'affaires speculatives, mais simplement
                        d'operations de reports. Sans cette circonstance la difference entre Janvier
                        et mara serait restee d'un tallari au lieu de tombber a 5/8 ou 11/16. C'est
                        toujours un soulagment pour le marche. Les reports ne varient pas beasucoup;
                        ils montrent cependant une tendance a s'elargir.</p>
                    <p>Comme nouvlles interessantes du dehors, nous en avons en deux xes jours ci.

                    <p>Dear Mr. Ward, - Your delightful and most interesting book on the Soudan has
                        reached me. I congratulate you heartily ono the excellent manner in which
                        the work is written and illustrated. All of us who have done our little best
                        to regenerate the country, after its terrible misfortunes, have received
                        more than kind treatment at your hands... I don't suppose anyone realises
                        more than I do the change that has come over the Sudan since my old and
                        tyrannical master the Khalifa disapperared from the scene. Your description
                        of the Peace and Progress is, in fact, a sequel to my Fire and Sword in the
                        Sudan. </p>
                    <p>With kindest regards believe me, Yours sincerely, </p>

                    <p>Les transactions du debut ont eu si peu d'importance que la Corportaion des
                        agents de change n'a pas cru perdre grand'chose en chomant les trois
                        derniers jours de la semaine, a l'occasion des fetes du Courban Bairam. Le
                        fait est qu'en presence d'une tension monetaire deja longue et indefiniment
                        prolongee par le pullulement des emissions nouvelles, on commence a battre
                        froid aux valeurs que la specualtion a trop pour se rejeter prudemment sur
                        d'austres plus solides et juiqui'lci depreciees qui, outre une plus-value
                        eventuelle appreciable, n'exposent pas leurs detenteurs a de desagreables
                        surprises. Aussi, ces dernieres, nom seulement n'ont pas suivi la baisse
                        generale, mais out fait preuve d'une fermete remaquable et donne lieu a une
                        demande discrete et suivie.</p>
                    <p>Tes samedi, les valuers spculatives qui avaient le plus profite de la recente
                        hausse, sont les premieres a subir les coupa de la reaction. Peu d'affaires
                        d'aillerus, et disreminees sur toute la cote. En revaunche les bonnes
                        valeurs jusques la deprecides, telles que l'Agricols at l'Union Fonciere,

                        l'excellent direciton de de cette societe; ce qui n'a rien d'etonnant,
                        lorsque le Conseil d'administation se compose de noms tels que E.A.
                        Harrisou, Ch. Bachler, G. Nungovich, Cook, Pagnon, etc. Le succes obtenu pas
                        les Egyptian et les Nungovich Hotels nous sont un garant du succes des Upper

                        extraordinaire, aura lieu du 4 au 6 Fevrier et sera reservee aux anciens

                        au comne cement de notre chronique, l'avenir se presente sous des auspices
                        favorables. Il y a en Europe une detente monetaire evidente et probablement
                        definitive: c'est d'abord la reduction du fauc prive d'escompte en
                        Angleterre a 4 5/8 pourcent, suivi bieuto: d'une reduction du tans de la
                        Banque d'Etat de 6 a 5 0/0 malgre quoi la reserve de la banque a ete protee
                        celts sormaine de. Il ya eu depuis il est vrai, une reprise du taux prive a
                        5 0/0 mais caluloin n'a pas tarde a revenir a 4 3/1. De son cote, la Banque
                        d'Allenmagne qui avait le plus eu a fouffrir de la disette de numeraire a
                        aussi ramene sou taux de 7 a 6 0/0. </p>
                    <p>Sur notre place, la situation monetaire profite natureillement de la detente
                        en Europe, L'Egypte se trove, en outra, particullierement avantague par la
                        prosperite  croissante de son agriculture et de sono commerce, comme cala
                        results a l'evidence de la statistique des dous: nes pour les entrees et les
                        sorties en 1906. Tandis qu'en 1905 les importations de L.E. 1,203,791

                    <p>La Grippe Is Epidemic Catarrh.</p>
                    <p>LA GRIPPE spares no class or nationality. The cultured and thte ignorant, the
                        aristocrat and the pauper, the masses and the classes are all subject to la
                        grippe. None are example-all are liable.</p>
                    <p>La grippe is well-named. The original term, la grippe, la French, but it has
                        been shortened by the busy American to one word "grip."</p>
                    <p>Without any intention of doing so, a new word has been coined which describes
                        the disease exactly.</p>
                    <p>The ailment clings to the patient as tenaciously as if some terrible giant
                        had clutched him in a fatal clasp.</p>
                    <p>Men, women, and children- whole towns and cities are caught in the baneful
                        grip of this terrible monoster.</p>
                    <p>Have you the grip? Or, rather has the grip caught you? If so, read the
                        following letters.</p>
                    <p>These testimonials will show you the quickest and been means of ridding
                        yourself of this tenacious disease and its after-effects.</p>
                    <p>Suffered Twelve Years From After-Effects of La Grippe.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Victor Patneaude, 828 Madison St., Topeka, Kasha well-known carpenter and
                        member of Knights and Ladies of Security, writes: </p>
                    <p>"Twelve yers ago I had a severe attack of la grippe and I never really
                        recovered my health and strength so that in a couple of months I was able to
                        go to work again.</p>
                    <p>"This winter I had another attack of la grippe, but Peruna soon drove it out
                        of my system. </p>
                    <p>"My wife and I consider Peruna a household remedy."</p>
                    <p>Pneumonia Followed La Grippe</p>
                    <p>Pe-ru-na, the Remedy That Brought Relief.</p>
                    <p>Mr. T. Barnecott, West Aylmer, Ontario, Can, writes:</p>
                    <p>"Last winter I was ill with pneumonia after having la grippe. I took Peruna
                        for two months, when I became quite well, and I can say that nay one can be
                        cured by it in a reasonable time and at little expense.</p>
                    <p>"Every time I take a cold, I take some Peruna which makes me well again. </p>
                    <p>"I also advised it for my daughter who was so ill with procrastination that
                        she could not follow her trade of dress-making.</p>
                    <p>"A bottle of Peruna made such a change in her that she has been able to
                        follow her trde every since.</p>
                    <p>"I also induced a young lady, who was all rundown and confined to the house,
                        to take Peruna and after taking Peruna for three months she is able to
                        follow her trade of tailoring. "I can recommend Peruna for all such who are
                        ill and require a tonic."</p>

                        Present Good Health.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Jennie W. Gilmore, Box 44, White Oak, Ind. Ter., formerly Housekeeper
                        for Indiana Reform SChool for Boys, writes:</p>
                    <p>"Six years ago I had la grippe, which was followed by systematic catarrh.</p>
                    <p>Pe-ru-na--A Tonic After La Grippe.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Chas. E. Wells, Sr., Delaware, Ohio, writes: "After a severe attack of
                        la grippe, I took Peruna and found it a very good tonic."</p>
                    <p>Judge Horatio J. Gosa, Hartwell, Ga., writes "I had a severe spell of la
                        grippe which left me with systemic catarrh. A friend advised me to try
                        Peruna. The third bottle completed the cure."</p>
                    <p>"Most Effective Medicine Ever Trizl for La Grippe"</p>

                        papers and magazines,-religious, educational and secular.</p>
                    <p>In speaking of Peruna, Mr. Madison says:</p>
                    <p>"I am hardly ever without Peruna in my home. It is the most effective
                        medicine that I have ever tried for la grippe. "It also cured my wife of
                        nasal catarrh. Her condition at one time was such that she could not at
                        night breathe through her nostrils.</p>
                    <p>"In consequence, an inflamed condition of the throat was brought about,
                        getting worse and worse, and yielding to no remedy until Peruna as
                        tried."</p>
