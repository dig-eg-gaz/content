                    <head>Pillars of Alexandria</head>
                    <p>Sheikh Mohamed Ahmed, in his vary sen- sible and forcible address at the
                        laying of the foundation stone of the new Victoria College on Friday last,
                        described the result of instruc- tion and education suited to the wants of a
                        people as a blessing to its country ; producing men who will, surely, in
                        after days, prove pillars to the State. Among the local notabilities present
                        on this occasion, was the new Vice-President of the Alexandria Municipality,
                        a worthy succes- sor to one who, during the past ten years, has by his
                        judicious and skilful pilotage of the Municipal ship amongst the
                        cosmopolitan rocks and shoals which beset it, proved himself to be snob a
                        pillar as the learned sheikh has spoken of. As regards his successor, those
                        Alexandrians who remember the Government Hospital as it was twenty five
                        years ago, before he took it in hand, can bear witness to its gradual
                        transformation from an Augean Stable to the model of good order and
                        cleanliness it has become. Its author has every reason to be proud of this
                        result as the work of his own head and hands during more than twenty years
                        of patient and contiunous struggle with diffi- culties under which many a
                        modern Hercules f less resolution, strong initiative, and organ- ising
                        capacity would have succumbed. In the early days of its transformation, the
                        hospital, daring past years, had acquired so evil a reputation for
                        neglect—not to say positive ill-treatment—of its patients, that it had be-
                        come a matter of daily notoriety for an Egypt- ian Government employé,
                        assured of death as the result of improper treatment, when sink or wounded,
                        in his own insanitary house, to choose, unhesitatingly, that certainty in
                        pre- ference to being sent to hospital. In fact, this institution was as
                        much dreaded by the sick or maimed Egyptian as service in the Sudan was by
                        the Egyptian soldier. A few years of the new régime sufficed to remove
                        entirely this prejudice, and the hospital became as popular as it had,
                        previously, been a terror. The wards ware increased and separated according
                        to medical or surgical requirements, and com- fortably furnished with an
                        ample sup- ply of filtered water and trained native nurses ; whilst a
                        recreation ground for the patients was created and planted wi h trees,
                        shrubs, and flowering plants, with suit- able walks; some remnants of
                        columns and other fragments of the mini of the ancient <cb n="5"/> city
                        being added as appropriate attributes to 'he supposed site of the Ptolemaic
                        theatre. All the above was effected by the "ex mede- cin en-chef," at the
                        smallest possible expense, daring the long period of rigid economy which
                        followed the Liquidation of 1880; the necessary funds being, literally,
                        scraped together, partly by means of a carefully administered though scanty
                        Budget, and partly from pecuniary assistance rendered by observing and
                        admiring friends. In 1887, in token of his appreciation of the new Egyptian
                        régime, and of the encouragement he had received from its distinguished
                        inaugurator in Cairo in the pro- secution of his improvements, he erected an
                        ancient Greek column on the summit of a conspicuous elevation within the
                        hospital grounds, with a suitable inscription, dedicating it as a memorial
                        of her late Most Gracious Majesty, the "good" Queen Victoria, oar first
                        British Empress, having just completed the fiftieth year of her prosperous
                        reign. In 1897, the year of her Majesty’s Diamond Jubilee, the energetic and
                        sympathetic Doctor. Bay proceeded to erect the fine column which forms the
                        central ornament of the Municipal Gardens adorning the north side of the
                        avenue leading past the Greek Hospital to the Rosetta Gate, now in course of
                        completion. The shaft of this column, alone, weighed twenty-five tons, and
                        the doctor was compelled to have recourse to the Port authorities to aid him
                        in raising so ponderous a pillar, the site of which h «d been selected with
                        special reference to the permanent stability of its foundations, which are
                        those of the wall of the ancient Bruchium The column was inaugurated, in the
                        following year, 1898, in memory of the reconquest cf the Sadan and capture
                        of Khartoum on 2nd September by the Auglo Egyptian forces under Kitchener
                        Pacha. </p>
                    <p>Not long ago the doctor transferred to his domain two sculptured
                        block-granite early- Christian columns of mach interest which had, for many
                        years, lain in the Arsenal at the disposal of the proprietor, unremoved in
                        con- sequence of the accumulated storage dues for which he had become
                        liable. They stand on either side of a Urge sarcophagus which the inmates of
                        the hospital believe is intended to awe refractory patients into obedience,
                        as typical of the one in Prince Ibrahim's garden on the island of Randa,
                        which, sixty or seventy years ago, was employed for the temporary in-
                        carceration of contumacious vice regal garden- ers. The Scotch head-gardener
                        of those days assured the late Lord Lindsay that three days in the
                        sarcophagus, with the lid on, had "a wonderful effect." ‘Citizens, however,
                        who enjoy the confidence of the doctor, and are aware of his merciful
                        disposition, assure us that he looks forward to a time, which we trust may
                        yet be far distant, when the great sarcophagus is to be some the repository
                        of his own ashes. </p>
                    <p> The association of so many pillars with the useful work in behalf of the
                        city of this inde fatigable functionary, as well as a general recognition
                        that ha is, from the Sheikh's point of view, a veritable pillar himself of
                        the State, has caused him to be locally known as Colonna Pacha. It is now
                        many years since we visited the ruins of the ancient fifth-century monastery
                        of Qala’at Sem’än, half way between Antioch and Aleppo, and about thirty
                        miles distant from each, in the midst of which lie the re mains of the
                        famous column on which the Pillar Saint, Symeon Saylites, immortalized by
                        Tennyson, spent the last thirty-seven years of his life until his deceases
                        in 460 A.D., at the age of 72. Ha is said to have gradually in- creased the
                        elevation of his pillar from six to forty cubits (nearly the height of
                        Pompey s Pillar), from the summit of which he harangued and preached to the
                        faithful with what mast have been asteutorian voice. His contemporary
                        biographer, Theodoret, explains the object of Symeon in thus elevating
                        himself on a pillar, as being to escape from the too flattering and
                        obsequious honours paid him by his earthly worshippers, as well as to end
                        his days with as near an approach to heaven as he could realize. Such
                        modesty, combined with a con- tinuous aspiration for improvement, is proto-
                        typical of our medico-municipal pillar. But, as regards the canonistation of
                        Symeou in recog- nition of his act of devotion in seating himself for thirty
                        seven continuous years on the capital of a pillar, we feel sure that no
                        ambi- tion to see, in his own person, ano her St. Jean added to the
                        Alexandria Calendar would ever induce our Colonna Pacha voluntarily to re-
                        main inactive during a single day, whilst here is useful work to be done ;
                        much less for so long a period as would be necessary to obtain his
                        canonisation. Long may he continue in that frame of mind and the city
                        benefit by his activity and the wisdom of his fellow pillar in the
                        Commission of the Alexandria Municipality.</p>

                        the Greek colony in Manchester. ‘’No trumps” then counted ten pentrick
                        instead of twelve, and four aces in one hand eighty instead of 100. The '
                        heart convention” was also known and practised. There is, too, a pamphlet in
                        the British Museum on "Biritch,” dated 1886, which gives a brief account of
                        the game, with the rules much as they exist at present. The members cf the
                        Greek colony at Manchester referred to by the correspondent of oar London
                        contemporary probably brought the game from Alexandria, where it is known to

                    <p>An Egyptian Banking Account.</p>
                    <p> Not many paupers in English workhouses have banking accounts in Egyptian
                        banks, so when it was discovered last week that a pensioned staff sergeant
                        name Hogne, who had been sent to the Sooth Stoneham work- house by the
                        military authorities at Netley, bad a bankbook showing 26,941 rupress to his
                        credit in an Egyptian bank, considerable j discussion ensued. He also was
                        the possessor of twelve portmanteaux, fifteen or sixteen suits of clothes, a
                        Masonic apron and jewels as wall as under clothes. The poor-law autho-
                        rities have obtained an order from the magis-. trartes to deduct the man’s
                        cost of mainte- nance whilst in the workhouse. It was stated that Hoyne, who
                        hails from St. Mary’s, Kil- kenny, was sent to the workhouse because he was
                        not capable of looking after himself, and his sister is coming from Ireland
                        to fetch him away. The guardians resolved to write to the Minister for War
                        asking why the man was sent to them.</p>

                    <p>AN INTERESTING SUGGESTION. BRITISH CO-OPERATION. </p>
                    <p> (Gazette’s Special Service) </p>
                    <p> London, Wednesday. </p>
                    <p> The current number of L’Energie Française” contains an interesting
                        suggestion for the settlement of the Bagdad Railway question by submitting
                        the same to an international con- ference. The writer points out that the
                        Ger- mans are straining every nerve to secure the maintenance in its
                        integrity of their concession, hut its possession by them is tantamount to a
                        seizure by Germany of the Ottoman Empire. The "Standard’s" Berlin
                        correspondent says that great importance is attached in Berlin to the
                        advocacy of British cooperation with Germany in the construction of the
                        railway, which Berlin expects will become as important as the Suez Canal. </p>
                    <p> The correspondent further states that no communications whatever have passed
                        between London and Berlin on this subject, but that there is clearly no
                        obstacle to the opening of a discussion of the matter.</p>

                    <p>In reference to the recent frontier incident, a not unknown politician
                        observed the other day, “What we have been witnessing is the first
                        utilisation by the German of his Turkish auxiliaries against the position of
                        Great Britain in the East. It is the first point, remember, at which the
                        latter is vulnerable to the pressure of a Continental Power by land. The
                        future will attest the absolute troth of his forecast if Germany succeeds,
                        as she intends, in per- meating Syria, Palestine, and Turkish Arabia with
                        her railways And with this purpose in view she employed the Turk as her
                        avant courier. It is not a venturesome prophecy, therefore, that any success
                        gained by Turkey at the expense c f Great Britain in the present instance
                        would have beau followed by an immediate and material advance of German
                        influence in the Near East."</p>

                    <p> According to the latest news from Gaza ten Turkish soldiers only remain
                        encamped south of the pillars on Egyptian territory, which the Turks allege
                        is part of the Sultan’s private property. </p>
                    <p> The authorities have summoned the chiefs of different Bedouin tribes under
                        Ottoman rule, and made them sign a declaration to the effect that the
                        pillars were never erected for the purpose of marking the boundary, but were
                        merely the remains of ancient ruins ; that Turkish territory stretches
                        several hundred paces south of the pillars ; lastly, that the pillars were
                        removed by the Rumeilat tribe, inhabiting the Egyptian side, as an act of
                        revenge because they were driven two months ago from land lately registered
                        in the Sultans name, which they claim as theirs, and have tilled from time
                        immemorial. </p>
                    <p> In order to shift their responsibility, the Turks now allege that the
                        pillars were par- posely removed by the Rumeilat and hidden to cause
                        complications, and that when his Majesty’s cruiser Minerva called they were
                        transported on board at night time. The Egyptian telegraph poles still
                        remain on- restored. </p>

                    <p>The record price recently paid in Liverpool for Sind Cotton grown from
                        Egyptian seed is likely to have a healthy effect upon Indian buyers. They
                        have hitherto regarded such cotton with distrust, being unaccustomed to
                        purchase high grade produce. The Government had to make special arrangements
                        in order to dispose of tho crop grown last season, bat the price offered by
                        a few firms was believed to be much below the true market value. For this
                        reason samples were shipped to Liverpool by the Bombay Department of
                        Agriculture wi*h a view to securing a real valuation. The result has
                        abundantly justified tho action of the Government. As 6,000 acres are under
                        Egyptian cotton, the yield-next season will be large enough to induce a
                        brisk trade in the local market, so that the cultivator will bo sure of
                        getting proper prices and the extension of the cultivation will be
                        stimulated.</p>

                        presidency of M. Rostovitz, to express their deep regret at the departure
                        from Egypt of M. Gennadis, late Hellenic Diplomatic Agent and Consul-General
                        at Cairo. The committee decided (1) to for- mally express the regret of the
                        Greek commu- nity in Cairo at the recall of M. Gennadis ; (2) to organise a
                        banquet in honour of the ex- Minister ; (3) to open a subscription for the
                        purchase of a valuable present to be offered to M. Gennadis in the name of
                        the Greek com- munity. </p>
                    <p> A committee of three, M.M. Staicopoulo, Belleni, and Athanasaki, have been
                        charged by the community to proceed to Athens and there express to his
                        Majesty King George of Greece and to his Government the regret of the Greek
                        colony in Egypt at the departure of M. Gen- nadis. </p>
                    <p> Two telegrams expressing the regrets of the colony were despatched ou Monday
                        to the King and to the Hellenic Government. H. E. Boutros Pacha Ghali called
                        on M. Gennadis on Monday afternoon. Yesterday M Gennadis returned the visit
                        and presented M. Kallergis, his successor, to the Minister of Foreign
                        Affairs. </p>
                    <p> It is considered that the withdrawal of M. Gennadis from the post of

                    <p>ORDERS FOR STEEL RAILS. GERMANY GIVEN PREFERENCE. </p>
                    <p> The way in which the Egyptian Govern- ment places orders in Germany when it
                        would be far better and cheaper to get the articles require 1 from England
                        is beginning to attract the attention of the English Press. The latest
                        affair which ha9 been noticed is the order for continental basic rails.
                        "African Engineering" remarks :— </p>
                    <p> For the first time in the existence the Egyptian State Railways have placed
                        an order for rails in Germany and Belgium. Price, of course, was the
                        consideration, for nothing but price could afford an excuse for purchasing
                        basic steel rails in preference to those of recog- nised qualities, whether
                        from Germany or any other country. Such an action is, of course, to be
                        deplored not merely on the ground of its being a loss of trade to Great
                        Britain, but because it is a great misfortune that a system of the growing
                        importance of tho Egyptian State Railways should adopt a penny wise and
                        pound foolish policy at the present time. Up to now these railways have been
                        notoriously careful as to the quality of their material, although they have
                        bought in many markets, and, especially with regard to their rolling stock,
                        have acquired a some- what miscellaneous assortment. Of late years a great
                        deal of trouble and expense have been incurred in the direction of
                        perfecting and standardising of their plant and equipment ; and replacing
                        foreign—notably American — bogie wagons by those of British make. </p>
                    <p>Aud now a sodden and disastrous retro- gressive step has been taken by
                        placing an order for £150,090 worth of Continental basic rails. Basic steel
                        bears much the same relation to acid steel that Continental natural cement
                        bears to British Portland cement. It is not to be relied upon except for
                        certain work, al- though within limits apparently excellent tests can be
                        obtained from it. The disastrous effects of the German basic steel axles on
                        the Metro- politan Railway have afforded a convincing proof of the
                        untrustworthy nature of this commodity. Again, the failures of basic steel
                        boilers, even under hydraulic test pressures, and when constructed in every
                        other respect according to accepted rules, shows that for any work subject
                        to pressure or stress basic steel should not ha employed. Some mouths ago we
                        gave soma particulars and pictures of the effect of ordinary weir and tear
                        on basic steel rails in America, and we reproduce from that article a
                        picture giving sections of two. of these rails after they had been in use
                        for five months and five weeks respectively. The specimens were cut from
                        samples cf what were considered, at the time of Lying perfectly sound rails.
                        Basic steel, however, is peculiarly subject to "piping,” and the samples in
                        question were, of coarse, badly flawed in this manner, though the flaws were
                        not perceptible at the time of inspection. In the Austrian boiler tests
                        above referred to it is interesting to note that samples cut actually from
                        the defective plates appeared when inspected, and overt tested, to be sound.
                        To employ such material on an important system like the Egyptian’ State
                        Railways at a time when hundreds of thousands of pounds are being spent for
                        the purpose of making it the finest in Africa appears to us a very false
                        policy. It is to be presumed, however, that the authorities will hardly lay
                        these rails on anything but branch lines and sidings where heavy traffic
                        will not be the order of the day. The effect of the experiment will be
                        watched with interest. We have not particulars of the exact price per ton
                        charged for these rails.bat the value of the contract was about £150,00, and
                        there were 21,000 tons, so that it would appear that the price works out at
                        a little over £7 per ton. If such is the case, one can hardly blame the
                        manufacturer, whether he he Ger- man or Anyone else, if the quality of the
                        rails should prove unsatisfactory.</p>

                    <p>FRENCHMAN’S ATTEMPT AT SUICIDE. </p>
                    <p> Some curious circumstances attended the attempted suicide of a Frenchman
                        this morn- ing at Alexandria. </p>
                    <p> A certain M. Faure arrived at Alexandria a short time ago and took op his
                        abode at the Hôtel 'de Marseilles, near the French Market. On his arrival he
                        made an application to the Alexandria Municipality for a license to sell ice
                        cream in the streets, but he did not obtain his request, although he was
                        strongl supported. The man had means of his own and was in no want of money.
                        He lived quietly at the hotel with his brother. This morning, how- ever, he
                        showed signs of aberration and began to tear to pieces a number of shares
                        which he possessed. His brother rushed to the French Consulate to ask that
                        he should be placed under protection and the Consulate at once despatched M.
                        Bertrand and a kawass to the house. </p>
                    <p> On arriving they found M. Faure undressed. He asked them to wait a minute
                        while he put on his clothes in order to accompany them to the Consulate.
                        They accordingly withdrew into an adjoining room. Shortly afterwards the
                        report of a revolver was heard and on entering the bed-room they found M.
                        Faure lying in a pool of blood. He had discharged the contents of his
                        revolver into his head behind the ear. He has been taken to the European
                        Hospital in a desperate condition.</p>

                    <p>AL OMMEH’S SCHEMB. </p>
                    <p> "Al-Ommeh” publishes a long article of which the following is an extract :-
                        "The object of this article is to awaken the Arabic-speaking populations and
                        all other peoples of the Orient, and summon them to a friendly understanding
                        which would enable them to seek prosperity. Mohamedans and Christians have
                        already experienced a great deal of trouble and backwardness. Their
                        countries were ruined and kingdoms devoured when their old good qualities
                        were extinguished by selfish interests, and their unity disintegra- ted by
                        corruption. We never mentioned Pan- Islamism till we saw the policy of
                        Bogland in the Orient entirely directed against the Ottoman Government. Some
                        people who pretend to be Ottoman subjects, but at the same time serve the
                        interests of the Occupation, have done a great deal of harm in this country.
                        Instead of supporting the Oriental Government and sympathising with her they
                        misled many simple minded Moslems in Egypt and elsewhere and encouraged them
                        to abuse the Sultan, whereas they should have sought the union of Islam and
                        Christianity in the East so as to attain that high state of progress which
                        pre- vailed in the time of the Abbassides. All who did and do so serious a
                        harm to the nation by endeavouring to cat off Egypt from the Sultan’s
                        dominions are self-seeking traitors who care for nothing outside personal
                        advant- age. We wish to make our object dear and sure, viz., to persuade our
                        brethren the Oriental Christiansto support us in this laud- able object in
                        the hope of helping us out of our backwardness, and prove to the European
                        world, especially the British people, that we are ready to act side by side
                        to oar mutual prosperity, and show that the past wars, differences, and
                        religious dissensions had never produced bad effects upon oar minds so far
                        as to prevent us from seeking prosperity.</p>

                    <head>OUR CONSULAR SERVICE.</head>
                    <p>REPLY TO "CIVIS."</p>
                    <p>To the Editor of the “Egyptian Gazette.’’ Sir,—“Civis” has in his reply to my
                        article on “Our Consuls” attempted to imitate the unparalleled feat of
                        Sampson, to overthrow | the very foundation of my argument, which rests on
                        the three questions, which are as to I., Nationality ; II, Qualifications ;
                        III. Character His silence on Question I. implies his tacit agreement with
                        it. To Question II. he replies that “the necessary qualifications for a
                        Consul are more numerous than he would appear to imagine. Mere commercial
                        knowledge is nothing-if not backed up by a knowledge of the languages and
                        history of the locality to which he is appointed.” Here- in I most beg to
                        differ with learned counsel for the defence. History, like the majority of
                        consular reports (which, by the bye, I have consulted in English, French,
                        Ger- man, and Italian), is retrospective ; in busi- ness, my dear “Civis,”
                        we gamble in “futures,” never in “pasts,” no matter how brilliant they may
                        have been. There are many wise sayings on this score, and the one that suits
                        best the present case is, ‘Happy the nation that has no history.’ If
                        language and history are to be the background to the commercial knowledge of
                        the Consul, then the best men whom the Foreign Office should appoint would
                        be those eminent men who occupy the chairs of lan- guages and history in our
                        homo universities. However, in fairness to "Civis,” I will submit the
                        following instance, which is founded on absolute fact:—I know a Consul
                        General from the United States of America who knew about Turkey and its
                        languages no more than the man in the moon. All he could speak was Yankee,
                        in fact in many ways he was as ignorant as the ordinary tourist , but with
                        this saving virtue, “he was a business man.” Know- ing neither the country
                        nor its languages, he nevertheless set to in a practical, business way, and
                        in a couple of years had organised a direct steamship line from Now York to
                        Turkey, had fought a corner which opposed some flour he was importing,
                        introduced American agricul- tural machinery in large quantities into Asia
                        Minor, and had by simple business experience established a strong foothold
                        for American produce. Was this the remit of history . and language, or
                        simply business capacity? The remark applies to the German, Austrian, and
                        Italian Consulates, who have come to recognise that commerce, the exponent
                        of a nation’s wealth and labour, is the one thing worth knowing. May I ask
                        if Germany owes her recent tremendous expansion to the knowledge of
                        languages and history or to the more profitable one of trade ? </p>
                    <p> If "mere commercial knowledge is nothing” history and language, which
                        "Civis” says are essential to it, show otherwise. Tyre and ! Sidon owed
                        their very existence as a sea power to commercial knowledge ; the language!
                        and history of the many lands to which they extended their commerce were of
                        no use to them in pushing their goods, for I very much doubt whether the Phœ
                        ician win landed on the shores of Britain knew much either about the
                        language or the history of our ancestors. Venice, which is the historical
                        replica of Tyre and Sidon, certainly did not find markets for her wares
                        simply by her knowledge of the languages and history of the people whose
                        lands she invaded, and where the grand old monu- ments of that bold Republic
                        still testify to the commercial knowledge of her Consuls, or Bayles. </p>
                    <p> No, my dear Civis, your argument won’t bold water. Trade and the deepest
                        knowledge of it? are the pillars upon which Britain rests, a s other nations
                        are finding ; they are the teases, moreover, of politics and history,’and
                        certainly have had more to do with 'he making of language than any other
                        factor, because of the immense interests involved. Germany has not a single
                        warship in the Ægean, nor a soldier nearer to Turkey than the Riesen
                        Gibirge, and y it to-day her influence in Con- stantinople is stronger than
                        were the guns of her North Sea fleet collectively trained on Yild’z Kiosque.
                        And why? Simply because Kaiser, and Ambassador, and Consul have realized
                        that “mere” commercial knowledge is the key to Asia. The Consul in bis
                        official capacity can get information which neither commercial traveller nor
                        British manufacturer can; but how many of them do so ? Their time, they say,
                        is occupied with far more important matters, whereas as a matter of tact it
                        is these “less” significant matters of trade that are the really important
                        one?. Sup- posing the Consul, as he ought, has at his finger ends, the
                        lowest c.i.t. quotation of our rivals and duly notifies the fact, is Dot
                        this prompt information much better for British trade than the stereotyped
                        return, which explains nothing ? Let us go into details as they are in
                        matter-of-fact life : A particular shape of spade is used by the Turkish
                        labourer, who buys it in Stanboul at 20 piastres retail ; the article is of
                        local manu- facture. The German Consul will note this, pack off a specimen
                        to Berlin, quoting the lowest wholesale prices for it, and giving details
                        about it just as if he were the salaried agent of a hardware house. The
                        result is that machinery wins the day over hand labour, and the next thing
                        we see is a German made spade on the Stamboul market selling for 15 piastres
                        retail. And this applies not only to spades, bat to everything else. The
                        German Consul enters into the practical side of things, deals piece by piece
                        with each article, whereas his British colleague contends himself with a
                        gene- ral survey, which, however, overlooks the essential details.</p>

                    <cb n="5"/>

                    <p>I recognize in the Consul the salaried com- mercial traveller of the British
                        nation ; his sole duties, I hold, are the safeguarding, fostering, and
                        promotion of our trade - politics are for his Embassy to deal with. The
                        Capitulations have led the Consular Body astray from the right path of their
                        duties, but at any rate in one province of the Ottoman Empire a reform seems
                        lcoming on the horizon in this respect. I have exhausted your patience and
                        the ink pot, but under the circumstances I feel I am justified in having
                        done so. Too much history has blinded us to the great strides of our rivals
                        If twenty years ago Turkish trade was in our hands we must not still base
                        our calculations on that record, hot see how we stand “now” and how we shall
                        stand in the “future.” The only way for our Consuls to tell us this is by
                        means of commercial know- ledge, le nerf de la guerre. </p>

                    <head>TURKEY SUSPICIOUS.</head>
                    <p>The Porte appears to view the proposed Anglo-Russian rapprochement with
                        suspicion. Anglophobes and Russophobes alike are, a telegram from
                        Constantinople states, united as to the necessity of impressing upon the
                        Sultan the almost vital importance which such an event would possess in
                        relation to Turkey. For some years his Majesty has been actua- ted by the
                        conviction that a spirit of mutual suspicion and distrust on the part of
                        Great Britain and Russia was indispensable to the preservation of the
                        integrity cf Ottoman role in Mesopotamia and of the authority which his
                        Majesty still possesses over a part of the littoral of the Persian Gulf. An
                        Anglo-Russian entente, in order to justify its title, would imply that a
                        special understanding had been arrived at between the two countries on
                        various debatable questions, including, amongst others, those of tho Persian
                        province of Irak and the Persiau Gulf. </p>
                    <p> It is easy to understand, therefore, how the possibility of an entente which
                        would pre- suppose an agreement on these two questions, amongst other Asian
                        problems, is occupying the mind of Abdul Hamid, who is naturally distrustful
                        of every regrouping cf his Euro- lean neighbours. In this dilemma his
                        Majesty has begun to place his hopes in an abrupt entry on the scene of
                        Germany, who, in his opinion, will not allow any of the Powers to minimise
                        the authority of Turkey in the Persian Gulf. The apprehension is also felt
                        by the Sultan that an Anglo Russian agreement would eventually lead to the
                        demand for an smeliora- tion of the conditions cf the Armenian inhabitants
                        of Anatolia. From this point, it would be a natural consequence for Great
                        Britain and Ruissia to unite in the application in Macedonia, and also in
                        the province of Adrianople of a programme of reforms which should be
                        effective in every sense of the word — a programme which Great Britain
                        alone, amongst the Great Powers of Europe, has appeared disposed seriously
                        to enter ain.</p>

                        portant papyri and inscriptions, discovered in recent years, which are now
                        published for the first time. The author points out that the work is the
                        outcome of two lectures on tho Books of the Tuat, i.e., the Egyptian
                        Underworld, or ‘‘Other World,” delivered at the Royal Institution in the
                        spring of 1904, and it has been prepared at the suggestion of many who
                        wished to continue their enquiries into tho beliefs of the Egyptians
                        concerning the abode of the departed, and the state 01 the blessed and the
                        damned.” The object of all the Books of the Other World, he goes on to
                        explain, was to provide the dead with a “Guide” or "Handbook,” containing a
                        descrip- tion of the regions through which their souls would have to pass on
                        their way to the Kingdom of Osiris, or to that portion of the sky where the
                        sun rose, and which would supply thorn with the words if power, and magical
                        names necessary for making an unim- peded journey from this world to the
                        abode of the blessed. The principal Books of the Underworld in vogue under
                        the 18th and 19th Dynasties were (1) Per-Em-Hru, or, "(The Book) of the
                        Coming Forth by Day.” (2) Shat Ent Am Tuat, or, "The Book of that which is
                        in the Tuat.” (3) The composition to which the name “Book of Gates” has been
                        given. The Egyptian Heaven and Hell is published in three volumes, the first
                        of which contains the complete hieroglyphic text of the Book of Am Tuat,
                        together with translations and reproductions of all illustrations. These
                        illu strations, numbering 180, have been reproduc- ed with great accuracy,
                        and the student will find this part of the work of great value. The
                        translations contain some very descrip tive passages, and afford farther
                        evidence of the high state of culture attained by tho Egyptians of old. The
                        following, from the scene that illustrates the Fifth Division of the Tuat
                        which is passed through by the Sun- god during the Fifth Hour of the night,
                        is a typical example : ’’This great god saith, Oye stand by your waters, who
                        keep ward over your lauds, who go round about in the pool of those who are
                        submerged in Nn, pilot ye those to the lands of the sea of the Tuat, unto
                        your waters which never dry up, and rise ye nu in your lands and lot me
                        travel over yon in peace. This great god saith, O ye life ye up your weapons
                        to your...image, and protect ye the foreheads of your maat, and perform ye
                        your work, in order that I may be able to pass by you in peace.” </p>
                    <p> Also this, concerning the story of the Nine Serpents :- “The majesty of this
                        great god speaketh words to these male gods who are at the head of this city
                        :—Hail, O nine forms of the divine spirits, whose faces are of flames, who
                        are provided with your knives, ham ye np the enemies of Khepera, hack in
                        pieces their shades, for ye are the warders of the Hidden Flesh, which is
                        made of Nu, your habitation, for it is ye who dwell in the Water of
                        Ta-thenen, and it is for you that the magical powers of Khepera came into
                        being. They have their means of living from the word of Ra every day. The
                        work which they do in the Tuat is to hack asunder the dead, and to cause the
                        spirits to be destroyed.” The second volume gives the complete hieroglyphic
                        text of the Summary of the Book Am-Tuat, and the hieroglyphic text cf the
                        Book of Gates, with translations and reproduc- tions of all illustrations.
                        This ‘Summary of the Book of what is in the Underworld” s fiords a clear
                        idea of what the Egyptians of the past believed of the "Other World.” We
                        reproduce the translation of "The First Hour:—” "This god entereth into the
                        earth through the Hall of the horizon of Amentet. There are one hundred and
                        twenty Atru to journey over in this Hall before a man arriveth at the gods
                        of the Tuat. </p>
                    <p> "The name of the first Field of the Tuat is NET RA. He (i.e., RA) allotteth
                        fields to the gods who are in (his) following, and he begin- net to send
                        forth words to and to work out the plans of the divine beings of the Tuat in
                        respect of this Field. </p>
                    <p> “Whosever shall have these made (i.e., copied) according to the similitude
                        which is in Ament of the Tuat (and) whosoever shall have knowledge of these
                        similitudes (which are) the copies of this great god himself, they shall act
                        as magical protectors for him upon earth regularly and unfailingly, and they
                        tall act magical protectors for him in the great Tuat. </p>
                    <p> "USHEMET HATU-KHEFTI-RA is the name of the (first) hour of the night which
                        guideth this great god through this Hall.” The concluding volume deals with
                        the origin of the illustrated guides to the Other World, in which the
                        history and development of these wonderful text books, which enable us so
                        accurately to understand the definite ideas held by the ancients of the
                        abode of the departed, are admirably and elaborately traced from the
                        earliest times. We are told that the oldest of the known Books of the Dead,
                        that is, the religious compositions which are inscribed on the walls of the
                        chambers and corridors of the pyramids of kings Unas, Teta, Pepi I.,
                        Mer-en-Ra, and Pepi II, are without illustrations of any kind, and this fact
                        is difficult of explanation, <cb n="6"/> for it is apparent, from the
                        evidences we have around us, that even in these early days the Egyptians
                        possessed remarkable ar tistic ability, which, it would be thought, would
                        have manifested itself in the religions works, as it did at a later date. To
                        Professor Maspero we are indebted for a probable solution of the difficulty.
                        According to hiar^the "pyramid texts” contain formnlae and paragraphs, which
                        have the appeararce of having been composed in the earliest times of
                        Egyptian civilisation. These formulæ are interspersed with others of later
                        periods, and it is believed that, at the time when the "pyramid texts” were
                        cut into stone, these religious compositions were intended to contain
                        expressions of pions thought about the hereafter which would satisfy both
                        those who accepted tho ancient indigenous beliefs and those who were
                        prepared to be- lieve the doctrines which had been promulgated by the
                        priests of the famous brotherhood of Ra, the Sun-god, who had made their
                        headquarters in Egypt at Annu, ie, On, or Heliopolis”. The oldest Books of
                        the Dead, in fact, re- present the compromise arrived at under the 4th, 5th
                        and 6th Dynasties, between the priests of the old and the new reli- gions. </p>
                    <p> Dr. Badge must have devoted an enormous amount of time and energy to be able
                        to present the subject in such detail, yet in so read- able a form, and he
                        deserves the thanks of a Egyptologists for the further services he has thus
                        rendered to the cause of Egyptian research. </p>
                    <p> The printing of the hieroglyphics end draw- ings is admirable, as is also
                        the text. The work is published by Messrs Kegan, Paul, Trench, Trubner &amp;

                    <head>SOLDIERING IN EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>AS OTHERS SEE US.</p>
                    <p>(From ‘ Les Annales Antialccoliques.”) </p>
                    <p> The English Army of Occupation in Egypt numbers about 6,000 men, who are
                        paid a shilling a day by the Egyptian Government In a country where the wine
                        imported from Greece and Italy is very cheap, and where spirits of all kinds
                        can be had for a piastre, it might be imagined that tho streets of
                        Alexandria and Cairo would present a frequent spectacle of military
                        drunkenness. On the con- trary such a spectacle is very rare, at all events
                        as far as the privates and the non-commis- sioned officers are concerned. </p>
                    <p> A foot perhaps still more remarkable is that the sailors from English
                        men-of-war, who are allowed to go on shore at Alexandris, almost invariably
                        set an excellent example to foreigners and Datives in their behaviour—in
                        this presenting a sad contrast to what is often seen among oar own French
                        sailors. What is the reason for these things ? It is to be found in an
                        admirable organisation which is extending more and more in the British
                        Empire, and is especially active in Alexandria and Cairo. I refer to the
                        temper- ance homes erected and carried on for the benefit of his Britannic
                        Majesty’s soldiers and sailors. </p>
                    <p> The English woman who loves her country has found that it is necessary to
                        keep British soldiers as far as possible from contact with the natives of
                        the countries where they are stationed. This contact taking place chiefly in
                        the liquor shops, to tho great detriment of the soldier’s health, it is
                        especially these that must be opposed. She has said to herself that, in
                        order not to give subject races the spectacle of rulers whom they cannot
                        respect, those who represent and maintain the authority of Great Britain
                        must be intelligently occupied and constantly interested, and she has shown
                        herself equal to the talk. She has everywhere created soldiers’ and sailors’
                        home’, where the men, daring their sojourn in that country or their stay on
                        shore, can find united the greatest comfort and tho most healthy recrea-
                        tion. Games of all kinds—billiards, football, tennis, cricket, chess,
                        draughts, cards—a well- filled library, writing and reading-rooms, bath-
                        rooms, etc., are all found in these homes. Alcohol is entirely forbidden
                        there The supervision of the ladies serving on the com- mittees of these
                        homes is most thorough, and the needs of the men are carefully noted and
                        supplied. </p>
                    <p> Tho result of these efforts is that the dis- cipline and the behaviour of
                        the English Army in Egypt is beyond praise, and has produced a very
                        favourable impression on the native Egyptians. Though the latter still
                        dislike their conquerors, and still cherish a lively sympathy- for the
                        French, yet they feel a certain mistrust of French soldiers, owing to their
                        intemperance.</p>

                    <p>Un de nos confrères du Caire daDS, un article cornac é aux compensations
                        accordées aux promoteurs d’une société anonyme, s’exprime ainsi : </p>
                    <p> Les promoteurs de socrétés ont principale- ment en vue, cela se conçoit
                        aisément, le bé- néfice qu’il peuvent personnellement tirer de l’affaire
                        qu’ils se sont chargés de mener à bien. Eu Egypte, ce bénéfice consiste,
                        principalement en parts de fondateur. </p>
                    <p> C’est à-dire que si l’affaire est bonne le bé- néfice da promoteur est
                        assuré par la valeur qu’acquiert la part de fondateur, si elle est mauvaise,
                        la part de bénéfice ne vaut rien et le bénéfice du promoteur est nul. Il a
                        donc tout in'érêt à ne s’occuper que de bonnes af- faires, d’affaires
                        d’avenir oar, plus elles seront sérieuses, plus elles seront honnêtes, plus
                        elles feront gagner d’argent aux actionnaires et plus il gagnera lui même.
                        C’est facile à com- prendre. </p>
                    <p> En Angleterre, ce souci a été, depuis long- temps supprimé par les
                        promoteurs. Ils gar- dent les parts de fondateur quand il y en a, mais ils
                        n’en créent pas souvent parce que c’est mal va. Il faut, en effet, être an
                        imbécile poor se contenter d’on bénéfice hypothétique, alors qu'il est si
                        simple de s’accorder nue compen- sation immédiate en bonnes espèces

                    <head>SYRIAN TRADE.</head>
                    <p>BEYROUT.</p>
                    <p>In his report on the trade and commerce of Beyrout and the coast of Syria for
                        1905, Mr. Drunmmond-Hay, Consul-General, states that the returns of foreign
                        shipping show that, although there was a decrease in the number of British
                        ships, their tonnage was higher than the preceding year. This was mainly duo
                        to the fact that Messrs. Westcott's (Eller- man) line of steamers called
                        leas frequently at Beyrout. British shipping on the Syrian coast was
                        represented chiefly by the Prince Line and Bell’s Asia Minor Steamship
                        Company. The bulk of British goods from the United Kingdom was carried by
                        the former, which also shared with the Deutsche Levante Linie and tho
                        Belgian line of steamers Adolf Deppe, in the transport of Belgian products,
                        con- sisting, chiefly of iron, including all iron mate- rials for tho Hedjaz
                        and Aleppo railways. The latter’s requirements will total about 40,000 tons
                        before it is completed. There are besides 10,000 tons of rails and other
                        articles being shipped for the now electric tramway at Damascus, a part of
                        which has already been landed at Beyrout. </p>
                    <p> A new German line of steamers, the Atlas of Bremen, will, it is expected,
                        open a monthly service on the Syrian coast. This will bring about a keen
                        competition between tho diffe- rent lines, to the advantage probably of
                        ship- pers. </p>
                    <p> For the outward return voyages, British vessels had a decided advantage
                        owing to the large quantity of barley shipped from the Sy- rian coast to the
                        United Kingdom. The export returns for 1905 show that about 15,000 tons of
                        barley were taken from this port alone, and there is every probability that
                        this amount will be nearly doubled during 1906. In anti- cipation of this
                        large demand the rolling-stock of the existing railway lines, Beyrout-Damas-
                        Hauran and Rayak-Homs-Hama, has been increased to meet the grain trade. The
                        com- pany is even considering the adoption of the original project of a
                        broad-gauge line to sup- plant tho present tramway, which crosses the
                        Lebanon Range over very steep gradients. It is not, however, likely that
                        this scheme will be carried out in the near future, as the in- evitable
                        construction of a long tunnel under Kaneisy would necessitate a large
                        outlay, for which the railway company is not prepared. The Hedjaz Railway,
                        which has now laid nearly 650 kiloms. of rails out of the 1,800 kiloms.
                        required to reach Mecca (excluding the branch line to Haifa), will in future
                        have all shipments of their goods landed at Haifa. This change will be
                        followed by a considerable decrease in 1906 in the imports of rails, and
                        coal contracts have already been signed by tho Hedjaz Railroad Commission
                        for 15,000 tons of Cardiff patent fuel to be discharged at Haifa during
                        1906. </p>
                    <p> It is now a much-debated question whether this new railroad, having its
                        terminus at the port of Haifa, will injure the trade of Beyrout, and many
                        fear that the unsatisfactory state of the Custom House administration at
                        Beyrout, combined with the heavy dues of the port company and the inability
                        of the Beyrout- Hama-Aleppo Line to meet the demands of trades in their
                        traffic will, unless remedied, he most prejudicial to the interests of
                        Beyrout.</p>

                    <p>There was a rise in the imports of about £110,000 as compared with the
                        preceding year, British articles alone showing an in- crease of £80,000.
                        This was mainly due to Manchester goods, which maintain the pre- ponderance
                        of British trade. </p>
                    <p> HAIFA AND ACRE. </p>
                    <p> Mr. Acting Vice-Consul P. Abela reports as follows :—The returns of the
                        import trade of Haifa and Acre for 1905 do not differ much from the
                        preceding year ; but those of the export trade are very high owing to an
                        excep- tionally fine harvest and to the fact that prices for cereals were
                        favourable in Europe. The railway from Haifa to Damascus will make many
                        openings for British manufactures. The principal articles that would find a
                        market in this district are oil-engines for working flour mills and for
                        irrigation purposes, hardware, ironmongery and agricultural machinery. </p>
                    <p> Application for contracts to supply the rail- way with coal and other
                        materials should be made to the headquarters of the Hedjaz Rail- road at
                        Constantinople.</p>

                        tho value of Peruna in cases of ca- tarrhal dyspepsia. If yon suffer from
                        stomach catarrh in any of its various forms, give Peruna a fair trial,
                        avoiding in tho meantime all such Indiscretions in diet as would tend to
                        retard a cure, and yon will soon be rewarded by a normal appetite and

                    <head>ASSOCIATION Dü COMMERCE DTMPORTARION.</head>
                    <p>Dimanche matin à 10 1/2 a eu lien L’assemblée générale de '.’Association du
                        Commerce d’Im portation. </p>
                    <p> Communication a été donnée du rapport sar les travaux de l’exercice écoulé.
                        Dans ce rapport, le Comité s’est préoccupé de certains abus auquels donne
                        lien le régime actuel de la livraison des marchandises ex- pédiées par
                        Chemin de fer. L’Administra- tion se contente poor la livraison des mar-
                        chandises de la remise pure et simple du récépissé sans exiger aucune
                        signature. Il arrive que des destinataires de mauvaise foi nient avoir reçu
                        la marchandise alors même que le récépissé leur avait été envoyé par lettre
                        recommandée. </p>
                    <p> Le Chemin de Fer dans ce cas peut bien prouver la livraison, mais il ne peut
                        établir à qui il a livré. </p>
                    <p> L’attention du Comité a été également attirée sur les dates inscrites sur le
                        récépissé. Le chemin de fer inscrit sur ’e récépissé la date du jour où le
                        récépissé a été émis àprès paiement du transport. Cette date eat quel-
                        quefois postérieure d’un jour ou deux a la véri- table date d’expédition et
                        il en résulte que le destinataire prenant la dace du récépissé pour celle de
                        l’expédition, est amené à se tromper sur le jour probable d’arrivée et paie
                        quelque- fois du magasinage auquel il ne s’attendait pas. Des observations
                        sont aussi parvenues au Comité au sujet da tarif de magasinage du chemin de
                        fer au Gabbari et au Caire pour marchandises rétirées eu retard, tarif qui
                        re- présente pour certains colis légers tels que certaines naisses de sucre,
                        d’amidon, etc-, une charge très lourde. </p>
                    <p> Pour ce qui concerne les ponts sur le canal Mahmoudieh, an dé'égué du Comité
                        s’est occupé de cette question comma membre d’une commission chargée
                        d’étudier l’augmen- tation des ponts sur le Canal. </p>
                    <p> Cette Commission réunissait des réprésen tants des Administrations
                        intéressées ainsi qu’un représentant du Commerce d’Exporta- tion. </p>
                    <p> En raison du développement du traffic, les ponts existants étant devenus
                        insuffisants, leur augmentation est absolument nécessaire, et la Commission
                        précitée a proposé la construction de deux nouveaux ponts et le remplacement
                        du pont Ibrahim par un pont plus large. Les ministères compétents ont du
                        reste déjà ap- prouvé en principe ces propositions et il est probable qu’on
                        passera a l’exécution, lorsque les administrations compétentes se seront
                        mises d’accord quant aux contributions à la dépense.</p>

                    <p>MR. WILLIAMS' LECTURE.</p>
                    <p>The following are some extracts from the interesting lecture on the above
                        subject de livered by Mr. R. Williams, F.R.I.B.A., under the auspices of the
                        A. L. M. and D. S. on Monday :— </p>
                    <p> At a time so remote aa to defy comparison, there dwelt in this land men who
                        practised architecture on a scale so vast aa to command, even to day, the
                        winder and admiration of the world. Ages upon ages have passed away and the
                        land has been subject to alternations of seasons of famine and of plenty,
                        but the groat monuments remain to tell os of the seasons of plenty, for we
                        may assume, with truth, that none of the great buildings of ancient Egypt
                        were built by a famine stricken people. Once more has the cycle come round.
                        We are again in a season of plenty. Like a full flood of the Nile, warmed by
                        a strong autumn sun, making life to spring forth anew, there flows over this
                        wonderful land of Egypt a wave of great pros- perity, the signs of which are
                        read in the great activity in building and the upward march of land values. </p>
                    <p> We live in strenuous times. Our thoughts and our lives fly like a weaver’s
                        shuttle. We have hardly time to give heed to the transfor- mation scene that
                        is going on around us. On all sides the great towns are being extended, the
                        older parts being partially pulled down and rebuilt and the streets widened
                        ; new towns are springing up in the Sudan and elsewhere. So great is the
                        activity that we have scarcely time to ask ourselves whether we are doing
                        that which is worth doing. There is nothing mysterious about archi- tecture,
                        but much mystery lies in the phan- tasmagoria of applied ornament, rightly
                        named in Alexandria “Fantasia,” but sometimes miscalled architecture. Let,
                        us, however, con- template, as Ruskin would have us do, for, at least, a few
                        minutes. In Egypt we can go a very long way back into the silent ages of the
                        past and here we find, more truly than, perhaps, anywhere, save in nature
                        herself, those sermons in stones, graven by a strange and wonderful people,
                        which, in a character at once as beautiful as it is profoundly ornamental,
                        tell us of the doings of nations whose polity was old when, as yet, the
                        Briton was in the palæolithic state. Whether an ancient Egyptian was the
                        first architect it may be difficult, perhaps impos- sible, to tell, but we
                        may believe with Pro- fessor Petrie that it was "his inherent pi war for
                        design and decoration which made the Egyptian the father of the world’s
                        ornament.” I The first ornamentist was probably the son of the first
                        architect; especially may this be true when we remember that ornament and -
                        building want together in the ancient archi- tectural works of the
                        Egyptians, for it is j mainly upon the walls and the columns of their
                        buildings that the ornament of the Egyptian fathers is found. </p>
                    <p> In this practice of ornamenting their con- struction the Egyptian architects
                        provide us, at the outset, with a good definition of architecture, which,
                        however, like all defini- tions, is difficult to put into terms. Sanmut, the
                        ancient Egyptian architect, a picture of whose statue is given in Petrie’s
                        History of Egypt, would probably say to his students : “In good building,
                        the materials should be of the best and Lankly acknowledged; if you will
                        have ornament then ornament your construction, never hide your construction
                        by ornament.”— a definition as true as it is old, but in practice to-day far
                        more honoured in the breach than in the observance. In this definition, that
                        was the outcome of their practice the old Egyptian architects showed
                        themselves to ba artists par excellence. How long they had practised is, as
                        ye:, a mystery. One of their oldest buildings, the Pyramid of Cheops, shows
                        no erode beginnings of the art of building as of a nation in its child-
                        hood. We can find no graduated steps which arrive at the beautifully jointed
                        and exquisite- ly worked blocks of granite lining the interior of the king’s
                        chamber. This work seems rather to be the work of men to whom mere weight
                        and size was as nothing,. men who handled blocks of 20 or 30 tons of granite
                        as a child might handle its box of wood bricks. Moreover, great size and
                        weight was no bar to the truth and beauty of their manipulative skill The
                        only drawback to this beauty of execution is a slight deterioration of the
                        workmanship, noticed by Professor Petrie, and which took place after the
                        death of the old architect—an incident which shows, in parsing, that even
                        7.000 years ago the architect or chief constructor was an absolute
                        necessity. </p>
                    <p> How long the forerunners of those wonderful pyramid builders took to arrive
                        at their per- fection of workmanship and unrivalled skill in the handling of
                        material, we cannot tell ; whether their architectural schooling was spread
                        over hundreds or thousands of years ,we cannot now compute ; whether those
                        mysterious builders of the Nile valley were indigenous to the soil or comers
                        from other or lost lands (as those of the supposed Atlantis buried under the
                        Atlantic Ocean,and whether they brought with them a long, used system of
                        architecture we do not know. But what we do know is that those men who lived
                        in those far-off ages built and built to last, even as one of their old
                        poets wrote 3,000 year? ago : </p>
                    <p> I built for thee a temple of millions of years, </p>
                    <p> … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … </p>
                    <p> … … … … … … … … … … … … … … … </p>
                    <p> Building for thee the pylons of stone unto completion </p>
                    <p> Setting up for thee their masts myself: </p>
                    <p> Bringing for thee obelisks of Elephantine, </p>
                    <p> I have caused eternal stones to be brought. </p>

                    <head>A SYRIAN ADVISER OF THE SULTAN.</head>
                    <p>Daring the Tabah dispute a correspondent at Constantinople discussed with a
                        Syrian official, who is high in the Sultan’s favour, but privately holds
                        Liberal views, some of the points involved. In the course of the interview
                        the Syrian said : — </p>
                    <p> If you had only allowed us to remain under Mehemet Ali we should have been a
                        province of Egypt, enjoying the most perfect freedom, whereas now we are
                        ground down under the heel of the Turk, whom we despise. Free Syria, give it
                        autonomy, or let it be annexed to Egypt, and yon will see the country
                        prosperous beyond conception in less than a decade. Your Gov- ernment has
                        gone the wrong way to work in the Akabah question. You should have worked
                        through Izzet Pasha, who is &amp; Syrian, and through his friendB the
                        Melhame brothers, also Syrians. They would have arranged the recall of Ghazi
                        Mukhtar Pacha and cf his son Mahmoud Pacha, who are both working the Herman
                        propaganda in Egypt, and who are winning over the young Egyptian party to
                        the German cause. Had your Embassy here been well inormed they would have
                        secured the sup- port of Izzet:, who foresees the early fall of the Sultan,
                        sud is ready to worship the rising sun. He is undecided whether to cast in
                        his lot with Youssouf Izzedin, the son of Abdul Aziz, or with the young son
                        of Abdul Hamid, Bar- haneddin. The former has a large Turkish fol- lowing.
                        The latter is favoured by the Mel- hame brothers, who are exceedingly
                        wealthy, and they bave persuaded the Sultan to nomi- nate an Italian officer
                        as his Governor, and on the Sultan’s death they would make a bold bid to
                        place the young Prince on the throne, to the exclusion of all the elder
                        members of the family. Izzet rather favours the son of Abdul Aziz, and is
                        already in close relations with him, unknown, of coarse, to his Royal
                        master. He has, however, an open mind on this as ou any other question where
                        money maybe made. </p>
                    <p> Izzet Pacha knows the condition of the Syrian army, none better. At his word
                        that army would refuse to act. He is president of the Mecca Railway. At his
                        order that line would ba stopped. Izzet is undoubtedly the ablest man in
                        Turkey and the most unscrupu- lous. Act with him, and you can do what you
                        please. Pay bin his pries, and the Syrians will range themselves on the side
                        of England, the Akabah difficulty will vanish, autonomy can be granted to
                        Macedonia and a Constitu- tion to the Empire. Pay him his price. guarantee
                        him his position (his life be knows no one can guarantee), and you will have
                        the ablest intriguer in Europe your most devoted servant, In dealing with
                        Izzet do not forget Mahmoud Pacha, the son of Ghazi Mukhtar. Mahmoud is the
                        ablest soldier in the Empire ; ha is more, he is absolutely honest and a man
                        who never spare himself where work is concerned. Recall Mahmoud Pacha
                        through Izzet’s influence and have him made Minister of War. You would find
                        the Turkish army in twelve months a per- fect fighting machine. You may say
                        this sounds too fantastic to be possible. I reply, read the history of
                        Turkey, even of the past century, of the past thirty years, and then tell me
                        if my scheme is fantastic. It will cost money, it is true. So do your
                        repeated naval demonstrations. The deposition of Abdul Aziz cost Midhat and
                        his associates less than £20,000. Prices have gone up since Herr Krupp
                        conquered Turkey, bat I am sure that your statesmen could arrange this
                        affair satisfac- torily for less than a quarter of a million sterling. Could
                        money be better invested ? A Constitution for the Ottoman Empire, auto- nomy
                        for Macedonia and Syria, financial control over the country, and the Eastern
                        Ques- tion laid to rest without war and without a Conference. Sorely the
                        scheme is worth an effort.</p>

                    <p>THE FAILURE OF THE GERMANS AT TIIE GAMES.</p>
                    <p>German writers, commenting on the failure of German athletes to carry off
                        signal honours from tin recent Olympian contests, assert em- phatically that
                        the chief cause of the low standard of their physical achievements lies in
                        the beer drinking habits, which are to a large extent sapping the national
                        vigour. Beer drinking commences with the German youth in his student days,
                        when, at the festive student meetings, the regulations of the stu- dent
                        corps makes the consumption of a certain fixed amount of beer compulsory.
                        The “beer habit” is, several German writers agree, the cause of the varions
                        typical traits which han- dicap the German athlete. It prevents him from
                        acquiring the tautness of muscle which distinguishes his English and
                        American op- ponents ; it not only gives rise to supeifluous fat, but
                        seriously affects the heart, the sport organ par excellence. </p>
                    <p> At present there is a movement for repress- ing the Anglicising of the
                        German youth, who, indeed, has little inclination towards the bygienic
                        personal habits of the Britisher and his moderateness in drinking.</p>

                        chapter on modern Egyptian research, and vies with many beautiful

                    <p> Come, let os sit for an hour on this verandah at the very edge of the Nile.
                        The sun is sink- ing beyond the western hills. Its great and glowing ball
                        looks almost as though it were falling through that clear and azure sky, so
                        rapidly does it appear to reach the low brown ridge yonder to the west. See,
                        it rests there for a moment, like the golden symbol of its disc on the stone
                        brow of an Egyptian god, then slides behind it and is gone. </p>
                    <p> Now the eastern slopes of the hills become veiled in shadow, bat on the
                        placid waters of old Nile a glow still lingers, while the opposing mass of
                        rugged cliff, that hides the sepulchres cf so many mighty kings and queens,
                        stands up as scarred and grim as it did upon that night when the first of
                        the Pharaohs who lie yonder —no, I am wrong, modern research has pro- vided
                        them with glass cases in the new museum —who lay yonder, looked upon its
                        frowning face and decreed that there in the place of the setting sun, there
                        in the house of Osiris, God of the Dead, he would lie asleep at last. The
                        cliffs fade, but, made glorious by that wonderful glow, a crowded ferry boat
                        can be seen crossing the stream to Luxor ; the great hawks, too, sacred once
                        to Horus, gather its' light upon their wings as they float past Between the
                        foot of the western hills and the bank of the Nile rises a grey and ghostly
                        mist that clings most thickly about the dense green of the palms and growing
                        crops. </p>
                    <p> Oat the town upon our left comes a con- stant clamour of noisy, chattering
                        fellaheen, barking dozs, and braying asses. Along the path below the
                        verandah stroll three great Sudanese, remarkable for their tangled, mat-
                        like hair. A little while ago these men were fighting us, but now they are
                        chiefly anxious to dispose of shell necklaces at whatever price they can get
                        for them. </p>
                    <p> They go on, and a blind boy throats his sightless orbs between the bars, and
                        remarks insistently that you, the Englishman, whom he has smelt ont in some
                        myterious way, are both his father and his mother and most of his other
                        relatives His much troubling is satisfied with baksheesh, and he departs,
                        leaving us to watch a Nile boat gliding by, its oars splashing gently in the
                        water, for the wind has fallen with the sun, its long, sloping, pennon ended
                        spar looking like a line against the sky of primrose flushed with pink. The
                        frogs begin to croak their fire well to the day, or their welcome to the
                        dark Then of a sudden the whole firmament seems to flare up, to be filled
                        with overflowing light —a last reflation, perhaps, from the desert sands as
                        the son sinks beyond them, that vanishes almost as quickly as it appeared :
                        yes, grows grey and seems to die like a living thing, while high in the vast
                        arch above springs forth a glittering star. It is night.</p>

                        <p>Yesturday's weather, which left nothing to be desired in the daytime, was
                            remarkable for a suden change at 9 0'clock, when the wind veered from E.
                            to W. and the air became highly charged with electricity. Vivic flashes
                            of lightning and heavy rools of thunder followed, and the gathering
                            clouds soon furnished rain, the rain- fall amounting to 0.05 in. At
                            midnight, however, the weather settled again, and the morning opens with
                            a cool atmosphere, and light easterly breeze blowing. The glass show a
                            tendency to fall.</p>

                    <p>( From our Correspondent. )</p>
                    <p>London, May 21. All ranks of the Inniskilling Dragoons will be pleased to
                        learn that Major G. K. Ansell, who met with a very serious accident whilst
                        polo playing at the Curragh, a few days before the regiment left Ireland for
                        Cairo, has been pronounced out of danger, and is now on the highway to
                        recovery.</p>
                    <p>The details of the Inniskilling Dragoons, left at Ballincolloig when the
                        regiment wont to Egypt, have been formed into a depot squa- dron until the
                        Queen’s Bays return home from South Africa. The depot' squadron is to be
                        kept at the strength of a reserve squadron.</p>
                    <p>In recognition of their services in the opera- tions of last year in. the
                        Bahr-el-Ghazal Pro- vince, Captain A. Sutherland, Argyll and Sutherland
                        Highlanders, and Captain S. K. Flint, Royal Fusiliers, have been promoted
                        brevets majors/Mad Major W. Boulnois, Royal Artillery, survived, he would
                        have been recom- mended to the King for suitable recognition. It may be
                        recalled that whilst Governor of Bahr-el-Ghazal Province, he successfully
                        car- ried out operations against the Niam-Niams and other cannibal tribes in
                        the Upper Nile regions, and died shortly afterwards. He has had a worthy
                        successor in Captain and Brevet Major Sutherland, who rendered very valuable
                        service in the pacification of the province. It was not bis first service in
                        the field, as he served with the gallant "Jocks” in the Tochi Expedition,
                        1897 98 (medal with clasp). Captain and Brevet Major Flint is an officer who
                        his fought bis way np from the ranks, and has five campaigns in the Sudan to
                        his credit.</p>
                    <p>On the 23rd prox. Brevet Colonel F. Amber, Lancashire Fusiliers, will vacate
                        the command of the 2nd Battalion at Fermoy. on the com- pletion of four
                        years at its head. Colonel Amber has been connected with the Fusiliers since
                        January, 1880, when he joined the old 20th East Devons—as they were then
                        desig- nated—became captain in 1889, major in 1898, and lieutenant colonel
                        commanding the 2nd Battalion Jane, 1904. He was with the Fusiliers in
                        Kitchener’s army np the Nile in 1898 and was present at the smashing of the
                        Mahdi at Omdurman (medal and Khedive’s medal with clasp), and in the South
                        African War he saw a lot of rough work both on the staff and regimentally,
                        shared in the opera- tions in the Transvaal and Orange River Colony,
                        commanded the 2nd Battalion for some time in the dosing phases of the cam-
                        paign (twice mentioned in despatches, Queen’s medal with three clasps,
                        King’s medal with two clasps). In the ordinary coarse the com- mand should
                        go to Major C. M. Brunker, D.S.O., second in command of the battalion.</p>
                    <p>Lieutenant J. R. Gordon, of the Worcesters, latterly serving with the West
                        African Regi- ment in Sierra Leone, bain resigned his com- mission. He
                        served a little over six years in the "Firms,” and had a turn with them in
                        the South African War, for which he holds the Queen’s medal with five
                        clasps.</p>
                    <p>Amongst a batch of subalterns of the Royal Army Medical Corps, just promoted
                        captains, I note the names of Lieutenants R.L.V. Foster and C. V. B.
                        Stanley, attached to the Egyptian Army. They get their step after three and
                        a half year«’ service in the R.A.M.C. Captain Stanley was iix eighteen
                        months a civil sur- geon in the Sooth African campaign (Queen’s medal with
                        three clasps).</p>
                    <p>The decision of the War Office to dose the Mounted Infantry Schools of
                        Instruction at Bulford Camp and Kaworth Camp has caused very much surprise
                        in Service circles. If this decision has been come to on the grounds of
                        economy, the savings will be very small, a mere nothing compared to the
                        utility of the Plain School, and the Irish one. The impor- tance of having a
                        good strength of mounted infantry in preparedness was folly demonstrat- ed
                        in the South African War. Had our army been well supplied with that arm at
                        an early date, the campaign would not have lasted so long. Long before that,
                        the great importance attributed to mounted infantry was fully justified by
                        our experience in the earlier Sudan wars, when even the marines were drawn
                        upon for mounted infantry. The success of the advance from Suskin to Berber
                        proved the value of the mounted infantry, and in every succeeding campaign
                        it largely supplemented the regular cavalry. In the South African War no
                        fewer than 30 regi- ments of mounted infantry were employed in the field,
                        irrespective of colonial and irregular corps. These two schools will be
                        closed at the end of July, and from that date the mounted infantry soldier
                        will be turned out at Aldershot only.</p>
                    <p>That another great quantity of war stores is about to be destroyed at
                        Woolwich occasions nowadays no surprise, much as it may disgust the
                        taxpayer. Waste and official management seem inseparable. It is not news the
                        waste wis not first discovered during the Boer war. A quarter of a century
                        ago visitors to Cyprus found thousands upon thousands of pounds’ worth of
                        Government stores lying rotting in the son and perishing in the rain. There
                        the goods had lain ever since they had been de- posited for the use of the
                        Channel Squadron <cb n="6"/> two years before. No one - military authority,
                        naval, or civil—had had the thought to throw a roof or so much as a
                        tarpaulin over the stores, and rain and san had done their work
                        completely.</p>
                    <p>The battleship Queen has left England to rejoin the flag of Lord Charles
                        Beresford in the Mediterranean.</p>
                    <p>The Tabah incident closed in nice time to allow of preparations for the
                        coming naval manœauvres. The Mediterranean Fleet has a grievance, as it
                        would have been very glad to have had an opportunity of showing that the
                        manœuvres carried oat so successfully in peace time could be equally as well
                        carried ont when playing the real game. The preparedness of our navy for any
                        contingency, however, was amply demonstrated in the Mediterranean.</p>

                    <p>This is a condition (or disease) to which doctors give many names, but which
                        few of them really understand. It it simply weakness—a break-down, as it
                        were, of the vital forces that sustain the system. No matter what may be its
                        causes (for they are almost numberless), its symptoms are much the same; the
                        more prominent being sleeplessness, sense of prostration or weariness,
                        depression of spirits and want of energy for all the ordinary affairs of
                        life. Now, what alone is absolutely essential in all such cases is increased
