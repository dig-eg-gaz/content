                    <head>DISESTABLISHMENT IN FRANCE</head>
                    <p>Our telegrams during the last few days have contained accounts of various bitter conflicts in Paris and the provinces in regard to the disestablishment in France. No impartial ob server, we believe, will deny that the Catholic are under considerable provocation. They are expected to stand by while the State officials catalogue and appraise all those contents of their church which are not only sacro-sanct by reason of the uses to which they are applied, hat are the pledges of the personal faith and love of generations of pious souls. To see these symbols of their fai h taken, so to say, into the custody of an unfriendly Government under the pretence of “protecting” them—from what ?— but in reality for the purpose of being able to confiscate them en bloc, with the churches which contain them, on the slightest pretext afford ed must needs be galling in the extreme. The officials appear to be trying to obey orders without any unnecessary provocation, and with that courtesy which habitually lubricates life in France And, after all, they are only performing a formal act, submission to which by the faithful is not forbidden by any spiritual authority. Submission— under protest—is the coarse ordered, we believe, by the Bishops, and the episcopal direction would seem to be the only possible for good Christians and good citizens
                        
                        These alarams and excursions are, however, only the preliminary to a much more serious business. What is to be the attitude of the Church of France towards the Act of Separation as a whole ? With Rome, of course, the answer to that question rests, and since Rome has not yet spoken, the Catholics do not admit that causa finita est, and they are divided as to the course which principle and expediency alike should dictate. The great majority, we believe, including most of the Episcopate, would apply to the law as a whole the same principle of  submission under protest which seems the plain duty in the particular case of the inventories. That principle is, clearly, based upon the duty of the Christian and the citizen. The law prescribes the formation of “Association Cultuelles” which shall take over the whole duty of the administration of the churches and ecclesiastical property. Wherever these are forme before the 1st of January next, the work of the Church will go on as if nothing had happened. Where these are not formal, the churches and their contents will pass into the hands of the local authorities and public worship will cease. In view of that alterca-tive the plain duty of the Catholics seems to be to emure the continuance of public) worship and the administration of the Sacraments, in accordance with a civil law which, whatever its demerits may be, has a claim to obedience. But some hold that when the nation sees the churches closed the majority will arise and wreak vengeance upon the Government responsible for their closure, and that, in the meantime, persecution will be an excellent tonic for French Catholicism. We doubt that very strongly. We believe that the French peasant —who has no lack of shrewdness — wou'd throw the blame of the closure upon its immediate and visible authors, the Catholics themselves, and that the hands of the enemies of all religion would be enormously strengthened. And as to persecution, well, persecution is a tonic which, to be efficacious, must be endured at the hands of the enemy, not self-imposed as a tactical expedient for political, quite as much as for spiritual, purposes. To repeat what we have said before,the Catholics will oertainly be undertaking a grave responsibility if they deliberately deprive a single French man of the existing facilities for the practice of his religion, ard they will, in all probability, be playing straight into the hands of the enemy, who desires nothing better than to see every church in France closed. Principle and prudence, there-fore,alike seem to dic'ae the acceptance of the law, which, with all its defects, is not necessarily fatal, or even in principle inimical,
                        
                        the continued existence of the Church
                        
                        France. The Act of Separation, undoubtedly concedes a certain measure of liberty to rthe Church bat it deprives of her State-supplied income. The Church, therefore, will do well to use that liberty, and to use it with prudence, knowing, as she does that it is granted upon conditions. If we are not mistaken, the party of resistance is animated by a z''al whioh is by no means purely a z al for souls. the last word, of course, has yet to be spoken —from Rome. But, if Pius X. be a less skilful diplomatist than his great predecessor, there is no reason to believe that he is less anxious for the spiritual welfare of those Frenchmen who are still striving to prove that France —if a wayward child has not yet lost all right to her grand historic title of The Eldest Daughter of the Church.
