                    <head>DISESTABLISHMENT IN FRANCE</head>
                    <p>Our telegrams during the last few days have contained accounts of various
                        bitter conflicts in Paris and the provinces in regard to the
                        disestablishment in France. No impartial ob server, we believe, will deny
                        that the Catholic are under considerable provocation. They are expected to
                        stand by while the State officials catalogue and appraise all those contents
                        of their church which are not only sacro-sanct by reason of the uses to
                        which they are applied, hat are the pledges of the personal faith and love
                        of generations of pious souls. To see these symbols of their fai h taken, so
                        to say, into the custody of an unfriendly Government under the pretence of
                        "protecting" them—from what ?— but in reality for the purpose of being able
                        to confiscate them en bloc, with the churches which contain them, on the
                        slightest pretext afford ed must needs be galling in the extreme. The
                        officials appear to be trying to obey orders without any unnecessary
                        provocation, and with that courtesy which habitually lubricates life in
                        France And, after all, they are only performing a formal act, submission to
                        which by the faithful is not forbidden by any spiritual authority.
                        Submission— under protest—is the coarse ordered, we believe, by the Bishops,
                        and the episcopal direction would seem to be the only possible for good
                        Christians and good citizens These alarams and excursions are, however, only
                        the preliminary to a much more serious business. What is to be the attitude
                        of the Church of France towards the Act of Separation as a whole ? With
                        Rome, of course, the answer to that question rests, and since Rome has not
                        yet spoken, the Catholics do not admit that causa finita est, and they are
                        divided as to the course which principle and expediency alike should
                        dictate. The great majority, we believe, including most of the Episcopate,
                        would apply to the law as a whole the same principle of submission under
                        protest which seems the plain duty in the particular case of the
                        inventories. That principle is, clearly, based upon the duty of the
                        Christian and the citizen. The law prescribes the formation of "Association
                        Cultuelles" which shall take over the whole duty of the administration of
                        the churches and ecclesiastical property. Wherever these are forme before
                        the 1st of January next, the work of the Church will go on as if nothing had
                        happened. Where these are not formal, the churches and their contents will
                        pass into the hands of the local authorities and public worship will cease.
                        In view of that alterca-tive the plain duty of the Catholics seems to be to
                        emure the continuance of public) worship and the administration of the
                        Sacraments, in accordance with a civil law which, whatever its demerits may
                        be, has a claim to obedience. But some hold that when the nation sees the
                        churches closed the majority will arise and wreak vengeance upon the
                        Government responsible for their closure, and that, in the meantime,
                        persecution will be an excellent tonic for French Catholicism. We doubt that
                        very strongly. We believe that the French peasant —who has no lack of
                        shrewdness — wou'd throw the blame of the closure upon its immediate and
                        visible authors, the Catholics themselves, and that the hands of the enemies
                        of all religion would be enormously strengthened. And as to persecution,
                        well, persecution is a tonic which, to be efficacious, must be endured at
                        the hands of the enemy, not self-imposed as a tactical expedient for
                        political, quite as much as for spiritual, purposes. To repeat what we have
                        said before,the Catholics will certainly be undertaking a grave
                        responsibility if they deliberately deprive a single French man of the
                        existing facilities for the practice of his religion, ard they will, in all
                        probability, be playing straight into the hands of the enemy, who desires
                        nothing better than to see every church in France closed. Principle and
                        prudence, there-fore,alike seem to dic'ae the acceptance of the law, which,
                        with all its defects, is not necessarily fatal, or even in principle
                        inimical, the continued existence of the Church France. The Act of
                        Separation, undoubtedly concedes a certain measure of liberty to rthe Church
                        bat it deprives of her State-supplied income. The Church, therefore, will do
                        well to use that liberty, and to use it with prudence, knowing, as she does
                        that it is granted upon conditions. If we are not mistaken, the party of
                        resistance is animated by a z''al which is by no means purely a z al for
                        souls. the last word, of course, has yet to be spoken —from Rome. But, if
                        Pius X. be a less skilful diplomatist than his great predecessor, there is
                        no reason to believe that he is less anxious for the spiritual welfare of
                        those Frenchmen who are still striving to prove that France —if a wayward
                        child has not yet lost all right to her grand historic title of The Eldest
                        Daughter of the Church. </p>

                        Marie, expressed his desire, as a Frenchman, to perform bis military

                        have reigned in France tr settle in that Country, and he was, therefore,
                        arrested. His imprisonment was merely nominal and after a few months he was
                        liberated by President Carnot and conducted to the Swiss Frontier, and on

                        and in view of the portion 1 f the Reverend author and the oh tract rof the
                        magazine, we repoblished it. Bat it appears that the Rev. Howard Agnew
                        John-on, who throughout the artiole is lond in hia pianes of the
                        Presbyterian American Missionaries in Egypt, is not to be trashed when he
                        comes to speak on Anglican divines, and the "odium theologioum" leads him to
                        inaoouracy. Io the artiole in question, he Animadverted in strong terms on
                        the manner in which the ' oanse of Christ" was hnrt by the example of the
                        "Episcopal Chaplain" at Luxor. The ground for the displeasure of tbit
                        American Presbyterian is that the Episcopalian Chaplain after "having read
                        the servioe Sabbath mornirgs, he is the organizer of the afternoon
                        excursions on that day," etc., etc. Organiz'Dg excursions on the Sabbath may
                        oause indignation in the minds of some religions people. An instance is
                        given by Mr. W. S. Gilbert, who in one of his ballads deals wifh the oase of
                        three yooths who:— </p>
                    <p>Every Sabbath day they walked. </p>
                    <p>(Suoh was their gay thoughtless natur). </p>
                    <p>In parka or gardens, where they talked From three, to six, or even later. </p>
                    <p>This reprehensible conduct came within the cognizance of a clergyman of the
                        name of Mackli- who </p>
                    <p>"Could in every action ahow </p>
                    <p>"Some ain, and nobody could doubt him." and cc n^eqnently </p>
                    <p>He wept to think each thoughtless youth Contained of wickednesa a akinfull
                        And burnt to teach the awful truth That walking out on Sunday'a sinful. </p>
                    <p>Apparently the Rev. Howard A grew Johnson, D.D., is of the same opinion and
                        consequently his conscience was stirred to its depthi when be heard that an
                        Episcopalian cleric Organised exoarsiooa at Luxor on 8unday afternoon and in
                        the week endeavoured to get up entertainments and other forms of amase-
                        ment. This condaot moved him to ask "Is it strange that many Mahometans are
                        very slow to believe that Christians are truly religions 1 ' </p>
                    <p>Even if it had been true no sensible person would have objected to this
                        condaot on the part of the Chaplain at Luxor. </p>
                    <p>But it appears that the assertions of this Presbyterian divine are qaite
                        false for yesterday evening we received the following telegram from Luxor :
                        — </p>
                    <p>To THE EDITOR OP THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE. </p>
                    <p>Sir,—Referring to the extracts given in your paper from the * f^erald and
                        Presbyter" and attributed to the Rev Howard A (new Johnson, DD., undet the
                        title 'Redemptive Forces in Egypt," I wish to say, as a resident for the
                        past three winter seasous at Luxor, that the remarks concerning the
                        Episcopal clergyman amount to a t currilous libel on a respected and earnest
                        Christian'gentleman and haye given mnoh pain to his nomerqaq friends here.
                        Not on'y does he not organise Sanday excursions bat he has always
                        steadfastly set his face against Sanday amasements in any form. He has never
                        taken any part in the hotel dances. I mnoh hope that his brother olergy in
                        this oonntry will indignantly protest against such an unwarrantable attack
                        on one of their namber.—Yours, ek» </p>

                    <head>BANQUET AT SHEPHEARD'S</head>
                    <p>A private and exclusive dinner tendered by Mr. Da> iel O'Day and his daughter
                        Miss Rath O'Day of New York, in honor of the Rev. Father Grepgory, O.S.F.,
                        of 8t. Joseph's Cbnroh in Cairo, to which were invited several prominent
                        Americans, to meet the Reverend Father, was served at Shepheard's on last
                        Thnrsday evening. Mr. O'Day, the host, in addressing the dinner party, spoke
                        eloqnently of Father Grepgory and the good work to which the Father and his
                        brother Franciscans are devoting their energies end their lives. He
                        expressed the hope that all visitor* to Egypt would recognize the need of
                        fond* to aid the oanse of Christianity and subscribe substantially and
                        speedily to the assistance of Father Greggory'g mission, saying "who gives
                        qniokly gives doable." The host subsequently in a few happy remarks
                        presented his old friend and follow voyager Dr. Bedloe of Washington, D.C ,
                        the Washington Correspondent of the Oil City Derrick, and requested him to
                        respond to the toast of the occasion, "The Cbnroh." </p>
                    <p>Dr. Bedloe although hailing from America's Capital City is well k°own the
                        world over, having represented the U.8. Government on three continents under
                        Presidents Hayes',(Harrison, and MoKinlej. </p>
                    <p>In response to the call of Mr. O'Day and to the edification and delight of
                        all present Dr. Bedloe said : </p>
                    <p>" I never drink snch a toast without recalling the vast debt ot gr*t>tade we
                        owe to the ohnroh of the middle ages. </p>
                    <p>In the long gone years the ftyhari*«s and good fellows of Greece and Rom*
                        quenched their tlrir*t. with rioh red wine. </p>
                    <p>To them John Barleycorn was a pe^f-ct stranger ; oognac and otard were
                        sealed book*; and the thousand and one liquors of to-day were unborn.
                        Champagne, the idealization of all vinons beverages, had not come into
                        existence, while, as for panche* cocktails, fizzes, smashes, erg-nog, Tom
                        and Jenry, shot Scotch and Irish, Ryeand Taos Moroney highballs of Boldt's

                        despite the genins of Homer and Plato, Virgil and Cioero **re overly unable
                        to express or describe. Imagine it yon oan a dinner of to-day (by O'Day) in
                        which the sole alleviates of thirst were wire and honey, w«ne and water,
                        wine and more wa*er! When the inspired writer said 'look not opon the wine
                        whm it is red,' perhaps he was looking forward 2,000 year's to our own time
                        when there are other and better beverages. Yet such was the condition which
                        ponfronted Laonllns, Apioins and other great bon vivants of antiquity. </p>
                    <p>! A small boy could give a better dinner today, so far as the wi e card is
                        oo* earned, than could all the Cm-ars c*f the West and the Kings and
                        Emperors of the East. </p>

                        ns the wealth nf enjoyment we have to-day ? It was the Church, the noble
                        abbots and hnmble monks who applied intellect to the world aronnd them and
                        brought forth results which qgiil never die. </p>
                    <p>They took the culture of the vine firom pagan Rom? and they converted it
                        into a new art and soienoe, </p>

                        named "Leibfraaenmiloh," or milk of the Virgin; the tawny pressings of the
                        Anda- lqrian oln8t*rg became known in lore as '^nnota Trinidad," or Holy

                    <p>The rumour that Anglo-Egyptian troops have occupied Akabah is untrne, as only
                        an in significant frontier dispute has ocoarred with the Turkish troops. The

                        question of ooonpation by E/ypt, bat of the ooonpation by the Tarka of a
                        point named Tabah, on the 8inai Peninsula, about eight miles west of Akabah,
                        and unquestionably Egyptian territory. The Porte, on being interrogated
                        regarding the matter, stated that it was unacquainted with the feet, bat
                        promised to withdraw its troops. rrhe performance of this promise is now
                        being awaited. The Turks allege that Egypt is distributing a force of
                        geodarmerie along the frontier. This, however, if true, does not ooneern
                        Turkey, einoe it is a question of movements on Egyptian territory. </p>

                        G,"whieh was den on peed hy the Vioe-President of the Alexandria
                        Municipality in our oolamns yesterday, was written by Mr. Geo. B. Alderson,
                        who only resigned his position ss Municipal Councillor a few months ago.
                        This theory as to the authorship of the letter was baaed on the fact that
                        the initials of the writer of the letter were a reversal of the initials ot
                        Mr. Alder- son's Christian and Surname. We are very pleased therefore to
                        publish the following disclaimer from Mr. Alderson :— </p>

                    <p>The inhabitants of the Fayonm hope that the Adviser's visit will have some
                        appreciable effect in lessening the number of crimes which threaten the
                        well-being of the fellaheen and farmers in the Fayonmv Although the progress

                        and the statistics for 1905 show that 195 crimes of a dangerous kind were
                        perpetrated daring the past twelve month. This condition of public safety is
                        by no means satisfactory. Many of the oases are due to professional
                        criminals who form hands for purposes of brigandage under a leader. They are
                        so organised as to be able to attack a whole esbet or a village, as happened
                        lately at Dissia and Isbet Z zon, where the brigands tied the hands of the
                        inhabitants and took everything they could carry off. The brigands laugh at
                        the Molahis of ghafirs who have done nothing yet to arrest the miscreant*.

                    <p>The South has nothing to fear in the way of a large increase of the Egyptian
                        cotton crop, according to Mr. Cope Whitehonse, the well known engineer and
                        scholar who is spending the winter in Washington looking after the
                        international features of his Lake Moeris irrigation project. Mr. Whitehonse
                        is thoroughly familiar with conditions in Egypt, and he does not hesitate to
                        say that the widely-heralded ABBOT an dam, instead of having the effeot of
                        doubling the Egyptian cotton crop, as its projectors predicted, has really
                        had no effeot save an unfavourable one. This year*8 crop, he say*, will
                        probably be a trifle smaller than that of the year before tbs dam was
                        commenced. </p>
                    <p>"In 1894," said Mr. Whitehonse to-day, "American cotton growers were told
                        that there was an immense area cf adandoned land, admirably adapted to
                        cotton cultivation, lying between the cultivated section of the Delta and
                        the Mediterranean. In 1887, the late John Cardwell of Houston, then Consul
                        General at Cairo, made an elaborate report on the oondi tion and prospeots
                        of the country as a whole. He described the attempts made to show that Egypt
                        could sapply itself and probably do a considerable export trade by
                        exploiting an extended field oharged with petroleum, at a point on the Red
                        Sea which has borne the name 'Petroleum desert' since the Greeks coined this
                        now familiar eqnivalent for rock oil. He WAS skeptical of any possible
                        competition with the United States, however, and it snbs2qdeatly became
                        apparent that the large sums expended on the borings in the field were
                        merely part of a financial scheme to benefit the speculative holders of
                        Egyptian seonrities in London and Paris. </p>
                    <p>"In treating of cotton," Mr. Whitehonse continued, "Mr. Cardwell said that
                        little o' that staple was produced prior to the time when the trade of ports
                        in the ootton-growing States was oat off by the blockade daring the civil
                        war. Egyptians then began to bend their energies to supply, so far as lay in
                        their power, some of the resultant deficit. One dollar a pound was a great
                        incentive, and the cultivation of cotton in the Nile valley beoame general.
                        In 1886 87 the total cultivated area of Egypt was estimated by him at 4,498
                        520 acres, with 824 114 acres of cotton in lower Egypt and less th\n 50,000
                        acres to the south of Cairo. Only 21 4 per cent of the population was
                        engaged in cetton culture. The cotton orop was tlieu a so t of by-prodact of
                        the general agricultural operations, being grown for export after abundant
                        provision had been made for a food supply of rioe, Indian com, barley,
                        beaus, wheat to the value of £13,000,000, etc. Sugar cane laud in upper
                        Egypt was worth £50 au aore. </p>
                    <p>"The Egyptian ootton was used in the United States in the manufacture of
                        cotton velvets or plashes principally. It could Dever compete with Amerion
                        sea island ootton at 30 or 35 cents for fine thread*, nor with the average
                        quality of Southern growth, on account of the price The quality was also
                        obviously limited to the ne:ghbourhood of a million Hores,so long as there
                        was no Government inter ferecce with the food supply. Bat when the British
                        took possession of the ministry of public works and of finance in 1883-4 ths
                        cotton crop became the end and aim of all their administrative energies.
                        They forced the farmers to abandon rice so that the water might be used for
                        cotton, and by praotioaliy abolishing the importation of fresh seed and the
                        substitution of a native seed known as mit afifi, the quantity was increased
                        and the quality lowered to a point at which it could be used in the English
                        milb». At a later period a reduction was made in the area allotted to sugar
                        cane. Egyptian sugar, in beaatiful yellow crystals, was sent to Franoe to be
                        used with beet sugars, being conveyed in French steamers, while the cotton
                        went in British vessels to English and Scotch mills." </p>
                    <p>It was in 1887 that Mr. Cardwel^l took cognizance of Mr. Whitehonse's work,
                        in his report he said that "the onrions historical and scientific researches
                        of a citizen of the United States had unfolded a huge plan of irrigation,
                        known to the anoients and the present Egyptian government, after at first
                        turning a deaf ear to his propositions, seems at this time disposed to proof
                        by this philosophy." But he added a warning that benefits would not be
                        realized "nnless foreign power again re established decay .''Under the head
                        "A Grand Scheme" he then described Mr. Whitehonse's Lake Moeris project. In
                        the early pa^t of 1882, Mr. Whithoose visited Egypt and went into the
                        desert, where he found a valley corresponding in shape, depth and position
                        to that which he had found depicted on a map copied nearly 500 years before
                        from a more ancient map drawn more than 100 years before that time. It was
                        by the use of this valley, with a canal about eight miles in length leading
                        off from the flooded area of the Nile about 70 miles upstream from Cairo,
                        that it was expected to double the available supply of water -during the
                        period known as low Nile. Athongh the great African river looms long and
                        huge on the map, for more than three months every year it ceases to dis-
                        ohargeany wateriato the Mediterranean. Hence, before there could be any
                        increase in ootton cultivation it was necessary to store flood water, and
                        the amonnt proposed to be stored by Mr. Whitehonse was 3 000,000,000 cubic
                        yard . Tlrs ciuld have bseu obareed from the Ra'yan valley, with a depth of
                        220 feet and a snrface area cf 250 square miles, by allowing the Nile to
                        raise the level of the proposed lake to that of the inondation in the
                        adjacent valley, and then closing the alnice gates, to be opened in March.
                        As the Nile ri*:e3 abont 20 feet, it was, and is, Mr. White- house's opinion
                        that this difference wonld have been more than euffioent. </p>
                    <p>"I take m .ch interest in this question," wrote Mr. Cardwell in his report.
                        "I desire to see the scholarly efforts and the persistent researches of one
                        of my countrymen suooeed; to see American mind do rood as a counterbalance
                        to harm done by European armies." </p>
                    <p>Bat years have elapsed and the swamps and sind-strewn regions of the Delta
                        remain as they were when tha Texas man wa9 oonsul general at Cairo, and f)r
                        1700 years before that, although the soorpion infested and hyena haunted
                        depths of tin "region of Gehenna" have been traversed, measured and explored
                        by a score of experts employed by the Egyptian Government, or representing
                        scientific societies of Europe and the United States. </p>
                    <p>"While the successful oarrying oat cf the project would obviously have a
                        wonderfully stimulating effeot on ootton growing in Egypt," said Mr.
                        Whitehonse in discussing this phase of the case," the ootton growers of the
                        Sonth need not fear that a single acre will be added to Egypt's ootton area
                        through my efforts for at least five years. In 1891 and again in 1894, it
                        seemed certain that tin werk would be undertaken at once. In 1898 a contract
                        was made for a reservoir dam at the first oataract; and even so
                        well-informed a representative of the United State* as Hon F. C. Pen field,
                        appoint ed by President Cleveland ventured the prediction that 1,600,030
                        aens would be added before 1908, wi*h an incase in the agricultural output
                        of at least 20 per cent. </p>
                    <p>"But these expectations have proved to be baseless. The dam itself is a wall
                        a mile and a quarter in length. The English engineers who designed it as a
                        private specnlation for an English company declared that it woold offer no
                        obstruction to the high Nile, but that the flood would pass as freely
                        through the sluiceways as a river through the piers of a bridge. Oa August
                        8, last, when the reservoir should have been empty, the Nile had headed np
                        over 30 feet, and wa9 tearing through 140 passages, abont 40 to 60 feet io
                        length, and 7 to *1 in widih, at a rate of more than 50 miles an hour. Deep
                        orevices had developed on the down side, and it was necessary to oons'ruot
                        buttresses in great haste. It will take at least two yean to complete these
                        and o^her repairs. </p>
                    <p>"The cot'oa crop has been increased by the transfer of sugar cane land to
                        cotton oultiva tiou," con tin nod Mr. Whitahons**, "hnfc tho official
                        reports show that the orops before 1898 when the contract for the dam was
                        signed have actually exceeded those raised since its completion. There livs
                        been a loud outcry to the effect; that a group of English speculators, of
                        whom Sir Ernest Cassel was the principal, quietly aeqaired over million
                        acres, at prioes ranging from the Government registrati6n fee of 10 cents
                        per acre, up to $10 a id $20, and then agreed to build the dam ia order to
                        raise prioes and enable them to onload the land on the French and English
                        pub'ic daring the foar years the construction work wv3 in progress. Even
                        Lord Cromer appears to hwa become alarmed at the impanding crash. The price
                        of the lands was forced up to nearly $ '00 an aore. And when the speculators
                        hare unloaded,the ground could not be remunerative t > the cultivator at any
                        sach price. It ii freely alleged that the famous understaudiug between
                        England and France was negotiated by King Edward at the request of Sir E
                        neit Cassel to prevent an investigation of the nse of British influence aM
                        the misappropriation of over $20,000,000 of tin revenues, which had bee lent
                        to th3 English group to oarry on their speculative enterprises. The Duke of
                        Con nanght was utilized to lay the oorn8r stone in 1833, and to inaugurate
                        the dam on its completion in Ojtober. 1902. The change of Cabinet in England
                        will lead to an investiga tion which will result in the restoration of many
                        millions to the Egyptian treasury </p>
                    <p>"But to return to the ootton question," said Mr. Whitehonse in conclusion,
                        "the Amerioan growers have nothing to fear. The Egyptian crop of this year
                        is estimated to be no larger than that of 1897-8, or aboat 1,200,000 bales." </p>
                    <p>A resolution calling on the State department fir all papers relating to Mr.
                        Whitehonse's operations in Egypt has been introduced by Senator Lodge and a
                        lop tel, and the data is now io coarse of preparation at the department (

                    <head>LETTER TO THE EDITOR</head>
                    <p>Sir,—Apropos of the recent very interesting article in the "Gazette" on
                        Egypt's egg industry, I may mention that I happen to know a big wholesale
                        egg merchant in London with whom I have frequently conversed on this
                        subject. His remarks may be thus summarised :— </p>
                    <p>"Egyptian eggs are inferior to all others. We only buy them when we can get
                        no others. They are, as you know, exceedingly small and nothing is done to
                        improve their size. Imports from other eastern countries have increased out
                        of all proportion to those from Egypt because the natives have learned how
                        to improve the size of the eggs. Egypt makes no progress in this respect.
                        Worst of all, the "Mammies" are so carelessly packed that cases frequently
                        come to us with three-fourths of them smashed " </p>
                    <p>From the foregoing remarks you will readily understand how it happens—to
                        quote from your article—that "Eggs arrive in England at a time when the home
                        production is exceedingly small." </p>
                    <p>There is here, however, a slight understatement of the actual facts. Egyptian
                        eggs arrive in England at a time when both home production and importation
                        from foreign countries are exceedingly small, because it is only at that
                        period of the year that "Mammies" can find an English market. At all other
                        times they are quite unsaleable. Surely, if my informant's strictures are
                        warranted, something might be done to remedy the state of things vouched by
                        him. Could not the Khedivial Agricultural Society take the matter up with
                        advantage 1— Truly yours, OVUM. </p>

                    <head>THE BLUE NILE</head>
                    <p>Dr. Hayes, medical officer at the Suez Quarantine Office, has written a very
                        interesting account ofbri travels through the Sudan to Lake Tsana in Western
                        Abyssinia and back to Egypt ly the Valley of the Atbarc. The author while
                        acting as medical inspector of the native ,,natter of Alexandria duriug
                        1902, the last cholera year, was chosen as the medical member of the
                        expedition which was sent at the end of that year by the Egyptian Government
                        to Lake Tsana. The other Englishmen of the expedition were Mr. Dupuis and
                        Mr. Crawley. The main objeot of the expedition was of a very interesting
                        nature. Aa the exploration of the Sudan proceeds, it becomes increasingly
                        clear that it will itself use op all the extra water that the engineer iaTe
                        likely to find for a long time to come. The cutting of the tndd on the White
                        Nile has not resulted so far in any increase of the volome of the lower
                        river, but in the reclamation of a good deal of land above Khartoum ; and
                        the fi at effect of engineering works on the Bine Nile and Atbara and the
                        tributaries of both will be the fertilization of the vast tracts of black
                        "cotton-soil" which stretch from Berber to Kassala, Gedaref, and Gallabat
                        These works are still in the future ; but preparations foi them ceaselessly
                        occupy the minds of the So dan administrators,prompted and encouraged by
                        Lord Cromer, whose paramount preoccupation it has been from first to lest to
                        multiply the waters cf the Nile Basin. About three years ago a notable step
                        was taken. After negotiations vith the Abyssinian Emperor, the expedition
                        fod by two engineers and accompanied by Dr. Hayes despatched to Lake Tsar a,
                        which receives and discharges the waters of the Abai River, known to os in
                        its lower oourse as the Blue Nile. The train object of the ergineers,
                        Messrs. Dupuis and Crawley, was to measurei the is founded. Dr. Hayes's
                        theory is that it is all owing to the exertions of the white antp. This
                        remarkable theory is based on consideration! which he states as follows :— </p>
                    <p>I formed the opinion that the white ants have rendered valuable service to
                        Egypt bj j that aha ever washes herself in her life, the amassing the

                        everything points to the popularity of that country being as great as ever
                        we have the pleasure to give our visitors the following information which in

                    <p>It may be said that there are two methods by which one may travel in
                        Palestine, (1) by rail, carriage, and hotel, (2) by horseback, and camp. </p>
                    <p>By tho first means a considerable portion of the most interesting part of
                        the country may be seen with no more fatigue than travelling in any other
                        oonntry, thug, one may reach Jerusalem in 30 hours from Cairo, going by rail
                        to Port Said, leaving there in the evening by steamer, arriving Jaffa early
                        next morning,and Jaffa to Jerusalem by rail iu 4 hours. </p>
                    <p>In Jerusalem very fair hotel accommodation is available. Most of the
                        excursions to points ot interest around the city may be visited by carriage,
                        including Hebron, the Pools of Solomon, Jericho, Bethlehem, the JordaD, and
                        the Dead Sea. For this trip from Jaffa back to Jaffa, covering eight days,
                        and including all the above excursions, services of a dragomau, hotel
                        accommodation, aqd other ncoessary expenses for sightseeiBg etc, Thos. Cook
                        and Son charge from £11.5.0 upwards, aooordingto the number of passengers. </p>
                    <p>From Haifa, where steamers frrquently touch, au excursion is ear ily made to
                        Nsaireth, Tiberias, and the lake of Galilee, and baok. There are very fair
                        hotels at Haifa, Nazsreth and Tiberias, and carriage road throughout. For

                        passengers. </p>
                    <p>From Bayrout the railway runs to Damascus and Baalbeo, and in all three
                        places there is very fair hotel aooommodatiou. For this trip ocoupying 7
                        days from Beyront back to Beyrout, the charge is from £ 10 upwards,

                        accomodation is to be foand, must make use of the second means of travel,
                        namely horseback, and camp, and it may safely be said that given favourable
                        weather, no more delightfal mode of travelling can be im»gin?d. The horses
                        are good and quiet, and the day's journey is never so long aa to be
                        fatigaing to anyone in fairly good health, and need not be feared even by
                        those e ntirely unaooustomed to riding. The oamp accommodation is RB com

                        served, and travellers need have no hesitation in undertaking the journey by

                        Sinaitio Desert, the country east of th9 Jordan, the Hanran, the Lebanon, or
                        even farther afield to the Euphrates Valley and Bagdad. Thos. Cook &amp; Son

                    <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                    <p>TheE0^Ptta.H(Ba3CttC has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes bv which
                        they may travel homewards. lireRt care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe. This
                        depends partly upon the month in whjch you leave Egypt, for Cairo in January
                        may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so warm as Sicily,
                        but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm than many
                        oth$r places in Europe They are as follows :— The long sea routes—from Port
                        Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southampton,London or Liverpool—occupy about
                        14 days. The short ones are as follows :— Port Said or Alexandria to
                        Brindisi 3 days Alexandria to Messina ... 3 „ Port Said or Alexandria to
                        Marseilles 5 „ Alexandria toVenice and Trieste... 4 „ Alexandria to Naples 3
                        „ Port Said to Genoa 5 „ Port Said to Naples 4 „ Alexandria to
                        Constantinople ... 4 , Alexandria to Pirteus 2 „ ( Port Said to Gibraltar 7
                        „ The steamers, of the P. &amp; 0. North German Lloyd, Orient and
                        Messageries Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby
                        Lines are also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by
                        travellers to Egypt. As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest
                        is that to Alexandria, without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now
                        be made without change in 4j hours. The least expensive way to England is by
                        the Moss, Papayanni; Prince, and Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria
                        to Liverpool. The German Levant line has also good steamers from Alexandria
                        to Hamburg. The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are
                        by P. &amp; 0. Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd
                        Trieste*Vienna express from Alexandria. As regards heavy luggage, it must be
                        borne in mind that very little luggage is allowed free on the railways of
                        Europe, but there are several good and responsible forwarding agents in
                        Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to deliver packages to any address in
                        Europe. The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is
                        undoubtedly by the fast Mail Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis" to Brindisi. One
                        of these leaves Port Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving
                        the Indian mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay. These small but
                        corafortab'e ships liave enormously powerful engines, and attain a very high
                        rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry boats,'* having been specially
                        built to caijy the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi. If you are going
                        straight through to England yo will find the train waiting at Brindisi which
                        will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete arrangements for
                        sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in London on the fifth
                        day from leaving Port Said </p>

                    <head>SICILY</head>
                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio- Rnbattino Co.'s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMINA, one
                        of the mo>t charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is »he
                        station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful,
                        occupying about one hour. In and around the town is much to interest the
                        visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but restored under the Romans.
                        CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of Etna and here also is a fine
                        Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all over
                        the island, are an endless sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting
                        history, having been a Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.c.
                        413, and taken by the Romans in B.c. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb
                        is to be seen. The cathedral was once an anoient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                        about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                        delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The
                        Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S.
                        Grivannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral,
                        Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also worth a
                        visit.</p>

                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        j during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days. NAPLES is also
                        reached in 10 hours from j Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steam-;
                        ere, which leave daily. One cannot approach j Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore ; some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                        hny—Castellamare and Sorrento. The | small steamer that takes you to
                        Sorrento [you J can drive tool will take you on to Capri. From Naples to
                        ROME is a train journey of | but five hours. All who can will devote at t
                        least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting portions of
                        the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known to need
                        comment here. Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey
                        of five hours brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent
                        admiring the City oj Flowers and its surrounding country. hi Florence itself
                        the chnrcheg and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local
                        promenades and excur- sions should not be omitted. The Caseine is j the most
                        attractive and fashionable promenade ! in Florence, whilst the Viale dei
                        ColH, one of the finest walks in Europe, opened 33 years ; ago, goes winding
                        up through the hills a ! distance of four miles. The most delightful
                        excursion outside Florence is that te Vallom- ■ brosa, with its Monastery
                        3,300 feet above the sea level. This is made first by ordinary train from
                        Florence to St. Ellero' thence by cogwheel railway to Saltino. The ascent
                        through groves of oaks takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are
                        unfolded to view. PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ;
                        here there is a fine Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one
                        night should if possible he made, in order to enjoy the view from the
                        Campanile at sunset. VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the
                        Italian Riviera near Pisa and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It \a a
                        very convenient half-way house between Egypt and England, and where living
                        is reasonable and the air and surroundings exceptionally good. </p>

                    <p>GENOA (La Superba). —The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                        the record of having one%of the lowest death averages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and deliciously oool
                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer. The
                        patriarchal home of Italy's most an- eient nobility, whose palaces, gardens,
                        and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a constant
                        delignt to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa. Then there
                        are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite marble
                        columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo filled
                        with its wonderful tombs. From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three
                        hours by rail. MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the
                        tour of the Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its
                        beautiful windows illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens
                        and the monumental cemetery are also worth a visit. Between Bologna and
                        Milan and only an hour and-a-half from Milan is SALSOMAG- GIORE, a renowned
                        health resort on account of its thermal springs, change trains at Borgo San
                        Donino and in half-an-hoor you are at Salsomaggiore. </p>

                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other seaport.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, men slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon. Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the
                        beautiful Italian lakes. COMO, the birthplace^ of the younger Pliny, is
                        reached in one-and-a-quarter hours by tram by way of Monza : Boats leave
                        Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very beautiful,
                        and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most enchanting.
                        CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo, Cadenabbiat and Menaggio
                        with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio opposite. The walk from
                        Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio is most enjoyable. A steam
                        tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza ou Lake Lugano in three-quarters of an
                        hour, then steamer to Lugano in two-and- three-quarter hours. </p>

                    <p>Switzerland, the heart of Europe, has been described as "A cluster of
                        delights and grandeurs." LUGANO is some 20 miles from Como and reached by
                        train in one-and-a-half hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is
                        charmingly situated on the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery.
                        Around it rise M. San Salvatore, M. de Caprinoand M. Generose. LOCARNO may

                        situated at the top of Lake Maggiore, has a mild olimate, and vs an
                        excellent winter resort. The church Madonnb-del Sasso, situated above the
                        town,is worth a visit, iCsTt^contains interest- Entombmenv by Ciseri, and

                        Lake of Lucerne facing the Rigi and Pilatus and the snow-clad Alps. In and
                        around the town the walks are charming, and the excursions to be made from
                        Lucerne by boat, rail, etc., are very numerous. The Like 0/Lucerne abounds
                        in delightful excursions, those to the Rigit Pilatue, Bur gen- stock and
                        Sonnsnberg needing a special visit each. Other excursions on the lake can be
                        made by steamer, and the ever-changing scenery on the trip from Lucerne to
                        Fluelen is a souroe of delight to the lover of nature. BRUNNEN, charmingly
                        situated on the most beautiful part of the Lake of Lucerne, commands
                        magnificent views of lake and mountain scenery. Along the Lake of Uri from
                        Brunnen to Fluelen runs the famous Axentrasse. A delightful excursion from
                        Lucerne is that to ENGELBERG. Take boat to Stansstad and from Stansstad it
                        is about 1 hour and 40 min. by Electric Railway, with delightful scenery en

                        the Alps is grand ; extending from Monte Bosa to the Black Forest, and from
                        the Santis to the Matterhorn. THE BERNESE OBERLAND.—INTERLAKEN a favourite
                        summer resortand the best centre for making excursions in the Oberland,
                        abounding in fine walks and views. There is a magnificent view of the

                    <p>Many people visit Greece after wintering in Egypt, as it is so easily reached
                        from Alexandria ; the climate in April is charming. The best steamers are
                        those of the Khedivial Mail Co. and the Russian Steam Navigation Co. If
                        possible tourists should arrange to be in Athens for the Orthodox Easter in

                        presen' at the dancing on the Easter Tuesday festival held at Megara
                        forlrhich a special train is run from Athens. Itf is worth while to spend a
