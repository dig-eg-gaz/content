                        after sacrificing his physical health and, latterly, his happiness, on the
                        altar of patriotic duty. In an age when self-seeking is not unknown even
                        among statesmen of high quality Lord Curzon has concentrated all his
                        endeavours on the consolidation and development of that wonder- ful
                        creation, the rule of a handful of his fellow- countrymen over a fifth or a
                        sixth of the world's inhabitants. That was the mission he undertook when he
                        first went to India, but long before, with the thoroughness which has marked
                        his public career throughout, he sedu- lously prepared for its
                        accomplishment by persistent study of whatever Asiatic problems touched the
                        ground plan of his coming cam- paign. When he gave up the brilliant posi-
                        tion he had won for himself at home some wondered at his decision; it seemed
                        to them that he was surrendering the substance of per- sonal greatness for
                        what might easily prove an evanescent shadow. But those friendly critics had
                        never plumbed the inner depths of Lord Corzon's idiosyncrasy. He had, of
                        course, great ambitions and far-reaching aspiration, of a more or less
                        personal charac- ter; no statesman worthy of the name is unequipped with
                        longings for permanent fame. But it stands to the lasting credit of the
                        retir- ed Viceroy that from the date of his arrival in India he unswervingly
                        devoted himself to the promotion of that country's most vital inte- rests,
                        political, military, and commercial. He was the builder; he left it to
                        poste- rity to prenounce on his skill in adapting to modern requirements the
                        almost miracu- lous ediface founded by those immortals, the two Wellesleys,
                        Clive, and Hastings. Lord Curzon will have no occasion to wait long for that
                        national judgment; indeed it has already delivered in the universal regret
                        what circumstances should have conspired to abbreviate his retention of the
                        Vicereyship. ____ it is a safe prediction that when he lands in England, he
                        will be quickly made to feel that no living British statesman holds higher
                        posi- tion in the national esteem that the great Pro- Consul who, as a last
                        sacrifice, gave up his career on what he regarded as a point of duty.</p>

                            <p>The situation at Sevastopol is very obscure, but it appears that the
                                mutiny is of a revolu- tionary character. It began by the rews of
                                the Panteleimon and Otchakoft hoisting the red flag on the 24th
                                November. They then landed and held a meeting at which a deputation
                                of a Brest regiment swore that the whole regiment would defend the
                                sailors to their utmost. Both soldiers and sailors afterwards
                                paraded the streets waving red flags.</p>
                            <p>Admiral Pisareviki was wounded while in the act of ordering the
                                troops to fire on the mutineers. Several officers were killed and
                                many arrested. The two vessels are still flying red flags, and the
                                fortress artillery have refus- ed to fire upon them.</p>

                            <p>The Panteleimon is now in the hands of the authorities, but the
                                mutinied crew and soldiers have shut themselves up in one of the
                                bar- racks. It is desired to attack them, but it is feared that the
                                artillery men may join them. A part of the Odessa garrison is
                                disposed to make common cause with the mutineers.</p>

                                whole army from Vladivostok to the Baltic. The Manchu- rian forces
                                are in a condition of almost open rebellion. The garrison of this
                                city has form- ulated demands involving the complete remo- delling
                                of the conditions of service. Business is at a standstill.</p>

                            <p>He added that he sympathised keenly with the efforts of the Tsar to
                                re-organise the internal affairs of Russia, and that he is gratified

                    <head>THE BEYRAM FESTIVAL. CELEBRATIONS IN CAIRO.</head>
                    <p>Full hotels, swarms of uniforms, and a clouding sky, with a bitter wind: so
                        the Beyram holiday opened in Cairo. It spite of the cold weather and threats
                        of rain the public had made up its mind to enjoy itself. The Mena trams were
                        full early, multitudes went out to Helouan, but the streets were by no means
                        crowded or eve unusually full, though it was holiday, perhaps in consequence
                        of late hours and feasting the night before. Near Abdern a good many people
                        had congregated to watch the arrivals fot the reception, which was, as
                        usual, very largely attended by the higher ranks of the military and civil
                        branches of the Government, by the officers of the Army of Occupation, and
                        those for whom official Egypt- or was it official France 1- has devised the
                        term of "notables."</p>
                    <p>A very strong official and lay contingent was furnished by Alexandria,
                        provincial no- tables were "up" and staying at all the best hotels, and the
                        rain very considerately held off till near the close of the reception, when
                        a few drops fell and thickened to a steady drizzle that lasted with
                        occasional intermissions well into the afternoon.</p>
                    <p>The Moslem Benevolent Society gave a fete in the Esbekieh Gardens, which were
                        decorated for the occasion and illuminated at nightfall. All sorts of music
                        was to be heard, conjurors kept a crowd, which contained a large pro-
                        portion of soldiers, amused and cheerful despite a low temperature and wet
                        grass. Acrobats and strong men performed before audiences that increased
                        gradually as the afternoon wore on, and at night came the fireworks and
                        coloured lights. The streets were thoroughly muddy, deep in that peculiarly
                        sticky mud that is so characteristic of Cairo, but no one seemed to care
                        particularly. The Egy[tian is easily pleased, and his calm acqui- escence in
                        all that is, makes him indifferent to a cold and wet Beyram.</p>

                    <p>We have the pleasure to announce to our readers, says "Al Moayad," that Lord
                        Cromer has intervened in regard to the disputs which recently occured
                        between Moslems and Christ- ians at the American Mission's School at Cairo,
                        on account of a sermon which touched Moslem sentiment. His lordship has seen
                        Dr. Watson, and required him to put an end to the policy of the preachers as
                        regards the Moslem religion. His lordship has a so ordered the Hakamdar of
                        the Cairo police to give the police strict orders as to the manner in which
                        they must act in similar circumstances.</p>
                    <p>The Mohamedans, continues our contempo- rary, will be pleased to learn of
                        Lord Cromer's great solicitude on their behalf, and the respect he pays to
                        national feelings. We hope, "Al Moayad" concludes, that Lord Cromer's policy
                        will have a good effect upon missionaries in Egypt and that they will learn
                        to be peaceful in future.</p>

                        night at Government House. No entrance fees were charged, and the place was
                        crowded, a very enjoyable evening being spent. The orchestra consists of 14
                        per- formers, all males, under Bandmaster Coke.</p>

                    <p>Our Tahta Correspondent writes that there is no sharaki land whatever in the
                        Tahta district this year. The lands have all been cultivated, and wherever
                        one goes luxuriant vegetation is to be seen, arguing well for the drops.

                    <head>SHEPHEARD'S SMALL DANCE. OPENING OF THE SEASON.</head>
                    <p>Quite a number of peopl took part in the small dance at Shepheard's on
                        Saturday night, and though there was a great preponderance of men present,
                        everybody seemed cheery and bent on amusement. Sir Elwin Palmer looked in
                        for a short time, and the Hon. Fred Morgan was very busy among his friends.
                        The Hon. C. James and Mrs. James were there, the latter in a pretty fresh
                        green silk frock draped with lace and velvet. The beautiful Mme Vernon was
                        surrounded, as usual, by her little court, though she did not take part in
                        the dancing; Brigadier-General Bullock, Mr. Webb, and Mr. Leigh Hunt (who is
                        at present staying at Shepheard's), were also onlookers, and among the
                        latest residents we noticed Mr. and Mrs. E.C.G. Porter, who brough a few
                        friends. Mrs. Porter, who has a beautiful, slight figure looked remarkably
                        well in black crepe de chene with a deep lace berthe. There were several
                        other pretty frocks in spite of it being quite an informal occasion and
                        still early in the season. One Empire gown was a filmy black chiffon
                        enriched by a heavy Greek design in black velvet, and hanging from a deep
                        yoke, etc., of cream lace. The velvet trimming outlined the yoke and
                        sleeves, and faint touches of coral pink gave a touch of colour to the lace.
                        A black sequined net had wide insertions and folded ceinture of delicate
                        Pompadeur silk; and a handsome fair woman was magnificent in
                        apricot-coloured "chiffon veleurs" draped with lace. A young girl was
                        wearing a soft grey spotted crepe-de-chene over an under robe of cream
                        chiffon, the crossed drapery of the decollatage being edged with tiny
                        quillings of cream; and there were one or two handsome cream satin gowns
                        draped with lace.</p>

                    <docAuthor>By Sir Hanburt Brown, K.C.M.G., late Insepctor-General of Irrigation
                        in Lower Egypt, and formerly in Upper Egypt.</docAuthor>
                    <head>IV.</head>
                    <p>To deal with the large bodies of water that have to be distributed over the
                        extensive areas of a basin chain, perfect control over the water at all
                        points is necessary. This is only to be obtained by a sufficiency of
                        regulating works, such as head sluices, to draw the water from the river
                        into the feeder canal; basin sluices to admit water from the canal into the
                        basins; regulators or escapes in the basin cross banks, to pass on the water
                        and regulate the level in the basins above them; and escapes to dis- charge
                        the water back into the river. The arrangements of a basin system should be
                        devised with a two-fold object, namely, to get the full benefit of a good
                        flood and to guard against the dificiencies of a low flood. In a good flood
                        as much water as possible should be passed through the basins, so as to
                        obtain a maximum deposit of the fertilising matter which is carried by flood
                        water. To effect this, the head sluice of the feeder canal should not be
                        closed when the basins are full, but should be left open, and the levels in
                        the basins re- gulated by the opening of their escapes to the necessary
                        extent. In this way a quantity of water is admitted to the basins in excess
                        of that required to fill them, and, as the current in the wide expanse of
                        water is imperceptible, all the silt is thrown down before the water passes
                        away again, fertilizing the land surface for the crop which will follow the
                        retirement of the waters. To guard against the deficiencies of a low flood,
                        the canals, as has been stated above, should be dug so as to give a
                        suffiency of water, even in the most unfavorable years, to cover all the
                        lands, if only for a short time, so that the ground may take up sufficient
                        moisture for maturing the coming crop- an important matter, inasmuch as, if
                        the opportu- nity of soaking the land during the flood is lost, the one crop
                        that flood lands produce in the year has no chance of being sown. It will be
                        easily understood that in bad years- in fact in most years- the land near
                        the point where a basin feeder takes off from the river cannot be reached by
                        the flood water entering the feeder. So these lands are served by the canals
                        belonging to the chain of basins next above, their high-level water being
                        carried in syphon under the basin feeder of the next lower chain. Provision
                        is also made for pass- ing on water from one basin to the next so that, in
                        case there remain some lands untouched by the water when the time for
                        emptying the basins comes, their inundation may be completed by raising the
                        water level in each basin in succession by the help of the volume discharged
                        into it from the basin next above it.</p>
                    <p>The basin system is, however, destined to give place to the perennial system
                        of irriga- tion, whereby not only are two crops a year raised instead of
                        one, but the average value of each crop is hgiher than that of the single
                        crop grown on basin lands. In Upper Egypt, since the construction of the
                        Assonen Dam, a very considerable proportion of the pre- viously existing
                        basins has already been con- verted to perennially irrigatied land. Conse-
                        quently, the method of irrigation by inunda- tion is losing some of its
                        importance as an object of study. Moreover, what has been written above
                        describes in a general way the principle of distribution of water by basins,
                        so that no further description need be given of the working of this system.
                        Those who may have, hereafter, to control such irriga- tion will naturally
                        study the official records and standard books on irrigation, which con- tain
                        a full record of the past twenty years experience of responsible officials
                        and the con- clusions arrived at.</p>
                    <p>Let us return once more to the consideration of the subject of perennial
                        irrigation. The possibility that the available supply of water might be
                        insufficient for the whole of a given area requiring irrigation has been
                        referred to above. The insufficiency may not be recognised in the first
                        instance during the period of design, but may be felt after the canals have
                        been in working order for some time, as a result of an unexpected expansion
                        of the cultivated area depending upon the canal. Such has been the case in
                        Egypt, where, in consequence of the remarkable development of the country
                        and the reclamation of uncultivated areas, the summer supply of the Nile, at
                        last, proved insufficient, when fully utilised, to meet the demand of the
                        increasing areas of crops depending on it for their irrigation. Con-
                        sequently it became necessary to study the question of how to supplement the
                        summer supply of the Nile. As, during the flood and winter seasons, a small
                        proportion only of the river discharge is utilised, while the greater amount
                        runs into the sea, the problem resolved itself into one of storage of this
                        surplus water at those seasons. And so the Assouan Dam was built, and a
                        reservoir formed above it in the valley of the Nile itself, wherein the
                        summer flood and winter surplus is stored for use in the following summer as
                        an addition to the low supply; but even with this addition the summer supply
                        is still insufficient to meet the demand, and additional means of
                        supplement- ing it are being studied. the problems connect- ed with this
                        question are somewhat intricate but highly interesting. They are clearly
                        stated in an article by Sir William Garstin, which appeared in the September
                        number of the "Nineteenth Century" under the heading "Some Problems of the
                        Upper Nile."</p>

                        <p>To the editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                        <p>Eight months ago the residents of the Zeitoun and Matarieh district were
                            inveigled into taking the company's water on the distinct understanding
                            that they were to be charged o fixed amount based on the number of
                            square metre contained in their respective properties. The price fixed
                            by the Water Company was accepted by the majority of the residents, who
                            relied upon the company's good faith when assuring them that no charge
                            would be made in the system then instituted for assessing the cost of
                            water consumed.</p>
                        <p>A few days ago the Water Company issued a circular to the subscribers
                            informing tham of their intention to place meters and that water would
                            in future be charged for at the rate of P.T. 68.7 for the first 50 cubic
                            meters and 51 metres and upwards at the rate of P.T. 1 per metre per
                            month, and rental for the meters at an all-around average of about P.T.
                            10. Thsi works out at about double the charge levied by the company
                            hitherto, and is no less than 82% dearer than the subscribers residing
                            at Ramleh pay the Alexandria Water Co.</p>
                        <p>Most of the residents have given up their sakkiehs and have in many
                            instances gone to considerable expense in laying down water-pipe
                            installations for their garden and house.</p>
                        <p>The company's action at the present junc- ture of affairs is manifestly a
                            gross abuse of equity. Moreover an examination of the com- pany's report
                            and balance-sheet shows that the receipts per 100 metres of water
                            amounts to P.T. 85, whilst the expenses, including the board of
                            administration, are only P.T. 20; there is thus a profit of P.T. 63 per
                            100 metres of water, equivalent to the enormous percentage of 335%.</p>
                        <p>The Assiout concession shows 205% profit.</p>
                        <p>Having regard to the special condition which obtained in the country
                            formerly, the policy of the Egyptian Government in granting monopolies
                            was no doubt a wise one and served a useful purpose, but surely the
                            Govern- ment of the present day, even supposing that they deem it
                            expedient to grant further mono- polies, should apply the necessary
                            clauses to safeguard the interests of the inhabitants affected by
                            them.</p>
                        <p>Water is one of the necessities of life and the result of the latest
                            decision of the Water Company is already felt in a distinct upward
                            tendency in rents in Zeitoum.</p>
                        <p>Instea of increasing their price the Water Company should decrease it.
                            Even if it were reduced to 5 milliemes per metre they would still earn a
                            profit of over 100%, a rate exceeding the wildest dreams of the heads of
                            the most flourishing commercial concerns in Egypt or elsewhere.</p>

                        <head>THE PROTECTION OF ANIMALS.</head>
                        <p>To the editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                        <p>Sir,- During my short residence in this town, the one thing I find
                            characteristically cruel, if the maltreatment of the animals, chiefly of
                            horses. It has been my daily misfor- tune to see these poor creatures
                            trying to draw the heaviest burdens, of which the weight is obviously
                            higher than their power. This burden is often composed of building
                            materials, or, sometimes, of Arab women, who sit down on the long carts
                            by dozens and more, perhaps, ignorant of the cruelty they are caus- ing.
                            Under these sad circumstances, no wonder if it has been a common scene
                            in the streets, the falling down of the horses, who, exasperat- ed and
                            bloody as they are, again and again are whipped to work even in their
                            impotence. I think the whip must be turned to the man, and not to the
                            animal. This fact is so obvious and cruel, that it ought to call the
                            attention of all those who are concerned. The other day I met a friend,
                            a fanatic member of Animals Protection Association, who was carefully
                            read- ing the annual report of the association, and declraing the good
                            done by this association. I don't know if there is any of the kind in
                            this town, but I can surely assume that it is high time to look after
                            these oppressed and mal- treated animals.</p>

                        <head>RUY BLAS.</head>
                        <p>Victor Hugo's play perhaps showed the Lambert company from a more
                            characteristic point of view than some of the pieces per- sented. Here
                            trandition, and that a most in- teresting and admirable tradition, came
                            before us. Ruy Blas as a play represents so strongly the reaction
                            against Classicism, that it must perforce establish a distinct school of
                            acting. This the Lambert company represent to the full, much to our
                            gain; and not only the leaders, but all the performers acquitted
                            themselves well. M. Lambert fils was again the chief figure, consistent,
                            and excellent throughout, as valet, toper, and Minister; the great
                            prophetic speech on decadent Spain and her ruinous corruption was
                            worthily delivered; equally fine was the sequel, and Ruy Blas' disguised
                            master rose to the occa- sion. Again, too, Mlle Delvair was brilliant,
                            every bold gesture and intonation telling. The comic relief reminded us
                            of Coquelin, but why not? How could the returned exile do better than
                            follow such a model? The whole play has a variety which was lacking in
                            the tragedy of Francois Coppee: not a word of Severo Torelli but it
                            tragic, fatal, so impas- sioned as to be almost a strain: this the
                            greater master avoids, and so, fine as is M. Coppee's rama, Ruy Blas is
                            more a human document, many-sided; and again one can have nothing but
                            praise for the actors who represented so fully every side.</p>
                        <p>We would add one word, if perhaps the management may accept it: why is
                            the charge of five piastres exacted for programmes? The programme with
                            the resume of the play has apparently been suppressed, and though the
                            present pictorial document may have its inte- rest, it is hardly worth
                            the sum asked, espe- cially as it does not seem to differ from night to
                            night except in the names of the characters. And these we can see for
                            nothing on the poster. Let us hope this will not be in force during the
                            rest of the opera season.</p>

                        <head>LE MARQUIS DE VILLEMER.</head>
                        <p>The Lambert company had given as tragedy, so far, classic and
                            neo-classic, to except the Vie de Boheme. The contrast brought out by Le
                            Marquis de Villemer was the more striking. The story is- one must call
                            it so- conventional, and savour of its epoch; the good brother the
                            Marquis, and the bad brother the Duke, and the well-born but ruined
                            demoiselle de compagnie. The Marquis falls in love with her; the Duke,
                            now reformed, solves the di- lemma by marrying the heiress destined for
                            the Marquis, and promoting the marriage of the other two. It is just one
                            of those plays which might drive one to think what would the sequel have
                            been. But the wit and excellence of the book' carry off the con-
                            vention, and leave a certain fragrance, as of Balzac, and a regret that
                            such times are past. Naturally the actors showed in a totally different
                            light; the stars were M. Marquet as the Duke, and, of course, Mlle
                            Delvair. The perfection in each tiny detail was more striking than ever,
                            faultless, and convincing; this same detail was at its height with M.
                            Marquet, the Duke, who had full play for his wit; he is 'd'un esprit
                            railleurs,' of that wit which France possesses above all and which has
                            seemed to its possessors worth more at times than anything this or the
                            next world can give or withhold. MM. Lambert, both father and son,
                            seemed less at their height: both were less subtle, shall we say, less
                            modern. Their talent, as we have seen, is classical, of the Theatre
                            d"orange, of great measured lines, under the moonlight against marble
                            columns. There the father's gestures, 'le geste noble,' and the son's
                            perfection of voice have their full effect. Yet this does not imply that
                            they failed in Georges Sand's play: they are great actors, and if we
                            could wish for less gesture in the one, and less tragic energy in the
                            other, in a word for the more delicate graduations of emotion which we
                            look for on the French stage of to-day, it was only at moments: the
                            harmony of the whole to the note stuck by M. Marquet and Mme. Delvair
                            was never really disturbed: it was more a case of noticing than of
                            criticising. The other parts were quite adequately filled, more
                            especially in the case of the Marquise, and the scandal-loving Baronne.
                            The staging, as usual, was most careful, adn showed minute study; that
                            again we find at its height on the French stage: no wonder a French play
                            is always worth seeing.</p>

                    <head>EGYPT'S MALADIES IN 1904. INTERESTING STATISTICS.</head>
                    <p>The Sanitary Department of the Ministry of the Interior has published a
                        volume of statistics dealing with the infectious diseases notified
                        throughout the country and deaths occuring from the same towns and villages
                        in each quarter of 1904. The figures are very inte- resting and afford a
                        bird's-eye view of the maladies of Egypt during last year. It is very
                        noticeable how fatal exanthermatic typhus was at Cairo. Out of 1,085 deaths
                        throughout the whole of Egypt from this disease more than half (593)
                        occurred at Cairo. At Alex- andria there were only 39 fatal cases. Typhoid
                        fever was responsible for 491 deaths, of which 172 took place in Cairo and
                        125 in Alexandria. Relapsing fever and malaria were far more common in Cairo
                        than in Alexandria. No less than 31 person succumbed to relaps- ign fever in
                        Cairo and only 5 in Alexandria, out of a total number of 201 fatal cases for
                        the whole of Egypt. Malaria was res- ponsible for 369 deaths, of which 39
                        occurred at Cairo and 3 at Alexandria. Malta fever appears to be a specialty
                        of Port Said, for out of a total of 12 cases for all Egypt 10 were at that
                        port. Of 13 fatal cases of erysi- pelas, 6 occurred at Alexandria and the
                        same number at Cairo, and only one other in all the rest of the country.</p>
                    <p>Epidemic cerebro-spinal meningistis was con- fined to Alexandria, where there
                        were 20 out of the total 21 cases. Of these 11 were fatal. Rabies claimed 16
                        deaths, 7 at Cairo and 4 at Alexandria. Influenza terminated fatally in 85
                        cases, of which 18 were at Cairo and 6 at Alexandria. There were 19 deaths
                        from lepro- sy. Medinet el-Fayoum had no less than 4 fatal cases out of the
                        total, the balance being spread in even proportions all over Egypt.
                        Puerperal fever terminated fatally in 215 cases, of which 75 were at Cairo
                        and 44 at Alexan- dria. There were 136 deaths from whooping cough, of which
                        72 were at Assiout, 31 at Suez, 16 at Cairo, and 3 at Alexandria. Small- pox
                        was responsible for 1,093 and measle for 5,260 deaths. Diphtheria was very
                        fatal out of 586 fatal cases for all Egypt.</p>

                    <head>THE DROP IN EGYPTIAN STOCK.</head>
                    <p>The recent decline in some of the leading Egyptian securities known to the
                        market, such as shares of the National Bank of Egypt, the Agricultural Bank
                        of Egypt, the Land Bank of Egypt, and the Daira Sanieh Company (says a
                        London contemporary), is an incident that had been anticipated for some time
                        past. The great prosperity of Egypt in late years has produced speculation
                        in the financial centres of the country, supported to a certain extent by
                        Continental operators. Prices of many securi- ties have been carried up well
                        above their natural value, and the operations being largely conducted upon
                        borrowed money, a collapse sooner or later was only to be ex- pected.
                        Indeed, the very properity of the country may have contributed to the
                        depres- sion, as the Egyptian markets are busy at the present moment in
                        financing an excellent crop of cotton, which is commanding a very good
                        price. In all probability the monetary de- amds of genuine business has
                        reduced the amount available for speculation, and shares have perforce been
                        sold. Although the ten- dency in some of these securities is now slightly
                        better, those who follow the course of events in Egypt would not be surpised
                        to see a further decline.</p>

                    <p>The annual blue books of statistics of the trade of Spain for 1904 recently
                        issued state that the imports into Spain from Egypt amounted during the year
                        to £464,364, and Egypt received exports from Spain to the value of £4,326.
                        On the whole British imports in Spain showed a falling off £451,174, whilst
                        the imports of our Colonies and dependen- cies, especially Egypt, and the
                        American, Asiatic, and Oceanian colonies, showed an increase of several
                        hundred thousand pounds in all. The exports to England proper from Spain
                        showed a falling off of £240,643, Gib- raltar of £207,588, Egypt £7,389 and
                        the Colonies about £30,000, compared also with the figures of 1903.</p>

                            check at Ghezireh Badrane on Friday, when in a fair and square struggle
                            with G. Co., K.R.R., they were beaten by 2 to 1. The railway men last
                            the toes and attacked Embabeh end. In the early stages of the game G.
                            Co.'s left wing registered a goal, before the home de- fence had known
                            what was happening. A few minutes later a second goal was scored and
                            this quite demoralised the home players, for all through the first half
                            they could do nothing right. After the change of ends the railway men
                            began attacking and kept it up all through the second half. When well
                            into the last half of the game, Hayes scored the only Institute goal
                            after and exciting scramble in front of the visitors' goal. The home
                            forwards tried hard to put matters straight, but G. Co. won the match by
                            their superiority in the middle line of defence. Mr. Trotter was the
                            referee.</p>

                    <p>Senor Quesada, Cuabn Minister to the United States. Senor Quesada, Cuban
                        Minister to the United States, is an orator born. In and article in The
                        Outlook for July, 1809, by George Kennan, who heard Quesada speak at the
                        Esteban Theatre, Mantangaa, Cuba, he said: "I have seen many audiences under
                        the spell of eloquent speech and in the grip of strong emotional excitement;
                        but I have rarely witnessed such a scene as at the close of Quesadals eulogy
                        upon the dead patriot, Marti." In a letter to The Peruna Medicine Com- pany,
                        written from Washington, D.C., Senior Quesada says:</p>
                    <p>"Peruna I can recommend as a very good medi- cine. It is an excellent
                        strengthening tonic, and it is also an efficacious cure for the almost
                        universal complaint of catarrh." -Gonzalo De Quesada.</p>
                    <p>Congressman J.H. Bankhead of Ala- bama, one of the most influential mem- bers
                        of the House of Representatives, in a letter written from Washington, D.C.,
                        gives his endorsement to the great ca- tarrh remedy, Peruna, in the
                        following words:</p>
                    <p>"Your Peruna is one of the best medicines I ever tried, and no family should
                        be without your remarkable remedy. As a tonic and catarrh cure I know of
                        nothing better." -J.H. Bankhead.</p>
                    <p>There is but a single medicine which is a radical specific for catarrh. It is
                        Peruna, which has stood a half century test and cured thousands of
                        cases.</p>
                    <p>If you do not derive prompt and satis- factory results from the use of
                        Peruna, write at once to Dr. Hartman, giving a full statement of your case
                        and he will be pleased to give you his valuable ad- vice gratic.</p>

                        <p>The Directors have pleasure in submitting to the Shareholders the Balance
                            Sheet and Profit and Loss Account of the Company made up to the <date
                                when="1905-06-30">30th June, 1905</date>. As the active business
                            season at Cairo runs from October to April it has been found that a
                            Balance Sheet made up to 31st December does not adequately show the
                            result of the work of the year; the accounts have therefore been brought
                            down to the <date when="1905-06-30">30th June</date> last, and embrace a
                            period of 18 months.</p>
                        <p>Further, in order to show clearly the actual results achieved by the
                            Company's operations. the Directors have decided to alter the principle
                            upon which the Accounts have hitherto been made up, by eliminating from
                            them all appreciation of value and showing the assets at cost. This
                            change has necessitated certain adjusting entries which appear in the
                            Balance Sheet.</p>
                        <p>The balance of £5,049 0s 2d to the credit of Profit and Loss Account
                            therefore represents the net realized profit to 30th June last. Out of
                            this balance the Directors recommend the payment of a dividend of 12 ½
                            per cent, free of Income Tax.</p>
                        <p>The Directors have made an evaluation of the land and share assets shown
                            in the Balance Sheet (exclusive of land now in process of reclamation),
                            and this, based on the market quotations and on offers actually received
                            for some of the land, shows an appreciation over cost price of about
                            £400,000.</p>
                        <p>The Board have satisfaction in reporting constant progress of the
                            Company's affairs in all directions. During the course of the year, Sir
                            John Rogers and the Cairo staff, with the assistance of the Engineering
                            Department under Mr. Beresford, have been fully occupied with the
                            business in hand with the consideration of many new proposals.
                            Successful operations have been carried out and a basis has been laid
                            down for further important land and other business in Egypt as well as
                            in the Sudan.</p>

                    <p>The photogravures annexed to the Report show the substantial nature of the
                        works that have been carried out under the direction of Mr. Beresford, the
                        Company's Consulting Engineer.</p>
                    <p>The regulators and other reclamation works constructed in previous years were
                        maintained in good order during 1904, and, together with the two new works
                        constructed before the flood of 1904, viz.: the Fashu and Hataba regulators,
                        all worked satisfactorily during that year.</p>
                    <p>It was proposed to carry out before the flood of 1905 three new works, i.e.,
                        regulators for the Ashmant, Luxor and Baiadya Khors. The first of these was
                        formally sanctioned by the Government, and its construction, which involved
                        the use of novel engineering methods, duly completed. This new regulator,
                        which is a striking work of great general interest and the largest of its
                        kind carried out by the Company, has acted very satisfactorily during the
                        flood of 1905.</p>
                    <p>The other two projects were submitted to the Government for approval early in
                        1905, and were at first accepted by subsequently this acceptance was
                        withdrawn, in the opinion of the Directors most unjustifiably, on the
                        pretext that new works could not be sanctioned at a date so near the
                        termination of the original concession.</p>
                    <p>The works as a whole have acted well during 1905, considering the nature of
                        the flood, which has been one of the lowest in the series of low floods
                        experienced during the last six year. With average floods much better
                        progress would have been made, but even with the adnormally low flood that
                        have prevailed, the area of land reclaimed has been considerable, and its
                        value is increasing year by year.</p>
                    <p>From the engineering point of view, the works carried out by the Company,
                        though more or less of an experimental nature at first, hav been completely
                        successful, and this has been admitted by the Irrigation Department of the
                        Government. Hence there can be no reason on engineering grounds why the
                        Government should not carry out its engagement to grant a new concession on
                        the conditions provided for in the original one.</p>
                    <p>The Directors, however, regret to report that the Egyptian Government has
                        declined to carry out the terms of Article 13 of the Reclamations
                        Concession, which provided, subject only to the works being successful, for
                        the renewal of the original concession for a further period of fifteen years
                        on the same broad lines. The Directors are at a loss to understand the
                        position taken up by the Egyptian Government, a position manifestly unjust
                        to the Company which hoped to receive better treatment in consideration of
                        the valuable work carried out. The Directors still trust that some
                        arrangement may be arrived at, but they have the best legal advice that,
                        should the Egyptian Government persist in its present decision, the Company
                        will be entitled to substantial compensation. Meanwhile, a test case is
                        being brought before the Mixed Tribunals in Egypt, which it is hoped will
                        legally establish the respective rights of the Company and of the natives in
                        the vicinity of the various sites. The correspondence on the subject is at
                        the disposal of the Shareholders, who are also referred to Articles 13 and
                        14 of the original concession, copy of which is annexed to this Report.</p>

                            channel across the Lake is proceeding satisfactorily, and although some
                            time has been lost by the delay in the delivery of the second dredger,
                            it is hoped that the section between Port Said and Matarieh, working in
                            connection with the railway from Matarieh to Mansorrah, will be open for
                            traffic in a few months.</p>
                        <p>Satisfactory arragements have been concluded with the Suez Canal Company,
                            by which the Lake channel will be connected with the Suez Canal, without
                            expense to the Menzaleh Company. Within a few months it is expected that
                            the channel will be continued</p>

                            already be realised at a considerable profit. The Company has also
                            acquired on advantageous terms, jointly with other local firms, an
                            extensive interest in various blocks of cultivable land which give

                            Beresford has now completed the plans, and it is hoped that the Company

                            inormed that the titles to part of the lands have not yet been issued by
                            the Government and that the lands purchased from the Daira Sanieh
                            Company, Limited, appearing in the accounts as other lands, are now
                            being transferred to the Company in terms of the Contract. IN our
                            opinion, such Balance Sheet is propely drawn up so as to exhibit a true
                            and correct view of the state of the Company's affairs as shown by the
                            books of the Company.</p>

                    <p>A BROKEN-DOWN SYSTEM. This is a condition or disease to which doctors give
                        many names, but which few of them really understand. It is simply weakness-
                        a break-down, as it were, of the vital forces that sustain the system. No
                        matter what may be its causes (for they are almost numberless), its symptoms
                        are much the same; the more prominent being sleeplessness, sense of
                        prostration or weariness, depression of spirits and want of energy for all
                        the ordinary affaires of life. Now, what alone is absolutely essential in

                        STRENGTH &amp; ENERGY to throw off these morbid feelings, and experience
                        proves that as night succeeds the day this may be more certainly secured by
                        a course of the celebrated life-reviving tonic THERAPION No. 3 than by any
                        other known combination. So surely as it is taken in accordance with the
                        printed directions accopanying it, will the shattered health be restored,
                        THE EXPIRING LAMP OF LIFE LIGHTED UP AFRESH, and a new existence impatred in
                        place of what had so lately seemed worn-out, "used up," and valueless. This
                        wonderful medicament is purely vegetable and innocuous, is agreeable to the
                        taste- suitable for all conspentions and conditions in either sex; and it is
                        difficult to imagine a case of disease or derangement whose main features
                        are those of debility, that will not be speedily and permanently benefited
                        by this never-failing recuperative essence which is destined to cast into
                        oblivion everything that had preceded it for this wide-spread and numerous
