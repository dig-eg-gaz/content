          <head>BISHOPRIC FOR KHARTOUM</head>
          <p>It would appear from <persName>Bishop Blyth</persName>’s written statements, and
              <persName>Bishop Wilkinson</persName>'s sermon on December 17 in <placeName>St. John's
              Church, West- ninster</placeName>, as reported in the home papers, that a definite
            attempt is being made to raise funds for an English bishopric at
              <placeName>Khartoum</placeName> “as a Church Memorial to <persName>General
              Gordon</persName>." It seems somewhat strange to open a fund for a second English
            bishopric in Nile land before the first scheme—that for an English bishop- ric in
            Egypt—has met with any adequate support. The "Egyptian Bishopric Endowment Fund" stands
            at £8,952.11.1 and £20,000 at least are required to establish the bishopric. The late
              <persName>Archbishop of Canterbury</persName> said, "Not less than £ 10,000 should be
            raised to put the bishopric on a firm financial basis.” A fund was opened in 1899, and
            in seven years has only secured a sum less than half the amount absolutely necessary ;
            last year the donations to the fund only amounted to a very few pounds (£8 17s.
            Od.).</p>
          <p>If it is desirable that we have a bishop of the Church of England in
              <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, surely it would be better to raise the remaining £11,000
            before starting another scheme for a second bishopric in the <placeName>Nile
              Valley</placeName>. In the <placeName>Sudan</placeName>, which is united to
              <placeName>Egypt</placeName> by the Nile, there are only five clergymen of the Church
            of Eng- land at work, and three of these have only just arrived. At the present moment
            we have an archdeacon of the Church of England in the <placeName>Sudan</placeName>, and
            an archdeacon,(in Episcopal Orders) of the Church of England in Egypt. Until the £20,000
            or £30,000 are raised to pay a living wage to the new bishop, might not the interest on
            the present endowment fund, which would be about £250 per annum, be (with the consent of
            the donors) applied to paying the expenses of our present archdeacon, who might be
            willing, if <persName>Bishop Blyth</persName> thought fit, to act as his representative
            in <placeName>Egypt</placeName>? As our archdeacon is also a bishop, surely this
            arrangement would meet the present needs of the English Church in Egypt and the Sudan.
            If English Churchmen in Egypt are con- vinced of the need for an independent bishop to
            represent, and preside over, their Church, they will no doubt, when approached, be
            willing to contribute to the fund. There are, we believe, about 27 clergy at work now in
            Egypt and the Sudan, and another 33 in <placeName>Syria</placeName>
            <placeName>Cyprus</placeName>. In <placeName>New Zealand</placeName> the average number
            of clergy to each bishop is 46; in Australasia 13 of the English bishops have an average
            of 37 clergy a-piece; and in the Amer- ican Church there is one bishop to 53 clergy. The
            time will doubtless soon arrive when it will be necessary for the welfare of the Church
            of England in Egypt that she should be fully organised with a bishop of her own.
            Meanwhile it would seem wise to seek to obtain the sum required for the bishopric
            proposed in 1899, before starting a second fund for the establishment of a second
            bishopric in the Sudan, which is after all but another portion of Nile-land, for the
            all- important river binds the two countries into one.</p>

          <p>The Meteorological Service. The meteorological observations over Egypt and the Sudan

            obtained makes it possible to undertake more thoroughly the study of the factors which
            determine the Nile Flood, in co-operation with the Meteorological Services of
            surrounding countries. In 1906 it is proposed to devote more time to this question, in
            order to see what information from other areas can be most usefully employed in
            estimating the probable strength of the rains in <placeName>Abyssinia</placeName>.</p>

            omissions be observed in the present edition it is requested that these be at once
            brought to the notice of the “Clerk-in-charge, The Garrison Directory, British Head

          <p>African World Annual. We have received the "African World” Christmas Annual, a bulky
            production of about 300 folio pages packed full of interesting information regarding
            every part of Africa, from the Cape to <placeName>Cairo</placeName>. Though the contents
            are mainly devoted to South African mining, a section which is of the utmost value to
            those interested in these ventures, space is found for a whole series of ably written
            and specially contributed articles, dealing with almost every phase of African
            activity—whether it be on mining, or on sport, politics, and travel. The literary value
            of the publication is very high and it is most profusely illustrated with photo- graphs
            and sketches. The editors and compilers, Messrs. <persName>Leo Weinthal</persName>,
              <persName>Hartley Knight</persName>, and <persName>Moses Roberts</persName>, are to be
            congratulated on a marvellously fine production. It costs 2s, and should be in the hands
            of all those interested in any part of this continent.</p>

          <head>EGYPT’S FRONTIER.</head>
          <head>THE PORTE’S CLAIMS.</head>
          <head>A TURCO-EGYPTIAN DISPUTE.</head>
          <p>A dispute between the Egyptian and Turkish Governments respecting the frontier separat-
            ing Egypt from the <placeName>Benghazi District</placeName> is report- ed by a
              <placeName>Constantinople</placeName> correspondent. Last year the Turkish Government
            caused barracks for a company of infantry to be erected at the further end of the
              <placeName>Gulf of Sollom</placeName>, from which the line of demarcation between
            Egypt and the district of <placeName>Benghazi</placeName> starts. The barracks, however,
            were erected at a point situated a little beyond the Turkish frontier, and the Khedive's
            Government therefore pro- tested against this encroachment by Turkish troops on Eyptian
            territory.</p>
          <p>To this the Porte only answered that there could be no question of any encroachment on
            a foreign soil on the part of Turkey, “since the villayet (province) of Egypt formed an
            integral part of the Ottoman Empire.”</p>
          <p>The sophistry of this argument did not escape the Egyptian Government. In order both to
            force the Turkish garrison in the barracks to quit Egyptian soil and to restore to Egypt
            her rights of territorial sovereignty not only over the entire district of
              <placeName>Sollom</placeName> but also over a district of about 250 kilometres to the
            west of that point, it is causing an Egyp- tian military post to be constructed at the
            farther end of the <placeName>Bay of Bomba</placeName>.</p>
          <p>The erection, therefore, of this Egyptian military post at Bomba will have for result
            the acquisition by Egypt of a considerable area. The frontier between Egypt and the
            Turkish district of <placeName>Benghazi</placeName>, which began, as the maps indicate,
            at Sollon, will now start from the <placeName>Bay of Bomba</placeName>, that is to say,
            will include about 250 kilometres more in the direction of the west.</p>
          <p>Recently the Turkish Council of Ministers discussed this question at great length, and
            decided that the Grand Vizier should address a communication directly to the Egyptian
            Government calling on it to give up the project. The Governor of
              <placeName>Benghazi</placeName>, <persName>Hilmy Pasha</persName>, has, on his side,
            received orders, to oppose by any means he may consider necessary the erection by the
            Egyptians of a military post at <placeName>Bomba</placeName>, supposing the Khedivial
            Government should refuse to take into consideration the communi- cation of the Grand
            Vizier.</p>
          <p>According to Turkish intelligence, an Egyp- tian despatch boat has been chosen to
            convey to Bomba the Egyptian soldiers whose duty it will be to erect the military post
            and thus to isolate from <placeName>Benghazi</placeName> the Turkish barracks at
              <placeName>Sollom</placeName>.</p>

            not obtained con- firmation of them from any authorised Egyptian source.</p>

          <head>ENQUIRY OPENED AT YILDIZ KIOSK.</head>
          <head>DJELLALEDDIN PASHA’S PROTEST TO THE SULTAN.</head>
          <p>The death of the Khedivial Princess who was the wife of <persName>General
              Ahmed</persName>. <persName>Djelaleddin Pasha </persName>and the sister of
              <persName>Prince Omar Pasha</persName> and <persName>Prince Djemil Pasha
              Toussoun</persName>, is still fresh in the minds of all, for the funeral, which took
            place at Alexandria, was one of the most solemn and largely attended inhumations that
            have taken place here for years past. Her body rests in the <placeName>Mosque of Nebi
              Daniel</placeName>.</p>
          <p>Since her death her husband, who for more than ten years was the most powerful and
            honorable of the Sultan's advisors, has re- sided in Egypt and resisted all the
            blandish- ments of the Sublime Porte to induce him to go back to
              <placeName>Stamboul</placeName>. His obstinacy has led, it is said, to the
            confiscation of his estates in Turkey, and now the Sultan has determined to blacken the
            character of his erstwhile favorite by ordering a commission to sit at <placeName>Yildiz
              Kiosque</placeName> in order to enquire into the circum- stances attending his wife's
            death. The Pasha’s case is fully set out in the telegram which he despatched to Tahsin
            Pasha, first secretary to the Sultan, on the 26th inst. The text of this despatch is as
            follows .—</p>
          <p>Je viens d'apprendre par les journaux l’en- quête ouverte au palais de Yildiz au aujet
            de la légère opération chirurgicale que la prin- cesse, ma très regrettée épouse, avait
            subie, aprés consultation et décision de quelques som- mités médicales de la Capitale,
            un an et demi avant sa mort et à laquelle assistaient égale- ment sa mère sa soeur et
            son beau-père.</p>
          <p>Je considère comme un devoir saoré d'aider de toss mes moyens à toute to démarche qui
            pour- rait constituer un hummage à la mémoire de la regrettée défunte, en facilitant la
            déconverte de la vérité en tout ce qui la concerne; Le soupçon, l'évidence même d'une
            intention personnelle- ment désobligeante pour moi, ne-saurait m’em- pêcher d'accomplir
            ce devoir sacré. Aussi est-ce avec empressement que je viens surgérer les moyens les
            plus propices à atteindre la but proposé.</p>
          <p>La défunte princesse est inhumée an Egypte et son cercueil porte tonjours les soellés
            qui, conformément au règlement régissant le trans- fert des corps, ont été apposés par
            les antorités po'icières de la ville de Cannes, cu elle a rendu le dernier soupir. Tous
            ses parents, l'illusure famille á laquelle elle appartenait, sont domiciliés dans ce
            pays et j'y suis établi moi-même, principal intéressé. La haute re- nommés de justice et
            d’impartialité des tri- bunaux égyptiens demeurant au-dessus de toute contestation il
            serait donc tout-à-fait naturel de poursuivre ce procès en Egypte, ce qui assurerait
            l’exaltation entière de la vérité.</p>
          <p>Pourtant, si par une considération queloon- que le recours aux tribunaux égyptiens
            était jugé inopportun on rourrait parfaitement déférer le cas à la justice française, la
            prince se étant morte en France. Au surplus, je suis prêt à me présenter à la justice de
            tout pays civilisé où l'indépendance des tribunaux se tronve assurée.</p>
          <p>Mais la manière par laquelle l’enquête est inaugurée à Constantinople, la constitution
            d’une commission au palais de Yildiz, qui ne devrait en rien intervenir dans une affaire
            judiciaire, la pression exercée sur certains mé- decins (parmi lesquels d’auouns
            n’avaient d’ail- leurs jamais examiné la défunte princesse)pour leur faire apposer leurs
            signatures au-dassous d'un rapport préslablement préparé, les mena- ces proférées à
            cette occasion constituent au- tant de symptômes indiquant que l’enquête poursuivie à
            Constantinople marque, dans son origine même, de cette incérité dans la recher- che de
            la vérité qui constitue la condition essentielle de toute justice régulière.</p>
          <p>Aussi, il devieut indispensable dans l’intérêt même du but pousuivi de trausférer le
            procès devant une justice inaccessible à aucune ingé- rence et dont la procédure normale
            ne saurait subir aucune déviation.</p>
          <p>Cette proposition ne peut qu’être adoptée, s’il existe la moindre impartialité dans
            l’en- quête inaugurêe. Le triomphe de ceux qui la poursuiventrerait incontestables’ils
            parvenaient à obtenir une condemnation d’un tribunal jugeant en pleine possession de son
            indépen- dance. Le refus, au contraire, de porter l'affaire devant une justice
            impartiale, découvrirait de suite le but caché qui ne peut être autre chose que de
            porter une grave atteinte à ma dignité et à mon honneur. Ce sont là justement les seuls
            biens auquels je tiens dans l’exil volon- taire que je me suis imposé. En présence d’une
            pareille entreprise qui sous imposé d'une procès absurde, équivaut à déclarer une guerre
            ouverte contre mon honneur, toute considera- tion de convenance, tout souvenir
            d’anciennes bienveillances cessent d'avoir leur raison d'être. La responsabilité de
            cette nouvelle situation ne peut révenir qu’a ceux qui m’obligent de me départir de la
            neutralité que je me suis imposée vis-à-vis du vrai instigateur de ces intrignes.
            J'accepterai le combat et j'attendral avec confiance les hostilités pour défendre mon
            honneur et lui conserver dans le monde l’estime et la considération dont je suis fier da
            le voir entouré. Ce sera une nouvelle occasion pour manifester la puissance morale de
            l’honneur et affirmer son triomphe contre toute force qui voudrait l'écraser
            injustement.</p>
          <p>An Englishman, who knew the Pasha at Constantinople, thus describes him:-</p>
          <p><persName>Djellaleddin Pasha</persName> was for years foremost and prime favorite among
            all the Sultan’s subjects, and fully deserved the trust reposed in him as an honorable
            and upright gentleman. His downfall, therefore, came as a shock to all who knew him, the
            greater, perhaps, for that the report added that he had been denounced by the Secret
            Police of the Palace, a force which he himself created and organised, and of which,
            among many offices, he has always been the working chief. A remarkable and singularly
            fascinating per- sonality, <persName>Ahmed Pasha</persName>’s most salient quality was
            ever an absolutely whole-hearted devotion to his master and when at last the enemies who
            ever dog the footsteps of Royal favorites succeeded in alienating from him
              <persName>Abdul Hamid</persName>’s confidence and affection, the cir- cumstance was
            received aa indicating a further sinister advance in the progress of that be- setting
            "manie de la persécution” which has for years haunted the gloomy potentate of Yildiz.
            During his long term of honored ser- vice <persName>Ahmed Pasha</persName> enjoyed an
            absolutely unique position in the Yildiz set. Privileges have been his which no other
            Turkish function- ary would have dared to solicit. Of late years, for instance, social
            communion between Turks and Europeans in the capital has been tacitly, and in some cases
            openly, prohibited. Yet Ahmed was a prominent member of the “English" club, and to which
            practically all the English colony belongs in common with the chief members of other
            European communities. Almost every day, indeed, Fridays excepted, during the many years
            I knew him, <persName>Ahmed Pasha</persName> took his place at the Bridge table—for
            Bridge was popular in <placeName>Constantinople</placeName> long before it was heard of
            in Europe, and it may be said that he is both a fine player and a good loser. It has
            often been suggested that this licensed associa- tion with Europeans was not wholly
            foreign to his functions as chief of the Secret Police. As to this, however, it may be
            said that all who have known the Pasha were penetrated with the sense of his complete
            honorability. In proof of this is the fact that when <persName>Abdul Hamid</persName>
            sought to end his differences with the chiefs in Paris of the ” Young Turkey ” party he
            employed in vain one intermediary after another until it was intimated to him that the
            services of <persName>Ahmed Djellaleddin</persName> as envoy would procure the desired
            result. The Pasha, therefore, was sent to Paris and on his representations the ” Young
            Turkey ” leaden complied with the Sultan’s invitation that they should return to
              <placeName>Constantinople</placeName> and their allegiance. It is noteworthy in this
            connection that Ahmed's influence with his master has sufficed to assure to them the
            immunity that he promised. It is within my knowledge that on several occasions he has
            been urged to diverge from this line of con- duct, and that at the risk of that loss of
            favor which has now overtaken him he invariably refused to put his hand to any unworthy
            action. Oddly enough, until now this inflexibility has served rather than injur- ed him
            in his master’s eyes : for the Sultan, though freely using spies and traitors, has a
            wholesome contempt for such gentry. Cover- ed with honors, only before his fall from
            favor recently, indeed, the Sultan bestowed on him the last and highest decoration in
            his gift.</p>

            to be derived from them. The inspector of the kuttabs of Lower Egypt, <persName>Sheikh

            subject, pointing out that these new methods of teaching were the same as those enjoined
            by the Koran. He mentioned that there are now about sixty kuttabs in the district of
              <placeName>Zifta</placeName> at- tended by 3,528 scholars, of whom 105 are girls. He
            added that there was only one kut- tab in the whole district in 1902.</p>

          <head>COAL IN EGYPT.</head>
          <head>IMPORTANT OPERATIONS OF CAIRO SYNDICATE.</head>
          <p>It is probable (the Financial News” remarks in an article on the above subject) that
            some time may yet elapse before the world at large realises, with any approach to
            completeness, the importance and the widespread significance of the entente cordiale,
            which was initiated by <persName>King Edward</persName> and <persName>M.
              Loubet</persName> and officially formalated by <persName>Lord Lansdowne</persName> and
              <persName>M. Paul Cambon</persName> in the early part of last year; but the influence
            for good which the Anglo-French Agreement could not fail to exercise upon the
            development and the growing prosperity of Egypt, met with immediate and universal re-
            cognition. Indeed, as <persName>Lord Cromer</persName> pointed out in his latest annual
            report "on the finances, administration, and condition of Egypt and "the Sudan,” it
            cannot' be doubted that the agreement constitutes a fresh point of depar- ture in
            Egyptian affairs. Evidences of an unmistakable character are already forth- coming which
            leave no room for doubting that in the comparatively near future Egypt will take that
            high place among the great indus- trial nations of the world which her vast and mainly
            undeveloped natural resources entitle her to hold. The work already ac- complished by
            various undertakings in the Nile Valley and in the <placeName>Sudan</placeName> has
            furnished satisfactory assurances that, with careful selec- tion and capable and honest
            management, gold mining operations in the two countries will become commeroially
            successful. Hitherto, however comparatively little attention has been devoted to the
            finding of coal in Egypt, although it is self evident that the production of coal of
            fairly good quality and upon even a moderate scale would be little, if at all, less
            important than the promised increase in the output of precious metals. <persName>Mr. C.
              J. Alford</persName>, in the course of the most voluminous of his reports upon the
            geological features of Egypt, said: "The tradition of the existence of coal or
            carboniferous deposits in the Valley of the Nile has been extant for many years. About
            seventy years ago a party of French- men are reported to have found some deposit of coal
            or lignite in the <placeName>Wady Keneh</placeName>, about 18 miles north west of
              <placeName>Keneh Town</placeName>"; but his time has been so fully occupied in the
            search for gold that he has not been able to pursue his investigations in regard to
            coal.</p>
          <p>Nor can it be saidthat inquiries into the subject have been encouraged by the Egyptian
            Government <persName>Captain Lyons</persName>, whose report is quoted by <persName>Lord
              Cromer</persName>, states that no reliable evidence of the occurrence of coal in
            workable quantity has yet been forthcoming, adding that most of the strata are of marine
            origin, but, in any case, the coal measures would underlie the surface deposits ; so
            that the character of the latter is by no means inconsistent with the existence of coal
            in depth. However, the sub- ject is not likely to remain much longer in doubt. In the
            early part of the current year, mainly on tha advice of Johnson Pasha the Cairo
            syndicate was formed to take over from the Government two concessions, one of about 400
            square miles, known as the "Abou-Ra-Dham,’’ and the other comprising the whole of the
            northern part of <placeName>Sinai Peninsula</placeName>, with an area of over 12,000
            square miles. At “Abou-Ra- Dham" shafts which are said to have been dug by Said Pasha
            have been discovered, and there are local traditions of other shafts and excavations. An
            excellent red hematite iron ore is stated to be known to exist on the con- cession—a
            valuable asset in itself, and still more valuable if, as local natives assert, the
            deposits were in ths old days smelted by means of coal obtained near at hand. From the
              <placeName>Sinai Peninsula</placeName> it is stated that coal and lignite have often
            been brought to <placeName>Suez</placeName>, while in the centre of the district ancient
            workings of im- portant dimensions have been discovered.</p>
          <p>Soon after the formation of the syndicate, properly qualified and equipped expeditions
            were dispatched to explore the two conces- sions; but as at least fifty years must have
            elapsed since the abandonment of work in the big shaft at ''Abou-Ra-Dham," some time
            must yet elapse before investigations can be completed. Meanwhile several smaller pits
            have been found, and, incidentally, it is stated that some excellent samples of hematite
            iron ore have been sent home from the property. In the <placeName>Sinai
              Peninsula</placeName> the expedition arrived early in September, and, after six days
            driving with a shift of eight labourers, an old tunnel was come upon intersecting the
            main one, the latter being 5 1/2 ft. high and 4 ft. broad at the top, and tapering to a
            width of 18 in. at the bottom. From the excavations some solid pieces of clean coal have
            been forwarded to the syndicate. The coal-bearing strata, when re- ported upon in
            September, was from 8 in for 9 in. to a foot in thickness, and the expert ad- viser of
            the expedition states that the main seam will shortly be reached. He adds that the coal
            is clean and easily depicted from the country rock, and remarks “That the ven- ture is
            now something more than a prospect is certain, and fully warrants the expen- diture of
            some capital. The operations of the <placeName>Cairo</placeName> syndicate will be
            watched with keen interest; for if it proves successful, as seems highly probable, its
            success will mark the beginning of a new era in the industrial progress of Egypt. At
            present all the ooal . consumed in the country has to be imported at great cost, while
            the markets for the com- modity which would be provided by <placeName>Suez</placeName>
            and <placeName>Port Said</placeName> for vessels passing through the world's greatest
            water-way and for shipment to the East would unquestionably place the local coal-mining
            enterprise in an extremely prosperous condition.</p>

          <head>IMMURED AS A LEPER.</head>
          <head>CANADIAN'S TRAGIC ADVENTURE</head>
          <head>HOW HE ESCAPED.</head>
          <p>When an individual becomes a member of the leper colony of
              <placeName>Molokai</placeName>, in the Pacific Ocean, he is lost to the world; there
            is no cure, no return, except in the rare case of an escape, an almost impossible
            performance.</p>
          <p>It has, nevertheless happened, and that within the past three months. The facts reveal
            tragedy and pathos transcending fiction, and would scarcely be believed if they were not
            vouched for by the best authority. For reasons that will be readily appreciated, it is
            undesir- able to mention the name of the gentleman who through his brother’s help has
            just succeeded in returning to freedom, if not happiness.</p>
          <p>He is a Canadian, and was married in Janu- ary 1890. A month later, while still on the
            honeymoon, the young couple visited <placeName>Honolulu</placeName>. After a few days'
            enjoyment of the life and sights of the capital of the <placeName>Sandwich
              islands</placeName>, the husband, at that time a man of twenty- five years of age,
            failed to return to the hotel for dinner. The anxious wife waited and waited, and
            finally called in the assistance of the Hawaiian police, but he had disappeared as
            completely as though the earth had opened and engulfed him.</p>
          <p>The young woman cabled to her relatives in <placeName>British Columbia</placeName>, and
            her father proceeded to her assistance. Father and daughter remained two months in
              <placeName>Honolulu</placeName>, and then, as there was still no tidings of the
            missing man, they returned home.</p>
          <p>His parents were wealthy, and engaged the services of a well-known American detective
            agency, urging that no expense should be spared to get at the facts of the
            disappearance. A competent man was sent to Honolulu, and after six weeks' patient
            investigation he dis- covered what had happened.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="item">
          <head>SEIZED AND DRUGGED.</head>
          <p>It seems that shortly after lunch on the day he disappeared he told his wife that he
            was going to the bank to draw some money, and that he would go to the club for an hour
            or so and return in time to take her for a drive before dinner. Immediately after
            leaving the bank, where he had drawn 500 dollars, he was arrested by four men, and,
            after being placed in a carriage, was driven to the house of 4 native official doctor.
            Here, after the most cursory examination, he was declared to have leprosy, and when the
            necessary papers had been signed he was drugged.</p>
          <p>It is easier to imagine than describe what his feelings were when he awoke to con-
            sciousness and found himself lying in the hold of a little vessel bound he knew not
            whither. Although the island is less than forty miles from
              <placeName>Honolulu</placeName>, morning had dawned before
              <placeName>Molokai</placeName> was reached. On arrival he was left to take his place
            in the company of over a thous- and lepers. It was in vain that he protested, demanded
            his instant release, and refused to believe it possible that he was a prisoner there for
            life.</p>
          <p>When the report was made to the parents by the detective agency they did all in their
            power to obtain their son’s release, but in vain. Years went by. The distracted wife
            died of a broken heart. Later his mother died, and some months afterwards his father
            likewise.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="item">
          <head>A BROTHER'S SCHEME</head>
          <p>Fortunately for the lonely sufferer, he pos- sessed a brother a year younger than
            himself, who decided to spare neither himself nor his fortune in efforts at rescue.</p>
          <p>It was not found difficult to charter a vessel, that would carry off the man if he
            could reach it, but the difficulty was to enter into any com- munication with the people
            on the island, so that co-operation could be had from that source. A man was finally
            found who possessed a skin disease that in appearance might be mistaken for a form of
            leprosy. This man was poor, out of work, and with a family to provide for. He agreed for
            £2,000 to be paid to his wife to risk his liberty and life. He was taken to
              <placeName>Honolulu</placeName>, and accused of being a leper. The doctor who examined
            him had grave doubts, but the man’s statement that his father had contracted leprosy in
            a mild form in India before his marriage, also that later in life the disease became
            worse, and he died a loathsome object to look upon. removed them, and he signed the
            necessary papers, as he could con- ceive no reason why a man should voluntarily desire
            to proceed to <placeName>Molokai</placeName> as a resident.</p>
          <p>His arrival there brought tho first ray of hope into the life of the man who for
            fifteen years and six months had borne and endured such as few men have had to do in the
            history of the world. The two men were not long in meeting, and the plot for escape was
            unfolded.</p>
          <p>It was four nights later that a good-sized schooner yacht, which had been lurking off
            the is and out of sight all day, drew gradually closer, and by ten o'clook was within a
            hundred yards of a part of the shore least likely to be patrolled by the guards. No
            lights were shown, but occasionally small pieces of wood were thrown overboard coated
            with luminous paint. As the current was drifting shoreward, they were thrown on the
            beach in a short space of time. Suddenly to the watchers of those on board two pieces
            were raised in the air and held in that position. Immediately a boat with muffled oars
            made for the shore, and took on board, the two men who were in waiting, hav- ing eluded
            the guards in the darkness.</p>
          <p>Two weeks later the yacht arrived at Van couver, and the brothers were reunited. Doc-
            tors who have examined the elder say there is not the slightest trace of leprosy about
            him. The mystery is who caused his abduction.</p>

          <head>ALLEGED COMPANY FRAUD.</head>
          <head>ANGLO-EGYPTIAN AUTOMATIC TRADING CO.</head>
          <p>On Wednesday week at the Mansion House before the Lord Mayor, <persName>Stewart Dixon
              Stubbs Ross</persName>, 38, of 18, Thicket-road, Anerley, and <persName>George Bertram
              Ross</persName>, 35, of the same address, brothers, both described as general
            merchants, were charged, on remand, with conspiring together to obtain by false
            pretences, between Nov. 13, 1901, and May 17, 1904, valuable securities from such
            persons as should become shareholders in the Anglo-Egyptian Automatic Trading Co.
            (Ltd.), and, in pursuance thereof, unlawfully obtaining on April 1, 1903, a cheque for
            £525 from <persName>Mr. J. G. Prentice</persName> Stewart Ross was further charged with
            obtain- ing, on June 16, 1903, from <persName>Mr. J. B. Champ- neys</persName> a cheque
            for £648 7s. 6d, with intent to defraud.</p>
          <p><persName>Mr. Graham Campbell</persName> appeared for the Director of Public
            Prosecutions; and <persName>Mr. Biron</persName> barrister, defended.</p>
          <p><persName>Mr. Campbell</persName> said the two defendants and a <persName>Mr. J. Tweedy
              Scott</persName> were the directors of the Anglo- Egyptian Automatic Trading Co.
            (Ltd.), which was registered on Nov. 13, 1901, with a nominal capital ol £15,000 in £1
            shares. <persName>George Ross</persName> was also the first managing direc- tor of the
            company, whose objects were to manufacture, buy or sell, and use automatic machines for
            the sale of goods. Its registered premises were first at 4s, Upper Tusmes-street, and
            afterwards at 109, Queen Victoria-street. The company entered into an agreement with
              <persName>Stewart Ross</persName> to buy certain property for the purposes of its
            undertaking, and for this he was to receive 12,500 shares in the company.
              <persName>Stewart Ross</persName> was appointed chairman, and his brother secretary
            pro tem, and at the first meeting of the board the agreement to pur- chase the property
            from <persName>Stewart Ross</persName> was sanctioned. As a matter of fact, prior to
            November, 1901, the liquidator of another company, with whom the defendants had been
            connected, had sold to a firm at <placeName>King's- cross</placeName> some tons of
            automatic machines and portions of machines at the price of scrap- iron and those were
            afterwards sold for £145 to <persName>Stewart Ross</persName>. This was the property
            which <persName>Stewart Ross</persName> subsequently sold to the company, the books of
            which did not show that any business had been done or that any profits had been made.
            The company's shares ware allotted in December, 1901, <persName>Stewart Ross</persName>
            receiving about 14,000, which were described as £1 paid. No cash, however, was paid for
            them. The next step was to dispose of these shares, and there could be no doubt that in
            the early part of 1903 he was disposing of large numbers of shares to the public at con-
            siderable premiums. The premium was £1 7s 6d per snare, making about £11,000 in all, and
            it was even being represented by Stewart Row, when he was inducing others to buy these
            shares, that they were changing hands at from £2 to £2 10s. each. <persName>Mr. J.G.
              Prentice</persName>, a marine insurance agent of <placeName>Liverpool</placeName>, and
              <persName>Mr. J.E. Champneys</persName>, shipowner, of 27, Hans- place, W., having had
            representations made to them as to the value of the company's business
              —<persName>Stewart Ross</persName>, in writing to <persName>Mr. Prentice</persName>,
            having advised him not to miss such a "golden opportunity "—and believing that the
            company was to be taken over by another concern at a considerable profit, invested in
            shares to the extent of: <persName>Mr. Prentice</persName>, £525 17s 6d. ; and
              <persName>Mr. Champneys</persName>, £648 7s 6d. Neither of them knew, of course, that
            the shares they purchased were portions of the ven- dor's shares allotted to
              <persName>Stewart Ross</persName>. The Anglo-Egyptian Company promoted the British and
            Colonial Automatic Trading Co. (Ltd.) in June 1903, which was to take over the former
            and other firms' businesses, at £12,000 in cash and £40,000 in shares, but this company
            was wound up in about eight months, and no portion of cash or shares—even if they were
            taken up—went to the Official Receiver. The Anglo-Egyptian Company was subsequently also
            wound up, the liabilities to unsecured creditors being set down at £7,162.</p>
          <p>Evidence in support of the charge having been given, the accused were remanded till
            Jan. 17, bail being accepted for <persName>Stewart Ross</persName> in £700 and
              <persName>George Ross</persName> in £500.</p>
          <p>Bail for both prisoners was immediately forthcoming.</p>

          <head>OUR PARIS LETTER.</head>
          <p>(From our Correspondent.)</p>
          <p><placeName>Paris</placeName>, December 23.</p>
          <p>The Parisians go about spiriting for Christ- mas and New Year with a somewhat heavy-
            hearted gaiety. As with all impressionable people, the fit, either of exhilaration or
            de- pression, is severe while it lasts. For the moment the depression is uppermost. At
            no period during the past few years has there been so much talk of military preparation
            as at the present moment. The more serious journals preserve a reticence of language and
            do not treat directly of the affair ; but columns are devoted to the question of
            national defence. In the lesser prints the issue is plainly stated with details of an
            alarming character. One of the evening newspapers, for instance, declares that a deputy
            for Nancy drew the attention of <persName>M. Etienne</persName>,the Minister of War,to
            the defence- less state of the capital of French Lorraine, in view of an invasion, and
            prayed for rein- forcements. The Minister replied that he fully shared the anxieties of
            the inhabitants, but he was unable to gratify their wishes. “If I increase the
            garrison," he said, "it would be interpreted as an act of war and would be responded to
            by an instant march across the frontier." An unfortunate factor in the situa- tion is
            that, whilst the greatest liberty exists in France for the printing of the movements of
            troops, the German Government allows no essential secret to escape from the argus-edye
            censor.</p>
          <p>Fears for the situation abroad consort ill with natural preoccupations for the
            situation at home. Parliament is no longer sitting, and a portion of the country is in
            the throes of elec- tion preparations. One hundred Senators will be returned to the
            Upper House in the first week in January. From the political com- plexion of those
            Republican Lords may doubt- less be gauged the political temper of the country.
            Patriotism belongs to no party exclusively, but the fighting spirit or the pacific
            spirit will probably be sufficiently indi- cated by these hundred new Senators. One
            should be able to draw some significant con- clusions as to the voting of the National
            Assembly in the latter weeks of January. Rarely has a Presidential election been invest-
            ed with such interest for the outside world.</p>
          <p>The younger generation and the Army itself are convinced that war cannot be avoided.
            They argue that the Conference can only increase the irritation already existing between
            the two nations. <placeName>France</placeName> will not yield one particle of her rights
            nor the neighbour one jot or tittle of her pretensions. The only issue, therefore, is an
            armed issue. Thus the young men I was witness yesterday of a curious scene very eloquent
            of the present temper of the nation. A large party sat at a luncheon table in a
            well-known club. In the midst of conversation one of the number, a very learned and
            cultured man, though hopelessly out of touch with everyday affairs, advanced the theory
            that <placeName>Germany</placeName> had a certain amount of right on her side.
            Instantly, the table was in a flame. There was a shout of indignation fron the younger
            men, and two elderly gentlemen arose and pointed a finger of scorn at the
            anti-patriot.</p>
          <p>In the absence of precise information at this moment, it is supposed that
              <placeName>Germany</placeName> will declare <placeName>Madrid</placeName> to be too
            distant from <placeName>Morocco</placeName> to answer the purposes of a Conference.
            More- over, it is estimated that this new difficulty will give the vacillating Sultan
            another op- portunity of showing his talents for procrasti- nation. The doubts as to the
            attitude of England are not entirely based on a disbelief in the effective support of
            the new Govern- ment ; they reside in an appreciation of the historical reluctance of
            England to under- take experiments not absolutely connected with her self preservation.
            I was arguing the point the other day with a distinguished student of foreign politics
            when he remarked : "We are so apt to forget that <placeName>Great Britain</placeName> is
            an island. It should not be forgotten, however. It is so easy for <persName>John
              Bull</persName> to retire to his island and look dispassionately upon European
            complications." These words have an ungracious sound, but I believe they re- present a
            widespread opinion. According to these critics, the British policy has often been with
            this country to a certain point, and then has turned at a critical moment in another di-
            rection. The Mexican campaign and the Franco-German war are supposed to be exam- ples of
            this disconnected friendship. Not to put too fine a point upon it, it is believed that
            the foreign policy, irrespective of the colour of the home administration for the time
            being, is founded upon immutable doctrines of self-interest. It will need much firmness
            of the British representatives at the Confe- rence (if ever it takes place) to dissipate
            this idea.</p>
          <p>Information of a most reliable character would lead one to suppose that the French army
            has never, since the days of Napoleon, approached a greater state of efficiency than at
            this moment. If there is a weakness on the purely military side, it is to be found in
            the high commands; the young school of officers, however, is, technically, the equal of
            the Teu- tonic etat-major. And yeti the conviction re- mains that, notwithstanding the
            preparedness and notwithstanding the martial ardour of the moment, this nation would, in
            its highest expression, feel itself unequally matched. It is for this reason that I
            refuse to believe in the imminence of war. If supreme pressure comes, it it to be
            foreseen that <placeName>France</placeName> will again resort to tactics of
            conciliation. That is to suppose that the authorities in the State are conscious of an
            essential inferiority. In what direction may we look for it? I do not know whether it
            resides in the Commissariat or in some other department, but if I have correctly
            surmised, then war is relegated to some distant date when the defect, whatever it is,
            has been successfully remedied.</p>
          <p>As to the conference it is worth noting that many people here think that for many
            reasons it would be preferable that there were no Con- ference at all; on the other
            hand, exactly the same conditions and exactly the same danger would exist as before the
            opening of the present period of diplomatic tension between France and
              <placeName>Germany</placeName>. The work of Peaceful Penetra- tion in
              <placeName>Morocco</placeName> is at a standstill, and yet such condition of things
            cannot last indefinitely without doing great prejudice to French in- terests in
              <placeName>Algeria</placeName>. The position which allowed the turbulent Moorish
            tribes to commit acts of brigandage on the frontier must be im- proved by bringing
            organised pressure to bear upon the Sultan, unlees France is prepared to see anarchy in
            her own possessions. “To be or not to be," is the question that confronts the Gallic
            Hamlet with as much disquieting force as Shakspeare's Prince of
              <placeName>Denmark</placeName>.</p>
          <p>Out of evil, good. One remarkable feature of the crisis is the unity of national
            sentiment. The sitting of the Chamber of Deputies on Saturday last afforded an example.
            All parties sank their differences in face of the interna- tional position. <persName>M.
              Ribot</persName>, who generally bores the House with pious platitudes, sounded the
            true national note when he said that his party would stand by the Government. His speech
            was applauded by the greater part of the assembly and even those sitting under the wing
            of <persName>M. Juares</persName> expressed a vehement approval. <persName>M.
              Juares</persName>, who a few months ago was the great god of the Extreme Left, ant who
            even swayed the votes of the Left and Left Centre, was cried down when he chose this
            moment to tarn on a current of interna- tionalism. It is for this reason that I regard
            the closing debate of the extraordinary Session of 1905 as one of the most significant
            in the recent history of the French Parliament, and as denoting the renaissance of
            French pa- triotism.</p>
          <p>This morning I had a conversation with a leading official of one of the great railways
            here. I was hardly prepared for his pessimism. His outlook was most gloomy. “I see," he
            said, “most of the conditions prevailing to-day that were existing before the war. There
            is an immense amount of spying being done. Let me take one example. Out of fifteen
            thousand working tailors employed in <placeName>Paris</placeName>, thirteen thousand are
            foreigners, that is to say, persons capable of giving information to an enemy. I think
            in the present prevalence of strikes in France we must see the hand of the trans- Rhenal
            Power. An attempt, too, has been made to tamper with public opinion through, as I
            believe, the bribery of some organs of the Press. Again, the trend oi legislation has
            been most unfortunate, recalling the abortive efforts of <persName>Marshal
              Niel</persName> to reorganise the army in 1869 -efforts that were entirely baulked, in
            my opinion, by outside influences. Is not the two years' service a most deplorable piece
            of work in face of the actoal conditions? One might suppose it to have been
            inspired—though I am sure unconsciously—by a certain monarch whose curious instability
            of temperament constitutes the real danger of the situation."</p>
          <p>One of the best-known English politicians abroad is <persName>Lord Rosebery</persName>.
            He is a familiar figure to Paris—less in recent years than in days agone. He stays for
            the moment at the Hotel Bristol. The Fourth Estate, as is its wont, has sought to
            interview the great man on the politics of the hour ; but his lordship has passed on
            with a gracious "coup de chapeau," leaving the sharpened pencil and the notebook bereft
            of their prey. Lord Rosebery is one of the few Englishmen belong- ing to the Jockey
            Club, where he is an appre- ciated visitor. It is the most exclusive institution in
            Paris, and counts among its members the King of England. Another politician to interest
            the Parisians is un- doubtedly <persName>John Burns</persName>. The Socialist writers in
            the Press hail his advent to the Ministry with a simple-hearted joy. They delight in the
            details of his costume: the “ reefer " suit, the bowler hat, and they wonder in their
            innocence whether it will be proof against the salary of his new position. Some suggest
            that his ideas will change when the short jacket lengthens to the frock coat.</p>
          <p>France has seen seven presidential elections since 1870, and an eighth will take place
            on January 18, when <persName>M. Loubet</persName> lays down the cares of an exalted
            office which none, perhaps, of his predecessors has so much adorned. The proximity of an
            event so important in the do- mestic history of a nation linked to
              <placeName>England</placeName> by close bonds of friendship may invest with a certain
            passing interest the results of previous presidential elections. In 1873
              <persName>Marshal Mac- Mahon</persName>’s majority was 196 ; that of <persName>M.
              Grevy</persName> six years later was 335 ; and on his re-election in 1885, 289. In
            1887, <persName>M. Grevy</persName> having re- tired as the sequel to the scandals
            connected with the name of his son-in-law, <persName>M. Carnot</persName> was elected by
            a majority of 414, after two ballots. <persName>M. Casimir-Perier</persName>'s majority
            in 1894 was 423— the largest majority recorded, and when, a year later, <persName>M.
              Casimir-Perier</persName> retired, in disgust with faction intrigues, <persName>M.
              Felix Faure</persName> succeeded him with a majority of 401. <persName>M.
              Loubet</persName>’s majority in 1899 was 407.</p>
          <p>Cayenne, long a name of terror to the most hardened of French criminals, will be so no
            longer. Its days as a penal settlement are well nigh over, though it is far from clear
            that the measures proposed may not raise difficulties of another kind in another
            quarter. It has been definitely settled that <placeName>Cayenne</placeName>, on account
            of its terrible climate, shall be used as a penal colony no longer. But France is far
            from renouncing such colonies. A mis- sion, with the ex-director of the penitentiary of
              <placeName>French Guiana</placeName> at its bead, has left for the French possessions
            in <placeName>Oceania</placeName> to study the most suitable site for establishing new
            convict prisons. It is to be feared that the voice of Australia will make itself heard
            should this project be realised.</p>

          <p><placeName>London</placeName>, December 22.</p>
          <p><persName>Lieutenant C. L. Smith</persName>, 2nd Battalion Cornwall Light Infantry,
            Gibraltar, who has just been formally seconded for service with the Egyptian Army,
            earned the little cross “For Valour" on that rad day at <placeName>Jidballi</placeName>,
            when our forces were crumpled up by the spear- men of the not so mad Mullah.
              <persName>Lieutenant Smith</persName>, in the heat of the fight picked up the badly
            wounded hospital orderly, in conjunction with <persName>Lieutenant Welland</persName>,
            of the R.A.M.C., but the native was killed before this could be effected, and in
            retiring <persName>Lieutenant Welland</persName> was daugoronaly wounded. The brave
              <persName>Smith</persName> did all that mortal man could to bring his brother officer
            to safety, and mounted him on a horse and a mule in succession. Both mounts were killed
            and finally <persName>Dr. Welland</persName> was spear- ed. How <persName>Lieutenant
              Smith</persName>, who stood by his friend to the last, escaped, was a marvel, but he
            did so and had the honor of receiving the V.C. in recognition of his gallantry.</p>
          <p><persName>Major H. Jellacorse</persName>, Royal Sussex Regiment, who for the past five
            years was adjutant of the 1st Volunteer Battalion, <placeName>Brighton</placeName>, has
            taken his retired pay after nineteen years’ service. The vacant majority should go to
              <persName>Captain J. F. P. Langdon</persName>, 2nd Battalion,
              <placeName>Crete</placeName>, and the company will either be absorbed or go in the 1st
            Battalion at <placeName>Umballa</placeName>. It is hardly likely that an outside officer
            will be brought in, as the regiment has had two or three brought in in recent years.</p>
          <p>The Army Council has ruled that men of the Royal Garrison Artillery serving on the
            three years' enlistment engagement or who have extended their service eight years whilst
            on service abroad, and on arriving home have still a few months to serve, may go at once
            into the Army Reserve. This is a decided concession to the gunner.</p>
          <p>The Duke of Connaught, Inspector General, has found it necessary to call the attention
            of commanding officers to the order against bang- ing the butt of the rifle on the
            ground when "ordering arms." The concussion produced by the butt striking heavily on the
            ground must affect injuriously the delicate breech mechan- ism of the magazine rifle. In
            the olden days with the Brown Bess, and in still more modern times, with the Martini
            Henry, the greater the "bang” the more smartly was the movement made and the battalion
            got credit accordingly. In fact it was impressed on the recruit that he must make his
            rifle “tell." That is all changed and no more “bang" is the word.</p>
          <p>The minimum height of the recruits of the Royal Garrison Artillery has been fixed at
            5ft. 6in., which is a return to the days when the Royal Regiment was composed of
            veritable sons of Anak.</p>
          <p>There are not wanting signs that the days of the Royal Marines are numbered. Every-
            thing points to their supersession in a com- paratively short period.</p>
          <p>It is expected that the new War Office, <placeName>Whitehall</placeName>, will be
            occupied early in the New Year, probably in February, or the beginning of March. The
            departments farthest away from the present War Office will first more into the new
            quarters.</p>

          <head>OLD EGYPTIAN SEEDS.</head>
          <p>The vitality of seeds found in Egyptian mummy cases has often been questioned and
            recently the question was again revived owing to the results of experiments reported to
            the Paris Academy of Sciences, in which the general conclusion reached was that the
            length of the vitality was greatly increased if the seeds had no watery constituents.
            Whether seeds are capable of existing in a state of suspended animation for many
            hundreds of yean, as in the reputed instances of wheat ears drawn from mummy cases, is a
            question that has never been decisively answered. An investi- gation of the subject was
            made some years ago by <persName>Mr. John Philipson</persName>. The doubt first cast
            upon the genuineness of the specimens of wheat appears to have arisen from the fact that
            some seeds taken from a mummy case in Egypt and supposed to be grains of wheat, were
            submitted to examination and determined to belong to a species of maize, an American
            plant, said to be unknown to the ancient Egyptians. This neces- sitated the belief that
            the subjects of the Pharaohs were engaged in commerce with
              <placeName>America</placeName> some three thousand years ago. It is curious, however,
            that this maize differed from the common maize in having a much narrower seed and a
            highly developed calyz-and <persName>Mr. Philipson</persName>, after reviewing all the
            evidence regarding wheat ears of indisputably ancient origin, came to the conclusion
            that in three instances the development of wheat from them was proved ; and that,
            therefore the seeds, in the extremely favorable environment of pre- servation in mummy
            cases, had retained their vitality. The wheat produced had a compound spike by which it
            is readily distinguishable from ordinary wheat. If <persName>Mr. Philipson</persName>’s
            obser- vations and deductions are to be taken as entirely trustworthy then it is
            possible that we to-day might eat bread from the grain stored by Joseph for his Egyptian
            master.</p>

          <head>NOTES ET CRITIQUES</head>
          <p>Le Cairo, 28 decembre.</p>
          <p>Les valeurs égyptienues sout signalées en reprise à Londres; la National Bank a gagné
            hier 1/4 à 25 1/4 et l'Agricole 1/8 à 9 1/8. A Paris, le Crédit Foncier a également
            haussé de 5 francs à 778.</p>
          <p>Ici, ce matin, notre marché a été relative- ment assez animé, avec de bonnes
            disposition L'Agricole, très demandée à 9 7/32, a c'ôturé à 9 1/4. La National Bank est
            négligée à 25 7/32. L’action Crédit Foncier a été traitée à 779.</p>
          <p>L'action Agricole du Nil a gagné 4 francs à 246. L’action Bourse Khédiviale du Caire a
            ouvert à £ 140 pour clôturer à 142 acheteurs.</p>
          <p>Dans le groupe des Hôtels, fortes transac- tions en Nungovich; on a ouvert à 11 1/8
            pour monter à 11 1/2 et c’ôturer à 11 7/16 ven- deurs. Les Upper Egypt ont gagné 1/16 à
            5 1/16.</p>
          <p>Parmi les petites valeurs, les New Egyptien, très recherchées, ont monté à 29 sh. 9
            pour clôturer à 29. 6. Egalement mouvementés, les Salt and Soda ont clôturé à 20. 3.
            après avoir atteint 20. 6. Par contre, les Markets ont fléchi à 24.9.</p>
          <p>Le brait court depuis hier, fort discrètement d'ailleurs, que la Société des Nungovich
            Hotels surait vendu à un groupe de capitalistes an- glais le Grand Continental
            Hotel.</p>
          <p>Cette rumeur est assurément inexacte, mais on rapporte qu’un syndicat anglais a offert
            à la Société £ 420,000 environ pour l'acquisition de cet hôtel, sut l’èmplacement duquel
            il se proposerait d’élever des galeries avec magasins et maisons de rapport.</p>
          <p>Si cette proposition à été faite, elle sera pro- bablement soumise à
            l’assemblée-générale des actionnaires qui la refuserait sans aucun doute.</p>
          <p>Le bruit avait couru à Londres, il y a quel- ques mois, que l’Egyptian Trust and
            Invest- ment avait l’intention de distribuer, vera la fin d’octobre, un dividende
            intérimaire de 5 %, Ce dividende devait être prélevé sur les bénéfices déjà réalisés par
            la Société.</p>
          <p>Or, M. Glymenopoulos fait annoncer que la loi anglaise s'oppose à ce qu'aucun dividende
            soit distribué avant la fin de l’exercice de la Société, qui fiuit le 29 mars
            prochain.</p>
          <p>Nous avons eu dernièrement l’occasion de rappeler que les statuts de l’Egyptian
            Improve- ments Corporation prévoient la clûture du premier exercioe, commencé en mai
            1905, pour le 81 décembre de l’année prochaine.</p>
          <p>Or, il se oonfirme que le oonseil d’administra- tion de cette Société a décidé de
            provoquer au plus vite la Convocation d’une Assemblée géné- rale extraordinaire après le
            règlement des comptes de fin courant, afin de proposer d’ar- rêter le premier exercice
            au 31 décembre 1905 et de fixer un dividende de 10 % sur le capital versé.</p>
          <p>On proposerait aussi à cette assemblée l'aug- mentation du capital actions dès que le
            dernier quart serait appelé, ainsi que la création d’un capital obligations, pour lequel
            la Société est déjà en pourparlers.</p>
          <p>Ces propositions sont motivées : 1. par le fait que les bénéfices réalisés à ce jour
            per- mettent aisément, en amortissant d'un seul coup le compte de premier établissement,
            d’ailleurs peu important, de distribuer le divi- dende de 10% précité, en reportant à
            nouveau une certaine somme ; 2 en ce qui concerne l’augmentation projetée du capital,
            par quel- ques grosses opérations qui se présentent dans les conditions les plus
            avantageuses pour la Société.</p>
          <p>Les cours de coton arrivent en baissé sen- sible d’Amérique. Le spot a perdu hier 15
            points, le Janvier 22 et le Mai 24. Le marché de Liverpool est également en mauvaise
            ten- dance.</p>
          <p>Suivant des télégrammes que nous recevons de New-York, la baisse serait déterminée,
            d’une part, par la nouvelle que les planteurs se préposeraient d’étendre encore leur
            acréage ; d’autre part, par le fait que l’estimation du "come into sight" pour les mois
            de janvier et février serait supérieure à celle de l’aunée dernière.</p>
          <p>Ici, le Mars a ouvert ce matin à 15 5/8 pour clôturer à 15 9/16.</p>

          <p>Plusiers personnes se plaignent du manque d'installation pour présserver du froid.
            C'est le motif, nous assuret-ou, pour lequel les specta- teurs viennent en si petit

          <p>Hier on a donné "la Poupée" charmant opéra-comique aussi bien pour le livret que pour

          <p>Mlle Lambertini y a obtenu le succès qu'elle mérite. Elle a été admirable d'entrain
            dans le rôle d'Alesia. M. de la Freydière, en Maitre Hilarius, a été fort bien,
            quoiqu'il soit mieux dans s'autre pièces, par exemple, Le Jour et la Nuit, la Périchole.
            M. Ballin a été désopilant dans le rôle de la Chanterelle. Très bien égale- ment M. La.
            Beny en Lancelot et M. Crépy en frère Maximin.</p>

            <head>BULLETIN DE LA BOURSE</head>
            <p>(Aujour d'hui à midi et demie)</p>
            <p>Nous avons assisté ce matin à une reprise d'autant plus sensationnelle qu'elle était
              moins attendue à cette époque de l’annes. Les tran- sactions ont été oonsidérables sur
              toute la ligne, mais particulièrement ou Banque Nationale, Agricole, Estates, Salt and
              Soda et Nungovich.</p>
            <p>La National Bank hausse de 25 1/4 à 25 3/8 l'Ancienne et de 24 1/2 à 24 5/8 la
              Nouvelle.</p>
            <p>Un bond subit est fait par l'Obligation Foncier de 3l7 1/2 à 325 1/2.</p>
            <p>Même remarque pour la Banque Agricole. L’Ancienne s’avance de 9 7/32 à 9 5/16 et la
              Nouvelle de 8 25/32 à 8 7/8.</p>
            <p>Pour compléter cet élan des valeurs de Ban- ques, là Cassa di Scento remonte
              subitement de 209 1/2 à 213 1/2 et de 205 1/2 à 210 1/4.</p>
            <p>Après une baisse momentanée hier à 16 1/8, la Daira Sanieh remonte aujourd’hui à 17
              1/16 acheteurs.</p>
            <p>Les Estates, stationnaires depuis quelque temps à 1 15/32, viennent de se réveiller à
              1 17/32 acheteurs également.</p>
            <p>Parmi nos valeurs commerciales et indus- trielles plusieurs regagnent aussi du
              terrain: la Crown Brewery repreud de 205 à 206, les Markets de 25/6 à 26 et la Salt
              &amp;Soda de 20/3 à 21/3.</p>
            <p>La Nungovich continue son mouvement ascensionnel et atteint 11 1/2 acheteurs.</p>
            <p>Par oontre, l’Alexandria Water recule de 14 3/8 à 14 1/8 et la Banque d’A'thènes de
              131 à 130.</p>
            <p>La tendance générale de notre marché est excellente. Beaucoup croient que nous sommes
              au début de la grande hausse qui se produit au commencement de chaque année. Dabs ce
              cas nous serious en avance de 3 semaines sur le années précédentes.</p>

              <head>GERMAN BANKS IN THE LEVANT.</head>
              <p>“<persName>Herr von Streit</persName>, the Director-General of the Greek-National
                Bank, has made a declaration,” writes the <placeName>Athens</placeName>
                correspondent of the Frank- furter Zeitung, "concerning the changes that are to be
                expected in the recently founded Banque d’Orient on the creation of the new
                Deutsche-Orientbank. ‘The Greek National Bank,’ says <persName>Herr von
                  Streit</persName>, 'only concurred in the foundation of the Banque d’Orient in
                order to put an end to the entire interruption of busi- ness relations with
                  <placeName>Germany</placeName> that had been caused by the State bankruptcy and at
                the same time to see itself side by side with the bank of a powerful nation in
                  <placeName>Turkey</placeName>.’ Perfect equality in business relations was
                established between the two banks at the time the company was formed, but only on
                receiving the assurance that the Greek element should have the preponderance in the
                conduct and direction of business transactions. Difficulties arose, however, from
                the action of the Nationalbank für Deutsch- land in seeking to influence the
                selection of the personnel of the governing board, and so interfering with the unity
                and promptitude of its action, and that in the interest of the German element—a
                course of action which the Greek National Bank naturally opposed."</p>
              <p>The solution of the difficulty now proposed is that the Banque d'Orient should be
                left entirely to the management ot the Athenian Board, on whish Greek preponderance
                should be assured. The Banque d'Orient would retain its branches in
                  <placeName>Smyrna</placeName>, <placeName>Salonica</placeName>,
                  <placeName>Alexandria</placeName>, and <placeName>Cairo</placeName>, while the
                branches in <placeName>Constantinople</placeName> and <placeName>Hamburg</placeName>
                would be handed over to the Nationalbank für Deutschland for further cession to the
                Deutsche Orientbank.</p>

          <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the accompany-
            ing description of some of the many interesting routes by which they may travel
            homewards. Great care had been taken to arrange them as accurately and concisely as
            possible, and it will be found that none of them are fraught with difficulty. In
            Choosing the route home there are several things to be considered. To there are several
            things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate between Egypt
            and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>
          <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave <placeName>Egypt</placeName>, for
              <placeName>Cairo</placeName> in January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and
            possibly not so warm as <placeName>Sicily</placeName>, but in March it will be warmer
            than <placeName>Rome</placeName>, and more uni- formly warm than many other places in
            Europe. Many people leave <placeName>Egypt</placeName> far too early in the year; for as
            a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest place to go to on leaving
            Egypt is <placeName>Sicily</placeName>.</p>
          <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at sea, and we
            therefore subjoin a list showing the time oc- cupied on each of the various routes
            between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>
          <p>They are as follows :-</p>
          <p>The long sea routes-from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southampton, London or
            Liverpool-occupy about 14 days. The short ones are as follows:-</p>
          <p>Port Said or ALexandria to Brindisi 3 days Alexandria to Messina... ... ... 3 " Port

          <p>The steamers, of the P. &amp;0. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageries Mari times
            are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines are also excellent, and
            their steamers are largely patronised by travellers to Egypt.</p>
          <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria, without
            change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made without change in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
          <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and Westcott
            lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant line has also good
            steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
          <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by P. &amp;O. Brindisi
            express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste-Vienna express from
            Alexandria.</p>
          <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage is allowed
            free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and responsible forwarding
            agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to deliver packages to any address in
            Europe.</p>
          <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the fast Mail
            Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis" to <placeName>Brindisi</placeName>. One of these leaves
              <placeName>Port Said</placeName> every week, as soon as possible after receiving the
            Indian mails from the great liner arrived from <placeName>Bombay</placeName>.</p>
          <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and attain a very
            high rate of speed. They are called the "ferry boats," having been specially built to
            carry the British mail from <placeName>Port Said</placeName> to
              <placeName>Brindisi</placeName>. If you are going straight through to England you will
            find the train waiting at <placeName>Brindisi</placeName> which will take you to
              <placeName>Calais</placeName> without changing. It has complete arrangements for
            sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in <placeName>London</placeName> on
            the fifth day from leaving <placeName>Port Said</placeName>.</p>

          <head>SICILY.</head>
          <p>The direct route to <placeName>Sicily</placeName> is by the Florio- Rubattino Co.'s
            steamers which leave <placeName>Alex- andria</placeName> weekly for
              <placeName>MESSINA</placeName>, where one takes train to
              <placeName>TAORMINA</placeName>, one of the most charm- ing and popular places on the
            island. <placeName>Giardini</placeName> is the station at which to alight, and the drive
            up to <placeName>Taormina</placeName> is most delightful, occupying about one hour. In
            and around the town is much to interest the visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but
            restored under the Romans. <placeName>CATANIA</placeName> is the starting place for the
            ascent of <placeName>Etna</placeName> and here also is a fine Cathedral. The Greek,
            Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all over the island, are an endless sources
            of pleasure. <placeName>SYRACUSE</placeName> has an interesting history, having been a
            Greek city, which was designed by <persName>Demostheues</persName> in B.C. 413, and
            taken by the Romans in b.c. 212, when Archimedes was slain in his tomb is to be seen.
            The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. <placeName>PALERMO</placeName>, with
            about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a delightful
            climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The Polazzo Reale is of
            Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S Giovannia degli Eremiti with its
            picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal
            Park are also worth a visit.</p>
          <p>CENTRAL ITALY.</p>
          <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave <placeName>Alexandria</placeName>
            every Wednesday during the season for <placeName>Naples</placeName>, the voyage being
            only 3 days.</p>
          <p><placeName>NAPLES</placeName> is also reached in 10 hours from
              <placeName>Palermo</placeName> by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steam- ers, which leave
            daily. One cannot approach <placeName>Naples</placeName> or leave it without wishing to
            explore some of its island, besides the lovely places on its Bay—
              <placeName>Castellamare</placeName> and <placeName>Sorrento</placeName>. The small
            steamer that takes you to <placeName>Sorrento</placeName> [you can drive too] will take
            you on to <placeName>Capri</placeName>.</p>
          <p>From <placeName>Naples</placeName> to <placeName>ROME</placeName> is a train journey of
            but five hours. All who can will devote at least one week to visiting the many
            historical and interesting portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are
            too well-known to need comment here.</p>
          <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours brings you
            to <placeName>FLORENCE</placeName>, where another week can well be spent admiring the
            City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In <placeName>Florence</placeName> itself
            the churches and galleries are of absorbing inte- rest, whilst the local promenades and
            excur- sions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and fashionable
            promenade in <placeName>Florence</placeName>, whilst the <placeName>Viale dei
              Colli</placeName>, one of the finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes
            winding up through the hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion
            outside <placeName>Florence</placeName> is that to Vallom- brosa; with its Monastery
            3,300 feet above the sea level. This is made first by ordinary train from
              <placeName>Florence</placeName> to <placeName>St. Ellero</placeName>, thence by cog-
            wheel railway to <placeName>Saltino</placeName>. The ascent through groves of oaks takes
            an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
          <p><placeName>PISA</placeName> is easily reached from <placeName>Florence</placeName> in
            about 2 hours ; here there is a fine Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least
            one night should if possible be made, in order to enjoy the view from the
              <placeName>Campanile</placeName> at sunset.</p>
          <p><placeName>VIAREGGIO</placeName>. One of the most delightful places on the Italian
            Riviera near <placeName>Pisa</placeName> and on the main line from
              <placeName>Rome</placeName> to <placeName>Genoa</placeName>. It is a very convenient
            half-way house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air and
            surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

          <head>NORTHERN ITALY</head>
          <p><placeName>GENOA</placeName> (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in
            Italy, with the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and
            a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and deliciously cool breezes from the
            surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
          <p>The patriarchal home of Italy’s most an- eient nobility, whose palaces, gardens, and
            famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a constant delight to
            thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa. Then there are the superbly
            decorated medie- val churches containing exquisite marble columns and historical
            paintings, and the in- comparable Campo Santo filled with its won- derful tombs.</p>
          <p>From <placeName>Genoa</placeName> to <placeName>Milan</placeName> is a matter of only
            three hours by rail.</p>
          <p><placeName>MILAN</placeName> is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour
            of the Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
            illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monu- mental cemetery
            are also worth a visit.</p>
          <p>Between <placeName>Bologna</placeName> and <placeName>Milan</placeName> and only an
            hour and-a-half from <placeName>Milan</placeName> is <placeName>SALSOMAG-
              GIORE</placeName>, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal springs, change
            trains at <placeName>Borgo San Domingo</placeName> and in half-an-hour you are at
              <placeName>Salsomaggiore</placeName>.</p>
          <p>NORTHERN ITALY (continued) and The ITALIAN LAKES.</p>
          <p><placeName>VENICE</placeName> is a 5 hours journey by rail from
              <placeName>Milan</placeName>, and one of the most delightful places imaginable to pass
            a quiet stay. The total absence of vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange; no
            horse, cart, carriage or bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at
            every turn. The approach to <placeName>Venice</placeName> from the Adriatic is unlike
            that of any other sea- port. The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the
            sea, no hills behind, no stretches of rock, but the first the tops of <placeName>Cam-
              paniles</placeName> appear above the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town
            rises like a fairy mirage out of the calm lagoon.</p>
          <p>Going northwards from <placeName>Milan</placeName> you make the tour of the beautiful
            Italian lakes.</p>

            one-and-a-quarter hours by train by way of <placeName>Monza</placeName>.</p>
          <p>Boats leave <placeName>Como</placeName> frequently for the other towns on the lake,
            which is very beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
            enchanting. <placeName>CERNOBBIO</placeName> is a charming spot; then come
              <placeName>Tremezzo</placeName>, <placeName>Cadenabbia</placeName>, and
              <placeName>Menaggio</placeName> with the prettily-situated town of
              <placeName>Bellaggio</placeName> opposite. The walk from
              <placeName>Tremezzo</placeName> along the shore of the lake to
              <placeName>Managgio</placeName> is most enjoyable. A steam tram runs from
              <placeName>Menaggio</placeName> to <placeName>Porlezza</placeName> on <placeName>Lake
              Lugano</placeName> in three-quarters of an hour, then steamer to
