                    <head>AMENDMENT OF COMPANY LAW</head>
                    <p>The considerable number of companies re-gistered in London or entitled
                        “Limited” but registered as english companies doing business in Egypt, makes
                        the recent report of the Com pany Law Amendment Committee of some interest
                        to our readers. This oommittee, under t he able presidency of Sir R obert
                        Reid.G.C.M G., K.C., M.P., consisted mainly of a most excel lent selection
                        of business men and their report is a model of brevi y and common sense. The
                        reference mads to the oommittee was under four heads, aad we propose to deal
                        with the first bead ou this occasion, i.e., “The growing praotioe of issuing
                        companies without a pro¬spectus.” This praotice is one of quite roceut
                        origin and is to a large extent the natural remit of the stringency of the
                        provisions of the Aot of 19S0 by which the liability of directors was
                        largely increased and, as gene¬rally interpreted, prohibited the- payment of
                        underwriting commission even if disolosed in the prospectos by the vendors
                        out of the consideration money r» ceived. </p>
                    <p>There is no douWPthat the Act of 19C0 has had the effeot of preventing the
                        beet men from becoming company dirieotors, and on the other hand has been
                        the means of throwing these important appointments into the hands of those
                        who are ready to run a certain amount of risk to gain the salary involved
                        and are<cb n="6"/> certainly not the most desirable class of men To meet
                        this point the committee reoommend “giving power to the Court to relieve any
                        director or promotor from liability for breaoh of any duty imposed on him by
                        the Companies Acts 1862 to 1900 provided (i) that the breach bas been
                        occasioned by honest oversight, inadvertence, or error of judgment on his
                        part,” and (ii) bygiving the Coort power in an action for negljgenoe as
                        breaoh of trost against a dlreotor to relieve him from his liability on snob
                        terms as the Coart may oon- sider proper where the Coort is satisfied that
                        he has acted honestly and reasonably. </p>
                    <p> such an amendment as this shodld relieve any right-minded man from any fear
                        so Jong aa he does not make himself wittingly parly to fraud or unreasonable
                        neglect and would, we think,have the resalt of attracting the beet class of
                        business men. The act of 1900 assumed a large number of fraudulent,ohm
                        pahies, and the Aot was bated on tbisESaomption; and the Committee express
                        their opinion, no donbt'correctly, that the nombsr of such companies is
                        small. By their reootnmeodt- tiou the penalties for deliberate fraud will
                        not be diminished, but they do think it ‘ both tafe and wise” to prevent
                        snoh provisions, operating unfairly. </p>
                    <p> As regards the payment hf underwriting commission, the committee Wisely
                        recommend that therd should be no objection to a vendor, promoter, or other
                        person who receives money or shares from a oompany applying any part in
                        payment of commission for subscribing or underwriting shares provided full
                        disclosure is made, as io the case of the oompany itself. </p>
                    <p> As it was a general praotioe for the vendors to pay niderwriting oommission
                        this will come as a great relief and wilrno doubt tend to inorease
                        enterprise and deter the making of prospeotns-lees companies." The committee
                        logically point out that the issue of shares with an underwriting commission
                        paid by the company is only the issue of shares at a disoount in other
                        words? and reoommend the legalizing of the issue of shares of companies who
                        have had\year or more trading at a dis¬ject of opuree to fall disclosure and
                        ' oount, subject registration. </p>
                    <p> How wise such a provision as this would be is patent to any man who has any
                        experience of public trading companies. Take; a more ordinary case a oompany
                        is working with all its oapital employe! in a lucrative business ; new
                        processes and improvements, for which they have not the capital to " go in,”
                        largely increase competition, shares go below par, so the company
                        cannotJjsoe more shares to enable it to meet competition Inputting down new
                        processes, and the whole of the share¬holders’ capital is gradually
                        lost.</p>
                    <p> Furthermore, as at the present many com-panies’ shares fall below par when
                        the com-panies are paying good dividends and are in fact intrinsically worth
                        far over par, the issue of new shares even at a disoount uny be a very
                        excellent thing for the business as well as for the shareholders who will
                        have a prior right, if the amendment recommended be oarried out, to
                        subscribe for them. By these removals of unnecessary restrictions, which
                        (together with the increased duty) have result¬ed in compelling promoters to
                        resort to other means of getting capital of which the pro¬spectus-less
                        oompany is only one,the oommittee propose to prevent the continued falling
                        off in the creation of “Limited” oimpauies which may been so oonspicaoui in
                        reoent years, and which has undoubtedly resulted in decreased enter¬prise
                        and the construction of companies under the laws of other oountries which
                        would other-wise have been British.</p>
                    <p> But to effect a radical change all there amendments will prove inadequate
                        unless the stamp duty imposed of 5s. per £100 of nominal oapital be largely
                        reduced The larger cash payment which has to be advanoed on the chance of
                        the success of the issue has undoubt-edly been a bar to many au enterprise,
                        and in rocommendieg its reduction by at least half the committee are no
                        doubt well advised.</p>
                    <p> It is somewhat strange that in summing up their reasons by which they
                        endeavour to account for the enormous falling off in regi stratiocs of
                        oompanies from a maximumin 1896 £285 millions to a minimum of £83 millions
                        l901 it should not have ocourred to them that there is naturally a limit to
                        the number of large industrial c oncerns which were for¬merly in private
                        hands and which have now been alnrost entirely turned into Limited
                        jompanies, and that this conversion, having once taken place, could not be
                        expected to be-come perennial.</p>

                        serious danger was imminent, but Great Britain must show that she has the
                        will and the power to maintain her position in Egypt, and the British

                    <p>WORST FORM OF THE DISEASE.</p>
                    <p>Ii comparison with 1904 there was a con¬siderable diminution in the number of
                        oases of plague in Egypt last year, says the report of thp Public Health
                        Department. </p>
                    <p> The number of/cnes brought to their notice dariug 19n5 amounted to 266. of
                        whiob 181 termioatedh with fatal results, the. remainder recovering; in IdO1
                        the number of oases amount¬ed to 855, with 501 deaths. </p>
                    <p>Many of the towns of Egypt in which there was a serious outbreak of Jhe
                        disease during 1904 remained entirely free from it daring 1905. The town in
                        which the largest number of cases occurred daring 1905 was Alexandria, hjch
                        famished 127 cases with 87 deaths, twenty-five of these, with six'deaths,
                        occurring among Europea fas and the remainder among the native population.
                        Only two eases were reported in towns south of Cairo. „ . </p>
                    <p>Plague has persisted io Alexandria each year since 1899,, when the first
                        cases were discovered here* It is the only town in which a system of
                        drainage exists, and many of the drains are in a very dilapidated oondition
                        and infested with rats; this may be one* of the reasons which account for
                        the persistence of the disease at Alexandria, as .from the
                        ex¬perience.gained by the department they find that the infected rat is the
                        oause of the disease remaining endemic in a town, but the epidejnie form of
                        the disease is caused by theiufeoted human being. </p>
                    <p>There seems no donbt that the disease in the simple bnbonio form is
                        frequently contrac¬ted by human beings trom rats either by handling'thie rat
                        itself or becoming infected by the,ficcal matter or nrine from an iufeoted
                        rat. These simple, bubonic cases may go on to suppuration and ultimate
                        recovery without* causing any farther spread of the disease, bat some of
                        these simple cases develop the disease in the septiemmio or pneumonic form,
                        when they become highly dangerous and oapable of disseminating the disease
                        among all persons approaching them. For this reason it is of the greatest
                        importance to isolate all oases of simple bnbonio plague as it is impossible
                        to foresee whether this or that case will not develop the more dangerous
                        form of the disease, and in the event of it doing so the necessary,
                        precautions in an isolation hospital oa^be taken to prevent it spreading the
                        disease to others. </p>
                    <p>In some of the towns ot Upper Egypt where we have not had any notification of
                        the disease before, one pr two pneumonic cases have occur¬red *’ continues
                        the report, “the disease has rapidly spretd among the inmates of the -house
                        where the case Ins ^occurred and among the neighbours who have visited the
                        ease or atten¬ded the funerals ; in some cases whole families have b?en
                        wiped ont by the disease in a few days. There is no donbt that in many
                        instances in these villages a simple bubonic case has oooarred which has not
                        been notified, and having developed a more serious aud infectious form of
                        the disease hab been the cause of spreading it in an epidemio form ; in
                        other instances a case of septica?mio plague has escaped from an infected
                        village and carried the disease to some neighbouring villages. </p>
                    <p>“In no towns where cases of simple bubonic plague have been detected at the
                        commence ment, and precautionary measures taken at once, has the disease
                        taken on an epidemic form. </p>
                    <p>“ plague, as is well known, was endemic in Egypt op to 1815. Statistics
                        showing the num¬ber of deaths notified as dne to plague in Alexandria
                        monthly from the years 1834 to 1843 being available, Lhave thought it would
                        be of interest to reprint these in order that they might be oompared with
                        the rnonthly mortality of the disease in Alexandria from 1899 to 1905. </p>
                    <p>“From 1834 cf P43 it is reasonable to sup¬pose that very few praotioal
                        measures were taken to keep the disease under oontrol; from 1899 to 1905
                        every effort has been made to isolate all cases ocoarring, and prevent the
                        spread cf the disease. </p>
                    <p>‘The population of Alexandria and its suburbs must be little short of 380,000
                        at prarcut,whereas during the’thirties and ’forties of the last century it
                        probably did not reach the fifth of this ; the general hygienio oondition of
                        the town, however, is far superior to what it was ic the early part of the
                        last century and the inhabitants in a more prosperous oondition and better
                        able to withstand an epidemio disease such as plague. </p>

                    <p> A Cairo contemporary publishes the follow¬ing remarkable story, whiob we
                        reprodnoe in extepeo. It seemB that the Capital requires to be oleate I of
                        unemployed aud unemployable Barabra even more than Alexandria, and we shonld
                        like to suggest to the Cairo polioe authorities that the sooner these
                        useless aud ill-eouditioued oreatares are removed the bet¬ter for public
                        ordor and quiet </p>
                    <p>The following is the story, which we repro duos with the necessary reserves,
                        but which is, iu ourj opinion, only, too likely to. be well fouhdda :—• </p>
                    <p>“In Atfet es Soug, a lane between the Coptic Bazaar and C|ot Bey-street,
                        there is a hashish den managed by a native, who has had fre¬quent disputes
                        with the polioe and has been several times charged with the same
                        contraven¬tion, bat Done the less oontinaes to carry on his scandalous
                        occupation. It is true that the ghaffirs and polioe of the quarter do not
                        disdain to pay oooasiopal visits to the den and ^njoy a few whiffs of1 the
                        poison that is so dear to the native. In^iAnwquenoo these good people
                        fra¬ternise and lend one another mutual aid and protection when required, as
                        was proved on Tnesday, fa propos of an inorease of the rent whi/rf?the
                        proprietor of the ofafd wished to im¬post on his tenant, who had to pay or
                        qnit The tenant (and manager of the den) accepted neither solation and
                        decided to give his land¬lord a good drubbing.- </p>
                    <p>On Taesday eveniug, at about 11 o’clock, the native, aided by four or five
                        Barabra who lived in the din, attacked the landlord—»n old European of 65
                        years of age,—palled him down,«and satisfied their ill-temper by kioking
                        him. iKfaawish who was present followed the various phases of the drama
                        without moving a muscle. The Berbereen then handed the Euro¬pean over to the
                        ghaffir, who beat him lnstily with a nabont. </p>
                    <p>A Frenchman who was passing made enqui¬ries into the cause of the attaok, but
                        being unable to obtain any explanations, and not knowing who was in the
                        right, contented him¬self with taking the nombers of the extraordi¬nary
                        shawish and the brutal ghaffir. The for¬mer bore the No. 1131, the latter
                        the No. 7. </p>
                    <p>This action on the part of the Frenchman was taken very ill by the pair. They
                        laid hands on him and showed a wish to t^re him the oaraool. He protested
                        most energetically and the onlprits, seeing that thing* might tarn out badly
                        for them, did their best to appease this inconvenient witness by the ready
                        “ma- leesh.”</p>
                    <p>Silence and order being restored, shawish atSlr ghaffir rejoined their
                        friends by the hashistrden, and while they talked with the Berbereen who had
                        beaten the old European rthey Were heard to laugh and congratulate
                        /themselvei on having given $ sound thrashing, npt to an inconvenient
                        landlord—Oh no ! — but to a * kelb Nastini.” . </p>

                    <p>Several sheds were recentlj^erected on a Unoooupied plot of land^ between the
                        Cairo station and the rae Olali by some iugenioas individuals who thought

                        explaining matters to landlords and of evading the vigilanoe of the polioe.
                        Large orowds assembled night after night as one shed after another
                        was.erected, aud the respeotable inha¬bitants of the quarter were losing

                        shouts of a crowd of low-olass Arabs, when on Wednesday night the police
                        descended apon the plaoe, drove off the orowd, demolishing the sheds, and
                        seized the hashish. </p>

                    <p> Sir Edward^Grey’s solemn warning as to the revival of fanaticism in Egypt
                        and North Africa continues to be one of the main topics of con¬versation in
                        Paris, aooording to the correspon¬dent of the “Times,” and the details given
                        by Lord Cromer in the Parliamentary paper on the Tabah incident have served
                        to bring home to French opinion the fact that the utterances of Sir Edward
                        Grey were no mere matter of Parliamentary strategy. . </p>
                    <p>The “Temps” has received a letter from Binder, the small negtfo Saltanate
                        whiob by the reoent delimitation of French and English terri¬tories has now
                        become a French possession, showing that France, too, will be wise to take
                        the Mussulman agitation serionsly. Sinder is the link between the French
                        territories of the Sudan and of the Chad, and is the terminus of the only
                        caravan road between the Sudan and Tripoli. In the snrronnding region
                        certain deplorable events have recently ooenrred ; three British officers
                        have been killed in Sokoto, two French officers have met with the same fate
                        at Niamey, and thore is some agitation in the Kanem district </p>
                    <p>These events have exoited fanatical feeling Sinder, with the result that a
                        plot was oon- oooted in which the teligions element played the leading rule,
                        and in which took part the Saltan, Malem Yaro, the rich Tripoli merchant
                        well known to travellers in the Sudan, the interpreter of the French
                        authorities, a neigh¬bouring chief, and various leading men. There a French
                        garrison at Sinder, but it was mnch depleted, the oommander even being
                        absent on toor of inspection, circumstances by which the conspirators sought
                        to profit in order to massacre the rest of the troops. The coup was take
                        place early in April. The plot was discovered and thwarted. At the moment of
                        writing the conspirators were in prison and the officer in command only
                        awaited the return of his chief to pass jadgment on thfam. </p>
                    <p>The ‘‘Temj^s,” comfaaenting or. this incident, says that mnch vigilanoe’ is
                        required in con¬nexion with the schemes attributed to the Tripolitan Tarks.
                        It is still being annoanoed that they are preparing to oooapy Janet and
                        Bilma. The “Temps” thinks that the prudent French policy would be to
                        forestall this action by plaoing French garrisons at those pointfc. We're
                        Turkish troops to put in their appearance at Bi'ma the ccnsequenoes would be
                        oarriedfar and wide along the Sudan 680 border. . </p>
                    <p>M. Engfane Lantier, writing in the “Figaro,” says that the most important
                        part of the English Parliamentary paper j st issued is that referring to the
                        growth of ffavatioism in Egypt. Had thfa^onflicji between Turkey and England
                        assumed a more serious form the Turkish troops would, it was said, 'have"
                        menaced the Suez Canal and advanced as far as Nekhl, an import¬ant strategic
                        position. It was therefore dear that Turkey had reck ined upon a rising of
                        the Egyptian Nationalists, and doubtless had reasons for doing so. In M.
                        Lantier’s opinion one of Lord Cromeris letters shows that Sir Edward Grey
                        had been guilty of no exaggera¬tion in speaking of the precautions which had
                        to be taken in Egypt The High Commissioner refuted the charges of the
                        Egyptian Opposition as to the neglect of moral progress and educa tion,
                        adding that it was necessary to reinforce the British garrison. M. Lantier
                        adds:— </p>
                    <p>If I understand him rightly, Lord Cromer considers that it is desirable to
                        show considera¬tion and to take no hasiy action, at least until the Britisfi
                        garrison in Egypt is stronger. The situation is therefore a very serious
                        one. The British Government has doubtless issued the Parliamentary paper in
                        order to enlighten pnblic opinion on the sabjeot. The docaments on the Tabah
                        incident are bat the prefaoe. The gist of the publication is to be foofad in
                        Lord Cromer’s letters. ... It is to be hoped that a few simple-minded
                        Frenchmen will not allow themselves to be take a in by the declamation of
                        certain Egyptians whose propaganda supplements that of German agents in
                        Cairo and elsewhere. Our cause is that of England, and we ooght to take
                        advan tage of Lord Cromer’s warnings. It is now obvions that if war had been
                        deolared last year we and those who would have wished to help ns wonld have
                        had to reokon with a gene¬ral revolt of our Musiulman suhj >ct9. . . . For
                        that reason all French sympathy with Egyptian nationalism is positive
                        madness. In case of a general contliot the members of that party would be a
                        tramp in the hands of Onr adversaries.” </p>
                    <p>Situation “Exiremely Sorloua^ </p>
                    <p>“The situation is extremely serious. Oar attention is attracted to it on the
                        same grounds as those of oar neighbours across the Channel, British and

                        the praotioal conclusion drawn by the from “Ganlois” what it desoribes as

                        localities ofjts own acoord. As a matter of fact, its origin is associated
                        with the Moroc¬can qnestioo. The German Emperor^in going to Tangier,
                        declared that he went to the as-sistance of the Mossolmans. Since then the
                        latter heye not ceased to reoeixe encourage¬ment from German agents, who,
                        under pretest o^xplorations, pursue and develop in Africa the vast ambitions

                    <p>The “Liberld” dwells upon the necessity that France should dxeroise dose

                        against the French and British ocou- pation, and, in view of the uncjrtainty
                        as to the origin and extent cf this reaction, it is ' essential to arsume a
                        vigorous defensive. Si-multaneously with the inoident at Sinder—a region in
                        which two French officers were recently killed, while three British officers
                        were massacred at Sokoto-an. unforeseen complication has aricen on the
                        Tripoli fron-tier. This is the rnmonr th at a Turkish co¬lumn has undertaken
                        polioing operations within the French sphere of influence. An- then tic

                        from the soath of Tunis do not permit any doubt as totheir- reality. This

                        southern frontier of Tonis,, which had necessitated an inter¬vention of the
                        French troops. Bnt, adds the “Liberty,” what is still more serious is the
                        oonviotion of all the residents and officers in the extreme south that a
                        deliberate plan, prepared in Europe, is ready to be pot into exeention. It
                        concludes by urging the adop¬tion of measures of praotioal pro den oe on the
                        French African froatier, together with a vigo¬rous protest at

                    <p>The Lesson of Tabah.</p>
                    <p>The “Sifaole,” commenting upon the reoent British Parliamentary paper on.
                        Egypt, draws “the lesson of .Tabah.” The advanoe of the Tarkibh troops to
                        Tabah was, it says, an attempt of the greatest gravity, indmating as it did
                        the tendenoy prevailing at Yild'z Kiosk, inot only with regard tb Egypt,
                        bat\lso towards the other European Powers ruling ov)Brv Mussulman subjects.
                        “It was bound to 'be regarded as sm encouragement to the/Tan- Islamib
                        propaganda, of which there" had been previous indications and which has been
                        greatly favoured for several years past, Aether intentionally or otherwise,
                        by the Ottoman polioy of William II. If England had tolerated this
                        encroachment upon the admi¬nistration of Egypt by Ahdal Hamid, the Saltan
                        would have secured a victory pregnant with immediate oomequanoee. It was to
                        he expeoted that the Turkish pretensions would soon give rise to storins
                        throoghon-t the whole Mussnlman world. Inpresenoe of the relations known to
                        exist between the German Emperor, and Abdul Hamid it could no. -be supposed
                        for an instant that the latUr had aoted with¬out the approval or, fodeed^

                        eyes to the importance of the Pan: Islamio movement in the valley of the
                        Nile and to the necessity of reinforcing the Anglo- Egyptian garrisons in
                        saoh a way as to reoder them capable of resisting all menaoes either from
                        abroad, like that of Akabah, or in the country itself in consequence of

                    <p>Referring to the letter addressed to Lord Cromer by an Egyptian stating that

                            Duma, stating that from the outset it overstepped the limits of the law,
                            it consistently discredited the Government, it attempted to usurp
                            executive newer, and it raised hipee by its agrarian programme which
                            oould not be realzed. (Reuter.)</p>

                    <p> AN INSULT TO THE KINg.</p>
                    <p> Mr. W. T. Stead’s prominence in connection with the recent visit of
                        German-editors to Great country is already producing, the reaction which
                        might have been expeoted. Unsble to resist the temptation to work his own
                        peculiar tads and shibboleths into an international exohange of courtesies
                        in which everything sectional, and still more, everything offensive to the
                        overwhelming mass ot public opinion in all sections should have been
                        scrupulously avoided, he has set up in Gormany a feeling of uneasiness which
                        may be unpleasantly felt when tfce question of a British return visit comes
                        to be considered.</p>
                    <p> It appears thst among our German guests was a lady named Fran Braun, who
                        with her husband constitutes a committee of two charged with the landable
                        enterprise of pro-moting Socialistic Republicanism in genera), and their own
                        activities in partiou^ar. These activities are embodied in a weekly joornal
                        i'wbich, as we learn from the Berlin “Conser-vative CorrespondeDz?’ has been
                        repudiated by responsible German Social Democrats, and though conntenanoed,
                        is not tolerated. Of this journal Fran Braun is co-editress.</p>
                    <p> For some reason Mr. Stead seems to have regarded Fran Braun as the most
                        important person among the German journalists who w.re recently-our guests.
                        A letter to herself in which he expressed this view, together with his
                        lessons for holding it, has been published in Germany, where it.has produced
                        precisely that disgust which might have been antici¬pated by everybody but
                        Mr. Stead.</p>
                    <p> Ever desirous of promoting international amity, the King invited the
                        visitors to lunoh at Windsor Castle. Bvon Mr. Stead oould not fail to see
                        that this gracious act was intended as ‘'an expression of the hospitality of
                        nations" but he also saw that it could be used for the mention tf the
                        application of the Greek purpose of his fad?, and he accordingly laid his
                        little scheme before Fran Braun, who, it should be premised, had expressed
                        herself as loftily above sitting at the tables of Crowded heads.</p>
                    <p> Mr. stead begged that the lady wotold waive this sentiment for the nonce, in
                        view of the party capital to be made out of the occasion. The King, he
                        urged, was only "the official head of our crowned Ropublic,” aDd theD, by
                        con¬descending to become His Majesty’s guest, Frau Braun^rould seoure the
                        recognition of two hich he and she held in common—“the sovereignty of the
                        people and the equality of womaD.” As a farther bait for feminine vanity,
                        Mr. Stead held out the pro- speot of the “far reaching ( fleet which would
                        be profound not only in England bat in other lands.”</p>
                    <p> Whether Frau Braun entertained some womanly scruple which did not trouble
                        Mr. Stead, about twisting His Majesty’s hospitable purposes into a hostile
                        republican manifesta¬tion, does not appear. Tn point of'fait,* ever.^e did
                        not kttend, but has, instead, pub¬lished his letter in Germany. Her
                        intention, doubtless, was Id demonstrate her own im¬portance. What she has
                        really done, ha? been to put Mr. Stead in the pillory before German opinion.
                        t ,</p>
                    <p> Two German daily jeornals of standing, the "Conservative Correspondent,” and
                        '’Die Post? both refer to his exposed intrigue in strong terms, and after
                        explaining to him that he seems to be as completely out of tonoh with the
                        political thought of German^' arf with that of England, both agree that when
                        British editors pay their return visit to Germany, fthe Recep¬tion Committee
                        will have to be carefully select¬ed to prevent the repetition of such
                        episodes. In short, Mr. Stead, besides insolting his Sovereign, haaoontrived
                        to convert an occasion of international goodwill into one* of suspicion.</p>

                    <p>Lord Newton asked the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs last week

                        was one which was undoubtedly grave, nor was it disputed that, so fares
                        oiroumstan- ces permitted, it was desirable for England and the other Great

                        binds in Greek.territory, and it had been poiuted out how materially the
                        diffioalties of the Powers in dealing with the Macedonian question had been

                        that they were taking renewed measures to prevent the Turoo Greek frontier
                        being cro*sod by suepeoted nersons. Ac, however, the activity of the Greek
                        bands in Macedonia had continued it was decided by the Powers to take
                        ooncerted action and on July 3rd a joint verbal representation had been made

                    <p> At the request of the Kaiser, and with the consent of Cardinal Fischer, the
                        Arohbishop of Cologne?tbe sarcophagus in which the remains of the Emperor
                        Charlemagne repose has been opened, and ^wo costly brocades in which his
                        bones were wrapped have been temporarily re¬moved, in order to be
                        photographed and de¬scribed. For some time past ProfsssOr Leming, of Berlin,
                        has, the “Telegraph's” correspondent reports, been eagagedon an exhaustive
                        treatise descriptive of anoiqpt embroideries,aud tissues, and in order to
                        make the work as complete as possible these celebrated brocades have been
                        added. One of them, probably the most ancient, is Byzantine work of heavy
                        silk, aud the colouring it still*perfeot, although it dates from the middle
                        of the twelfth century. It is worked in a pattern of ciroles, and in each '
                        ci role is an elephant. The other is of Sioilian LorigiD, dating probably
                        from the thirteenth century. It has an elaborate design of birds and beasts,

                    <p> Charlemagne’s tomb ha? been frequently opened, the first time by Friedriob
                        Barba- ro?sa, and the last in 1843. The sarcophagus, which is one of the
                        sights of the cathedral at Aachen, is covered with silver gilt, thiokly
                        strewn with precious stones. Some surprise i? expressed that the Catholic
                        authorities of the oathedral should allow the sarcophagus of a saint of the
                        Church to be opened for snch a purpose. It may be mentioned that the bone?
                        of the great Emperor, which still remain, [show him to have be a man of
                        extraordinary, size.</p>

                        oameover me, making work quite a labour. My languor was distressing. I tried
                        not to give in, and foroed myself to eat,; but had no appetite. Every
                        morning I felt positively lifeless, and I got weaker evd weaker gntil I was
                        always sfflioted with headaches and^izziness Breathless and utterly
                        exhausted, many times I have been told that I ought to have been in bed
                        instead of working at the cotton mill. My deathly pale face told of. my
                        pitiable state. A dootor attended me for some tim*», but in the end I seemed
                        wora$ than. ever. Life was all one constayt misery to me. I was going from
                        bad to worse when a friend advised me to try Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills. I
                        did, and they proved a blessing to me The effeat was a steady restora¬tion
                        to complete health, which I have ever since enjoyed. / - . • . </p>

                        very bad start on the part of Mr. MaoLaren’s XI. was only averted by the
                        oaptaio of the team, who played very good, free orioket, his off driving
                        being remarkably good. He was seventh out at 153 for a freely hit innings of
                        84, ohance- less tiH he had soored 45, after which he was let off two or.
                        three times. He hit a six and fourteen fours. Lucas hit well at the end,
                        rooring nine fours. Dawson, who bowled very pluokily after receiving a
                        severe blow in the month, bad a good analysis. On the oppos¬ing XL going in
                        Cbeesman and Hanley added 63 for the second wicket, when the latter was ran
                        oat. Shortly afterwards Cheeseman left, olean bowled for a very good innings
                        of 45. After this Mr. Dawson’s XI. never quite looked like winning, though
                        its cap¬tain, Pte/MoDonnell, and Pte. Evans all made some good hits. Two
                        more batsmen were ran ont>nd the innings closed for 158, leaving
