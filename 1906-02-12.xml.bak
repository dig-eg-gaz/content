                        Government buys Consols. The Egyptian Government baa invested about a
                        million and a half sterling in Consols and similar securities. The Egyptian
                        Govern-ment is entitled, as our reader* are aware, to a share in the profits
                        resalting from the Daira transaction. As the transaction is now nearly
                        completed, a portion of the share of the profits to which it is entitled has
                        been paid to the Government, and having no immediate use for the money, it
                        has made an investment of it as stated. There have been other large
                        purchases of consols-, and the price has moved upwards, but not as much as,

                        this morning at the British Agenoy. As we have already announoed Sir Vincent
                        is the favourite in London, and is supportel by the infiuenoe of Sir Ernest
                        Cassel and of the Lon¬don Agenoy. But some of the local Board of Directors
                        prefer another candidate, and won Id* like to see Chitty Bey, the Director
                        General of the Customs Administration, take the post. The seleotion
                        ultimately rests with the Egyptian Government which has the right of veto.
                        No final decision will be arrived at for a few days. The new governor, in
                        lien of a house, will pro¬bably have an allowance of £1,00 » per annum. The
                        board will not allow him to go in for any other outside business without
                        their express oonseut But of oourse the new gover¬nor will be ohairman of

                    <p>A PROFITABLE YEAR</p>
                    <p>ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING. The annual general meeting of the Alex andria
                        Sporting Glub was held at the Khedivial Club on Fridav evening. The stewards
                        present were Messrs. H. E. Barker, J. P. Rodooanachi, and A. 8. Preston and
                        a few members. The minutes of last year’s annual general meeting were read
                        and oonfirmed. The Hoo. Sec. laid on the table the accounts and balanoe
                        sheets for 1905 and read the following report:— Gentlemen, I have the honour
                        to lay before you the profit and loss a/o and balauoe sheet of the club for
                        the year 1906 showing the considerable net profitfor th e year of over LE.
                        1.411 and funds last year, the figures of the previous year are shown for
                        purposes of comparison, and to a large extent explain thenselves.I
                        would,however, call your attention to the following items : The sum spent on
                        games amounts to the substantial figure of L.E. 356, or L E. 32 more than
                        last year; the amount debited to the “oourse a/o” is very considerably more
                        than last year while the “oharges a/o” shows a considerable diminu¬tion, bnt
                        it shonld be explained that this year various items of upkeep, which were
                        last year dehited to the ‘oharges a/o” are this year iuoludedin the “oourse
                        a/o” which would moe properly be called the “clerk of the oourse a/o” The
                        additional expenditure under this head has been involved by the increased
                        oost of labour and of hire of mules, and by other extra work involved in
                        Resting the grounds of the olnb in good order. The “extra expenditure a/o”
                        consists this year in almost entirely one item, viz : the repairing,
                        repainting and putting in thorough order of the grand stand ;, this work was
                        undertaken on the advioe of two competent engineers who reported on the
                        state of the stand ; and the olub is mnch indebted to Mr. Blagd»n for having
                        kindly supervised the work. The office expenditure shows an inorease of L K
                        121 over that of last year, neoeas tated by the extra work involved, but as
                        against this, the work - of the supervision of the pari mutnel, which last
                        year oost the olub over L.B. '50, was taken over and worked from the office.
                        The handicapper’s fees which la9t year were paid, have this year been
                        economised owing to the handicapping having been done by a handioap
                        committee of three stewards. Turning to the items of reoeipts the
                        subscrip¬tions have again increased slightly by some L E. 83 The profit of
                        racing, too, shows an inorease ofL.K >9 , made up of an inorease in the gate
                        money and pari mutnel. The buffet was this year let out to Vassili for L E.
                        150, and consequently shows a better profit than last year ; the other items
                        remain much the same as last year with the exception of the interest on
                        investments, which is natu¬rally increased with the additional funds. The
                        committee have again to express their warm thanks to H.H. Prince Mohamed
                        Ibra¬him, the Alexand ia Municipality, the Khe¬divial Club, the Alexandria
                        and Kamleh Rail¬way Co. and the Alexandria Athletio Sports club. The
                        Municipality have* reoently gener¬ously increased their donation to L E. 100
                        of which part will be given in the form of a cap. The olub has now in band
                        very substantial funds and can look forward consequently with equanimity to
                        the prospect of having to mwt heavy expenses which will necessarily be
                        involved when we are obliged to change premi¬ses. I have no more information
                        to give sou as to this than I had last year. H.H. Prinoe Mohamed Ihrahim,as
                        yon areaware,hfc promised to leave ns where we are until he can provide as
                        with new premises,and his intention has not, as far as I know, been altered.
                        The coming raoing season will show more big-races ’ban in the past chiefly
                        oaueed by the addi¬tion of large prizes for European horses; ’his has been
                        possible ohiefiy by the gene¬rosity of H.H. Prinoe Mohamed Ibrahim, who has
                        given farther donations to the ^Xtent of L E. 400—for this object The rest
                        of the racing will mostly follow ~ last year’s programme. Various
                        alterations have been made in the raoing rales of the ol«b daring the past
                        year, ohiefiy with the view of settling various knotty points which have
                        arisen os to the classification of horses, oowntrybred', barbs, eto, Owing
                        to my time being folly OQOupled otherwise, I have found it impossible to
                        oontinne as hon. secretary and treasnrer of the olnb ; the committee have
                        accordingly ap¬pointed a paid secretary in the person of Mr. Walter
                        Wilkinson who has during the past year assisted in the Sporting Clan office
                        and had oharge of the acoonnts. ? s already intimated to the committee, I
                        propose to oontinne to exeroise on their behalf a general oontrol over such
                        racing and other matters as need the supervision pf a steward, and the
                        acoonnts will be periodically audited throughout the year. I have only to
                        add that as usual Mr. Frank Haseldeu’s servioes to the olub have been
                        invaluable ; few who take part in the various sports such as polo, golf,
                        tennis, etc., realise what an amount of time and trouble Mr. Heselden
                        sacrifices to the elub with the result that the polo ground, tennis oonrts.
                        golf greens, and other parts of the olnb premises are, I think you will
                        agree with me, as thoroughly and efficiently kept np as is possible. The
                        thanks of the Glnb are dne to the other members of the Committee who have
                        taken iu hand various branohee of sport, and the oloh will have mnch to
                        regret in the Iras from the ranks of the stewards of Major Ludlow,, who so
                        efficiently looked after the golf Af*er' thia Mr. Rodocanachi proposed, and
                        Mr. H..K Barker seoonded, that the aoooonta and balance sheet he passed as

                        at the Cairo Mixed Courts at 3 p.m. on Saturday, Judge Tacit presiding. The
                        Cairo Bar was well represented: Me. Carton de Wiart was present with Maitres
                        Msrzbaoh, Padoa B«y, St Privat, Guillaumou and Martino. The Hon. A. Davey,
                        M. Naville, and M. A. Gant liquidator of the 8ay Rsffinerie, with several
                        members of the press, were also present. On the Judge asking whether any
                        proposals had been agreed to by the creditors, Me. Carton de Wiart stated
                        that the majority of the oreditors h*d agreed to the proposals put forward

                        the proposals had been read Me. Carton de Wiart read the following
                        docu¬ments 1. The new agreement between the Daira Sanieh Sugar Corporation
                        and the Sucreries Co. 2. The agreement between M. A. Gault and the Snoreries

                        GAZETTE. 8ir,—I have read with mnoh interest the oorrespoudeDce and
                        ‘articles which yon have recently published with reference to our
                        Municipality. You very justly oom plain that no pub1 i city is given to the
                        real savings and doings of hand to the amount of about £5, OOOstg. As our
                        representatives in that body, so that we' are pleaded to find a few straws
                        about, to see which way the wind blows; but I mnch regret the intemperate
                        style which your cor¬respondents on both sides have adopted; snch abase is
                        not oalouUted to domuoh good, anonymous or otherwise. What advioe oould be
                        more despicable than that of “Veritas’* to the electors, telling them to
                        refrain from voting ? I believe that there is, theoretically, some fine or
                        other punishment pro ided for MuDioipal Councillors who negleot to attend
                        meetings, without some due oause. I should like to see a fine for each
                        eleotor who neglected to record his vote, or. to see it taken from him and
                        given to some worthier individual who could not afford to pay £76 a year
                        rent. The right to vote should be a privilege mnoh sought after, and in my
                        opinion the standard of rental should be mnoh re¬duced. It is true that in
                        reoent times the landlords have pat their heads together to inorease the
                        electorate to no small extent, and many tenants have had greatness most
                        unwillingly throat upon them by seeing their rents raised from £*0 or £60 to
                        £80 or £90 a year, perhaps snob may not be very eager members of the
                        oon9titaenoy, hat let them flatter themselves that they have paid f ir a
                        privilege which they should not fail to nse. In one of your artioles you say
                        that a well- known looal Councillor who reoently resigned was quite right in
                        doing so, beoanse he was refused a seat on the delegation. I think it not
                        unlikely that every member of the Mu¬nicipality not on the delegation,
                        thinks in his own inner oonsoionsness that he could do better than those who
                        have that privilege. Therefore I oannot agree with yonr opinion; the motive
                        referred to seems to me puerile The letter from the Vice-President of the
                        Municipality appears quite as intemperate as thoee to which he replies. When
                        a man speaks “ex oathedra” be should be a little more should like to know
                        for ixptanoe how, or why, I who write to you anonymously so long as I do not
                        slander my neighbour, or say anything which is antrue, am more despioable
                        than a mmioipal oounoillor, who avails himself of that same anonymity (to
                        propose or vote for municipal laws or regulations, which be knows will be
                        widely objected to by his eleotors ? To take a case in point. The
                        inhabitants of the town are at the present moment put to great inoonveuienoe
                        by the oab strike ; this strike was principally brought on by a sudden
                        inorease of the tax on unnumbered carriages, to three times its former
                        amount. If the town oounoillor, in whose fertile brain originated ’his
                        drastic method of filling the municipal o ffers, had spoken publioly, as he
                        should have done, with the fear of bi* electors before his eye°, he wonld,
                        possibly, have moderated his zeal,*and ^o^ld have con¬tented himself vfi'h
                        sojpe more reasonable and acceptable inorease ; it even seems to me
                        extraordinary that it shonld not have ooourred to some of his oolleaguea,
                        that multiplication by three to one made rather too big a pill to be
                        swallowed oomfortably. On the other hand, |t may be said that if the
                        proceedings of municipal meetings are tp ba made public, some of the
                        gentlemen, who have represented the town for many years, might deoline to
                        act; to this I^shonld feel inolined to reply and a very good thing too. The
                        result of the recent general eleotion in England has shown in the most
                        astonishing way, the evil of an eleoted body holding power too long ; the
                        oonntry looked upon it, as a host might on friends who had been invited to
                        tea, and who had stayed all night It is only natural that much interest
                        shonld be taken iu the coming municipal emotions ; the publicity of
                        municipal proceedings, and if they oonvinoe the eleotors of their intention
                        to do th'*s, they have good hopes of being returned. As I do net speak, or
                        write, “ex cathedra” nor am I responsible to any electors, I do not fell it
                        any disgrace to sign myself, yonrs truly, “ANONYMOUS.” Alexandria, Feb.

                    <p>The oab strike still oontinnes to the great inoonvenienoe of the publio of
                        Alexandria The delegates of the drivers called at the Gonvernorat this
                        morning and proposed a new tariff as follows. For not more than 15 minntes
                        p.t. 2 (1 horee). and p.t. 3 (2 horses). For one hoar in the oity streets
                        p.t. 6(1 horse), and p.t. 8 (2 horses). To Ramleh p.t. 20, and p.t 30 with
                        1| hour’s waiting. The President of the Municipality also discussed the
                        question with the Commandant of Polioe, and it will be oonsiderel at the
                        meeting on Wednesday provided that in the meantime the men resume work.
                        Otherwise the question oannot be disouseed for some weeks. It is feared that
                        all the Alexandria carters will oome out on strike. These men have not yet
                        deoided to strike, but they threaten to do so unless they are exempted from
                        the Munici¬pal Tax. The strike of these men would be most inconvenient, and
                        would paralyse work on the quays. Passengers arriving with luggage from
                        Cairo and the Interior, at the Moharrem Bey termi¬nus, are put to the
                        gieatest inoonvenienoe owing to the utter laok of conveyances. The doctors
                        are also seriously inoonvenienoed in going their rounds. The general
                        impression among, the cabmen appears to be in favour of the proposed
                        emen¬dation of the tariff. The arbaghi’s side of the question is given by a
                        correspondent who writes — Abdul Wahad tells me he now pays P.T. 80 per
                        ardeb for barley and P.T. 100 per hemel fortibn for his horses. These prices
                        are the highest we have seen, and are 50% more than the rates of two years
                        ago. Everything else has also risen iu prioe. The Municipality wish to exsot
                        a tax of £5 on carriages and horses worth £10 ‘. The horse tax is raised
                        from P.T. 60 to P.T. 60. Why a man with good carriage and horses should he
                        taxed more heavily, is beyond my comprehen¬sion. The tariff for oarriage
                        hire is notoriously low in Alexandria, and the arbaghies are quite justified
                        in striking against any inorease of taxes. The publio should protest and
                        hold an indignation meeting in favour of the arbaghies. Another complaint is
                        that their horses, if run down, may be taken at the instanoe of the Sooiety
                        for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, kept in the hospital at a charge of
                        P.T, 6 per day, where they sleep on the oold stones with¬out bedding and,
                        none too well fed, get worse instead of better. </p>

                    <p>Loudon, February 2. Captain W. A. I. K^ Kir g’s Royal Rifle Corps, wh) has
                        been seleoted for the adjutancy of the 21 st Middlesex V. R. C., bettor
                        known as the Finsbury Rifles, was latterly serving with the 1st Battalion at
                        Cairo. He £ot bis first commission in the R flss over nine years ago, and
                        his comoany in December, 1901. He was attached to the West African Regiment,
                        Sierra Leone, Jor some time, and shared in the expedition in that colony in
                        1898-99 (medal with olasp), and with the R fl «s he saw con¬siderable
                        service in the South African War, including the operations in Natal and the
                        Transvaal (medal with tour clasps). It is freely stated that the grouped
                        regi¬mental district system, which Mr. Arnold- Forster introduced with a
                        flourish of trumpets for greater efficiency and economy, will be
                        dicoontinned, and the older'and well’tried system of independent regimental
                        district, commanded by. colonels, will be reverted to. The grouped
                        regimental district ay-tem has got a fair trial, and certainly it has not
                        worked better, nor has it boon found to be cheaper than the system it
                        displaced. It is one of the most unpopnlar of the alleged “reforms” carried
                        out by the ex-War Secretary. On the evening of the 8th inst. a lecture
                        entitled ‘The De?ert Frontier of Lower Egypt” will be given in the Theatre
                        of Leinster Honse, Kildare, St Dublin, by Lieutenant Colonel W. H. Rycrifc,
                        11th Haaears. Gen. the Rt. H in. Lord Grenfell, ex-8irdar of the Egyptian
                        Army, and Commander in Chief in-Ireland, will preside. Lieutenant Colonel
                        Ryoroft has an extensive knowledge of the country in question, having had a
                        lengthened service with- hi regiment there, in addition to a The re armament
                        of ihe Riyal Horse Artil lery and Royal Field Artillery is to be procee 1 ed
                        with on ’he original Hues settled eightee months ago. It is stated that the
                        new guns for both branches of the Royal Artillery will be completed in time
                        for the entire ie-arinament by the end of next year. 'Hie new field gnn has
                        given fairly satisfactory reanlts, and it praoti- cally does all that is
                        olaime 1 for it, which cannot be said of some of the Continental field
                        artillery, but the question of ammunition supply iu aotion still remains to
                        be perfected. An offi rial statement relating to the laum h of the
                        Dreaduonght by the King was issued at Portsmopth yesterday. His Majesty will
                        arrive atPortsmoath on the, night of February 9. At a quarter past eleven
                        next morning be ’8 to leave his yacht at the South Railway Jetty and proceed
                        across 1 ho dock yard in a speoial train. Guards of honour will be mounted
                        at various points, and the whole route will be lined with sailors and
                        marines,some 4,000 men being detailed for this duty. Decorated Vene¬tian
                        mai-ts are being erected' alongside the railway station, and tour triumphal
                        arohes are being throw.) across it. The general public will be admitted to
                        the dook yard,and may assemble at any point alongside the King’s route, or
                        near the Dreadnought. For privileged spectators stands are being erected,
                        admission to ’hsss being by ticket. No tickets, however, will be needed to
                        get into the dock yard. It is anticipa¬ted that many exoursion trains will
                        be ran into Portsmi u’h, as the launch is regarded as one of the most
                        important in the history of the British Navy </p>

                    <head>COLLEGE GORDON</head>
                    <p>FROM OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT). The day after our visit to Omdnrman, tbp
                        Press party and the Legislative Councillor.- paid a visit to the Gordon
                        College. In man* ways this was the most interesting sight cf all. The olose
                        attention paid by the boys, Arabs. Blacks, Berberines and mixed races, to
                        their teachers, their evident intelligence and eager¬ness to learn, and
                        their bearing and discipline, delighted everybody, and the members of the
                        Legislative Council were loud in their praise of the College. The system of
                        teaching the curriculum of the various olasses, and the num¬ber,
                        extraction,and aptitudes of the pupils must be treated separately and at
                        length ; for the present I need only say that the object of the Gordon
                        College i« to train young Sudanese to be of use to the Government and to the
                        com¬munity, whether they afterwards become kadi«, schoolmasters or artisans,
                        and thit the founders of the College forget that such an institution set
                        down in the midst of a barbarous and newly conquered country had to have
                        small beginnings. The College was certainly in its beginnings a primary
                        school for black boys—it is difficult to see how it oould have been anything
                        else, for whatever the capabilities of the Sudanese youths for absorbing
                        higher or even secondary educa¬tion without any tiresome primary training,
                        these do not spring op from the soil, and I believe that European
                        educational systems are based without exception on a course of pri¬mary
                        education, which is generally supposed to be a necessary preliminary to more
                        advanced study. The chief event in the history of the Gordon College during
                        1005 was the creation of an Upper School, which already oounts 15 pupils.
                        This may not seem an immense nrm- her, hut education was to put it mildly—
                        primitive at the time of the reoonquest, and Upper Sehools are not oreated
                        in a day. Th« time, however, oame when its oreation was considered feasible,
                        and Mr.Currie the Director of Eduoation in the Sudan, having obtained the
                        fundi, decided to oonsult the principal officials of the Technical
                        Departments eKhe Sadan Government, vie., the Director of Works, the Director
                        of Surveys, and ihe Director General (f Irrigation, with a view to learning
                        their opinions as to the training most required in the rew Upper School, and
                        as to what type of employ^ would be mest useful to the Government. The
                        following reply from Mr. Dupnis, the Inspector General (f Irrigatir n in the
                        Sudan deserves special attention by all who are interested in the spread of
                        education not in the Sadan oi ly, but in all backward eouitries in the East.
                        The principles it lays down for the training of engineers are equally
                        applicable in Persia, Mesopotamia and the central Sudan, and the‘future
                        organisers of higher technical education in those regions will doubtless
                        prof? by the results attained at the Gordon College. “Concerning the

                        the Sudan are ever carried out, of which, I think there oan hardly be any
                        dnubt. there most be an enormous deman i for men wi'h at least an elementary
                        knowledge of surveying, land measuring and simple construction. The
                        convenience and economy of being able to obtain suoh men looally, instead of
                        hwing to tempt them away from Egypt by the offer of salaries often out of
                        all proportion to their sooial standing and qualifications, would he
                        immense, and theadvanfage to anew country like the Sudan of the oreation of
                        a class with some engineering training oould not bat be very great. The
                        special kind of qualification for which a demand would arise on the
                        undertaking ofsnoh works as are contemplated would ba those that would fit a
                        man to lay out lines, measure land area®, preoare simple plans, supervise
                        earth works, lime and brick burning, and the construction of simple masonary
                        works. An elementa’y knowledge of how. to keen accounts in any simple and
                        oomprehensibl form, would be a most rsefal additional quali¬fication.
                        Imagine the case of the construction of a large canal system say in the
                        Ghezira; the firar step would be the retting out of the lice* of the oanals,
                        and the demarcation and expropriation cf the areas of laud they would occupy
                        ; these lire* would extend certainly over hundreds,and probably over
                        thousands of kilometres. The next step would be the execution of th-
                        nesessary earthwork over there lines, an im mense business, and by no means
                        so a mple a- is generally assumed], but one in which the presence of a
                        capable 4upeivior can just m^fcp all the difference between the fini-hed
                        work and strength, or being a permanent eyesore and source of trouble.
                        Simultaneously with the earthwork a v*ry large number of bridges,
                        regulators^ onlverts rest-houses, shelter-huts, e’e wonld be requir¬ed :
                        some of these works would nccef-suril require the presence cf tul’y trained
                        engineer- of some experience ; hut for the innnmerah'e petty works an almost
                        unlimited demand fv cheap but trustworthy supervision would arise. A very
                        useful qualification wonld he a knowledge of lime and brick burning, w:th
                        Heas as to what constitutes suitable limestone and briok eirth. where they
                        are generally to be foaud, and how to set about converting the crude prsdnot
                        into the finished article. In gnperv sing any snnh wo»k it would he
                        necessary or desirable to kepp a running account (if expenditure; and for
                        this an elementary knowledge of acoount keeping would he nseful. A very
                        large demard for rongh but efficient temporary shelter huts and
                        store-hauses, almost always arisen in the early stage of large under-takings
                        ; and men with an intelligent eye for "he application of locally available
                        material (generally mnd, grass, and in'erior timber) for "he construction of
                        such buildings, are of great use. So far I have been considering the use of
                        suoh men regarded as overseers or supervisors, and working as subordinate
                        employes in a lyge organi-ed staff of ergineers ; but they would be at least
                        equally nseful as petty con¬tractors or gangers working at “ piece work,”
                        •ndeed.the line dividing the temporarily engag¬ed overseer on small pay from
                        the petty con¬tractor, often becomes very fine indeed. I think I have ssid
                        enough to show the nature cf work f r which men of the most elementary
                        qualifications are required, bet if you are prepared to go further, there is
                        nothing to prevent suoh meu being trained and educat-ed into fully qualified
                        engineers. For this course? ’he first necessity is deeper knowledge of
                        mathematics, and a cultivated reasoning power, to permit of the formation of
                        intelligent forecasts of the probable course of events under given
                        conditions. The nse of the level is a more or IBRS me-chanical operation,
                        and might easily b° acqnirpd and accurately practised by men of the first
                        cla-s, without their quite understanding its inner bearings, and it is a
                        qualification of the utmost value ; but I should not expeot reliable results
                        from the use of a theodolite by a man of limited mathematical attainments;
                        more¬over. the use t f the theodolite is comparatively res triced. I have
                        therefore divided the subjects in whieh training might in my opinion be
                        attempted, into two classes, which I denote “Rub-overseers” and engineers”,
                        olassed respectively after an old Indian ctas^ifiobtion. I apologise
                        beforehand for the obvious im-perfections of the lis’s as submitted, and
                        trust to yon to make gool their defijiencie* in the light of the
                        explanations I have given above of the practical objects to be ob’ained. I
                        have no experience iu the preparation of ooorses of instruction, or the
                        elaboration of a college syllabus to guide me, and it is undoubtedly a
                        delioate and d fficult business.” ( To be continued, </p>

                    <p>The dcotors r f New York are growing more and more alarmed about the
                        proportion of sudden deaths, mainly fr m heart disease, and this they
                        attribute to the killing pace at which New Yorkers live. Five and twenty

                        deplorable. I often recommend to my patients—b isy merchants, many of them,

                    <p>To THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE. J Sir—While I was qnietly having my
                        lunoh j in one of the houses of the Rue de la Forte Rosette, I was suddenly
                        startled by a howling noise which seemed to be produoed by some war-ship
                        passing in the street at great speed. The thought struck me that it might be
                        some new fire-engine racing to a conflagration, but although I had made the
                        few steps to the window as1 quickly at possible I could only just get a
                        glimpse of a motor disappearing in the distance. The motor was not even one
                        of the very large ones, but the howl it gave made the whole neighbourhood
                        sharidar and the he*da ot all the people in the street were turned in the
                        direction where it had disappeared in a oloud of dufrt. I understood that
                        this new noise iu the streets of Alexandria meant that a man was driving
                        through the thorough fares of the town at about the speed of an oiled fla-h
                        of lightning, and that he was warning great and small, ohildren, women and
                        men, old ladies with gout and yoong without, carriages and oarts, busses and
                        all other* vehicles, oats and dogs, to hop quiokly, or hasten in some
                        manner, out of the way he had chosen for his mad career. He must have been
                        aware himself that he was driving a little too quickly to give common
                        mortals the neoessary time to get out of bis way, if not warned at a great
                        distance. I will not speak about the necessity to oome to a decision about
                        the speed with which it is allowed for a motor to drive throngh densely
                        frequented streets, for I have heard from competent sources that the polioe
                        as wall as the Muni¬cipality have given up all hope of control ling this
                        nuisance cf reokless driving of Autos; but what I should like to kaow
                        is:—Will it be allowed to use this howling machine in the town of Alexandria
                        also daring the night, when people who do not drive in Autos and still
                        stiokto the RntTdibvia® habit of walking on foot, try to get a litt’e rest.
                        This rest is already greatly curt fed by the furions driving of carriages
                        and the oraoking of whips aft*r the theatre or some other amuse¬ment is
                        over. The above bespoken common mortal is already sufficiently frightened
                        ont of his sleep by the usual “Toot” of the motor, when the unease or
                        Vieillesse dorde, belated at the olub or the theatre seek to get home as
                        quiokly as possible, or are speeding to some Dew p^sure We know that a man
                        in an Auto considers himself so f»r above the non- be-antoed humanity that
                        considerations of the regard due to his fellow citiiens do rot trouble him
                        much. We km w that egotism is waxing wild in modern times, when ft soems to
                        be merely a S’gn of weakness to oonsider what harm yon may be doing to
                        others by the pnrsuit of your own, often very futile, p’ea sures. An example
                        of this may easily be found on a Snnday afternoon, when Autos, laden with
                        representative* of the higher society from whom fair thinking might be
                        expeotei^ are driven at a hurling speed through the rows of carriages,
                        throwing clouds of dost and ill- smelling smoke into *he faces of others who
                        by a qniet promenade-drive try to get a little frei-h air. The Chaonbhe k
                        oheval gallop* afer the Arab who drives his oart a little qnioker than he
                        ought to, but for the Auto his horse is not quick enough. And of what use
                        would it be ? People in motors are immune from the cooseqnenoes of laws or
                        regulations made many year* ago when motor* had not yet been invented. In
                        Earope it is forbidden fir sfeam->hips to blow their whis’les and ring their
                        bells daring the night on the river in the vioinity of towns. In the “Avis k
                        la Navigation” for this port the last Artio’e (No. 18) reads as follows: “Il
                        eat strictunenfc ddfeudu aux navires de fiire usage de sirknes à vapeur dans
                        le port iotk- rieur et dans l’arsenal ” Bat after all, motors are not ship*,
                        which is best proved by the fact that not thorc who are in them,but those
                        who are out of them get mo it sick of them. Let us hope that one day
                        Artio'es may be made for motors also.—I am, dear Sir, like the greatest part

                        Khartoum will shoot later in the moDth. The weather was very unfavour¬able
                        for aboetiog, as a strong rear wind raised olouds of stud, which' seemed to
                        upset the shooters. Cairo soore* ore given below. Total ’ 620 On Saturday
                        Mr. W. V. Shearer won a spoon with 29 + 32 + 80 = 91, Mr. Craig being naxt

                        FOOTBALL. A football match between the Railway Insti¬tute and the M.M.P. was
                        played on Friday last at Gheziret Badrane, and the game ended in a win for
                        the home team by 2—0 goals.The conti¬nuous rain which fell during the game
                        rendered the ground very slippery and muddy, and con¬sequently proper
                        football was a matter ot impos¬sibility. The two goals were scored iu the
                        opening half of the game.MoCairns was referee. </p>

                        thoroughly up-to-date especially in Seotion I., which deals with the
                        questions of the day. Although the date at which it went to pret>s did not
                        allow r f the insertion of the names of the new Liberal ministers, the faot
                        of Sir II. Campbell-Banner¬man’s acceptance of office is neftified, and the
                        remarkable forecast of the anricipated Liberal and victories made by Mr
                        W.T.Stead in his esti¬mate of the remit the general election—below the mark
                        as, to everybody’* surprise, it turned out—is given in detail, and forms an
                        excellent example of editorial foresight.' Information on eve y oonoeivable

                        J. L. Garvin and Mr. L. G. C. Money. M.P. Altogether pages ate devoted to
                        the ques¬tion, of which p'obab’y most people are by this time rather tired,

                    <p>Eighteen months ago a deserted infant was found by the roadside at Clonghton,
                        a village outside Scarborough. The child was taken nare of by Mr. John
                        L?adley, a farmer, and member of the board of guardians, and tie mother
                        having teen traced, she was prose- outed. The o’ronmstanoes surrounding the
                        girl’s downfall were tonnd to be very pathetic, and as she hid been more
                        ainnel against than sinning, no punishment was i» flicted. A ww4paper report
                        r f the faots wa* read by a gold miner iu British Columbia, and his heart
                        was so touched that he forwarded an offer of marriage, together with a sum
                        of £30 for the girl’s passage out. She went, and was married the day after
                        Bbe landed. Last week she returned for the child, which had been ado; t’d by
                        a sympathetic carter's wife at Selmer, and on Saturday the happy mother and
                        child sailed from Liverpool to rejoin the husband. By the time the mother
                        regains British Columbia she will have tra¬velled forne 8,000 miles on the
