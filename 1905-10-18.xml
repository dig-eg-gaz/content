                    <head>FRANCE AND SYRIA.</head>

                    <p>During his recent visit to France H.B. Mgr. Hawayek, the Maronite Patriarch,
                        appears to have accorded interviews to several French journalists in which
                        he stated that the Maronite population of the Lebanon, whatever its
                        sympathies with other nations, could not forget that it owed its present
                        comparative freedom and happiness to French intervention, and had no idea of
                        exchanging a French for a German protectorate. Whether the Patriarch would
                        have spoken with the same fervour during M. Combes' regime is doubtful That
                        vigorous anti-clerical did not realize that the French protectorate over the
                        Eastern Christians was from every point of view a “valuable asset,” and the
                        studied incivility with which the Patriarch himself was treated on one
                        occasion might have cost the Republic dear. Fortunately for French
                        interests, M. Combes' successor has realised that anti-clericalism J is '
                        not an article for exportation, and his policy has done much to heal tho
                        sores left by his predecessor’s rather unwise neglect. None the less the
                        position of France in Syria is by no means so strong as in former years. The
                        Germans, though they have not extended their operations to the Lebanon, are
                        extending their influence in Palestine to the Damascus region. The Jewish
                        colonies in the Holy Land are more German than French in origin and
                        sympathies, and Russia, France's ally in Europe, had made formidable
                        progress until her prestige was overthrown by Japan. Ameri- can influence,
                        though not directly political, mast affect local politics. Education in
                        Syria is largely in American hands, and the Ameri- can College at Beyrout is
                        now a serious rival of the Jesuit schools and colleges. British in- fluence,
                        always strong among the Druses and Protestants of Syria, has gained fresh
                        strength since the young Syrians took to visiting Egypt in search of an
                        honest government and lucrative employment, and our commercial interests in
                        Palestine and Syria are far superior to those of any other nation. It is for
                        France to decide whether her influeuce in Syria shall survive or not, and on
                        her decision much depends, for, if France gradually withdraws from the Near
                        East to concentrate her attention on her new African Empire, there can be no
                        doubt that her great European rival will make every effort to take her
                        place. British statesmen hare long looked forward complacently to a German
                        protectorate over Asia Minor, but the increase of German influence in Syria
                        might well be regarded with suspicion by the Power most interested in Egypt.

                        <p>About 10 O'clock on Monday night, and unusual incident took place at
                            Kar-el-Nil barracks. A soldier, feeling unwell, plunged into the Nile,
                            and commenced swimming away from the bank. Some bystanders at once gave
                            the alarm and several plucky attempts at rescue were made, but the
                            current was strong and the swimmers had some difficulty in regaining the
                            shore, one of them, indeed, being landed in an exhausted condition.
                            Subsequently, a boat was got out and the unfortunate man was pcked up
                            some distance down the river. He was subsequently brought before his
                            commanding officer for absence without leave. </p>

                        <p>- A horrible crime was enacted in the Bab el Sharieh district of Cairo on
                            Monday consequent on a quarrel between a native married couple. It
                            appears that the husband and wife began to struggle with each other, and
                            as they reached the window, the former attempted to throw his wife out
                            of it on the ground many feet below. The woman clung to her husband in
                            an endeavor to save herself, and eventually both of them fell out and
                            were picked up badly injured. The unhappy pair were taken to the Kasr el
                            Aini Hospital, where the woman suc- dumbed in a very short time. It is
                            expected that the husband will recover from his injuries. </p>

                            for the month of August- that is to say, the smile is on the side of
                            John Ball. Not withstanding the most enthusiastic mutual good feeling
                            be- tween France and Great Britian, the fact cannot be overlooked that
                            our friends across the Channel have seen with envy the marvelous
                            prosperity that the Government of Great Britain has brought to Egypt,
                            and we may expect about now a movement on the part of France to endeavor
                            to check in some way that money-making monopoly which Mr. Bull holds in
                            the land of the Pyramide." The illustration referred to, which comes
                            under the heading of August, 1906, represents a group of money-laden
                            natives entering an English bank, and John Bull, seated on a camel,
                            being pulled back by the heels by three French soldiers. </p>

                        cotton trade, which provided that the join com- mittee of employers and
                        employed should meet at an early date for the purpose of framing a scheme
                        for the automatic regulation of wages, a meeting was held a few days ago at
                        the offices of the Master Spinners' Federation in Manchester.
                        Representatives of the federa- tion, the Amalgamated Association of
                        Operative Spinners, and the Cardroom Workers' Amalga- nation attended, nut
                        no resolution of import- acne was arrived at. It was felt that before
                        anything practical could be accomplished the representatives of the various
                        organizations should meet separately to consider procedure and other
                        matters. In order that this could be arranged, the meeting was adjourned to
                        a near date. </p>

                    <p>The imports for the past month (inclusive of tobacco) totaled L.E. 1,975,946
                        against L.E 1,742,088 during the corresponding month of the previous year,
                        showing an in- crease of LE 233,858. For the first nine months of 1905 the
                        value of all imports amounted to L.E. 14,716,859 against L.E. 13,573,380 in
                        the period January 1-Septem- her 30, 1904, an ncrease of L.E 603,912 last
                        moth- a decided drop from the figures of September, 1904 when they amounted
                        to L.E 616,119. Owing no doubt, to the causation of hostilities, imports
                        from China and the Far East show a 13% increase, while Turkish imports have
                        risen from L.E. 280,688 in September, 1904, to L.E. 327,939 last month, and
                        Austria and Sweden show a decided increase. For the nine-months period
                        British imports show an increase of L.E. 282,871, French imports of L.E.
                        336,167, Turkey and the USA have largely increased their im- ports, and
                        Sweden show an increase of 30%. A decline is noted in German, Italian, and
                        Swiss imports, and in those from India and the Eastern possessions of the
                        British Empire. </p>
                    <p>Turning to exports, the total for the month amounts to LE 928,302 a fall of
                        L.E. 109,439 as compared to September, 1904. For the first nine months of
                        the present year the total exports are valued at L.E. 12,878,173, against
                        L.E. 13,724,419 in the corresponding period of 1904, showing a decline of
                        L.E. 846,246. Ex- ports to Great Britain fell off for the month and for the
                        first three quarters; the total dimina- tion in value for the last-named
                        period amount- ing to L.E. 520,373. The exports to Italy con- tine to show a
                        falling-off in value, and the only great increase to be noted is in the
                        Amer- I can trade, which shows export figures, this September that more than
                        double those of September, 1904, and has given the remarkable increase on

                        very marked, while British Eastern possessions have nearly doubled their

                    <head>CAIRO SHOOTING OUTRAGE. HEARING OF WITNESSES </head>
                    <p>Carmelo Pissani, a native of Malta, was brought up again yesterday morning
                        before Mr. Alban, at the British Consular Court in Cairo, charged with
                        shooting with intent to murder Victoria Dehan and Austrian subject who had
                        been living with the accused for some time at Port Said. </p>
                    <p>We related in our issue of Monday how Pisani, when finding that the young
                        woman had left with another lover for Cairo, followed them there, and on
                        discovering their where- a bouts had gone on Friday afternoon to the house
                        situated near Ataba-el-Khadra, and fired at his victim on her refusing to
                        return with him to Port Said. He afterwards turned the weapon on himself,
                        and fired again, causing, however, only a slight wound. </p>
                    <p>The first witness called was Gaetano Muns- for who disposed as followed, "I
                        am a printer by trade. I saw prisoner on Friday for the first time at about
                        a quarter past three o'clock in the afternoon. I was, then in the office of
                        the 'Imparzale'. I am the proprietor of the print- ing establishment where
                        the paper is printed. Whilst there I heard a revolver shot and went out to
                        see what has happened. I saw the proprie- tress of the lodging house
                        opposite my pace at a window and ward her shouting to me"Help help, as they
                        are killing upstairs." I replied that could not risk my life with people who
                        were armed. I returned to my shop, when I heard another shot. Then, at the
                        request of the land lady of the lodging house, I rant to the end of the
                        street and found a man belong- ing to the fire brigade whom I aroused from
                        sleep. In the meanwhile I heard a third shot at a short interval from the
                        last. The fireman went to the caracole to fetch a policeman whilst I
                        returned to my shop. Then, when entering I saw a woman, who was wounded,
                        coming out of the lodging house and bleeding from the right side. I saw the
                        blood running down her side. Behind the woman I saw the accused also coming
                        dow and covered with blood. He has nothing on his hand. The man wanted to
                        lead back Victoria, but she pushed him away. When he saw that the woman did
                        not wish to go with him Pieani returned to the house. The wounded woman
                        wanted to come into my shop, but I refused her admittance." On Mr. Alban
                        here mentioning that he thought this conduct inhuman the witness explained
                        that he did not want her to come into the shop by the front and asked her to
                        go to the workshop at the back to prevent a crown collecting, and anything
                        disagreeable occurring with the police. </p>
                    <p>The witness continued: "After a little while some policemen arrived and
                        commenced to hold an enquiry. None of these policemen dared to go in, but
                        remained outside. In the meanwhile the accused came down with his hat on and
                        a flu-whisk in his hand. Pirani walked quietly away, the policeman
                        following. When the accused stopped and looked round the two policemen
                        courageously got out go the way (great laughter). The crowd, on seeing this
                        kept calling out "Arrest the man, he did the deed." They, however, kept at a
                        safe distance. The fireman called by me afterwards took hold of the
                        prisoner, seizing him by both arms. He was then conducted to the caracole.
                        Later there arrived the chief of the secret police, the mamour of the
                        district, and some other people, and Victoria then returned to the house
                        where she lived. When the woman went back her second lover, named Giorgio
                        came, and on being told that his signora was wounded he ran upstairs. I got
                        to know that his man on seeing a revolver upstairs came down again and ran
                        away as fast as he could go. Shortly after the wounded woman was brought
                        down, put into a carriage and driven away. After about half an hour she
                        returned to the house with an Arab. I led her upstairs. On my coming out I
                        met the accused, who had been brought back to the house, accom- panned bu
                        the police, I asked him whether this woman was his wife or his sister. He
                        answered "No". I then asked him how those wounds had been inflicted. He
                        replied "I don't know. I heard two shots but I don't know where they came
                        from." There was a revolver lying on the table, and on being asked by the
                        mamour if it belonged to him Pisani said it was not his. </p>
                    <p>In no answer to a question from his Honor, the witness declared there was an
                        interval of about five minutes between each shot. The second witness was
                        Rosine Krauss, an Austrian subject, who is the keeper of the lodging-house.
                        The woman deposed that Victoria came with a man called Giorgio Mascarelli
                        about two months ago and the repre- sensed themselves as husband and wife.
                        On the 11th the accused knocked at her door just before noon. In reply to
                        her enquiry Pisani said he wanted to see a certain Victoria Dehan. She told
                        him she knew no person of that name. He added that he had come from Port
                        Said on behalf of the consulate. The accused then left. Witness afterwards
                        went to Victoria's room and told her what had happened. She looked out of
                        the window, and on seeing her Pisani return- ed to the house and again
                        knocked at the door, but Victoria begged witness not to open. Then accused
                        forced the door open and came in. Subsequently he went out with Victoria.
                        About 3.30 p.m. the latter returned with her supposed husband. Last Friday
                        afternoon the accused called again and an altercation ensued, the upshot of
                        which was the he drew a revolver and shot his ex-paramour, while she and her
                        mother (who had meantime put in an appear- acne) were sitting on chair in
                        the parlor. After some more confirmatory evidence had been heard, prisoner
                        was remanded until Monday morning, when the remaining witnesses will be
                        examined. His Honor intimated that he would consider the application for
                        bail on Saturday. </p>

                    <p>Last Friday, on the invitation of the Suez E.T.C. Cricket Club and Mess, a
                        team of eleven representing the Alexandria staff of the same company left by
                        the 3.40 p.m. train, arriving at the Suez at 11.30 p.m. Although cricket was
                        the main object of the trip, tennis (singles and doubles), a relay billiard
                        math, and a golf match were all fixed up before- hand. On Saturday, at about
                        10.45, a start was made at cricket in very hot weather (during the match the
                        thermometer restored 95 degrees in the shade). R.B. McLean won the toss and
                        put in Suez in Maynard and Carpenter open- ed against the bowling of Byrne
                        and Thurston. The wicket was not at its best and the outfield very rough and
                        slow, so that scoring was a matter of some difficult. Byrne im- mediately
                        found his length and throughout was almost unplayable, accounting for eight
                        of the wickets for thirteen runs (7 clean bowled) -a most excellent bowling
                        performance. The remaining two Suez men were run out. More of them should
                        have suffered this fate had the Alexandria throwing in been more accurate as
                        Suez ran some very risky runs. Maynard played a very steady innings, as did
                        Masey. Noe- worthy livened things up a bit and showed how to score in desert
                        cricket by hitting "hard and high", though fortunately for Alexandria not
                        "often". The total reached 72, - much better one than it looked and quite
                        equal to 180 on the Alexandria ground. The lunch interval was taken with the
                        fall of the last Suez wicket, and the game resumed at 2 o'clock. Stacey and
                        Cheeseman opened for Alexandria to the bowl- ing of Mansell and Noseworthy,
                        and the score mounted steadily until, with the total at 15, Stacey was
                        bowled by Nosworthy. Cheesman and Byrne put on 25 for the third wicket, and
                        after Cheesman left with a most useful 21 to his credit, McLean's anxiety to
                        score more freely brought about his downfall. During the partnership the
                        winning hit was made. Byrne did not long survive McLean, being bowled by
                        Battiscombe for a somewhat lucky but invaluable 38. After his departure
                        there was a comparative collapse, the remaining five wickets only producing
                        16 runs. G. McLean in his nine had a brace of very big hits which would have
                        credited him with a dozen in Alex- andria. The total reached 116. Score and

                        dinner in the speeded dining-room of the staff mess and passed a most
                        pleasant hour and a half until speech time. The toast list was made as short
                        as possible in order to allow of a start being made in the billiard match.

                        all through, reached 100 to his opponent's 96. G. McLean then took up the
                        one for Alexandria and Templeman for Suez. This, too was very close and they
                        were 180 all when McLean put in a twenty break and gave Byrne, who relieved
                        him, this balance in hand. Mansell, who was his opponent could not get
                        going, the balls running most unkindly, while Byrne went steadily on, with
                        the result that Alexandria reached 300 to Suez's 237. R.B. McLean, with Marx
                        of Suez, then entered on the final stage of the match, but Marx was given
                        too heavy a task, and Alexandria won the match by 400 to 317. </p>
                    <p>Next morning the gold match was played, and in this Suez scored their first
                        success. Noe- worthy beat Byrne by three and two, and Toms beat Harrison by
                        three up. </p>
                    <p>Next morning the golf match was played, and in this Suez scored their first

                        series of match- es to an end and the result was very satis- factory to the
                        visitors. The Alexandria men were the guests of the Suez mess and were
                        treated right royally, enjoying their trip im- mensely. Hopes were freely

                    <head>BANKRUPTCY LAW IN EGYPT</head>
                    <p>The "Times" contains the following article from correspondent Alexandria
                        Anyone who has followed closely the laws enacted of late years in Egypt
                        cannot fail often to notice in them a lack of business foresight. I am now
                        dealing with one of the laws which never fails to raise grave complaints on
                        all hands in Egypt and which since its birth has been the cause of great
                        dissatisfaction. This is the now famous law on the "Concordat Pre ventif."
                        The measure appears to have taken its origin from the French law of Match 4,
                        1839, on the "Liquidation Jadiciairt,” and imperfect as this law has been
                        pronounced to be, the Egyptian law on the’ “conoordat Pre ventif” is very
                        much worse. One market consequence of the law is that the number of failures
                        had decreased and the number of admitted to the benefit of the "Conbordat
                        Preventif” has been steadily on the increase. </p>
                    <p>THE LEGISLATURE AND BANKRUPTCY To the Egyptian legislator it seemed that the
                        time had come to admit that in Egypt there were merchants and traders who,
                        through misfortunes altogether independent of any fault of theirs, had
                        fallen into commercial trouble. But the legislator apparently lost sight, of
                        the fact that half at least of these worthy , merchants would be natives
                        whoso ways of trading and ideas of commercial order were but little known to
                        him. It was not realised that the social opprobium from which the “Concordat
                        Preventif’ was intended to save tho unfortunate and innocent traders’ was of
                        no great moment to the native mer- chant ; bankruptcy indeed has not the
                        same moral and social consequences, even to European in Egypt, that it has
                        in Euro pean countries. Thus the reason which led to the enactment of the
                        French law on the '‘Liquidation Jud ciaire" did not seem to exist in Egypt;
                        and in fact what Egypt required were more stringent and severe laws dealing
                        with failures and bankruptcies, and not a law which has afforded a wider
                        field than existed before to unscrupulous merchants and their creditors for
                        fraudulent mareuvers to the detriment of honest traders.</p>
                    <p>The French Liquidates Judiciaire.”</p>
                    <p>M. Demole in his report to tho French Senate on tho "Loi de la Liquidation
                        Judi ciaire" explained the object of the law when he said:-</p>
                    <p>This new regime, which is reserved for debt- ors unfortunate and of good
                        faith, and which adjusts the law, as iar as convenient, for the regulation
                        of their business, would free those debtors from the sharp humiliations and
                        harsh treatment which accompany the state of bank ruptcy. This law would, in
                        the interest of creditors, simplify the preliminary operation of settlement
                        and arrive sooner and with les expense either at the ‘conoordat'
                        (composition) or the liquidation of the assets. But [he con- tinued], in
                        order that a merchant could claim the application of the benefit of the new
                        law, it is necessary that the Courts, called upon always to judge the
                        merchant's position, should not find in the conduct of his business either
                        bad faith or any one of those serous faults which prove on the part of him
                        who committed them wilful disregard of his own responsibilities That is the
                        object of proposing this law. It most be borne in mind that this French law
                        was the result of much criticism adverse to the law of May 28, 1838, which
                        dealt severely with all bankruptcy. A similar thing cannot be said of the
                        application of the former Egyptian law on bankruptcy ; in fact, such as it
                        was, it was a good law, and all it required was that criminal jurisdiction
                        should be given to the Mixed Courts over cases of fraudulent and simple
                        bankruptcies. These extended powers of the Mixed Courts would have been the
                        means of impressing prospective bankruptcy with the fear of a stricter and
                        more effective law than the old 'one, which deferred criminal proceedings
                        against the bankrupt to the Con sular Court, with the result that scarcely
                        ever if at all, was the matter extended beyond mere complaint made to the
                        Consular autho rity.</p>
                    <p>WORKING OF THE "CONCORDAT PREVENTI</p>
                    <p>It has been contended that the law on the "Concordat Preventif' is a good
                        law. I have already said that in practice it is most un satisfactory, as it
                        is also in its conception, and if that contention were justified, then this
                        law either is not strictly applied by the Courts whose business it is to
                        apply it, or else it con- tains something which diverts its aim. I am afraid
                        that both those things are responsible for the dissatisfaction felt with the
                        law. The operation of tbs law is as follows : — The would be commercial
                        malheureux et de bonne Joi files a declaration of insolvency in the registry
                        Of the Court accompanied by his balance sheet; he may or he may not deposit
                        his books; very seldom he does. At the first sitting of the Court after the
                        filing of the declaration, the matter is brought forward; no notice is given
                        to the creditors and the Court begins by delivering a judgment admitting the
                        declarant to the benefit of the “Concordat Preventif’-under the
                        circumstances, of course, with out a dis- sentient voice. Once proclaimed a
                        malheureux et de bonne foi Article 206 enacts that the Court shall appoint
                        one of the judges, “who will sign the books of the debut and who will
                        proceed to verify the situation .... and will convene a meeting of the
                        creditors before him with a view to learning their opi nion on the admission
                        to this Concordat Pre- ventir and will read to the meeting a report on the
                        good faith of the debtor, his buisness position, and his proposals for a
                        composition. The Judge, of course, appoints an expert of the Court to
                        overband the books and examine all papers, and it is he who makes out the
                        report. If the debtor succeeds in obtaining a majority representing
                        three-fourths of his crediitors claims he is entitle to the concordat ; but
                        This concordat” must be homologated-or confirmed by the Court. Here the
                        creditor! it tho minority are given a chanoe of oppAinf the “concordat," and
                        the Court itself by the operation of Article 260 may at any moment. if it
                        becomes convinced that the debtor is not malreuAeux et ce bonne foi, declare
                        him bank- rupt moreover, the “concordat” remains subject to the provision of
                        Article 1341 and 312 of the Commercial Cole in case of fraud as therein
                        mentioned or of non fulfilment of the condition of the "concordat."</p>
                    <p>DEFECTS IN PRACTICE</p>
                    <p>No doubt to the uninitiated these legal pre cautions may appear a sufficient
                        guarantee ; unfortunately they are ineffective,for it is found in practice
                        that the law has put the cart before to the horse. Indeed, what the law asks
                        is that the debtor be declared malheurenx el de bonne foi on his own
                        affirmation, and that is con- sidered sufficient to begin with. Then his
                        itaation is investigated, and when this is done the creditors are asked to
                        come and prove that the debtor is not maUteureux el de bonne foi. It would
                        seem for all logical purposes that the reverse should happen. It would be
                        more rational if the Court were, on the declaration made by the debtor, to
                        appoint at once an expert who would report to the Court on the situation and
                        circum- stances of the insolvency, give notice of the deposit of the report
                        and the books and all papers at the registry to tho creditors, and then fix
                        a day for the creditors to appear in Court and put forward their
                        observations. The full Court would then give their judg- ment with complete
                        knowledge of the case. As now happens the fall Court hears the minority of
                        the creditors after the majority has already confirmed-by its vote the
                        provi- ional admission of the debtor to the benefit w of the ““Concordat
                        Preventil,” which is a totally different thing. The Judge appointed by the
                        Court leaves everything in the hands of the expert, who in practice not
                        being invest- ed, as in the case of a bankruptcy, with the power of a
                        syndic, must often simply give an account of the position, seldom trou-
                        bling himself except in patent cases with giving an opinion as to tho good
                        faith of the debtor. On the other hand, there being no supervision whatever
                        over the creditors—by_a committee of creditors — the- -greatest abuses are
                        most frequently committed ; personal ad- li vantages are distributed by the
                        debtor, and when, on paper, it appears to the Court that the debtor offers,
                        say. 40 per cent.) one or more creditors have actually received an extra 10
                        per cent or more, according to their importance and their ingenuity in
                        extorting all they can out of their unscrupulous debtor. The majority
                        required by the law is thus obtained; the Court’s practice almost invariably
                        follows the of vote; and Article 210 is and remains a dead letter for an
                        upright creditor unless he can make tho Court acquire the conviction that
                        the debtor is not “anfortunate and of good faith.” But in order to do so he
                        must bring nothing short of palpable proof of fraudulent bankruptcy, and
                        that is not an easy matter. Many circumstances may concur to show the
                        absence of good faith on the part of the debtor, which will, however, fall
                        short of fraudulent bankruptcy; yet, although the |aw does— not require as
                        much, the Courcs satisfy themselves, nevertheless, with a majority of votes,
                        unless, as Isay, there can be made out a crashing in case against the
                        debtor</p>
                    <p>PlAYING WITH THE LAW.</p>
                    <p>The result of all this is that the law has become a most convenient means
                        whereby a man may enrich himself. And naturally so, for on the one hand the
                        expert is a mere inoffensive instrument; and as he has no power worth
                        mentioning, he counts for very little indeed, and in practice he confices
                        himself strictly to his ludicrous mission. On the other hand the creditors
                        are easy prey; and the debtor can do anything he likes with them; the
                        obstreperous minority is not to be feared, for the Court follows the
                        majority. Moreo ve there is, it seems, no appeal against the judg- ment
                        confirming or homologating the decision of the majority of the creditors.
                        What could be better for the debtor And let us bear in mind that the object
                        of the law is to save the trader the moral pain and social opprobrium
                        following upon a declaration in bankruptcy, and also save the creditors
                        expense by amelior- atiag tho proceedings and simplifying the legal process!
                        The debtor has turned all this to his advantage, and it has often been seen
                        that on the following day after his "concordat” has been ratified he opens a
                        larger shop, better equipped, and supported by the credit of bis former
                        creditors. And why so I Because in most cases his creditors are the agents
                        of European firms, to whom their representatives in Egypt give the 40 per
                        csnt. or mere 15 per cant, appearing on paper for the “conoordat," while
                        they pocket quietly the extra 5 per cent, 10 per cent., or 20 cent.
                        according to circumstances, and in consideration of which they have
                        recommended to their firms in Europe the acceptance of the “conoordat” and
                        the continuance of supplies of goods when the debtor is whitewashed by the
                        majority of his creditors.</p>
                    <p>It has, indeed, been asserted that the Frenoh law on the "Liquidation
                        Judicair” is no better. This is wrong; that law is bad, but it is better
                        than the one in Egypt. Article 4 of the French law enacts that the full
                        Court, in Chambers, shall summon before it the debtor and examine him, which
                        is something akin to our examination in England by the registrar and the
                        official reciever. The debtor has to explain his position to the Court
                        before it provisionally pronounces its opinion. The report on the law to the
                        French Senate set forth plainly :—"We thought it was not sufficient to make
                        the appearance of the debtor before the full Court optional; in chambers we
                        made it compulsory." Moreover, Article 9 of the law enacts that the Judge
                        shall ask the cre- ditor whether they will appoint a few amongst them to
                        control the work of the liquidator There is no such provision in the
                        Egyptian law.</p>

                    <head>MISSIONS IN THE SUDAN. </head>
                    <p>A PIONEER EXPEDITION. </p>
                    <p>Reuter’s Agency is informed that an im- portant missionary pioneer expedition
                        to the Sudan is being depatched by the Church Missionary Society this month.
                        The sphere of work has been selected by the Earl of Cromer, and comprises a
                        region about four times the size of England, inhabited by pagan tribes, the
                        majority of whom are men of immense stature, and some of whom are cannibals.
                        Roughly speaking, it will start from the junction of the Sobat and
                        Bahr-el-Ghazal rivers, and stretch- ing on both sides of the Nile will
                        extend to the northern border of Uganda and the north- east comer of the
                        Congo Free State. Running along the northern part of Lake Rudolph, it will
                        include the south-western boundary of Abyssinia. The region is largely one
                        of sudd and swamp, being intersected by the Upper Nile, which will form tho
                        principal route of communication. </p>
                    <p>It is only now, when, in the opinion of Lord Cromer and the Sirdar,the
                        political and general situation warrants it, that it is found possible to
                        reply to an appeal for a mission in this region which was made by General
                        Gordon nearly thirty years ago. The mission will link up Egypt aid Uganda.
                        The first party,' consisting of six mission aries, will leave Marseilles on
                        the 18th inst by the German steamer Schleswig, and hope to reach the scene
                        of their labours by Christmas. They take provisions for twelve months, and
                        expect to live for a considerable period in boats and tents. At Cairo, after
                        conferring with Lord Cromer, they will proceed to Khar toum, whence they
                        will travel by sailing boats, which will be acquired by tho mission, for
                        about 1,100 miles np the White Nile. Escorted by Arch lesson Gwyone of
                        Khartoum, they will first go right through the new district to its most
                        southerly point at Mongalla, a Government' station, near the borders of the
                        headquarters of the mission will be fixed near This point the only other
                        habitable place being Bir situatedon the line some distance to the north of
                        Lido. Tho Pagan tribes inhabiting this region include the Nuers, Dinks,
                        Shilluks, Baris, and Niam Niams. The whole of the vast areahassuffered
                        considerably from Dervish raids, but the natives are now regaining confi
                        dence. </p>
                    <p>An addition to the clergy who go with the pioneers, the party includes a
                        doctor from Poplar Infirmary, a carpenter from one of the County Council
                        technical schools, and an an agricultural expert. After escorting them to
                        Mongalla, where they will be met by Dr. da A. R. Cook, of the Uganda
                        yission, who still have medical supervision, for six months, Arohdeacon
                        Gwayne will return to his work at Khartoum. It is is tended at first to
                        commence industrial work among the pagans, and in time teach them to
                        manufacture bricks. It is hoped that a second party will be despatched 1
                        from England in July, and a third next autumn. Tho region indicated by Lord
                        Cromer was specially selected, so that the work in view du would not touch
                        tho Mohamedan population, and would not clash with the spheres occupied by
                        the Americans on the Sobat, and by the Austrian Roman Catholic Mission. In
                        in- dicating the new sphere to the Church Missionary Society, Lord Cromer
                        says: “It is bounded, on the north by the Bahr- ar el Ghazal, on the east by
                        a line proceeding south from the White Nile, starting at a point about
                        half-way between where the Nile is joined by the Bahr-el Zaraf, and where it
                        is joined by the Gahr el-Jebel to Ajiung, and thence southwards to Twi. From
                        Twi the line proceeds due east to the Abyssinian frontier and thence follows
                        the frontier to the Uganda border on tho fifth parallel of North Latitude.
                        On the south it is bounded by the northern do border Qf the Congo Free
                        State, the Lado en- clave, and the Uganda province; on the west, by a line
                        drawn from Marhre-el-Rek to a point where the frontiers of the Congo Free
                        State, the French’Grugftand the Bahr el Ghazal meet near N'Darama.</p>

                    <p>“Times."</p>
                    <p>The public are confident that the Agree ment will prove a bulwark of the
                        peace Asia for many years to come. .... We may admit at once that treaties
                        made on eqna terms between one Great Power and anothe; have their
                        disadvantages as well as theii advantages, like most other human arrange
                        ments. Bet the prejudice whicn condemn.- treaties in principle upon this
                        ground is in dotd old-fashioned. It depends on a conception of foreign
                        politics which never was altogethei correct, and which the modem
                        developments ol WiUpolitik have rendered quite out of date. ......All the
                        Great Powers now have in- terests and aspirations in parts of Asia elsewhere
                        where our interests are Vital. All of them believe in alliances and are
                        actually in aihancos, or ready to enter into alliances, for various objects.
                        Isolation in these condi- tions spells weakness, mid weakness, in the case
                        of a Power so wealthy as ourselves, is an invitation to aggression, the only
                        method ol preserving the peace of Asia is to confront any ambitions directed
                        against it by the ready arms of a coalition too strong to be defied. Our

                        arising out of the revelations of certain ol our Paris contempora- ries, and

                        certain to follow. Lately thero has been a riotous outburst of confidences
                        of this perilous nature ; Priuoe Buelow, Count Witte, and the inspirer of

                        Buelow should bavi given provocation, and that M. Delcaasd —if hi has really
                        inspired the "revelations"—should have taken up the challenge. Who profits

                    <p>It has always been the wish of the Boglisl Government and people to live on
                        good termi with Germany. We are oonacioue of no enmity towards the
                        Fatherland, and our only rivalry lies in the honorable field of commercial
                        com- petition. Nor shall we allow our polioy to b« altered, our judgment
                        disturbed, or even oui temper ruffled by the angry and ill-informed comments
                        of certain German pubdeists on the reoent action of Great Britain in regard
                        to French rights in Morooco. We regret to ob- serve, however, that a
                        hectoring tone has been taken up by journals which have hitherto ob served a
                        judicious moderation in their attitude toaarda ourselves. It is not
                        difficult to account for the irritation which they display. They art
                        uncomfortably consoious that the national diplomacy bas met with a sudden
                        and very nuplcasant check.................... Every State fir itself—that is
                        the Gerrman motto,and the sufficient answer is,“Forewarned forearmed."
                        Nevertheless the conspicuous fail of Berlin, in this instance as in others
                        proceeds from its insensibility to the feelirgi of nstions. Individually,
                        the German is by nr means harsh or selfish, bat the action of bii Government
                        is deplorably lacking /in regari for the finer feelings of humanity.</p>

                        of invasion. This is bound to be the Case for quite obvious and elementary
                        reasons, though some of anti-Germans seem to have great difficulty in
                        understanding it.</p>

                    <p>No useful purpose can concavely be Served by taking up the challenge of the
                        Ger- man Press to indulge in mutual recrinations or on paper. It is easy to
                        understand that the German nation and the German Government are in a state
                        of high tension and suffering from a bad attack of "nerves." That was
                        already the oase beforo the alleged revelations of the "Matin" found their
                        way to print. And now the official communique which graces the German Press
                        does its best to make the trouble worse. Its language is pompous, and
                        therefore absurd. To reply to it in kind would a be loss of dignity and
                        common sense. But the whole incident shows how "blazing" are the at
                        indiscretions of to-day. How sober and re- sponsible Ministers such as
                        Prince von Buelow (The fount and origin of the trouble) and M. Delcaise (the
                        supposed inspirer of the ^ "Matin") can venture to play with fire as they
                        have been doing, and continue to do, passes the ordinary comprehension.</p>

                    <p>An Anglo French alliance, destined, whether 30 desired or not, to arouse keen
                        anxiety in Ger- many, would be a source of great strength for England. It
                        would not, however, be a source er of strength for France. British
                        friendship is precious to us, and we wish to preserve it. The rapprochement

                        hand, would be a cause of disturbance in Europe which, while compromising
                        us, would in case of a conflict famish as with no sufficient guarantee. Our
                        natural position and our per- manent interest is to be the allies of Rossia
                        and the friends of England and Italy. . . If conflicts, which we do not
                        consider inevitable and which we shall contribute to avert in the higher
                        interest of civilisation, should unfor- tinnately break on, our army and
                        navy should have no other mission in a difference occurring in which we had

                        policy. se Apart from the Russian alliance, French policy in is and ought to

                    <p>If the account published by the "Matin” were tree, it would represent nothing

                        according to this account, have had no other object than a conflict between
                        Germany and France We are not inclined to believe that England, without any
                        out ward cause, came to the support of M. Delcasse with an offer of military
                        assistance. Assuming the truth of the story, it is much more probable that M

                        saw no way except war, and that be applied to Eng- land for military support
                        This would con- clusively prove that M. Dekassl had brought France to the
                        edge of war, and that the pro- Action of his policy would very probably have

                        political revolutions. I had been warned of the difficulties of the route

                        Omalos (4,000ft.) to the torrent bed below, than by anything similar in the

                        mountains. I was absolutely unarmed and rather taken aback when my servant

                        beheld two mu ales pointed at me at a distance of about a down yards. It was
                        money they wanted ; a hundred napoleons (£80) they demanded; but as I was
                        not inclin- ed to negotiate and it was impossible to escape, I adopted the

                        had most unfortunate results. Capital is shy, industry has suffered, and
                        life and property are unsafe, After the Powers had categorically refused, on
                        to May 13, the request of the Chamber for union in with Greece, the
                        insurgents adopted a more energetic propaganda, and the seizure of the town
                        of Vamos was followed in July by the capture of local customs houses.
                        Encounters bad so far been mainly convinced fined to Venezelo’s followers
                        and the gendarmes and foreign troops. Now they are taking place between
                        civilians, those — the great majority—who favor union and those whose
                        interest it la to keep in with the present Government. This is a very
                        serious development. At first the Powers treated the insurrection as a mere
                        outbreak of a dissatisfied party and failed to Attach importance to the
                        history of the last New year. During this period education, lan- guage,
                        commerce, and general communications have been so many links in tho chain
                        binding Crete to Greece, and instead of dealing with a Few armed bands led
                        by burgry politician, the Protecting Powers find themselves face to face
                        With a strong national majority whoM latent power will be sufficient to
                        prolong the struggle. At the outset I was loth to contemplate Crete joining
                        Greece, the material disadvantages to the former were obvious. 'Why no, said
                        I to many a village politician, 'gradually develop a real autonomy but after
                        journeying all over the island and meeting all classes of people, I from
                        shepherds to Dr. Sphakianakis himself, am convinced that outside the
                        Mussulmans nine-tenths of the Cretans favor anion with Greece, and that the
                        material disadvantages do not weigh with the racial feeling. Perhaps only
                        the educated realise the former, bat they are quite prepared to face them.
                        There is another reason, practical rather than senti- mental, which I do not
                        find mentioned, bat which continually came op in quiet talks with
                        villagers—that it the fear of annexation by one of the crest Powers. Soda
                        Bay is a tempt- ing harbour, and if yon refer to the solemn declaration of
                        the Protecting Powers on this point, the Cretan quietly and tersely

                    <p>The protecting Powers are faced with an increasingly awkward situation caused
                        by Prince George's failures in a very difficult position, their own
                        procrastination, and the political rivalry among the Cretans. As known to me
                        there were in July last only two bases— and these were considerable
                        compromises—on which the insurgents would treat One was the impossible coup
                        d/tat of Prince George going over to their camp, and the other the
                        appointment of an experienced Greek admi- nistrator in place of Prince
                        George, who could be trusted not to violate the censtitation. This, on the
                        understanding that anion should ultimately take place. This is as far as the
                        Cretan insurgents would go, but the difficulties in the way of acceptanoe by
                        the Powers have relation to Prince George and his connection to the crowned
                        beads of Europe. The Athenian papers which clamper for union would regard
                        Prince George’s return as a disgrace, which would refleet in a u-nature upon
                        the Greek Royal Family. Moreover, Prince George was the nominee of the
                        Emperor of Russia and the companion of his travel in the Far Bast Here,
                        then, is a deadlock out of which who shall deliver the Cretans"</p>

                    <head>THE TSETSE FLY.</head>
                    <p>Since the days of Dr. Livingstone, the tsetse fly has been known as
                        constituting one of the greatest difficulties of African travel in many
                        regions. It renders thousands of square miles of ’hat country uninhabitable,
                        and (says the “Globe") neither horses, cattle, nor dogs can venture into the
                        ‘ fly country.”Formerly it was thought that the fly injected poison into the
                        animals, and so killed them. It is now known, however, that the diseare is
                        due to a minute blood parasite, a tscrewshaped organism known as
                        trypanosoma, and that the fly only acts as a carrier. There parasites swim
                        freely in the blood, and often number several mil- lions in every drop. It
                        is a very remarkable fact that among the many blood sucking flies. which
                        exist in Africa, the tsetse (Glossina monitans) is the only one capable of
                        convey- ing the parasite from a diseased to a healthy animal. And the
                        explanation of this is that the parasite has the power of multiplying in the
                        body of this, and probably not is other flies. The former, at any rate, has
                        been demonstrated recently by Messrs. Gray and Tulloch, two Army medical
                        officers, who have been studying “sleeping sickness” in Uganda. Another
                        curious fact is that tsetse flies brought directly from the "fly country,”
                        where there is do disease, and allowed to bite healthy, cattle, at once
                        produce the disease. This has led to investigations, which have shown that
                        most of the wild animals of the country, buf- falo, koodoo, carry small
                        numbers of try- panosomas in their blood. These organisms, which multiply to
                        such an enormous extent in the blood of domestic animals, and produce such
                        disastrous effects, can live in small num- bers in the blood of wild animals
                        without any ill result. In a similar way, the trypanosome discovered by
                        Surgeon-Major Lewis in India in the blood of healthy rats, nausea a fatal,
                        disease in horses and dogs. This accounts for the fact that the test fly
                        disease disappears from a district as soon as the wild killed iff, or driven
                        away. At present, then, the extermination of the wild game seems to be the
                        only practical method for exterminating the disease.</p>
                    <p>That dread disease of the human subject, the “sleeping sickness," is similar
                        in its origin to the tsetse fly decrease of cattle. It is caused that is to
                        say, by a species of trypanosome in the blood, aid conveyed from one subject
                        to another by a specie) of tsetse-fly, "Glossina palpalis." And as the
                        parasite of the cattle disease exists in small number in the blood of
                        healthy wild animals, so this latter,trypanesa- probably occurs in some
                        other species in a similar way. The discovery of this natural reservoir of
                        the parasite would be a step towards the extermination of the dread "sleep-
                        ing sickness."</p>

                    <p>THE BRITISH CAPTIVE.</p>
                    <p>Some information regarding Mr. Philip Wills, the English gentleman whose fate
                        it for the moment matter of grave concern to the British Consular. officials
                        in Macedonia, has been received by Reuter's Agency. Hr. Graves, the Consul
                        General at Salonika, left on the 6th inst. for Moaastii; end it is believed
                        that his journey were prompted by the receipt of a cut-off ear together with
                        a letter affirming that it had been severed from the bead of Mr. Wills, who
                        was detained prisoner by brigands, and for whose release a ransom of £6.000
                        must be paid before the 14th last. Mr. Wills was captured by bandits in the
                        district of Monastir about the middle of July while ont shooting. About a
                        fortnight later a body was found near Ochrida, and it was declared that it
                        was that of Mr. Wills. A week later Hilmi Pasha, the Turkish Inspector
                        General in Macedonia, gave notice that the report of his death was an tree,
                        and that lit. Will* bed Joined a Greek bend. It was not until the beginning
                        of September that the troth leaked oat. Definite information was then
                        received that Mr. WiHr was alive bat was the prisoner of the tend of
                        brigands. Mr. Wills is about 37 years of age. He is the eon of an engineer
                        who was for many years engaged in work In Turkey, and is the brother of the
                        British Consoler Agent at Ismid Al- ways of an adventurous disposition, he
                        volun- teered for service with the British Army in the South African War.
                        While in South Africa however, he was thrown from his horse, and being
                        invalided home, returned to Turkey, where, through the influence of
                        relatives, be obtained an appointment with the Turkish Tobaccor Regia.</p>
                    <p>It is thought highly probable that the ear which has been sent to the British
                        Consulate at Salonika is not really that of Mr. Wills, but has been sent
                        with the idea of bringing pres- sure to tear in order the better to ensure
                        the payment of the ransom demanded. Those who are acquainted with affairs in
                        Macedonia do not think that the sum named (£6,000)is greater than the
                        brigade are likely to claim as on previous occasions soma no less con- s id
                        stable have been demanded as the ransom for the captives of bandits.</p>

                    <p>London, October 11.</p>
                    <p>A ceremony which cannot fail to be impos- ing has been arranged for
                        Wednesday, October 18, when the Kina-, who is to be accompanied, by the
                        Queen, will open Kingsway and Aid- wych, tho broad now thoroughfares
                        construe tel by the London County Council on the . Holborn to Strand
                        improvement. The order of the proceedings has been approved by his Majesty,
                        and nothing now retrains but to make the final preparations. The royal
                        procession will comprise four carriages, the first three for the suite and
                        the last fer the King and Queen, who will be attended by a cavalry escort
                        The route is to be by way of the Mall, Marlborongh-yard, Pall-mall,
                        Pall-mall Bast, Dancannon-street, and the Strand to the western end of
                        Aldwych, and thence through the new street to its junction with Kingsway,
                        where a ddi» is to be constructed. At this point their Majesties will be met
                        by the chairman of the council ; (Mr. B. A. Cornwall), the vice and deputy '
                        chairmen, the chairman of the Improvements Committee (Mr. J. Allen Baker),
                        the vice- , chairman and members of the committee, and , the clerk of the
                        counoil (Mr. G.^i Gomme). When the King and Queen have taken their i seats
                        on the day, Miss Bernice Cornwall will present a bouquet to her Majesty,
                        after which the chairman of the council will read an ad- dress to his
                        Majesty on behalf of the London County Council Then will come the most
                        important item of the programme. After re plying to the address, the King
                        will be pre- sented with a gold key. with which he will unlock the gates
                        erected temporarily to dose the thoroughfares, and will then declare Kings-
                        way and Aldwych open for the use of the public, a declaration which will be
                        received with a flourish of trumpets. </p>
                    <p>Subsequently their Majesties will be asked to accept bound copies of a
                        descriptive account of the improvement, and to sign the council's record of
                        their presence on the occasion of the opening. </p>
                    <p>Before returning to Buckingham Palace the royal procession will drive right
                        along the new thoroughfare, passing the platform opening to the new
                        underground tramway and the site of the School of Arts and Crafts, which is
                        to be built by the Council in Kingsway. Their Majesties will cross Holborn
                        and proceed right to tho end of the improvement, through Southampton-row and
                        thence through Vernon- place, Hart-street, Oxford-street, Regent street,
                        Waterloo place, and so back to the Palace. The details as to what guards of
                        honor are to be mounted are not settled as yet, but troops will line both
                        sides of the new street and its approaches, probably being furnished from
                        the London garrisons.</p>
                    <p>At the meeting of the London County Coun- cil to-morrow, the General Purposes
                        Committee will bring up a report with regard to the opening of Kingsway and
                        Aldwycb. They will state that they are carefully considering the
                        arrangements to be made in connection with the opening ceremony, and have
                        pot forward an estimate of £5,000 to meet the necessary expenses. They
                        recommend that the estimate be approved and authorised. In connection with
                        the same matter, the Finance Committee will submit that they have received
                        an esti- mate from the General Purposes Committee for the outlay of £5,000,
                        and have no observations to oiler on the matter. Mr. Russell 8poke‘ will
                        recommend that the matter be referred back for further consideration.</p>
                    <p>At the meeting of the Holborn Borough Council on Wednesday. Councillor Keen
                        will move a motion asking the County Council to change the name of that
                        portion of Southamp- ton Row between Theobalds-road and High Holborn to
                        Kingsway before the day of the opening ceremony.M </p>
                    <p>On January 25 next Admiral Sir John Fisher reaches the age of sixty.five, and
                        would, consequently, be retired under the age rule did circumstances permit
                        But it is out of the question that an officer called to the all important
                        post of First Sea Lord to carry out a great policy of reform should be
                        obliged to quit bis post after only some sixteen months' service—long before
                        his work is accomplished. Despite the fact, therefore, that the number of
                        Admirals of the Fleet is already shove the establishment, we may confidently
                        expect to see Sir John promoted to that rank by special O der in Council. In

                        accept the promotim, and to continue in office. But it is wort a while to
                        inquire st what rate a private firm would estimate the value of Sir John
                        Fisher's »«i and what a grateful country thinks adequate remuneration for
                        them. The Portsmouth com mand. which be relinquished to become First Sea
                        Lord, is worth £4,000 a year. The salary of b-s pie ent office is £2,500. No
                        one doubts for one moment that Sir John Fisher ie con- tent to be in the
                        position in which be can best serve his country, even though thereby he
                        incurs a pecuniary loss ; but this is niggardly treatment on the part of the
                        country, and a poor inducement to officers of ability to con- tinue in the
                        public service. There is, I believe, precedent in the case of Lord Hood of
                        Avalon for making a grant in recognition of distinguish- ed service. Surely,
                        when Sir John Fisher is asked to continue his work, it would be a fitting
                        time for a simile r recognition of services almost unparalleled to be made
                        to him. No one can doubt that the proposal of a grant would meet with ready
                        acquiescence. Princess Christian has greatly gratified the Aberdonians by
                        visiting their city twice within a week, each time in the interests of
                        charity, the first time for the purpose of seeing the infirmary, where she
                        displayed a knowledge of nursing detail and hospital administration that
                        somewhat surprised her guiders . She also on that occasion visited Lady
                        Cathcart’s Training Institute for Girls. Lord Aberdeen was wearing the dress
                        of a Highland chief—a kilt of Gordon tartan, grean oat, and Scotch bonnet
                        with the clan badge of the Gordons—when he presided at the meeting of the
                        Soldier's and Sailors' Aid Society at Aberdeen the other day. which the
                        presence of Princess Christian made such a splendid success. That Lord and
                        Lady Aberdeen are immensely popular in the city from which they take their
                        name is evident to eve* the casual visitor, for both have the heartiest
                        greeting whenever they appear in public. Lord Aberdeen was an admirable
                        chairman at the med'ing. tactful and genial, and with kindly and
                        appreciative words for all who help the work of the society of which he is
                        president, especially for its able secretary, the Hop^ Mrs. Forbes, of Brux.
                        Lady Aberdeen had quite an ovation when she appeared on the platform with
                        General Sir Charles Tucker. She is president of the Aberdeenshire branch of
                        the Soldiers' and Sailors' Families Association, so that, as Lord Aberdeen
                        jocularly remark; d, there is a sort of diplomatic matrimonial alliance
                        between the two societies, ai d they are not likely to quarrel.</p>
                    <p>Lady Aberdeen, who is just now almost constantly with her daughter Lady
                        Marjorie Sinclair at Tarland, was looking remarkably handsome in a gown of
                        mauve cloth with beautiful sables and mauve ‘oque. Before the meeting she
                        was talking gaily with General Tucker, whose uniform made a variety on the
                        dress of the civic fathers present to wel- Come e the Princess. Sir Charles
                        was one of Lady Gordon Cathcart's many distinguished guests at Cluny. Castle
                        to meet Prince's Christian and her daughter.</p>
                    <p>We should like to be more folly informed as to the reasons which have led
                        General Booth to abandon, for the present, his wide and far- reaching scheme
                        of emigration to Australis. That he should have encountered a certain amount
                        of passive resistance to his ideals in certain of tho States cannot have
                        been a shock to one so well versed in men and politics. Wo deplore the
                        existing opinions by which the Australasian democracy is largely swayed, for
                        they ore in their more pronounced manifesta- tions, as childishly wrong
                        headed an they are self-destrnctive. Bat we do not despair of a change of
                        mind. Nor is it easy to acknow- ledge that a known state of affairs is a
                        suffi- cient bar to an experiment which promised so well that it received
                        the hearty support of public opinion in England and Mr. Deakin' warm
                        approval. There may be misconception as to the quality of the Army's
                        emigrants. There should be easily removed. There may be other obstacles of a
                        temporary nature. But we hope that the large plan is only deferred, and that
                        the ‘ small contingents" will prove an earnest of future success.</p>
                    <p>If we accept the torching of Dr. Plehn, a speaker at the German CoWal
                        Conference, we shall attribute the brutal excesses of German and Belgian
                        officials when set to govern white men to 'tropencholer,” or tropi- cal
                        frenzy. An official with tropical frerrv, says Dr. Plehn, is not responsible
                        for his actions, however criminal they may be. Tho disease gets hold of him
                        jnst like creeping paralysis, an affliction with which it has much in
                        common. It is true that experience shows the deterioration of many white men
                        under the enjoyment of unlimited authority. Bat a tortured native of the
                        Congo or German South- West Africa does not derive much consolation from the
                        statement that his woes were inflict- ed by a madman, nor is the star cast
                        upon the white races mitigated by the same knowledge We most beware of
                        condoning brutality by the excuse that it was inflicted daring temporary
                        insanity. Colonisers are called on to fight their own lower dispositions as
                        well as the more easily conquerable obstacles with which they are faced.
                        Unless they can master themselves as well as the natives they are not worthy
                        the name of pioneers of civilisation.</p>
                    <p>The rapture of an Englishman by brigands in the neighbourhood of Monastir is
                        a warning to travellers not to trust themselves in that Part of Turkey
                        without a proper esoort. The wretched incapacity of the Turkish administra-
                        on makes such a precaution absolutely neces- Sary, though, as a matter of
                        fact, in most of these cases-the brigands are perfectly well- known, and
                        could be suppressed with very little trouble. A British Consol at Salonica,
                        from which place the news of this capture comes, years ago expressed his
                        conviction that with half a squadron of horsemen and leave to Use them in
                        his own way he would clear the whole province of brigands in a fortnight In
                        the meantime, it remains really dangerous for travellers who are supposed to
                        be worth a ransom.</p>
                    <p>It is not an easy matter to determine quite who among the bishops would make
                        the best President of a Church Congress, for in what- ever part of the conn
                        try' these annual eccle- Siastical gatherings are held there is an able and
                        scholarly man ruling over the spiritual fortunes of that diocese in which
                        the Congress town is situated. Weymouth being in his diocese, the Bishop of
                        Salisbury has been call- ed upon to perform the presidential functions at
                        this year’s meetings. Dr. Wordsworth's father was the bishop of- that name,
                        and he is a great-nephew of the poet.</p>
                    <p>A glance at any account of the Bishop’s life shows that he has had quite a
                        remarkable career. After leaving Oxford he went as master to Wellington
                        College, but war soon transferred to Brasenose as tutor. His scholar- ship
                        and training gave him several import- ant positions in the Church, Dr.
                        Wordsworth having interested himself in a variety of sub- jects of a
                        literary and religious character. Latin classical literature, the Latin New
                        Test- mont, the Education Question, the Old Ca- tholic Movement, the
                        Colonial Churches, the Eastern Churches, liturgical questions, and Church
                        History and Doctrine are some of the subjects in which he takes a keen
                        interest The Bishop of Salisbury is* one of the most travelled of prelates,
                        having been all over the Colonies, in most parts of Europe, and visited
                        several of the Patriarchs of the Eastern Church at Constantinople,
                        Jerusalem, Alexandria, and Damascus.</p>
                    <p>Justice would not suffer, and society would benefit from an extension of the
                        spirit of sympathy displayed by a detective and a magistrate at Middlesex
                        Quarter Sessions. The prisoner was an exconviot who had gone far towards
                        living down a reputation for going on burglarious expeditions with a loaded
                        revolver in his pocket and shooting at policemen. Por mx years he had been
                        "going straight" had married and proved excellent husband and father, had
                        worked bard and honestly to keep together bis little home. Then being
                        pressed for money, he had stolen a quantity of wood. The usual course with’
                        that man would have been to bring the criminal part of his record against
                        him, and send, him to gaol again for a long period. Thereby he would have
                        been im- pressed with tho futility of trying to "go straight,” and would
                        have relapsed into bis former way of life, a misery to himself and a terror
                        to other people. The detective in charge of the case happened, however, to
                        be an Officer who could appreciate even an exconvict’s better side. He told
                        the bench the best be could of the mao, and the bench approved his action by
                        giving the prisoner another chance. If notice of such practical sympathy'
                        were shown, we might hear less of the impossibility of a lost character
                        being regained. </p>
                    <p>The experiences of Mr. Mark Hambourg, the pianist, in the colonies, have been
                        precisely similar to that of many other virtuosos. He declares ho found the
                        appreciation of classical music extraordinary and gratifying. Mr. Ham- bourg
                        never tried to play popular music, and was never compelled to in order la
                        draw audiences. Nothing exasperates the colonial so much— whether in South
                        Africa, Australasia, or Canada—as to be tried with too popular a per-
                        formance of any kind, or to be suspected of being incapable of appreciating
                        the classical. Audiences take art and culture seriously ; a very popular
                        vocalist who toured the Empire not long ago with surprisingly little
                        suocess, only discovered after months that this was due to the fact he bad
                        been singing ballads. Lon- doners who are sure of their position in the
                        world of art, and only want to be entertained, make one of the most easily
                        pleased audiences in the world.</p>
                    <p>Having always expressed the view that sooner or later sixpenny fares would
                        become a necessity of the cab industry, I welcome the announcement of the
                        London Cabowners’ Federation that they intend once more to try the
                        experiment, and in association, too, with the taxameter. Cabby has always
                        set his face against the sixpenny minimum, but, consider- ing the
                        ever-increasing competition now accen- tasted by the motor omnibuses and the
                        electrified underground, he will be foolish indeed if be again resolutely
                        sets his face against this reform It is for the short journey that the cab
                        is now so much needed, and when the distance can be covered for sixpence it
                        Is certain the use of cabs will be largely increased. All that the system
                        needs is a fair trial.</p>

                    <p>SOME INTERESTING FACTS</p>
                    <p>Writing on the subject in the New York ‘Tribune," Mr. C. P. Holder wye that a
                        few year ago some farmers in the vicinity of the Saco River, in sailing over
                        it, discovered what appeared to be an artificial dam of stones, and it was
                        suggested that at an early date the natives of the region had been seised
                        with a desire to dam op the river and had started a breakwater, bat had been
                        forced to abandon it The structure was fifteen or twenty feet in length,
                        three or four in height, and two or three feet through. The theory of the
                        human origin of the work held for year; but finally one day an inquisitive
                        man went to one of the farmers a man who seemed fond of plants, fishes, and
                        animals of all kinds, and it was not long before he heard the story and had
                        examined the stone dam or breakwater, and bad a well-defined plan of it on
                        paper. Not only this, he spent hours on the river floating over the curious
                        structure, studying it from all points. Finally, one day he announced that
                        he had learned how it was made and who the builders were. This aroused much
                        interestamong the neigh- hours, and not a little laughter when he stated
                        that the so-called dam was made by lamprey eels, and was their-nest, a
                        castle, a stone for- tress for the protection of their young. While the nest
                        of the stone toter or sucker was a mountain-peak, a pile of stones, this was
                        a miniature mountain-range, a breakwater fifteen feet long by three in
                        height, each stone of which had been carried to the spot by the builders. No
                        little intelligence was displayed by the lampreys in their work. Some of the
                        stones that composed the nest were as large as half a brick, and the
                        observer saw the fishes bringing them, two eels being fastened to each
                        stone. Such material was sought up the river, doubtless so that the current
                        could be employ- ed. The lamprey is an eel with a peculiar sucker-like
                        mouth. Two fishes would swim about till they found a large stone : they then
                        would fasten their mouths to it, and by squir- ming lift it from the bottom,
                        and the moment it was clear the swift current would sweep them down the
                        stream in the direction of the nest. If the weight of the stone carried them
                        to the bottom, the action would be repeated indefinitely, or until they wore
                        carried or swept over the nest, when the load would be dropped. Individual
                        stones were brought by single Gibes almost always in tbe same way, the tail
                        being held upward or vertically to offer the greatest resistance to the
                        current, which at this locality was swift. How long the nest had been in
                        course of erection no one knew, but doubtless a bomber of years were
                        required to produce a structure that mort bare weighed several tons. In
                        their home or neat-building the fishes recall the birds, and in some
                        instances the resemble no o is pronounoed, a notable one being the common
                        stickleback, the several varieties building complicated and birdlike nests.
                        The stickleback is a pugnacious little creature, with an armament of spines
                        that makes it dreaded by larger fishes. Nearly, if not all, make nests, and
                        when kept in an aquarium their movements may he watched from day to day. . .
                        When the material collected teemed to suit the builder—the male fish—be
                        would life it about, change it after some architectural plan of his own,
                        then rud- denly butt into the mass bead first and force his way into it with
                        a wriggling motion,-rub- bing himself against it, and going over it with the
                        rubbing motion, until after several days an object was seen, of irregular
                        egg-shape, with an orifice about the site of the fish through it This had
                        been shaped and moulded by the nest-builder. . . At last the middle portion
                        is large enough so that the stickleback can poise or rest in it, an 1 then
                        the nest is com plete. This is the type of nest most common, and hundreds
                        may be seen in localities effect ed by these fishes. Others are suspended
                        from twigs that have become water-logged and suspended between twigs or
                        branches, or are placed beneath projecting lodges of rock. When completed,
                        the fish bunts up his mate and drives or escorts her to the neat and
                        present# the mansion to her. She accepts -it, deposits her eggs or spawn in
                        the Interior and imme- diately deserts them, leaving them to the mercy of
                        the male, who having been the house-builder now becomes the nurse.</p>

                    <p>This is a condition (or disease) to which doctors give many names, but which
                        few of them really understand. It it simply weakness—a break-down, as it
                        were, of the vital forces that sustain the system. No matter what may be its
                        causes (for they are almost numberless), its symptoms are much the same; the
                        more prominent being sleeplessness, sense of prostration or weariness,
                        depression of spirits and want of energy for all the ordinary affairs of
                        life. Now, what alone is absolutely essential in all such cases is increased

                    <p>to throw off these morbid feelings, and experience proves that as night

                        conditions, in either sex; and it is difficult to imagine a case of disease
                        or derangement, whose main features are those of debility, that will not be
