                    <p>SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 16, 1908.</p>
                    <p>FRANCE, GERMANY AND MOROCCO.</p>
                    <p>After the complete understanding at which
                        Franoe and Germany have arrived on the points at issue between them, there remains nothing farther to decide bat the date and whereabouts of the Conference. It is plain, however, by certain notice. It is  the Press, both
                        of this Great Britain and of France, that there is still a haziness, as to Germany's attitude with regard to the soope of the Conference. The view has several times been expressed that an agreement could speedily be arrived at, and that Germany should not be supposed to be placing any sort of difficulty in the way. But the confasion which these various reports published from time to time in the European . Press argue, as to not only the state of the negotiations, bat as to the Ten raiton d'ltre of the Conferenoe itself, demands a plain state¬ment of the situation as a page in history. It may, however, be noted that reports of the itate of affairs ooming through Paris must al-ways be 
                        examined with caution, many so-called sourcee of information being governed by one
                        other of those faotions who to-day hold rival views on the subjeot of Moroooan polioy, and who seem none too anxious to admit a settle¬ment.
                        Briefly, then, all Europe, and particularly Franoe, has beoome tired of Oriental intrigue and incompetence as evidenced io almost every aotion of the Saltan of Moroooo. In the eyes of Europe England has reoognised the paramount interests of France in the country, and has refrained from urging certain claims she might have urged, and it is no secret that the quid pro quo ia K strengthened footing in Egypt. Her support,” then, is, in a certain sense, "a standing aside." When a number of demands mado upon the Sultan on behalf of france were referred by that nomad to Germany, as one of the signatories                                                                                  to the Treaty of Madrid, it was observed that these "demands" or "clainn”— -all them what you will—had not been formally put before the Imperial Government, and an exchange of notes between France and Germany became not only necessary, but, from a Europoan stand¬point, highly desirable. In the earlier stages of the discussion, some slight divergence of views may not unnatarally have been evinced, bat certain it is that a complete understanding and agreement has now been arrived at. Moreover, if there was one point upon which no difference of opinion existed at all, it was ths' policing of the frontier by France. As for the questions of the Tangier breakwater and the loan, these are purely private mattere for private speculation and arrangement To suggest, as has been sug¬gested, that the referring of the police causes to the Confereunce is in the nature of a hitch in the negotiations, is to misunderstand the whole question of the Conference from first to last, the whole idea of whioh was, and is, that it shall ratify every point raised, and -has seoare all Europe from the possibility ■if the Saltan again panning that favorite Oriental plan of playing off one Power against mother. The position, thee, is that Franoe and Germany ore agreed on the points raised, and the members of the Cinfereuoe will be called open to attest by their signatures at onoe their witness and their recognition of the understanding.

                    <p>LONDON, September 15. Much speculation has been aroused by the
                        circumstances of the wreck of the British S.S. John Grafton on the Finnish coast. She was fully laden with arms and ammunition. The Custom officers who. boarded the wreck were obliged to retreat by the crew, who threatened to shoot them. Eventually the crew disappeared, and their whereabouts remains a mystery. It is stated that the captain of the John Grafton was a brother of Schaumann, the assassin of General Bobrikoff, on the 16th June, 1901. Rumours have reached Paris that the Finns are preparing disagreeable surprises for Russia.

                        M. Savorgnan de Brazza has died. (Zfowtt)
                        M. Savorgnan de Brazza was born of Italian parents at Rome in 1852. He became a natur¬alised Frenchman in 1874, entered the French marine,and in 1875 obtained a subvention from the French Government to explore the Upper Ogowe or Gaboon River. He ascended the river bo a point 688 kilometres from the sea, advanced to the east and discovered the source of the Alima. Prevented by the hostility of the natives from moving further eastward he struck north, discovered the Lioona river and finally made his way back in a state of destitution to the Gaboon. On returning to Europe he heard of Stanley’s descent and discovery of the Upper Congo, and,realising the importance of his own discovery of the Ogow4-Lioona route to the Congo above its rapids, set out in 1879 and founded two stations, Franceville and Brazza¬ville on the Congo. In 1880 he concluded a treaty wi h King Makoko by which that ruler placed his kingdom under French protection, and after further important explorations and discoveries returned in 1882 to Europe.
                        In 1886 de Brazza was appointed High Com-missioner to the French Government in West Africa, organised the colony of French Congo, and launched steamers on the Congo and the Ogow4. Invalided home, he returned to the Congo in 1890, and remained as High Commis¬sioner with direct authority over the Gaboon district till 1897. His great knowledge of and popularity with, the natives caused him to be sent out to Africa very recently to enquire into certain scandals in which European officials were implicated. There are few more distin gnished names in the history of African ex¬ploration.

                    <head>NOTES FROM PORT SAID.</head>
                    <p>THE CHATHAM.</p>
                    <p>(FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT).,
                        Port Said, Friday.
                        Confirming my telegram of to-day I may mention that I learn that several gentlemen, including Messieurs Tillier and Coullaut and also Mr. Nobell,the well known expert and manu¬facturer of high explosives, together with one or two members of the council of the Suez Canal administrators, are to arrive here on Wednes¬day, when they, in collaboration with the Army experts already called, will go tho¬roughly into this matter. The position of affairs at present is decidedly unsatisfactory. Ships pass the Chatham (which is now completely submerged with the exception of fannel and mask) at undoubtedly grave risk ; every precaution possible seems to have been taken in the matter of having tugs and other material on the spot to aid vessels which pass her, but there is no gainsaying the fact that the least slip, which might end in the pacing  vessel colliding with the Chatham, would   probably mean the explosion of the latter and consequent great damage to both ships.	 
                        I heard that the spontaneous explosion of the vessel,which I believe might easily occur owing to the chemical action of salt water on the detonators which form part of the cargo, , has been thought seriously of and every prepara¬tion has been made for the event of such a disaster taking place. The fresh water canal has been barred at intervals with bags of sand and a special watch is being set in the locality.
                        It is rumoured that Mr. Nobell has an idea by which the power of the explosives on board this unfortunate ship may ba rendered harm¬less. Let us hope it is so, for under no matter what condition the vessel lays the gravest anxiety will be felt by all in the vicinity until something very radical is proposed and carried through successfully. Port Said, which lies only nine miles from the scene of the wreck, would, in the event of an explosion, suffer very considerably. Water, which is brought here by a canal on the maritime canal west bank, would undoubtedly soon fail ; railway and all other communication except via the lake would be completely out off and it would, I imagine, mean at least two or three weeks of very hard work before a ship could pass the spot with safety—which would mean on accumulation of probably 150 vessels each side of kilometre 9 in the period mentioned. The arrival of the commission is anxiously awaited, for though the town itself would hardly suffer, directly, that is to say, the effects of the actual stock would probably not do any damage beyond breaking a few panes of glass, considerable anxiety will be felt till such a source of danger is removed.
                        Tiro dredgers are however at work widening the channel on the west side of the wreck which entails stopping all traffic to-day and perhaps to morrow, but which will greatly help in removing the present danger to passing ships Since the fire, no ships appear to have been allowed to pass the spot at night, in fact all seems to have been done that could have been iu such a dfficult and dangerous position.

                        Canal traffic during the day has been resumed this morning with intervals for dredg¬ing. No vessels are allowed to pass through after dark. *

                    <p>Sir—I beg to call your attention to the erroneous quotation given of the shares of the Egyptian Trust and Investment, Ltd. in your editions of the 14th and 15th inst. under the rubric of London Stock Exchange, Friday, September 8th.
                        Amongst the different nomenclatures of shares, etc., you quote the EgyptianTrust and Investment Ltd. at 1/8 discount.
                        I must ask you to rectify this error in the columns of your paper at once, as it has already caused as no end of serious inconve¬nience and complaints. More especially as the itations in London on Friday the 8th Sept, for the shares of the Egyptian Trust and In¬vestment Ltd. were 9/16 premium.
                        I take this opportunity of mentioning that the the shares of company have never been below par either in London or elsewhere, and I feel certain that you will take an immediate opportunity of rectifying the mistake. .

The accident occured at about 11 a.m., and the sufferer was hot re¬moved to hospital until 1 p.m. The whole of this time was taken by the police authori¬ties in going through the usual formula, viz. taking the procces verbal. No doctor was summoned,, or at any rate appeared on the scene daring the whole time. Comment needless. —I am, Sir, etc.

                    <p>To THE EDITOR OF THE EGYPTIAN GAZETTE.
                        Sir, — The situation of the Casino, Sau Stefano, is so excellent and the managing staff so courteous and obliging, that I shall not he mis understood if I attempt to point out those few defects, important or trifling, which mar the pleasure of so many visitors.
                        The place is a ..focus of noise : we live, prac- tically speaking, in a megaphone, through which sounds, for the most part disagreeable, are projected both day and night.
                        'One is awoke betimes by the airy badinage of the native servant (who imagines somehow that the dosing of a thin door renders him in¬audible), conversing with his raucous mates. After breakfast—a well arranged meal—the real trouble of the day begins : the children, with their nurses begin to arrive : and the horrible monotonous chant of the paper- seller begins: “Sheepshian Gassett,” “Far Dalexauderee.” *
                        The nurses, often the parents, have not the smallest idea of keeping their charges reason¬ably quiet : here a scion of Themistodes blows a shrill tin trumpet, there the young hope of oppressed Armenia teats upon an empty biseuittin. Cresoit opus : the din grows space swelled by effeudis in lemon coloured button boots, sipping syrups and loudly jesting, until, about 1 p.m., . the assembly seems to ooze a- way, and luncheon is upon us.
                        This, although too long a mealr is, in its way excellent Some day perhaps, the manage¬ment will invest in toast racks (at present the toast comes in like a hot poultice in a napkin), and salt-cellars that hold salt, and salt spoons (metal not bone) that will do something.
                        “After luncheon rest, a while”—not here there is no rest for the weary : a few babies begin to yell: the electric fittings are put up, or taken down : the AOOT is repaired : waiters push forward each chair (heaven knows why) noisily and push it hack again?
                        * The sun gets lower, and the shooting more desperate : the near East, having taken its exercise for the day (a drive from Ramleh to the Casino) is upon us. The near East, very much dressed, and with pale pathetic daughters, rolls in, talks, laughs, and drinks beer with even increasing fervour, until about 7.30 p.m., heedless of the orchestra, the sea, the world’s news, heedless of everything except the rest of the near East that watches it closely but uneasily, while livers give in, and figures—give out—I am, Sir, etc.

                    <p>Trams representing the above opened the
                        'ootball season at Kasr-el-Nil with a challenge match, and about 1,500 spectators were present when the teams lined out in the following order : —
                        Ssrgts. Goal, Thompson ; backs, Behan, and Boody; halves, Crothers, Walker, and Grace ; forwards,Guerin, Mowbray, Packer, Power, and McAuley.
                        Corpls. Goal, Dolan ; baoks, Crilly, and O’Neill; halves, Lei tch, Millar, and MoLoughilin; forwards, Russell, Montgomery, Collins, Aitken, and Rafferty.
                        The Corporals won the spin of the coin, and decided to defend the Museum goal. Packer set the ball going, but a foul checked their progress, and the next few minutes saw Behan and Doody busily engaged, Doody doing excel¬lent work. The teams had scarcely yet got settled down, and the play was rather wild, but the Sergeants were the first to find their footing. Mowbray essayed a lovely shot, which Dolan neatly negotiated, and cleared his charge for some time, as Millar got the ball at his toe, and after dodging through the backs, sent in a stinger to Thompson, who cleared in his old style, but Collins getting the hall on the rebound sent in an unsaveable grounder to Thompson, who had no chance of Saving, thus making the first score for the Corporals.The Ser- geants resumed strongly,and a run by McAuley looked promising but O’Neill intercepted,causing a foul. This, however, proved of no advantage. Aitken missed badly with none save Thompson to challenge and eventually Russell volleyed to the wrong Bide. The Sergeants then assumed the aggressive and gained a comer; Guerin centred nicely but Leitch cleared amidst great applause. With the Corporals leading the game became most exciting. The Sergeants redoubled their efforts, and fine efforts by Gaerin, Mow¬bray, and Packer, were put forth to draw level, but all of no avail, as O’Neill and Crilly were in fine form and repelled all attacks. Play at this stage became very exciting, Rafferty get¬ting on a fine run sent in a stinger, 'which Thompson saved at the expense of a comer, which, however, did not pay as Doodiy cleared in fine style. Good play op the part of the Corporals’ forwards caused the Sergeants’. de¬fence some anxiety,but Thompson was very safe, and cleared some difficult shots from Rafferty, Collins, and Montgomery. Play now took a turn, and the Sergeants were the aggressors. Mowbray and Guerin did some good work and McAuley got away on a fine run, and dodging Crilly hid an open goal before him hat to the astonishment of the spectators, he tripped and fell, and Dolan rushing out cleared his goat The game at this stage became fast and famous; but no further scoring took place, half-time arriving with the Corporals leading Half-time score Corporals 1 Goal. Ser¬geants Nil.
                        In the second half the Sergeants early invad¬ed, Mowbray being responsible for a nice piece of work. A cheer went op from the spectators, when Guerin shot, and the hall landed in the net, but it was the portion of the net outside the post, and their joy was short-lived. The Sergeants were playing a determined game tod Dolan was called upon to save time after time, which he did in magnificent style. A splendid long shot by Walker just topped the bar, and from the kick-off Rafferty broke away, but Crothers, who was playing a nice steady game, came to the rescue. High kicking was indulged in by the backs on both sides, and as a result play suffered. A fine bout of dose passing between McAuley and Power ended in a shot by McAuley which grazed the upright. Packer made several attempts to get through, but was too closely watched. O’Neill gave away a comer to save bis goal, and Dolan was again prominent with a fine save. The Corporals’ forwards, by a magnificent comhined ran, carried play into the Sergeants’ goal, Behan clearing with a ponderous kick. Grace created considerable amusement by his defensive tactics and the way in which lflie feinted. Both teams at this stage appeared to be fairly done, the want of training being apparent in many cases. Elay slowed down, nothing of note occurring for a considerable time, till a nice spell of clever forward play by the Sergeants livened up matters/ Referee Walsh appeared to be very strong on the off-side rule, some of his decisions, zhowever, not meeting with the entire approval of the spectators. ’With the Sergeants playing finely there was every prospect of an exciting finish. Packer gave Dolan a hot one to save, he saved once, and running out to clear again he was beaten by Power, thus drawing the score level amidst great applause. After the kick-off both sides put forth great efforts to secure the winning goal, and for a time the Sergeants held the upper hand. The Corporals then forced matters, bat Russell failed to score from a good open¬ing. Toward the close the players showed signs of fatigue, and the end of a stubbornly con¬tested game arrived without any additional score. Result:—
                        Sergeants	  1	Goal
                        Corporals	   1	Goal
                        The Corporals are highly pleased at .the splendid manner in which the Sergeants enter-tained them after the match. They were treated to an ample supply of beet, minerals, etc, which goes a long way to shot the good feel¬ing that prevails between the senior and junior N.C.O.’s of the Battalion

                <head>THE ATROCITIES ON THE
                    CONGO.
                </head>
                <p>A REPLY TO SIR ALBERT ROLLIT</p>
                <p>Mr. E. D. Morel, the hon. secretary of the Congo Reform AssooiatioN, has issued a com- munication, in which here: On the evening of September 5 Sir Albert Kaye Rollit M.F. Knight, Commander of the Order of Leopoldo, speaking at a banquet given at Liege to the Associated Chambers of Commerce, is reported by Reuter’s Agency to have said:
                    "I well know that it has been said that the Congo was the scene of atrocities, but I assure you that the larger proportion of the British nation consider these reports - calumny.”
                    Reuter’s telegram accentuates the fact that the applause which followed this statement "was led by the British Minister" (Sii Constantine Phipps).
                    In this connexion the hon. secretary of the Congo Reform Association calls attention to the five following official statements—viz :
                    1.	The resolution voted unanimously by the House of Commons on May 20, 1903:
                    “Resolved,that the Government of the Congo Free State having, at its inception, guaranteed to the Powers that its native subjects should be governed -with humanity and that no trading monopoly or privilege should be per¬mitted within its dominions, this House re¬quests H. M. Government to confer with the other Powers, signatories of the Berlin General Act, by virtue of which the Congo Free State exists, in order that measures may be adopted to abate the evils prevalent in that State.
                    2.	Extract from the British Note to the Powers, August 8, 1903 :
                    “There is a feeling of grave suspicion, widely prevalent among the people of this country, in regard to the condition of affairs in the Congo State, and there is a deep conviction that the many charges brought against the State’s ad¬ministration must be founded upon a basis of truth.’’
                    3.	Extract from Lord Lansdowne's Memor-andum to Sir Constantine Phipps, February 11, 1904:
                    “The descriptions given in the report (Consul Casement’s) of the manner in which the ad-ministration is carried on, and the methods by which the revenue is collected in the districts visited by Mr. Casement, constitute a grave indictment”
                    4.	Extract from the speech of the Under-secretary of State for Foreign Affaire, June 9,
                    1904.
                    "Mr. Casement’s report has been quoted at length, and hon. members have referred to cases of atrocities reported by missionaries and traders j but I do not think that it is necessary to go into the evidence of Mr. Case¬ment or others in order to substantiate the speoifio allegations which we have made. We have only to look at the actual findings of the
                    Courts in the Congo state itself.	When the
                    United Stales, first, and the European Govern-ments, subsequently, recognised the existence in the Congo Basin of a Govenment possessed of a national status, that recognition was accorded not to the Congo state, but to an association professing an international char¬acter, and proclaiming before the world as the object of its being, not the accumulation of rubber at an infinite poet of human life and suffering, but the protection and civilisation of the natives of Africa.”
                    5.	Extract from the letter of Lord Lans-downe to the hon. secretary of the Congo Reform Association, August 31, 1905:
                    "Instructions have been sent to his Majesty’s Minister at Brussels to communicate to the Congo Government the summary of recent outrages annexed to your letter.”
                    Mr. Morel continues: “A single comment seems necessary, followed by a single question. If the accuracy of Reuter s telegram be pot disputed, Sir Albert Rollit has stated—and the accredited representative of Great Britain to Belgium has applauded the statement— that ‘the larger proportion of the British people’ consider that the House of Commons and the British Government have, in this matter, been guilty of propagating a calumny. Such being the case, what claim has Sir Albert Rollit to voice the ‘greater proportion of the British people’, and on what grounds does Sir Constantine Phipps continue to represent Great Britain in Belgium I"

                    <p>Liverpool, September 7</p>
                    <p>There has been only a moderate business in Egyptian Cotton this week, without change in quotations. The better qualities of Metafifa are scarce, but those below Fully Good Fair are plentiful, and difficult of sale.
                        In Futures only a small business has been done, and the following are the latest values— Sep. 7.38 Nov. 7.24 Jan. 7.12 Oct 7.29 Dec. 7.18 Feb. 7.11 Mar. 7.10
                        AMERICAN. FUTURES. — The Market thia week has been fairly active, aDd although there have been frequent unimportant fluctuations, the tendency has been downward, and to-day’s closing values are 81 @ 35 point below those of last Thursday. The decline is chiefly due to improved weather conditions, free offerings from the South, absence of speculation, and a more favorable Bureau Report than had been anticipated. At the present moment the general sentiment is decidedly pessimistic, and a further considerable fall in values in the course of the next few weeks is freely predicted. It is, in our opnion,. largely a question of weather; should the conditions oontinue favor¬able, crop estimates will undoubtedly be raised, the South will offer cotton freely, and what speculation there may be, will be on the "Bear” side. At the same time the Market will he unusually sensitive to any unfavorable news, and at the lower range of prices "Bean" can be easily scared. We still think that the Market will remain for some time liable to frequent sharp fluctuations.

                <p>PITH OF THE PRESS COMMENTS.</p>
                <p>THE SULTAN CLIMBS DOWN.</p>
                <p>“TIMES.”</p>
                <p>We are glad to learn that, after not a little pressure, the Sultan of Moroooo has given full satisfaction to France in the affair of the Algerian Bu Mzian. He would have gained nothing by any further attempt to refuse it The information we have published has made it plain that the French Government was perfectly prepared to take all legitimate me¬asure of coercion, if they were still needed to bring the Saltan to reason. Those measures would have shown the Moors unmistakably which is the Power that has predominant interests in Morocco, and is also best able to protect them. Abdul Aziz, however, has yielded just in time. We may assume from bis surrender that be realises it was quite in France’s power to compel him, and that, in view of the precarious state of his authority throughout the Shereefian Empire, he has has thought it wiser not to risk an open humiliation. Both in form and in substance he now satitfies the French demands. .	.
                    All European Powers concerned in Morocco are indebted to France for taking prompt action, because they all had an interest at stake. If the Sultan’s unwarranted claim over Ba Mzian had passed unchalleged, he would probably have been emboldened to attack the rights of the Mohamedan subjects of other Powers. The prestige of Europe as a whole, and the safety not merely of native but of white subjects of other Governments residing in Morocco, would certainly have been com¬promised by acquiescence on the part of France.

                <p>"STANDARD.”</p>
                <p>We congratulate the French Government on the coolness and steadiness with which they have carried the business through. It is to he hoped that this success will be followed by and friendly adjustment of the remaining differen¬ces of opinion between Paris and Berlin. The mission of Dr. von Rosen, who has just arrived in the French capital, shows that Germany has no longer any desire to make a quarrel over Morocco. It is already difficult to realise the nervousness which was aroused in Europe,only a few weeks ago, by the Kaiser’s visit to Tan¬gier. Probably he did not understand, in the first instance, how much mischief he might have caused if he had persisted in the policy of ostentatious interference between France and the Saltan. A very brief study of Moroccan affairs has convinced him that all Europeans must to some extent stand and work together. "GLOBE.”
                    The Sultan only stood out against the wishes of France so long as he perceived that he could play off the jealousy of one nation against the other ; but the whole system under which Europeans live in the Mohamedan dominions would become impossible were each petty ruler in Africa or Asia able to count successfully on the want of union among the Great Powers. The Cabinet at Berlin, in fact, were placed in a false position : every step they took towards assisting the Sultan of Morocco seemed an act against the general polity of civilisation. Bat it would be idle to deny that there are still elements of danger in the situation : it has yet to be decided where the Conference meets, and there are many grave questions to come before it which will no doubt, give rise to disputes and differences of opinion.
                </p>
                <p>“EVENING STANDARD.”</p>
                <p>The Sultan of Morocco has thought better of it We believed he would. At the eleventh hour he has saved M. St Rend Taillandier the trouble and expense of an unnecessary journey home by giving to France complete satisfac¬tion for her wrongs. This is the Oriental way: to bargain with extreme deliberation until the customer shows signs of exhausted patience, and then to come quickly to terms. In this case the satisfaction is complete. Not only has the required apology been given and the required indemnity “presented,” but the Shereefian Government will deem it its duty to see that similar breaches of treaties and customs shall not recur. The Moroccan Go¬vernment had too exalted an idea of what might be gained by playing off one Power against another. It has now learned, let us hope, that the European nations are not yet so jealous as to take sides when the safety of their subjects in an alien land is at stake.</p>
                <p>MANCHESTER GUARDIAN.”</p>
                <p>The Saltan had, as we pointed out, put him¬self so clumsily in the wrong that German influence could not support him, and was pro- | bably exerted to bring him to reason. It is to : he hoped that no further complication will pre¬cede or impede the International Conference on Moroccan affairs. The arrival in Paris yes¬terday of Dr. Rosen, Germany’s new Minister to Morocco, shows  that the German Govern¬ment is at last expediting the arrangements. French opinion seems uniformly favorable to the appointment of Dr. ROMO, who is thought reliable and levelheaded j and it will be very glad to see the last Qf Han von twttinboeh,the head of the present German Mission in Fez, to whom so many diplomatic alarums and excursions have been due. </p>

                <p>“TEMPS.”</p>
                <p>The "Temps” observes that the official doc-ument announcing the apology and reparation given by the Morocoan Government consecrates the complete success of the legitimate claims made by France., The Bn Mzian incident, which had nothing to do with the Franco- German negotiations, is, therefore, disposed of. Its prolongation would not have compromised those negotiations, from which it was essentially distinct. Its settlement will nevertheless have a favorable influence on the serenity of the negotiations. “We said yesterday that the time had come for Germany to manifest more good humour and cordiality towards France, if she wished public opinion in our country not to entertain certain doubts as to her intentions, Prince Radolin and Dr. Rosen . . . brought to call the attention of the Imperial Govern¬ment to this point. As a matter of fact, the details which remain to be cleared up are chiefly among those in which Germany can prove to us her desire to consider our rights.” "SIECLE.”
                    The “Sifcole” and the "Matin” express the opinion that the same firmness should have been shown in an earlier crisis, in which case they consider an equally satisfactory issue would have been seoured.

                <p>RIOTING IN TOKIO.</p>
                <p>“TELEGRAPH.”</p>
                <p>Tokio is under martial law; peace is being celebrated by bloodshed and riot The tele¬grams which we publish this morning, giving a- vivid narrative of the grave disorders that have broken out in the Japanese capital will be read in England with genuine amazement and regret. The marvellous self-restraint of the Japanese throughout the war had led us to expect better things of Tokio than this. They had provided the Western world with the spectacle of a people acting together in perfect unity, animated by a single purpose, and quickened by a splendid, burning patriotism. Their obedience to authority was wonderfhl,not alone in reply to the call for men, and in the extension of the age for military service, but in snob matters as the extreme reticence of the military and naval chiefs, and the keeping by an entire nation of secrete which might have benefited the enemy. The Government had only to speak and their word was law. Never did there seem to be a people at once so patient and so brave, with almost superhuman qualities of self-restraint. The events of the last two or three days mast inevitably bring them down to mere human proportions again. There is alloy even in the fine gold of Japan.</p>
                <p>DAILY NEWS.”</p>
                <p>After all, the patriotism of Japan, which almost amounts to a religion, has now to face a strain which is quite as exacting as that of the battlefield. To this day. Great Britain is hardened with the debt which was accumulat¬ed during our straggle with France, a hundred years ago. Japan has to shoulder the same knapsack. From the military and naval stand  point,she is secure, but she lacks what Lord Roseberyi called "the moneybags,” which must always be the real foundation of every line of defence. Her credit stands high, hut she will need it all if she is to obtain the capital requir¬ed for her national needs and commercial expansion. Her position is, in fact, like that of the United States a generation ago, when outside capital had to be called in to meet a hinge war liability and to develop industries. </p>
                <p>“CHRONICLE.”</p>
                <p>Japan is a wonderful country, but it cannot be so uniquely favored as to contain no turbu¬lent Jingoes. While the life and death struggle was in progress, there was no scope for their activity in the streets the whole nation was bent upon prosecuting the war, and even in the hours of victory there was no noisy exube¬rance. But now that the war has not been continued to the bitter end, the day of the Jingoes has come, and they have gone down into the streets to shout, and stamp and fume. Such seems to have been the originating source of the disturbance. It was aggravated by the
                    action  of  the police in refusing, access to a- public park. We may think of the affair as a sort of mixture of a political meeting against the Governments of a shooting Jingo demon¬stration, and of a Trafalgar-square or Hyde Bark riot. There is a touch that will come home to Londoners, too, in one of the incidents. When the Guards appeared on the scene, "the crowd received them good nataredly.” So long an this good nature is shown in a popular dis¬turbance, things are not so serious as they seem. It would be unfair, however, to attribute all the discontent which the peace has caused in Japan to unreasoning Jingoism.

                <p>  How can the Government retain its dignity in the presence of such rioting. The committee which organised the meeting have a good standing in society, and are not irresponsible agitators. The police exceeded their authority with a result derogatory to the honor- and dignity of Tokio. Popular indignation has been set on fire, and the police are finally unable to keep order. If the conditions con¬tinue, the contagion may spread,, and innocent people and their property be damaged.

                <p>SCANDINAVIAN CRISIS.</p>
                <p>The"Aftonbladel,”one of the leading Swedish
                    journals, in an artiole urging, as a necessity
                    of permanent peace between Sweden and
                    Norway, that the fortresses on the frontier
                    between the two countries should he demolish-
                    ed, say a: Up .to the present Sweden has shown
                    herself willing to concede to Norway's wishes
                    by self-denyjngly sacrificing poincteof consider-
                    able importances To that confederate, who has
                    broken the bonds of union, Sweden has offered
                    her services in the work of settling the un-
                    happy dispa to. Thereby Sweden demands
                    merely one sine qua non, and one which
                    exclusively contemplates good. This one condi-
                    tion is : take away the bayonet direoted towards
                    us. The people of Sweden only desire peace,and i
                    this is threatened at the frontier by the for- tresses there existing. As a practical stop1
                    towards safety, and in order to obtain peace in
                    this direction, the Swedish Riksdag nnani-
                    moufily demands the removal of these hostile
                    works.
                    By demolishing the frontier forts Norway no doubt makes a sacrifice, but the advantage she gains is double. In the first place she obtains
                    the confifence of the neighbouring people, and  
                    their reliance on her urpright and peaceful,
                    intentions regarding the future. Farther, she
                    will be entitled to the respect of the whole:
                    world for the sobriety and wisdom she has  shown. Herein lies the ideal and profoundly :
                    moral interpretation of the question.
                    Disarming the forts is not enough. War—
                    nay, the danger of war—breaks every compact.'
                    Then the forts may suddenly be rearmed, and  thus we shall find ourselves in the same position as of old. Only demolishment of the forts j
                    can be regarded as a definite solution. This
                    done, no new controversies on this question |
                    can arise. Let it, once again, be dearly and

                        It was on such a day, ay ear ago, that two of us  decided to make a pilgrimage to the Oeeouorola, a little stream some seven miles from Rome.

                        Backache is really kidney-ache. It isn’t the back itself that aches, but the kidneys, which lie just beneath the small of the back. When the back is weak and lame—when it "bricks” if you turn or stoop sharply—when it burns, or spoils your sleep give your kidneys help at once in Doau’s Backache Kidney Pills, and see how quickly your back will grow strong and well, and how your general health will improve.

                        Here all is changed. The town might be miles away. High hedges covered with honey¬suckle and syringa shade the road on one side, while on the other, a mouldering wall blazing with crimson poppies affords shelter to innu¬merable lizards.
                        We pass the catacombs of S. Carlisto to the left, and come to the bottom of the little bill where, on the right, as far as the eye can reach, the Campagua stretches with its innum¬erable depressions, where the crust has fallen in and allowed wind and air to sweep fJong the streets of the mortuary city beneath oar feet.
                        Up the hill a little farther on, where Sora Nina keeps her flourishing establishment, we find ourselves in what might well be mistaken for a Devonshire lane. Hedges, twenty and thirty feet high, starred with roses, shade ns from the sun.
                        Still farther on we seem to be passing through an English park, with short turf and groups of massive trees.
                        Down the hill and up again, then a sharp turn to the right, towards the deep valley where the Ceoouorola ripples nnder its old •tone bridge. A little quarter of a mile, and we have arrived at the brow of the bill-ever-

                <p>(FROM A CORRESPONDENT.)</p>
                <p>London, September 8.
                    The world breathes freely again, knowing that the treaty between Russia and Japan is actually signed. Diplomacy’s seal has been set to the universal hope. For the moment the details of the treaty cannot be discussed, but the larger fact of the Peace is open for all to think upon. Wednesday was a day that will hold prominent place in history. As the “Times” points out, it marks the conclusion of a war without parallel in the history of man kind. Hitherto the tide of conquest has flowed from West to Bast. Since the Greeks rolled back the Persian flood, the Western nations, threatened though they may have been from time to time, have been triumphant over the Eastern. Bat during the last nineteen months a “nation of unmixed Asiatic blood” has proved ita. arms superior to those of a Euro¬pean Power. A portent indeed ’ Its conse-quences may not yet be read. Our successors will have to pore over them—in rejoioing, let us hope—certainly with a very real personal interest.
                </p>
                <p>Not the enormous number and length of speeches made in the House of Commons bnt the amount of questions strikes one most forcibly. No fewer than 7,353 were asked last session, Mr. Weir being responsible for 328, Mr. Sloan for 235, and Mr. MacNeill for 229, while the Chief Secretary for Ireland had to deal with 2,099 of the huge total. Now,Ireland is important, but not to that comparative extent. Messrs. Weir, Sloan, and MacNeill are ingenious, but not so superior in acumen to the other members of the House that they can be justified for taking up an unfair proportion of time and attention. Making questions is easier than walking through a division lobby. That is why so many are asked. No wonder, in the circumstances, that so few are adequate ly answered 1</p>
                <p>It is obvious that, whether by the will of the Government or the effluxion of time, the General election cannot be far off, a fact which gives added importance to the work of the registration courts about to commence. The task of the registration agents, so far as prepar¬ing the lists is concerned, is now finished, and the preliminary tussles will be fought before the revising barrister. It is iropossi ble to over-estimate the importance of the work of the agents, and the assurance that supreme efforts have been made to trace re¬movals will be comforting to candidates. The indifference of the average voter to the importance of the lists is even more remark able than the apathy so often shown at elec¬tion times, for thousands even of those keenly interested in politics make no attempt to discover themselves to the agents.</p>
                <p>Although those who for political reasons are working up the education revolt in Wales may affect to disregard the fact, there is undoubt¬edly a large section of Welsh Calvinietio Me¬thodists who entirely disapprove of tbe me-

The Victorian Year Book contains figures which should convince even those members of the Labour Party, to whose influence the restrictive policy was due, that the short¬sighted measures adopted daring the last ten or fifteen years have bean ruinous. “Im-migration from outside Australia to the Aus¬tralian States ceased about the year 1891, and since that time we have had to depend solely upon the excess of births over deaths for any increase that has taken place in the population.” That sentence most be marked and digested by Australians who wonder why their land is not more pros¬perous. </p>

                <p>A glance through the list of trades repre¬sented at the Trades Union Congress brings to mind how recent is the origin of many. Shake¬speare would have been puzzled by a plumber; and the only engineer he knew was ‘ hoist with his own petard.” Even Dr. Johnson would have had to confess his incapacity to define a boiler¬maker or a paper-hanger ; while the general expression “artisan” has totally changed its meaning, for, to the oonrtier-poet Waller, Van Dyok was the “Tare artisan” of the age. On the other hand, the “Franklin” and the “R°eve” of the Canterbury Tales are as dead as the wile of Bath.</p>

                <p>combined with an explicable delight in the ugly the silly, and the squalid - these are the themes of a surprising proportion of the “latest” picture postcards. Not, of course, that there is any “harm in them”—that is the usual  	defense. But it is a melancholy reflection that

It was this downward tendency
                    not reveal its impossibility for practical pur poses, at the very first glance of an experienced eye.” The truth is, everyone, at some time or another, thinks he could write a play. Those who succumb to the temptation (and, jadging from the groans of the managers, their name is legion) seem to forget that they are dab¬bling in a most difficult business, and when their amateurish effusions are inevitably re- j fused, their voices are too often joined to swell the chorus of grumbling. As Mr. Harri¬son well says, it stands to reason that “the first object of our existence as managers is to get rood plays,and so long as they are good, it doesn’t matter a pin’s head whether their author’s name is Pinero or Barrie or Tomkins
                    or Robinson.”

                <p>Photographers declaim against the news¬paper , and the papers have good cause to complain of the photographers. An instance from one’s personal knowledge ; Copies of a certain photo were bought with right of repro¬duction by two London firms, both of whom published. Then from the olonds there descend¬ed a syndicate saying that it had previously bought the copyright of that photo, and mast have damages and a royalty on every paper sold containing their property. One of the two firms, intolerant of a fight, paid  up at once in three figures. The other, having less money and more time, looked into the bona fi les of the syndicate, and to do so went up to Stationers’ Hall. There, right enough, was tbe registration of the copyright. But—here comes the rub—that photo had not been registered until days after it had been published in London. “You do your worst,” said the little firm, “we won’t pay a farthing.” And they did not; they had paid already, paid the man who first had the right to sell. That syndicate dis¬appeared as rapidly as it had materialised.</p>
                <p>The compliment paid last night to Lord Hawke is a confession of how much Yorkshire cricket owes to its moving spirit. It is the more welcome because the services of a captain are so se dom recognised. More than one county which has gained championship honors has owed its success to its leader. A good captain is more—much more—than a good cricketer. He can discover the good qualities of the untried and draw ont the best that aie known to exist. Moreover, he can discover that comradeship and enthusiasm which wins the hard-fought game. Lord Hawle ■ has done all this for many years now. For the sake of Yorkshire it is to he hope he will continue his services for many years longer.

                    <p>The 3rd Battalion Rifle Brigade, now at Aden, did well last year in signalling, and also the 2nd Battalion King’s Royal Rifle Corps. Both received special commendation in Army orders.</p>
                    <p>Arrangements have been made for the despatch daring this trooping season of a large number of officers of the Royal Engineers to India, in order to meet with the demand of the local authorities for an increase of esta¬blishment. Th:s increase amounts to forty-five officers of various rank. The Army Council has intimated that officers desirous of proceed¬ing to India should make their wishes known in order that their convenience, if possible, may be consulted in arranging the roster. The increase in the Indian establishment oomes in very conveniently after the redaction of the submarine companies.</p>
                    <p>Before H. M. S. Renown commences her voyage to India, it is expected that the King and Queen will pay her a visit, in order to respect the arrangements made for the comfort of the Prince and Princess of Wales daring the voyage. All things considered it is a matter for some regret that the Royal travellers will not make their start from Portsmouth, where a real good send-off could have teen managed, bat the Princess of Walesnasa great horror of the Bay of Biscay, and therefore it has been decided that the Royal party shall cross to Genoa. The embarkation at the Italian port, however, will not be without ceremonial, for both an English and an Italian fleet will be present to pay farewell honours.</p>
