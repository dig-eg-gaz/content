                    <head>Egyptian Magic</head>
                    <p>The discoveries daring recent years both in Egypt and Chaldea have given an
                        entirely new aspect to the subject of magic, formerly regarded as an evil
                        invention of the priestly magicians to enslave tho minds of the igno­rant.
                        In magic we have man's private sys­tem of natural philosophy, based on
                        practical experience, and many of these dednetion- survived and became the
                        basis of religions teachings or soieutific faots. The numerous editions of
                        the Book of the Dead, a mioe of information on magic, published by the
                        Trnstees of the British Mnsenm, afford ns a knowledge of the main teachings
                        of Egypt, while the large number of magical tablets from the library at
                        Nineveh, pnblished and translated by Mr. R. Campbell Thompson, enlighten us
                        upon the chief teatnres of Baby Ionian magic. It is particularly interesting
                        to compare the two systems, for they sh-.w a carious difference both in
                        origin aDd future development.</p>
                    <p>In Egypt (says a writor in our London con­temporary the "Globe") magic
                        reaohos back to an immense antiquity,and even where literature oeases we can
                        trace its existence by certain signs or objeota placed in the tombs of the
                        dead. In Egypt it presents more primitive ideas than in Chaldea, and is,
                        therefore, more interesting to the student. Fortunately, Egypt affords ns a
                        slight claa t) ths gaieiis of magic, especially the earlier firm of spoken
                        magic. All spoken magio depended upon the right pronunciation aui tone of
                        certain words oalied "words of power," or, rather, to take another meaning,
                        "words that compelled." Those words might be names of gods or demons, or,
                        indeed, the names of individuals, for the knowledge of a name gave the one
                        who ottered it power over the owner. There were also certain mystic words,
                        often very grotesque, which possessed great power. It does not seem wrong to
                        see a a very simple origin for this system. In the earliest days of man's
                        oooopation of the Nile valley there most have been a very limited number of
                        individuals, and language was in its infancy, words only coming into
                        existones as required to name or describe certain objects, the vooabnlary
                        growing as civilisation progressed. In this primitive stage language was
                        oonfined to the more intelligent of the community, and the faot that by the
                        utterance of a certain word a man was made to perform certain acts or to
                        bring certain objects was to the ignorant a mysterioaa manifestation of
                        power, and the words were the compulsion to bring about the desired lesuk In
                        this way there grew up certain formu'ac, or simple names and words that were
                        of occult power, and would act not only on men, bot on gods and demons also.
                        A carious survival of this belief in the power of the knowledge of the name
                        of a being or objeot is preserved in the Bible. After the Creation all the
                        animals were brought to Adam, that he might give them their names, for by
                        doing to he gained domi­nion over them.</p>
                    <p>It was an easy step from spoken magio to ceremonial magic. It was found that
                        certain aots, each as dancing, certain gestures, had an effect upon human
                        beings ; that they would also be effective upon those whom the de­parted
                        might encounter in the next world was a natural conclusion. The graphic
                        instinct, shown in the lowest types of man, which is one of the strongest
                        differences be ween him and the anthropoid ape, next comes into play, and
                        the picture of a man, a god, demon, or animal oarries with it power over the
                        efforts depicted. In Babylonia we have no trace of these primitive stages,
                        for in the earliest texts Chaldean magio had become systematised. In
                        Babylonia religion and temple ceremonial was perfected at a much earlier
                        period than in Egypt, and man did not worship his gods by compelling them to
                        do what he required, bat by association with them, feeding with them in the
                        sacrifices, and observing a loving filial relationship with them.</p>
                    <p>Magic has two oourtes open to it when it reaches its fallest development. It
                        either be­comes absorbed into religion, with a more elaborate ritual and
                        liturgy, or it becomes elementary science. In Egypt the former was the case.
                        All Egyptian magic became absorbed first in the "Book of the Dead," then in
                        the Funeral Ritaals, such as the ceremony of ihe "Opening of the Month," the
                        funeral service of Nile-land, and, as M. Me ret has shown, the whole daily
                        service of the Theban temple was a magical cer^moi y which brought the god
                        to life eaoh day. Babyiouian primitive magic, ' which peopled ad objects in
                        natnre with in dwelling spirits, gradnolly led to a class ficatinn of these
                        spirits into special hierarchies—which was, indeed, a primitive scientific
                        grouping. Clond and storm demons in their ritnal laid the groundwork of
                        meteorology.Star and planet rituals passed from astrology to astronomy.
                        Demoniacal possession supplied the elements of medicine, and the herbs used
                        in the oharms became drugs. Egypt shows no traoe of this phase. Even the
                        astronomical texts show no magical or scientific knowledge, and the Ebers
                        medical papyrus owes little to magio and more to common-sense. The resalt of
                        this divergence ia subsequent developments is that Egyptian magio died with
                        the fall of the religion. Chal­dean lived long after the temples of Chaldea
                        were in mins—was studied in the Jewish schools of Babylon and Borsipps, to
                        be trans­mitted in the form of the Black Art and psendo-scienoe to Europe by
                        the Arabs, and thns to live in some sense to-day.</p>

                        to make a retreat from Sana. The breakdown of the transport arrange­ments
                        has made a sustained campaign impos­sible. Ahmed Fe zi Pacha, oat of
                        despair, has resigned his command, but hia resignation has not been
                        aocepted. The Government is doing all that is possible, but the laok of

                    <p>THE NUNGOVICH APPEAL.</p>
                    <p>CAIRO JUDGMENT REVERSED.</p>
                    <p>This morning judgment was given by the Mixed Court of Appeal at Alexandria in
                        one of the most interesting capes of pre-emption that has ever come before
                        an Egyptian Tri bnnal. This was the appeal of the Nnngo- vich Hotels Company
                        agaitst thejadgmeDt of the Cairo Mixed Court of 1st Instance, which upheld
                        the claim of Dr. Bifky Pacha and the Princess, his wife, to exercise their
                        right of pre-emption in the matter of the purchase of Mena House Hotel by
                        the Non- govich Hotels Company.</p>
                    <p>The appelants maintained that none of the rights and privileges of persons
                        olaiming to pre empt could be invoked in the present case. In regard to the
                        position of the property the donble contignity, an indispensable prior
                        con­dition of pre-emption in the oase. of rural pro­perty, snoh as the Mena
                        House, Hotel, was absent. Moreover, no servitude existed and the objeot of
                        the claimants to pre empt was merely a speculative deal, sinhe it was the
                        hotel qua hotel and not as an estate that was the object of the pre emption
                        in this case, and pre emption oannot be exercised in the oaae of a
                        commercial or industrial establishment. The arguments of the claimants to
                        pre-empt were based on the faot that the estate in qnestion could not be
                        qualified as "rural" bat as "urban" and therefore contignity only on one
                        side of the property constituted a sufficient basis on which to exeroiee the
                        right of pre­emption.</p>
                    <p>The appeal oase came before the Seoond Chamber, presided over by Jadge
                        Moriondo. The Coart quashed the judgment of the lower Coart, non-saited Dr.
                        Rifky and the Princess, and ordered them to pay or sts.</p>

                    <p>His Excellency the Minister of Public Instruction has deoided to grant an
                        amnesty to those students of the 8cho.nl of Agricnltnre who rcoently went
                        oat on Btrike.</p>
                    <p>The following is the text of a letter sent by the Earl ot Cromer yesterday to
                        his Exoellency on the subject of the strike:—</p>
                    <p>BRITISH AGENCY.</p>
                    <p>Caiko, 14th March, 1906.</p>
                    <p>Exoellency,—I have the honour to forward a petition which I have received
                        from the students of the 8ohool of Agrionltnre. Your Exoellency will obsorve
                        that the students ex­press ' very ainoere repentanoe" for their reoent
                        conduot, and allege that they "aoted thonghtlessly, blindly following the
                        example of other schools." They, therefore, ask that their reoent oondnot
                        should be overlooked. I understand that yonr Excellenoy has received a
                        similar representation.</p>
                    <p>The breach of discipline of which the stndents at the School of Agrionltnre
                        have been guilty is unquestionably serious. They absented themselves after
                        the Ministerial order of February 28th—which was issued by yonr Excellency's
                        direction, and whioh, I am of opinion, was urgently demanded under the
                        O'ronmstances bad been read to them. Never­theless, I am quite willing to
                        believe that they were lei away by the bad example set to them by the
                        students of the School of Law; aDd I have no reason to donbt that the
                        expression of repentanoe which they have now oommanioated to yonr Exosllenoy
                        and myself is sinoere. Under these oironmstanoes, I venture to re- oommsnd
                        the petition of the stndents to yonr Excellency's favourable
                        consideration.</p>
                    <p>It must, of coarse, be fatly understood that, now that fall pablioity has
                        been given to the order of February 28 th, it will be impossible to plead
                        ignorance of the regulations. That order mast, therefore, be Btrictly
                        ap­plied if, in future, similar oases should un­fortunately arise.</p>
                    <p>I take this opportunity of alluding, briefly, to th9 faots oonneoted with the
                        reoent in­cident at the School of Law. Had the al­leged grievances of the
                        stndents at that Sohool been pat forward in a proper manner, yonr Excellency
                        wonld, I do not donbt, have emsed oareful and impartial enquiry to be made
                        into their natare. Unfortunately, the method adop­ted by the stndents in
                        order to bring their grievances to notice was in the highest degree
                        objeotionable. More than this, I gather, from the reports which I have
                        rece'vei, that since the stndents returned to the Sohool their oon- daot has
                        been far from satisfactory. They have, indeed, addressed a oommaaioation to
                        yonr Excellency which, so far from mitigating, aggravates their previous
                        offenoe. Even, how­ever, in their oase,I should be unwilling to take too
                        severe a view of the oondoct of inexperien­ced young men, who have very
                        possibly been led away by bad advioe. They mast, however, dearly understand
                        that the maintenance of proper discipline in the colleges under yonr
                        Excellency's direction comes before all other considerations. Indeed,
                        inasmroh as these stu­dents are being prepared for the legal profes­sion, it
                        would seem that they shoald be the first to set to their comrades an example
                        of obedience to the law.</p>
                    <p>I wish to reiterate the statement which I made in a memorandum published a
                        few days ago, namely, that enquiry into ths alleged grievances of these
                        stadents will depend upon whether, "at the end of the session, the
                        department of Public Instruction reports favour­ably on their work and
                        general oondnot." I should add that unless this report is favour­able,* the
                        qnestion may arise, not so mnoh of whether any enquiry should be made into
                        the alleged grievanoes, hot rather of whether some fnrthet special measures
                        shoald not be taken in or ter to enforoe discipline in this School.</p>
                    <p>I avail myself of th&lt;s opportunity to renew to yonr Excellenoy the
                        assurance of my high consideration.</p>

                    <p>MR. JOHNSON'S EXPERIENCES.</p>
                    <p>Mr. J. C. Johnson, jaD., of Messrs. J. C. Johnson &amp; Co., Ltd, cement
                        manufacturers at Gateshead on-Tyne and Greechithe, author of the work "Sport
                        on the Bine Nile," returned to Cairo last week, aPer an absence of about
                        three months, from a successful shooting ex­pedition - the fifth he has
                        undertaken—on the Bine Nile and Dindet River. In the latter district he was
                        for the space if 24 days engaged in traoking elephants throngh a desolate
                        coun­try overgrown with forest and jangle and destitute of human
                        habitations. In these regions, between the extreme limit of the inhabited
                        Sudan and Abyssinia, the only food available for the sustenance of Mr.
                        John­son's personal servants and a company of 20 soonts, the latter drawn
                        from among the natives of the inhabited districts, was the game secured by
                        his own gan.</p>
                    <p>Although on this occasion Mr. Johnson did not succeed in killing an elephant,
                        as on his previous expedition, yet he bad a somewhat thrilling experience in
                        meeting at each olose quarters an enormous ball elephant that it was
                        important to secure an aooorate shot at that pre&lt;i6e spot in the huge
                        skull of the pachyderm wh ch covers the brain. He was traoking the animal
                        with extreme diffioolty owing to the direotion of the wind, and while making
                        a long detonr to oironmvent the herd by crossing their path ahead of them
                        suddenly, on emerging from behind a screen of tall straw, he found himself
                        praotioally overshadowed by the elephant, which was striding along, and he
                        barely had time to take aim and fire hastily at the head of the beast and
                        decamp as the elephant broke into a gallop.</p>
                    <p>On his return journey by the Bine Nile Mr. Johnson had a remarkable bag of
                        hippopotami near the village of Rammash, district of Singa, bringing down
                        three of these enormous brutes within the space of an honr with a 303
                        oarbico rifle, the only weapon used by him ror all kinds of game. In each
                        oase the ballet entered the brain olose to the ear, bat in one instance it
                        actually entered the brain by one ear and passed ont at the other without
                        the slightest perforation cf the skin, which, although un­intentional, was a
                        singular anl remarkable achievement.</p>
                    <p>Although at times he suffered from fever and the extreme heat Mr. Johnson
                        enjoyed his trip immensely, and when he arrived in Cairo looked and felt
                        very fit. He left Port Said on Sunday aooompanied by a faithful Sudanese
                        servant, by the Orient mail liner Ortona for Naples on his retorn to
                        England.</p>

                    <p>The party of missionaries sent ont to the Sudan by the Chnroh Missionary
                        Sooiety in November last, at the instigation of Lord Cromer, arrived safely
                        at their destination, Mocgalla, in January. It has now been prac­tically
                        deoided to select another plaoe as the headquarters of the mission. After
                        investigation by Dr. Cook (who arrived from Uganda some weeks in advanoe of
                        the pioneer band) and oonBnltation with the Governor of the Bahr el Ghazal
                        provinoe, it has been discovered that another district lower down the river
                        offers mnoh greater opportunity for beginning mission work. There are
                        several pagan tribes in that region. Those with whom the Chnroh Missionary
                        Sooiety missionaries will at first have moBt todo are the Dinkas, a warlike
                        people who have no king. Their only "religion" appears to he spirit- worship

                    <p>IIIS EGYPTIAN CAREER.</p>
                    <p>The late General Gatacre remained a briga- dier-geDeral on the Indian
                        establii-hnient until July, 1897, when be returned home to assome command of
                        an infantry brigade at Aldershot. He had only held this a few weeks when he
                        was harried ont to Egypt to take charge of the British brigade daring the
                        advanoe on and at the battle of the Atb ra, where his personal gallantry was
                        once again oonspiononsly dis­played In the subsequent advance on Khar­toum
                        General Gataore was given command of the British division, with Colonels N.
                        G. Lyt­telton and Wanchope as hie brigadiers.Under hie command the division
                        certainly was in a state of oonrtant readiness and hard fighting effioienoy
                        ; bat here again he was generally considered to have oarried his theory that
                        the British soldier is capable of unlimited physical endurance to
                        unreasonable limits, and some of his precautions, such as that of making the
                        whole divis:on sleep in their boots when not within measurable distance of
                        the euemy, were rather severely commented on at the time. With his men,
                        however, the general was on the whole extremely popular ; though he taxed
                        them to the ntmost, he never made them do what he was not always willing to
                        do himself, while no one could gainsay his per­sonal gallantry on the field

                        in despatches, was thanked by both Honses of Parliament, and received the

                    <p>DISMAY AT ITS WITHDRAWAL.</p>
                    <p>BY ONE OF THE GARRISON.</p>
                    <p>Thore is a British possession which on rues the Entente Cordiale. Dismay
                        rtigns in the island of Malta. Undisguised alarm and appre­hension are
                        written upon the features of its genial inhabitants, from hotel proprietor
                        to shopkeeper and dhaisaman, as they try to realise all that is meant to
                        them by the latest concentration scheme of the British Admiralty, which
                        involves the withdrawal of the Medi­terranean F'eet a'most entirely from
                        this his­toric station. It is like a man waking up to find a gold miae has
                        been suddenly reft from him in the night. From Floriana to 8t. Elmo, from
                        the lines of Verdala to the limits of Sliema, there is lamentation and
                        monrning and woe. One party iB stricken dnmb. The extreme eeotioD, whose
                        raison hitherto has been the assertion of a so-called national policy, in
                        opposition to British interests, are brooght up short against the adamantine
                        fact that they have been qnarrelling with nothing less than their bread and
                        butter.</p>
                    <p>A prominent speoimen of this party, a trades­man in the Strada Reale, who has
                        made his living entirely ont of the soldier and sailor officer, not long
                        ago, in a character­istically vehement disquisition on the natio­nal
                        qoeation, assured me that both garrison and fleet remained at Malta solely
                        on the sufferance of the Maltese "nation" ; that the latter, who had
                        besieged and overpowered Napoleon's army in Valetta, oould, if they so
                        pleased, bundle ns ont of the plaoe to-morrow. Poor man ! when I visited him
                        before leaving, I found a pale ghost of the former self-oonfldent and
                        bellicose patriot. "Santa Maria! it is rain for me, for as all 1" he
                        exclaimed, with despairing gesticulation, and I had not the heart to rub it
                        into him any farther. He knew, they all knew, what a loss of untold gold the
                        with­drawal of the fleet will rne&amp;D. And it is bat a step, they say, to
                        the redaction of the garrison as well. Thousands of men will lose their
                        employment on the dockyard and wharves Thousands of boatmen, whose
                        many-oolonred dhaisas cover the interminable waterways of the Grand Harbonr,
                        will feel the pinoh of the coming time, the bumboat people, the frnit
                        sellers, the carrozzi drivers, the mnltitn- dinons beggars who hannt every
                        garlic-smelling street, the vendors of laoe and filigree, will realise as
                        never before the dependence of their fortunes on the open-handed Briton.</p>
                    <p>For not only does the sailor, by reason of his aooumnlated savings when at
                        sea, poor ont his money like water as soon as be gets ashore, bat the
                        presence of the fleet has always largely augmented the number of British
                        residents in the shape of families and relatiocs of officers serving in the
                        Mediterranean, who have eontinnally found Malta a very conve­nient
                        residential oentre. Large numbers of these are already paoking np, and even
                        as 1 write the flight has began. The generally- expressed opinion is that
                        henceforth, if no change of polioy takes place, the sooial rain of Malta is
                        complete, and the long-famed Valetta season may be ooasidered a thing of the
                        past. The Mediterranean Fleet has always contained a considerable percentage
                        of rich men who took a large share in the sport and sooial festivities of
                        the island. Oa the polo ground and racecourse the Navy could hold their own
                        with anyoue, and the danoes on the battleships in the harbonr were looked
                        forward to beyond any in the plaoe; while, if the soldiers gave a ball, the
                        blnejaoket was always at band with his banting and unrivalled talent as a
                        deoorator.</p>
                    <p>It is inevitable, therefore, that the withdraw- wal of such finanoial
                        resource" which a bi j fleet represents, will se^. ^sly affect the sooial
                        outlook. The garrison,even if not also reduced, as many soldiers, who might
                        go,fervently hope, and as is by no means improbably oinnot support the same
                        harden alone. What will become, then, of the great "Fishing Fleet" which has
                        invariably defended on the island for the winter season ? Hitherto, eaoh
                        year, when the son has travelh d southwards to the line, when the
                        moistnre-laden air beoama a trifle oooler and the sirocco less frequent,
                        every steamer has deposited a living load on pleasure bent. Hotels, flats,
                        and houses have had their accommodation taxed to the utmost Few men have
                        arrived with the' Fishing Fleet," but mothers by the score with marriageable
                        daughters, grass widows, society failures or soiled goods, wives, sisters,
                        oousins, and aunt* of the fleet and garrison, a multitudinou; gathering of
                        femininity, good, bad, and indiflo rent, ponr into the plaoe.</p>
                    <p>Young aDdold, titled and nutitled, moneyed, but more often moreyless, those
                        who havo fai'ed to secure any fish in the home waters set forth with wits
                        and experience matured to net the big garrisons abroad. Above all, the fleet
                        and garrison at Malta are heavily officered and form a big fixed shoal
                        inoapable of flight, and although mo3&lt;ly small fry, the fiiherwo men have
                        hungered too long to be partionla*- about their catch. There is indeed no
                        limit to their energy, and the disappointed oast the:r nets with advanoing
                        years even forther eastwar 1 still. Is it all at an end—the brilliant "whit
                        i nights" at the opera, the succession of dances, the moonlignt pionios.the'
                        Maltaengagementi," the eating and drinking, the squabbling, back biting,
                        costly dressing, the rise in prices si! ionnd, and rivalry in everything ?
                        For thes • are the constituents cf the "Malta season" in which the
                        butterflies of the "Fishing Fleet" 'ceem tofiad such perennial debght, and
                        npon which the astute "Maltes" bar. battened to his no small profit for so
                        long that he never dreamed of ite possible transition.</p>

                    <p>Captain C. H. E. Longhlin, Leinster Regi­ment, who latterly has been serving
                        with the 4th (Uganda) Battalion King's African Rifles, has been promoted
                        major. Major Lough'in originally entered the army as a private soldier and
                        served in the ranks for over three years, getting his oommission in the
                        Lrinstera in 1890. He has seen a good deal of service in East Atrioa and
                        Central Afrioa, including the Uganda operations of 1898 (medal with clasp),
                        and as a non-oommissioned officer he served in the Sadan Campaign of 1888,
                        inoluding the ection of Gemaizah (medal with olasp, and hronzs star).</p>
                    <p>The King has been pleased to approve of the Africa General Service medal,
                        with clasps, being granted to the forces employed in the recent military
                        operations in Southern Nigeria, eabject to the claims being approved of by
                        the Army Coune'1.</p>
                    <p>The old constitutional Force, commonly known as the Militia, it is announced,
                        is to be given a brigade organisation with a proper staff. This has been
                        promised from time imme­morial.</p>
                    <p>It is announoed that the Army Coanoil has decided to redace the infantry of
                        the line by ten battalions, and that from the 1st April next—a pecnliatily
                        appropriate date in many army matters—the 3rd and 4th Battalions of the
                        Northumberland Fasiliers, Royal War­wickshire Regiment, Royal Fasiliers,
                        Lanca­shire Fusiliers, and Worcestershire Regiment will be gradually
                        absntbed. The c-ffioers and non-oommissioned tfficers for whom vacancies
                        cannot be got in the 1st and 2 d Battalions will be given a choice of
                        transfers to certain regiments. The most of the doomed battalions were
                        formed in the spring of 1900, daring the early stages of the Boer War. If
                        Mr. Haldane has nothing better to replace these ten batta­lions he should
                        let well enough alone. It is all very (well to talk about the expansion of
                        the militi^ and the special. training experiment which is to b8 oarried ont
                        by selected batta- lionsfbut the latter is a tentative measure whilst the
                        ten battalions are a substantial asset in the Empire's forces. It looks like
                        the old familiar polioy of ontting down expenses for party purpose?.</p>
                    <p>Readers of the "Gazette" will recall the 3rd Battalion Royal Fusiliers, one
                        of those to be disbanded, as a very smart battalion at Cairo and Alexandria

                    <dateline>London, March 9.</dateline>
                    <p>The Money Market.</p>
                    <p>Gold h»0 continued to flow into the Bank daring the past week, with the
                        inevitable re­sult that loan rates have been put on a lower level all ronnd.
                        It is evident, however, that the market is still in a very sensitive state.
                        Loans and discount#, in the early days of the week, were very easy, but when
                        it was seen that the discharge of Treasury bills on Wednes-. day to the
                        extent of £2,000.000 brought very little money into the market, ra4es
                        qniokty showed a harder tendency, especially the dis­count rate, which
                        recovered from 3| to 8$%.</p>
                    <p>A lower level has, nevertheless, been reaohed, for although oall loans are
                        somewhat patchy, ranging between 3} and 4}%, weekjy fixtures command only
                        3$%, at which rate also the India Coanoil have renewed loans for a month,
                        whilst Stock Exchange settlement loans were done at 4$ as against 4f on the
                        last occasion.</p>
                    <p>No great redaction on these rates oan be looked for in the . forthcoming
                        week, for al­though the Bank of England has received a fair amount of gold
                        since the returns were made np. constant withdrawals are taking place for
                        Sooth America, and to the Bank als^ the market is still indebted. Whilst the
                        French Exchange is weak at 25.15, the German rate, high as it is at 20.48,
                        (hows a fall from last week's figure, and the American rate is on the
                        downward move. ThnBank returns referred to were also not as favourable as
                        was generally exnected. Troe, the proportion is higher at 47% but the other
                        deposits show a redootion of £3,712,000, and although there is a de­crease
                        ot £692,000 in public deposits, owing, of coarse, to the repayment of two
                        millions of Treasury bills, revenue collections are evident­ly still heavily
                        in progress, the balance at the awdit of the Government being nearly 17$
                        milliors. It appears that a portion of the gold received daring the past
                        week has found its way into the provinces, and this, although weakening to
                        the reserve, is gratifying as exhibiting increased activity in the trade of
                        the country.</p>
                    <p>All things oorsidered. the outlook, although favourable, does not justify any
                        very "bearish" view as regards loan and discount rates.</p>
                    <p>The Stook Markets.</p>
                    <p>It is pleasant to be able to record a very distinct improvement not only on
                        the Stock Exchange.bat also in respeettohome and foreign politios. It seems
                        now quite e'ear that what ever may follow from the Algeciras Conference,
                        Germany hfcs no w nil for war, and is, equally with Franoe, showing signs of
                        a desire to bring the deliberations to a satisfactory termination. When once
                        rid cf ttbss lowering oloud, there seems every prospeot of things getting
                        rapidly better. The trade reports of the oonntry are magnificent, and unless
                        a set-back occurs, this progress promises to continue for the rest of the
                        year, though probably the last month will show some falling-off. ^</p>
                    <p>The new members in the House of Commons are so taken up with finding their
                        way about, and discussing all kinds of topics with their friends, that there
                        doe? not seem any proRpeot of important legislation for fome time to oome.
                        At the same time, Mr. Haldane, with his statesmanlike, diplomatic manner of
                        handling the great army qnestion, meets with praise from all sides. It is
                        felt that the party is more likely to be ran by the few strong men, which it
                        undoubtedly contains, than by the weaker and more irresponsible members.</p>

                    <p>ANGLO-EGYPTIAN OFFICER NATIVE QUEEN.</p>
                    <p>The main sretfs cf Mr. Rider Haggard's latest novel "The Way of the Spirit"
                        are laid in the Sudan. Colonel Rupert Ullershaw, the hero; home on leave
                        from Egypt, where he has highly distinguished himself, falls in love with
                        the calculating Edith. They are married, only to separate after the wedding
                        ceremony, Rnpert having to retarn to the Sudan to undertake a difficult
                        secret mission. The villain is responsible for this separation, his
                        machinations having resulted in the ohoice of Colonel Ullershaw for the
                        dangerous diplomatic task.</p>
                    <p>It proves very dangerous. Rupert falls pri­soner to a revengeful Arab, who
                        deprives him of a foot and an eye. He is rescued from death, however, by the
                        roler of a little tribe who live in a wonderful oasis. The ruler is a
                        obarmiog young woman, the Lady Tama, to whom Rupert has done a service, and
                        who repays him by falling in love with him, mutilated as he is.</p>
                    <p>The reader will guess that she carries the unfortunate hero to her oasis,
                        norsea his wounds, and suggests matrimony. Rnpert, though fisoinated. gently
                        repels her advances and returns home. His wife shrinks with horror from him.
                        Everybody thinks him dead. He decides to remain dead to everybody. Going
                        back to the oasis, he live? with Tama as a brother with a eister. He will
                        not marry her, even according to the onstom of the oonntry, because he
                        already possesses a wife.</p>
                    <p>8o for years Rupert and Tama live in platonio friendship, ruling their people
                        wisely and wall. Then it becomes known in Eogland that the Colonel Ullershaw
                        whom none save the silent E lith have thought alive is hidden away in Egypt.
                        It is necessary to seek him, sines the eynioal peer's death has made him
                        Lord Dsvene. Edith, whosa views have been ohanged by the process of
                        years—and the peerage, travels to the Sadan in company with the villain.
                        Poor Rupert is called on to decide whether duty oalls him to his wife or his
                        sister Tama. How he decides we oaunct tall—it would be a pity to give Mr.
                        Haggard's story away.</p>
                    <p>As a work of art "The Way of the Spirit" cannot be praieed. Nevertheless, we
                        have found it very interesting, and its moral - the beauty of
                        rennnoiation—is admirable.</p>
