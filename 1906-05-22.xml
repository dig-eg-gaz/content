                    <p>Icilma Fluor Cream is the only cream that contains no grease nor oil.
                        Deliciously scented it cleanses the pores of the skin as nothing else can
                        do, makes it pearly white, gives life to the tissues, elasticity to the
                        muscles, and a deliciously cool feeling to the skin.</p>
                    <p>Its unique properties are due to Icilma Natural Water so that it may well be
                        called <hi>Nature's Skin Food </hi> and the skin requires nothing else to
                        give it the necessary vitality, to preserve it from sunburn, heat, cold or
                        the effects of hard water, to prevent and cure the minor irritations due to

                        cored,, he stated thus :— "I spent this period of life in the greatest
                        troubles. doing no work, but asking for alms all the , time ; but, a few
                        days ago. I slept in the Coptic church, finding no other refuge, where I
                        dreamed of two angels, who. with the weapons , ot kindness, struck my legs.
                        The angels, as he, stated, after doing their work, sent a young gentle lady,
                        who washed me all over with ointment; and in the morning. as if secondly
                        born, ( I became completely-cured cabbie of working for life. The rumour is
                        spread all over the province, for the mao is personally known; and as —
                        reported with a slight difference by the native press. </p>

                    <p>Captain Charles Herbert Dawson, late of the Army Servioe Corps. who is well
                        known in Alexandria, having been once stationed here, succeeded in his
                        action for libel against certain English newspapers last week. During the
                        war plaintiff superintended tho shipment of hay "from Liverpc/rf to South
                        Africa, and the litigation arose out of comments on proceedings id the Hoore
                        of Commons in regard to defective hay. The jury fonnd in favour of
                        plaintiff, awarding the damages as follows : Against "Reynold's Newspaper,"
                        £50 ; against the "Western Daily Mercury, £15 ; against the , Scotsman," £5
                        and egaim.t the ' Weekly Timhsand Echo £10- Judgment was accord- ingly
                        pronounced for plaintiff, with costs against defendants. In hia summing up
                        to the jury Mr. Justice Backnill taid that they must not baso their damages
                        npon the treatment the plaintiff bad received at the hands of the War
                        Offi'e. He admitted that no one could be so cold blooded as Hot to be
                        touched by the plantiff evidence if the way in which be had been treated.

                        of L.B. 500 in aid of the institution. A teacher skilled in industrial work

                    <p>WORK OF CAIRO SCHOOL.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Reginald Harrison, P.R.C.8 , writes as follow to the "British Medical
                        Journal':— a Your account of Lord Cromer's report On Egypt will be read with
                        interest by all who have watched the progress that has taken plaoe in its
                        development and iglgtiem to oor own and other oontriea. Reference is made to
                        the advantages that are likely to follow the recognition of the Medical
                        Scbool by the two ^ Royal Collages of Bogland, and the mark that their
                        conjoint diploma will put on Bgyptian students who are enabled to obtain it
                        after examination. To give effect to this "it has been arrange that a
                        delegate of the British Royal Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons should be
                        present annually at the examinations held in Cairo, and that the students
                        who! pass those examinations when the de'egate ia.prrsent . should enjoy the
                        same advantage as if the corresponding examinations had been passed in
                        London." </p>
                    <p>From my residence in Egypt for a portion oi two recent winter, and the
                        opportunities I bad of making myself acquainted with the facilities ' for
                        stodying medicine and snrgery in Cairo, I am strongly of opinion that
                        further important developments should be enoooraged. I hope this may take
                        the form of a tropical school of medicine in Cairo in connexion with the
                        medical school, and open to all nationalities.</p>
                    <p>From the British point of view such an institution would offer many
                        advantages. In the first plaoe, Cairo is within a week's journey from
                        Bngland, and, in- the next, it is on the great highway to British India, to
                        Australis, f to parts of Afrioa and other places in which 1 we have large
                        interests. In addition to educating medical students, each could be made
                        available for oivil, naval, and medical practioners desirous of obtaining
                        this form of post graduate study.</p>
                    <p>If the Egyptian student may now count his time spent there for examination
                        purposes, there seems no reason why the latter persons may not do so, in _
                        the pursuit of farther professional knowledge and experience. Of tbe
                        advantages of Cairo as a place of study for tropical diseases I Deed hardly
                        say a word. Many types of medical and surgical diseases may be seen there in
                        their most gente and varied forms, and the facilities offered by a Urge
                        hospital with a 'well equipped medical school and museum attached, with
                        Eoglish speaking professors 5 (including hospital physicians and surgeons)
                        leave nothing to be desired.</p>
                    <p>In the volume of reports recently issued by the Kasr El Ainy Hospital will be
                        found 1 mcch valuable information and original research, made on the spot,
                        relating to tropical disease. Those of us who were fortunate enough to be
                        present at the First Bgyptian Medical Coogress (1902) will not forget the
                        personal i encouragement that great cosmopolitan assembly received from H.H.
                        the Khedive, and ; the numerons scientific attractions and no- - velties
                        provided for us.Though excellent work is being done in the t tropical
                        schools of London and Liverpool, this should be added to by similar efforts
                        in places which are themselves liable to tropical diseases and their causes. </p>
                    <p>Lord Cromer thus refers to the School of Medicine in hie Uat anneal Report :
                        — During the past year, the number of itnd- ente who joined the Sohool of
                        Medicine wae 37, of whom one wae a pharmaoentical student.'rhe number who
                        obtained their diplomas was 17. There ere at present 116 students in the
                        School, of whftytwo are attached to the phar maceutioal seetkn.</p>
                    <p>As the result of some negotiations in which Mr. Reginald Harrison took a
                        leading part and materially assisted the cause of Egypt, it has 1 been
                        arranged that a delegate of the British ' Royal Colleges of Physioians and
                        Surgeons should be present annually at the examina- ' tions held in Cairo,
                        and that Jjhe students who pass those examinations when the delegate is '
                        present should enjoy the same advantage as if the corresponding examinations
                        had been passed in London. The advantages of the new arrangement to Egyptian
                        students of medicine will be very great, for amongst the people of this
                        country there still exists a strong prejudice in favour of employing a
                        medical man who holds a European qoalification. This School now possesses a
                        staff of highly qualified professors, under whose auspioea various
                        scientific work of much interest and importance was earned out during the
                        past year. </p>

                        rival that which followed the finding of the famous "sayings" of Christ on
                        the same spot.</p>
                    <p>A representative of the "Daily Mail'' saw the "find' at Queen's College,
                        Oiiord. It ie e. i tiny fragment of vellum, perforated by worms and yellowed
                        by sixteen oratories, but still perteotly legible. The writing ie almost
                        microscopically minute, but the Greek characters and even the scarlet of the
                        initial letter still show op vividly. </p>
                    <p>"It is certainly no part of an extant Gospel," said Dr. Gieofeil, "bal its
                        theological value 1 must leave to theologians. It is unusually ] well
                        written from a literary point i of view. Thoro are some 300 words on the
                        page.</p>
                    <p>"It begins in the middle of a speech. Jeens acd his disciples have entered
                        the Temple end 1 have met a Pharisee, who rebukes them for omitting to go
                        through some elaborate ceremonial of ablation. Jesas asks whit the Pharisee
                        has done, and the reply describes (the process J of purification
                        minutely.</p>

                        of such a ceremony as the Pharisee describes.</p>
                    <p>"There follows a power!ll and eloquent denunciation by Jesna of mere outward
                        purification. He says that He and His disciples baye t been pnrifisd with
                        the 'living water' or water y of life.' Another new point brought oot by the
                        c fragment is the first mention of a portion of the f Temple called tbe
                        'Hsgnentorion,' or plaoe of fc porifioation. This, too. has never been

                        on Mount Sinai, stating that when she revisited the oonvenQin 1902 she fonnd
                        that leaf No. 101 of the MS, containing Mark il, 21 iii., 21, had been
                        abstracted from the special box in which it was kept. The monks were aware
                        of the loss, and had their suspicions as to the identity of the thief, but
                        had taken no steps to recover the leaf from fears that snch action might
                        lead to its destruction. It was rianidsd to give all possible publicity to

                        also considered delicaoies by the Pacifi Islanders and the Chinese, who

                        histoire où la France tient une place glorieuse Dés 1830, Champollion avait
                        proposé, sat succès, à Mohammed Ali d'organiser un servit des antiquités
                        égyptiennes.</p>

                        choses, mais qui u'eut jamais de conservateur ni même de gardien. Le vrai
                        fondateur d musée fat Mariette. Après sa découverte d Serapeum vers 1852,
                        des rivalités et di intrigues l'avaient obligé de quitter l'Egypte, y rentra
                        en IÇ57. grace à l'appui du prim Napoléon et de M. de Lesseps, et l'anm
                        suivante Nubar pacha le nomma directeur d service des antiquités. </p>
                    <p>Le premier soin Mariette fut d'empêcher l'exportation de ci antiquités et
                        d'entreprendre lui-même 1 fouilles qu'il supposait devoir être les pic
                        productives. Il rassembla sous de simples hangars ses trouvailles de
                        Memphis, d'Abydos et de Thèbes. Ce n'est qu'en 1863, après di négociations
                        sans fin, q i'il eut la joie d'inaugurer musée de Boulaq. Tout le reste de i

                    <p>Lorsque Mariette fouillait à Abydos, un vieux cheik s' merveillait de la
                        précision avec laquelle dirigeait le1 recherches: "Je n'ai jamais quitté ce
                        village, et pourtant je ne savais pas l'existence de ce mur.. Quel Age as-tu
                        donc,toi qui l'es rappelé î—Trois mille an», répondit Mariette — Alors,
                        reprit le cheik, il faut que t sois on grand saint pour avoir l'air si
                        jeune. Ce grand saint n'est pas aussi connu ,^u' mériterait de l'être. M.

                    <p>Nous croyons être en mesure de déclarer, c la manière la plus positive, que
                        la nouvelle lancée avant hier par un journal d'Alexandrie savoir qu'il e t
                        question d'an fractionnement des actions de la National Bank of Egypt, est
                        dénuée de fondement</p>
                    <p>Les steamers que l'Express Nile Steamers Co. a commandés en Angleterre seront
                        prêts en automne, do manière que la transport di voyageurs sur le Nil paisse
                        être inauguré l'entrée de l'hiver prochain.</p>
                    <p>On suit qu'un service hebdomadaire de b teaux touristes sera organisé entre
                        le Caire i é Luxor, avec no arrêt do trois jours dans cette dernière
                        localité, et un service journalier entre Luxor et Assouan. La flottille sera
                        placée soi la direction d'un homme des pins compétent qui, par une longue
                        expérience acquise dans pays, connaît tons lo» rouages et les besoins 1 de
                        does services. Le succès de l'entreprise peut a donc, d'ores et déja, être
                        considéré cornu assuré.</p>
                    <p>Aussi ne faut-il pas attacher de l'importance la circonstance que l'action
                        est cotée au-dessous du pair. Cette particularité, d'ailleurs commune a
                        maint autre titre nouveau, est absolument d'ordre transitoire et doit être
                        attribues d'absord a la situation actuelle du marche ensuite a l'appel du
                        deuxième versement enfin au fait que certains apiculteurs a l'affut d'un
                        petit benefice immédiat, liquident leur souscription pour s'assurer le
                        profit provenant des parts de fondateur qui leur ont été allouées. </p>
                    <p>La valeur intrinsèque de l'action et les perspectives de l'affaire ne se
                        trouvent nullement modifiées de ce chef. Tout au contraire, les acheteurs
                        sérieux profiteront assurément de l'occasion pour s'intéresser a meilleur
                        compte a un titre appelé à acquérir une plan value certaine. </p>

                        and ten 30-ton bogie oil-tank wagons, to tho standard 4 ft. 8 1/2 in.
                        gauge.</p>
                    <p>Both sets of wagons are provided with Pox's patent pressed steel underframes
                        and bogies, similar to those of the wagons described in our former article.
                        They have a length over buffers of 37 ft., a length over headstocks of 31
                        ft, and a width over solebars of 8 ft. 9 ins. The bogie wheels have a
                        diameter on the tread of 2 ft. 9 1/2 ins., whilst the wheel base is 5 ft. 6
                        ins., and the distance between the bogie centres 23 ft The bogie platform
                        wagons have a fare weight of 10 toes 17 cwts., and tho oil- tank wagons a
                        "tare" of 17 tons 1 cwt. The platform wagons are fitted with steel floors,
                        but are without aides or ends. The oil-tank wagons have a capacity of 836
                        cubic ft. and are capable of taking a load of 23 tons of petroleum. </p>
                    <p>The shell is composed of steel plates, 9-32nds of an inch in thickness,
                        weighing 11 1/2 lbs. to the square foot. Each tank has been tested with a
                        water pressure of 10 lbs. per square inch Tho tank is filled through a man-
                        hole in the top, which is 1 ft. 6 ins. in diameter. They are emptied by
                        means of pipes leading a gun metal cock at each side of the wagon, and also
                        by means of a semi-rotary pomp at the end. The ,tanks are supported upon
                        timber baulks, which-are bolted between steel cradles. </p>
                    <p>The whole tank is protected from the heat of the son by a light roofing of
                        corrugated iron. In these days, when so much is being heard of the
                        "superiority" of American-and other foreign-built railway rolling stock, it
                        is interesting reto note that in October, 1904, a contract was placed with
                        the Leeds Forge Company for 50 sets, or 100 bogies, with axle-boxes and
                        springs, etc., for the Egyptian State Rail- ways, whilst twelve months later
                        a "repeat" order was given to the same firm for an additional 100 sets, or
                        200 bogies, for Egypt. These bogies are for 30-ton wagons, and are being
                        used to replace unsatisfactory American bogies which were built only two or
                        three years ago.</p>

                    <head>THE CASTLE OF AKABA</head>
                    <p>Akaba, about which so much has recently been heard, has, a correspondent
                        points ont, a good deal of history. The castle was erected by Sultan El
                        Ghusi of Egypt in the sixteenth century, and was in the possession of the
                        Egyptians about a hundred years age, when Burckhardt, the celebrated Arabian
                        traveller, visited it.</p>
                    <p>He says:-"The Pasha of Egypt keeps here a garrison of about thirty soldiers
                        to guard the provisions deposited for the supply of the Hadj and for the use
                        of the cavalry on their passage by this route to join the army in the Hedjaz
                        The castle iB situated at an hour and a half or two hours from the western
                        chain, down which the Hadj route leads, and about the same distance from the
                        eastern chain.</p>
                    <p>It is a few hundred paces from the sea, and is surrounded by large groves of
                        date trees. Burckhardt adds that the descent of the western mountain is very
                        steep, and has probably given to the place its name of Akaba, which in
                        Arabic means a cliff or "a going up" </p>
                    <p>There appears, too, to be little doubt that it is identical with the Ezion
                        Geter of Scripture, the port of Solomon's navy. Into the plain which
                        surrounds the castle on every side except the sea issues the Wady of Akaba,
                        the broad sandy valley which leads towards the Dead Sea, and which in put
                        ages probably formed the channel of the Jordan to the sea.</p>

                    <p>THE WHITE MAN'S BURDEN</p>
                    <p>Africa, more by reason of its olimate than of the temper/of its population,
                        continues to levy a heavy toll on those strangers who, whether in the
                        pursuit of gain, or, as in the instance cow under discussion, at the oall of
                        doty, seek to penetrate far into its hitherto woll nigh inviolate precincts.
                        From 1901 to 1904, both inolusive, 11 British officers, 2 British
                        noncommissioned officers, and 32 Bgyptian or Sudanese officers died. Daring
                        1905 and the early part of 1906, Major. Bonlnois, Lieutenant Fell, Captain
                        Sterling, Colour Sergeant Boardman, Mr. Barron, of the Geological 8srvey,
                        Mr, Marsden, Deputy Inspector at Scnaar, and s:x Egyptian and Sudanese
                        officers died. This,is a heavy death roll, when considered in relation to
                        the small number of those. employed, and when it is also remembered that
                        those who died were all men in the prime of life, specially selected for
                        their physioat strength and for their pre- en mod capacity for resisting
                        disease.</p>
                    <p>Neither does ths nomber of deaths ade- quately repro-ent the amount of
                        national and personal sacrifice, for from 1901 to 1905, both ioclnsire, 10
                        British officera, 1 British non- commissioned officer, and 23 Egyptian and
                        Sudanese officers were invalided from ill- hoalth. Farther, it cannot be
                        doubted that many civil and military officials, who have neither succumbed
                        n6r been invalided, have Buffered severely in health from the praise- worthy
                        zeal with which they have performed their work under conditions of special
                        hardship.</p>
                    <p>"I will not deny," says Lord Cromer in his last Report, "that the prize is
                        worth the oust, bat there can be no manner of doabt that it is being dearly
                        bought. All that can be said to console the mourners over the loss of these
                        valuable young lives, which the onward march 6f Sudanese civilization has
                        claimed as its victims, is that, as I firmly believe, their friends abd
                        relatives will not have died in vain, for the noble cans in which they laid
                        down their lives is bound ultimately to triumph."</p>

                        contemporary observes) that at all events a very considerable stream of
                        oranges and other agricultural products was produced by the Holy Land doring
                        that period. The value of the exports of oranges from Jaffa in 1905 was no
                        lees than £114 600 or £11.700 more than for 1901 and £17,6(0 more than the
                        average value for the years 1901-5. Altogether the trade of Palestine had a
                        prosperous period in 1905, the total exports amounting to £367,800, an
                        increase of £72,500, or 24.5 por oent. on the figures for the preoeding
                        year. Oranges were the staple export, and the trade is said to be steadily
                        increasing. </p>
                    <p>The sime remark holds good os to the exports oi wine and spirits, the value
                        of which amounted to £47,0C0, or £9,200 more than for the previous twelve
                        mouths. The imports, on the other hand, amounted to £464,000, which is
                        £9.300 less than for the previous year, but even this decline points to
                        improved conditions in the country. Thus the value of the imports of rice
                        have declined by £19.200, the result, no doabt, of the excellent harvest in
                        Palestine, which during the past year has been able to export wheat and
                        other foodstuffs. A further gratifying feature is that the imports of ootton
                        goods, which in 1904 amounted to £180.000, havo risen by £20,(00 in 1905,
                        and these goods are practically all obtained from Manchester ; although as
                        they are im- ported to a very largd'extent via Beyrout they fignre under the
