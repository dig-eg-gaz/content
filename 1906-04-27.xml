                    <head>The Political Condition of Germany.</head>
                    <p>A very interesting article on the preset political condition of Germany from
                        the pea of Herr Conrad Haussmann, the leader 0f the Wurtemberg Democrats,
                        appears in the Prankforter Zeitong." The article menu the reroll entry of
                        all who take an intere.t in the factor of Germany. Herr Haasamaon points out
                        that the attempt to govern the Empire under the appearance instead of with
                        the reality of constitutionalism has led to the rapid delay of the vigorous
                        political life of which the early years of United Germany gave promise. The
                        Government is a pare bureaucracy, and is not based upon any powerful
                        re­presentation of public opinion. Instead of being able to upon a definite
                        programme</p>
                    <p>it has to expend its energies upon the diplomatic manipulation of political
                        parties which are themselves in great measure impotent because they lack the
                        wholesome impulses of the ambition and possibility of governing as well as
                        the steadying influence of responsibility. The power of the Government is
                        weakened rather than strengthened by formal detachment from the
                        representatives to the people, and instead of being invigorated by the topic
                        of intelligent criticism it is mostly attacked by the weapons of corroding
                        ridicule and satire.</p>
                    <p>Herr Hanssmann shows how the attempt to combine absolutism with the forms of
                        constitu­tionalism demoralizes the political parties with which the
                        Government is in the habit of negotia­ting behind the scenes and how the
                        same causes prevents the growth of political talent to an extent which at
                        present renders the German imperial Parliament so singularly barren in
                        respect of anything like the elements of states­manship. The present system
                        is defended in some quarters as being necessitated by the Social Democratic
                        danger. Bat as a matter offset it is the absence of constitutional
                        government which produces the German type of Social Democracy as a
                        consequence. of the want of a constitutional safety-valve.</p>
                    <p>Herr Hanssmann long at tide, every word of which is worthy of careful
                        perusal, with the following reflections1 In the days before Francs had
                        achieved political recovery Germany was in a position . to ignore the spirit
                        of the age. At the present moment it is a doable mistake to fail to
                        understand the times. The national resources are wasted when the political
                        strength of a nation of outruns who have passed beyond the childish stage of
                        mere is not system­atically tamed to amount It if the power of eligibility
                        were to be left unemployed Constitutionalism is the sole perm meat so arci
                        of power well as the automatic instrument for regulating and equalizing the
                        on rents of political life.” </p>

                    <p>COLONEL FHRGUSSON'S EULOGY.</p>
                    <p>The discussion of this subject is continued in the "Times" by Colonel Charles
                        Ferguson, D. S. 0., who was present with the 10th Sudanese Battalion
                        throughout the campaigns of 1896-97-98, and was severely wounded at
                        Rosaires, being five times mentioned in dos-. patches. In 1889 Col.
                        Fergusson commanded the 15th Sudanese, and later was in command of the
                        Garrison and District of Omdurman. For the above services he was
                        decorated.</p>
                    <p>Colonel Fergusson writes as follows :</p>
                    <p>Sir,—In view of the letter from your Indian Correspondent in to-day’s insane,
                        I venture to write; in corroboration of Colonel Lewis's statements in his
                        letter of the 14th instant. The matter is not one of opinion bat of fact,
                        and that the ‘ Spectator" takes the same view as your correspondent does not
                        alter the facts.</p>
                    <p>Both have evidently been misinformed.</p>
                    <p>At the time of the “mutiny" 1 was in com­mand of a Sudanese battalion. I was
                        a member of the Court of Inquiry which investigated the matter; and, in the
                        position which I subse­quently had the honour to hold in the Egyptian Army,
                        its inner history was well-known to me, Those who read between the lines of
                        Colonel Lewis’s letter will understand bow the true facts, or what your
                        correspondent calls "the deeper causes,” could not be made public, and how
                        easy it consequently was for misapprehension to arise.</p>
                    <p>Lord Kitchener’s administration and treat­ment of the native soldier had not
                        the remotest connation with the incident, except that the total collapse of
                        the agitation was due to the remarkable loyalty displayed by the troops
                        generally, and by the Sudanese in particular, in the aide of the most
                        desperate efforts to subvert them. This fact, I venture to think, itself
                        disproves the assertion that the troops had been injudiciously handled by
                        Lord ’ Kitchener; had each been the case, our position in Omdarman would
                        have been critical.</p>
                    <p>Their absolute steadiness under the most difficult circumstances was an
                        eloquent testi­mony to the confidence which he had inspired, and J assert,
                        without fear of contradiction by any one conversant with the fooling of the
                        Egyptian Army, that no commander was, or is, regarded with more respect and
                        affection than Lord Kitchener. </p>

                    Maohell, Major and Mrs. Herbert, Matohett Bey, Watson Pacha,. Owen Bey,

                    Lambert and many others—the tea tent being full and the excellent tea provided
                    highly appreciated. The sports were characteris­ed by any amount of "go,”1 and
                    their organisation reflected the highest credit on Matchett Bey and the members
                    of the committee. The gymnastic display was extremely good and the obstacle
                    race, which closed the proceeding*, gave great amusement to the -spectators. The
                    competitors found wire entanglement# as trying as the Japanese found them at

                <p>The 100 yards was well won by Ali Efif. Zeki. The quarter mile race, open to the

                    an excellent runner. The tag of war resulted in the success of the team of the

                            against the action of the Water Company who undertake to supply the
                            public with ice. The company are supposed to have a machine capable of
                            turning out far more ice than is required by the public. Yet, year after
                            year, whenever the slightest hot spell, such as the last few days, it is
                            almost impossible to get ice, except at times when I presume it suits
                            the convenience of the company to issue it. I do not write as a private
                            consumer but as one who actually depends upon ice to preserve the
                            product I supply, and it has happened year after year. I experience
                            consi­derable loss, owing to the company’s apparent indifference. Sorely

                        <p>Yesterday morning, Me. Pietri continue his defense of the Government’s
                            claim. After discuss­ing the Law of Liquidation he claimed that it
                            constituted a “novation.’’ The creditors were unchanged bat the debtor
                            was no longer Ismail Jaoha bat the State. In virtue of this novation the
                            former debtor was freed from all response- utility. How then told he
                            and- hi*heirs make any claim for the surplus ? In 1880 the Daira
                            properties were by no means equivalent to the debts they guaranteed ;
                            however they were all the assets that the original debtor hold offer to
                            the State which replaced him in this unen­viable position. Ismail Pacha
                            shook off all legal responsibility for the debts he had ignored. The
                            Egyptian Government acquired the Daira ands. Again, if it were admitted
                            that Article 40 did not transfer. to the Government the absolute
                            property in these lands, none the less the fact that they had been
                            transferred by proscription in good faith and with good titles l or five
                            years, or that they had been 15 years in the possession, in the widest
                            sense, of the if government made them State property. As a matter of
                            fact they had been for 23 years in the hands of the State. During all
                            that period the Government bad held visible and peaceable possession of
                            them.</p>
                        <p>Me. Nassif then intervened on behalf of Yaooub Paoha Hassan, husband of
                            the late rinoess Jamila, on the side of the claimants, lie. Chalom
                            stated that he had been instructed to appear on behalf of the Credit
                            Frontier.</p>
                        <p>Me. Carton de Wiart, on behalf of the Daira Sanieh, declared himself in
                            favour of the Government’s contention. Repaying to Me. Villa's
                            contention, he remarked that Ismail Pacha’s cession and the eminent
                            advocate’s illustration of a ship recovered after abandon­ment by her
                            owner could not be compared. Ismail Pacha’s cession was a “Lustier
                            solute” wing incomplete. The incomplete cession of the goods of a debtor
                            constituted a payment by French and Egyptian law.</p>
                        <p>Me. Mannsardi then opened his pleading on Dehalf of the claimants. After
                            a eulogy of Ismail Pacha he pointed out that be had grant ed L E.
                            260,000 to the Princes and Princesses named in the grant as an indemnity
                            for their loss of trio estates mortgaged to Messrs. Rothschild. In 1880
                            the grant to Ismail Paoha and lie throe wives only figured L E.400,000
                            in the Civil List. In 1888, in virtue of the arrange­ment then made, a
                            capital sum answering to the LE. 40,000 per annex which they had ceased
                            to obtain from the Government was granted them. Ismail had not made any
                            claim, nor had he received anything.</p>
                        <p>The wording of this arrangement was then discussed. After this the
                            speaker went on to point ont that the Government was forcing an open
                            door. The claimants recognized that the 'Government was proprietor of
                            the Daira lands, and why was it proprietor, because it wished to take
                            them or because Ismail had ceded them? The Princes did not ask for the
                            lands but for the consideration for their cession.</p>
                        <p>At the meeting of August 7,1888, the ques­tion of the eventual right of
                            Ismail Pacha to the surplus had been clearly pat From the contributions
                            to the dissuasion made at that date by Sir Evelyn Baring and M. de
                            Bligni &amp; res this right seemed implicit in the law. The commission
                            considered best to leave him the eventual rights to any surplus.</p> <p>The

                <p>POPULATION AND MORTALITY.</p>
                <p>The report of the Alexandria Municipality for the past year contains a mass of.
                    highly interesting information on the vital statistics of the city, which is
                    embodied in the report of the Municipal Sanitary Inspector. The population of
                    the city is expected to reach 400,000 this year. The avocation is only a rough
                    one as about a thousand European children are born every year and not
                    register­ed. There is a decree of Jane 9, 1891, which enjoins that all births
                    should be registered' irrespective of nationality. Bat as far- as regards
                    Europeans the decree is a dead letter, and it is suggested in the interests of

                    stop to by enforcing a severe penalty. An example of the way the sanitary
                    authorities are handicapped by the want of obligatory registration is to be seen
                    the fact (hat they are quite unable to find out how many people have been

                    foreign Jews, the econo­mical position of these two classes of the population
                    being very favourable. Then come the Orthodox Armenians. The rate of mortality
                    amongst the Latins and Greeks is about the same. The highest death rate is among
                    the native Jews (37, 5 °/M), but these people also have the highest birth-rate
                    (41,1 7~) after the natives. The healthiest quarter is Ramleh, while Memhieh and
                    Labbane have the highest death-rate.</p>

                        <p>The necropolis of Cbatby, situated on a barren extent of chalky ground
                            between the electric tramway and the sea, has since its exploration
                            added much to oar knowledge of the epoch immediately after the death of
                            Alexander the Great, ie., daring the reign of the First Ptolemy (811—306
                            b.c.). The necropolis seems to have continued to be used as a place of
                            burial until .the second century a d , when it evidently became too
                            crowded. The excavations made are three in number, the last being the
                            deepest, for where-Dr. Breccia gave his address there were at least 16
                            feat of superstrata, consisting of sand, stones, and human skulls. The
                            place of these ghastly trophies contained tombs belonging to a much
                            earlier period and they differed from those of the Ptolemaio period in
                            that they were approached horizontally by steps hewn out of. the
                            sandstone, whereas the spenders found in the other two excavations were
                            ranched from above, and were surmounted by.</p>
                        <p>As a psychological study the discovery of these, m of all other tombs,
                            is, as Dr. Breocia explained, invaluable. In the 5th and 6th entries

                            worshipped in life, bat later on a change is. noticeable ; religions
                            beliefs appear to become weaker, the status of the gods disappear, their
                            place is taken by symbols characteristic of the lira of the departed,
                            until in this Alexandrian period there is indicated a state of
                            psycholo­gical sentiment much like that of oar own day. The age, too, of
                            the deceased might be gauged by the profusion, or the con­trary, of the
                            funeral emblems found in the tomb : an old man would not be expected to

                            was difficult to deter­mine ; conjecturally they were to be used in
                            repairing grim Charon’s vessel. Other objects of iron that were
                            especially interesting were the bucklers and other weapons of a
                            Mace­donian soldier ; as also iron striges need by gymnasts after their
                            exercises.</p>
                        <p>Two modes of burial were need, crema­tion and inhumation. Sometime a
                            skeleton would be found, with the ashes of relatives— sons, daughters,
                            etc., - deposited in vases around it Of sarcophagi there were none,
                            except for several wooden office. The Arab and the Bedonin had unhappily
                            combined to remove much before the Museum could interfere. At the
                        conclusion of this address, Dr. Breccia invited, the party to watch the
                        opening of three of these step tombs. A number of antiquities in the form of
                        lamps, tear bottles, and vases were found, as also enameled lay dishes
                        containing food for the soul in its transit. One of these dishes had the
                        bones of a fish, of what kind is not known.</p>

                <p>The activity of Turkey at the present (moment is astonishing and it is said that

                    aggression, add ought to be repelled by tore. The Porte which, it is said, has
                    the support of a European Power, and is acting under the inspiration of that
                    Power - maintains its . .right . thinkable Egyptian territory and to barracks,
                    and even to construct a railway, without recopies Great Britain’s right to
                    defend Egyptian interests.</p>
                <p>“The Porte also appears disposed to maintain that Wadai, Kanem, and the desert
                    forapg the extreme hinterland of Tripoli are; de­pendencies of Egypt, and that
                    in the agree­ments of 1898 and 1899 Great Britain disposed in our favour of
                    territories not belonging to her.</p>
                <p>“This singular contention onset be sus­tained, since care was taken to make it
                    dear in the agreement of 1898 thit Darfur, which remained British territory, was
                    the extreme limit of the old Egyptian protectorate.</p>
                <p>“The Porte would doubtless forego its claims to Kanem, and would perhaps transfer
                    them to the oasis of Bilma, half way between Tripoli and Lake Tohad. There,
                    again, our claims were recognized in the Anglo-French agreements, and the

                <head>Port Said Salt Association</head>
                <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette</p>
                <p>Dear Sir, — I venture to intrude on your space for a few comment? on the recent
                    meeting of the shareholders of the Port Said Salt Association. Certain of the
                    directors of the company signed a requisition calling that meeting for the
                    purpose of rescinding one of their articles of association expressly devised to
                    protect minorities and to prevent the confiscation of their property. This
                    article, strictly in harmony with the fiduciary relations which should exist
                    between directors and shareholders of all companies, provides that no director
                    should vote, as snob, on any contract or arrangement affecting the interests of
                    a company in which contract he may be per­sonally interested. It was proposed to
                    suspend this article to enable the directors of the Port Said Salt Association
                    to band over to their own tender merries, as director of the Salt and Soda Co.
                    (they being on both boards) the interests of the Port Raid Co. The meeting of
                    the 91st inst very soon disposed of the falla­cies by which it was sought to
                    cajole the shareholders. In vain was the Port Said Co. threatened with catting
                    prices, and to me it was a novel experience to hear one of the directors of a
                    company belittling and de­preciating that which he was there to repre­sent and
                    to conserve and to Bay to his own shareholders that they most “amalgamate or
                    die.”</p>
                <p>The object for which the meeting was called was inequitable. The resolution had
                    been carried both companies would have been in­volved in endless and expensive
                    litigation, for there are abundant precedents to justify the advice given 'by me
                    to the dissentient directors as their legal representative at the meet­ing to
                    the effect that our Courts do not tolerate the oppression of minorities and the
                    Confisca­tion of their belongings.</p>
                <p>The Salt and Soda Co. has nothing. which the Port Said Co. wants. The latter
                    desires nothing better than to be let alone--to stand on its own merits. The
                    public is with it, it a dividend earned, its shares far above par, its expenses
                    are extremely light, and its future1 assured.- Were it not so it has a right to
                    say that the Salt and Soda Co. would not desire to force an amalgamation. Such
                    is the logical inference of the scheme proposed and vetoed. For the director of
                    the Salt and Soda Co. to threaten to sell salt in Egypt for the mere cost of
                    transport is mere hysterical bluff and will not depreciate Port Said Salt shares
                    one centime.</p>
                <p>It is now said ,on the Alexandria Bourse that the shares,-of the Port Said Co.-
                    will be hammered down by the men of the Salt and Soda. I would donation the
                    share­holders of the smaller company against selling their shares. I venture the
                    prediction that this little concern will pay 20 % within a very few years and
                    their Bhares will be at 3"s.</p>
                <p>If there be one single, shareholder left in this company disposed to fight the
                    matter out to a finish this single shareholder can set the Courts at work to
                    protect his in­terests and no matter by what majority hostile and inequitable
                    resolutions may be carried. unless it can be shewn that Port Said Salt has
                    something to gain from its connection with the Salt and Soda, some tan­gible
                    quid pro quo, then will all arbitrary dealing with the shares of this policer
                    share­holder by set aside.</p>
                <p>Has the Port Said Co. anything to gain from the Salt and Soda ? I say—nothing.— I

                        the loyal co-operation of Lord Selborne. He entirely sympathised with
                        Natal’s difficult position and wished them success He deprecated the word
                        interference as entirely contrary to the Imperial Government’s position.

                        bhares of some leading companies have fallen sharply. (R.)</p>
                    <p>INSURANCE COMPANIES LOSSES.</p>
                    <p>In regard to the above, the following, which we cull from a home paper, will
                        be of interest:—</p>
                    <p>There seems considerable uncertainty, even at the head offices of some of the
                        companies themselves, as to the question of their liability for fire losses
                        indirectly caused by the earth­quake In some of the States, uniform policy
                        conditions with regard to this point necessarily obtain, but in the case of
                        California there appears to be no such legal necessity for unit fortuity.
                        Inquiry at the offices of some of the leading British companies generally
                        fails to elicit any definite information on the point, the absence of
                        information being partly due to the impossibility of obtaining telegraphic
                        communication with their representatives in the ruined city it would appear,
                        however, that the majority of the companies, perhaps nearly all, are bound
                        by clauses modelled on those ruling in New-York State, under which the
                        liability does not extend to buildings first ruined by the earthquake and
                        subsequently set on fire, but only to those which, having escaped direct
                        damage from the earthquake, subsequently suffer damage through the spread of
                        the {ire from other buildings. In the case pf at least one important
                        company, however, as we have mentioned above, there is apparently no
                        liabi­lity at all. The American companies themselves are, of course, chiefly
                        concerned—and Conti­nental companies, too, have done a large business in the
                        city, but there will without doubt still remain a heavy amount to fall on
                        the shoulders of the British offices. The estimates that have already been
                        compiled, however, are necessarily very vague.</p>

                    <p>A book on the above subject by Mr. T. L Gilmour has just been published at a
                            very opportune moment, in view of the Anglo Franco-Italian convention
                            referred to in yesterday’s telegrams. It is ably written by a man who is
                            evidently a master of his subject, and in addition to an interesting
                            narrative, it pub­lishes several important documents not easily procured
                            by the general public and which cannot fail to be welcome so many people
                            in Egypt who take an interest in Abyssinia, in its connection with the
                            head waters of the Nile, the link which it will form in the passage of
                            the Cape-to-Cairo railway, in its Bank, and last but not least, in the
                            question to which the book under notice, not only refers, but gives an
                            amount of information not hither to known to the general public,—we mean
                            of course, its struggles for railway communication with the Red Sea
                            coast. His Majesty the Emperor Menelik, King of the Kings of Ethiopia,
                            who, although he has never yet seen the sea himself,' has for many years
                            been sufficiently well-informed to know that even. if he has been able
                            to do a good deal in the way of the internal development of his empire,
                            the barrier to more rapid progress has always been the difficulty of
                            foreign communications. If once his capital were in railway
                            communica­tion with a good seaport, he has long since appreciated the
                            fact that its progress would then take much more vast proportions. If
                            this knowledge had been acquired by Menelik’s predecessors they would
                            probably have been a little more difficult in dealing with the European
                            Powers, who within the last forty years or so have become possessors of
                            all the territory between Abyssinia and the Red Sea.</p>
                    <p>At all events, in 1889, when Menelik II. came to the throne, he had to face
                            the some­what difficult position to which we have just alluded. For
                            years past his capital had been the arena of a diplomatic struggle in
                            which Great Britain, France, and Italy have played the most conspicuous
                            parts. During many years after the war of 1857, England, not very wisely
                            we think, treated Abyssinia with a considerable amount of neglect, and
                            when Menelik first became Emperor her principal intercourse was with
                            Italians and Frenchmen. In the first year of his reign he was glad to
                            sign a treaty with Italy one of the principal clauses of which was that
                            “His Majesty the “King of Kings of Ethiopia consents to avail “himself
                            of the Italian Government for any “negotiations he may enter into with
                            any other Government” As was not improbable this dame soon gave rise to
                            different inter­pretations, and Menelik absolutely rejected the Italian
                            reading of it, and maintained that Abyssinia was still an independent
                            sovereign State. The administrator of French Somaliland, now Minister at
                            Adisbeba, was quick to see the importance of the part which France might
                            acquire from a friendly understanding with Menelik; he supported the
                            Emperor’s views : and the friendship of France was of the greatest
                            service to him; it enabled him to complete his preparations for the
                            final struggle, and after the defeat of Adowa he signed a treaty in 1896
                            recognising the absolute independence of Abyssinia, a decision which was
                            recognised by the Powers of Europe and which must not be forgotten in
                            any subsequent negotiations.</p>
                    <p>This situation did much to strengthen the influence of France in Abyssinia,
                        and it was the only Government at that time having direct diplomatic
                        relations with Menelik, It was therefore only natural that Menelik, seeing
                        that he required European advice and assis­tance, should lend a ready ear to
                        the counsels which the astute Minister ci France was only too ready to give
                        him ; the keynote of which was that France should secure in Abyssinia a
                        privileged position denied to other Powers. This idea found frequent
                        expression in the French Press and among political speakers ; that Abyssinia
                        was to become “a French colony in all but name.” This was an ideal
                        arrangement from a French point of view, and would certainly have been a
                        good return for prevent­ing Italy from adopting the same policy. But in
                        this, as in many subsequent events it always appears to ns that France made
                        one fundamen­tal mistake. The Emperor Menelik is, as the author rightly
                        says, a man of strong character and remarkable intelligence; and yet in
                        dealing with him these are qualities which the French Government never seems
                        to have taken into consideration. Is it at all likely that such a man should
                        col sent to be treated as a "quantity negligible 1"— and yet on this
                        occasion and on several others this is just the manner in which the French
                        Government did treat him.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately up to a few years ago the rivalry between France and Great
                        Britain, in Africa, was keen and bitter ; it might natu­rally have been
                        expected that the French Minister should use his privileged position to fill
                        Menelik’s mind with ideas of British policy, to use a mild expression, — far
                        removed from reality. We have still some recollection of the colors with
                        which Albion used formerly to be painted, nor was it unlikely that the
                        Emperor, with the limited sources of information at his command, should form
                        grave suspicions as to the ultimate British policy in North-eastern Africa.
                        Early in 1897, events happening in the Upper Nile Valley showed the British.
                        Government the desirability of forming closer relations with Menelik, and
                        Sir Rennell Rodd was entrusted with a mission to him, the result of which
                        appeared to be satisfactory, and a treaty was signed strengthening the
                        ancient friendship be­tween England and Abyssinia, which, by</p>

                            Rennell Rodd’s mission was that ha was accompanied by a young officer of
                            the Indian Staff, in charge of Ejs transport arrangements, Captain John
                            Harrington, who had for some</item>

                        of useful j information. It speaks volumes in favour of Sir Rennell Rodd’s
                        mission when we say that that same officer, then Captain Harrington, is now
                        Lieut.-Colonel Sir John Harrington, K.C.V.O., C.B., H.B.M.’s Minister
                        Plenipotentiary at the Court of Menelik, and we quite agree with the author
                        when he says that the appointment has prove! to be in every way an ,
                        admirable one; he has, in spite of much opposi­tion, boldly maintained the
                        policy of the open | door, contending, rightly, the political ( predominance
                        of any one European country was incompatible with the maintenance of the
                        territorial integrity of Abyssinia, which the British Government was
                        anxious, and we hope' is still anxious, to see preserved.</p>
                    <p>The antagonists struggles, to which these two points of view have given rise
                            in Abyssi­nia, have centered around the affairs of the Ethiopian
                            Railway, and have entailed on that hitherto unfortunate concern such a
                            chequer­ed career, that before long one may expect to see it become an
                            irresistible attraction to the pans of soma of our ablest romancists.
                            The little book we have before Us contents itself, we believe, in
                            dealing with matters of ^ fact, but they have been set forth in a vary .
                            clever way, and give so clear a picture of the present the important
                            events which led up to it, that anyone at all interest­ed in the matter
                            should read this book. </p>
                    <p>The Ethiopian Empire is land-looked, and it was therefore only natural that
                        one of the earliest proposals submitted to Nienellk by his European advisers
                        was that of a railway to the coast. This railway most pass through the
                        territory of one of three foreign Powers ; France had at that time an
                        overwhelming predominance of influence in Abyssinia, and j France also
                        possessed the port of Djibouti at a distance of only about 56 miles from
                        Menelik's frontier. It was therefore only natural that the French Minister
                        Should use his in­fluence to obtain a concession for a railway from the
                        French port to the capital of Abyssi­nia, a distance of about 480 miles ;
                        and IQ due course such a concession was obtained, in 1894. The Emperor was
                        wise enough to see all the advantages which his occultly would gain by
                        opening op communications with the outer world moreover he had never seen
                        the Bea, which he was anxious to do, and also to improve his mind by foreign
                        travel and to make the acquaintance of his foreign friends of whom he | had
                        heard so much, and seen so little. Under proper guidance, he no doubt did
                        everything that the French Minister could reasonably expect of him to
                        encourage so good a work ; but in another way we think that he did a I good
                        deal more than the French Minister seems to have appreciated at that time,
                        and with much greater wisdom and for thought than the French seem to have
                        given him credit for. He most carefully stipulated that the railway was to
                        be built in three sections, the first of which was to extend from Djibouti
                        to Harrar, a distance of about 190 miles. It was under­stood that a special
                        permission was to be given ' for the construction of each of these sections
                        and that for the first section was duly given in November, 1896.</p>
                    <p>i Anxious though he was to get the railway 1 up to his capital, Menelik
                        wisely foresaw that</p>
                    <list type="simple">

                        without permission by special letter from himself Although ' the concession
                        gave large privileges, they were entirely of a commercial and not at all of
                        a political character.</p>
