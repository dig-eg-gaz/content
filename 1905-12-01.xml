                        <head>THE MUSEUM OF ANTIQUITIES.</head>
                        <p>All most acknowledge the immense amount
                            of care and labour expended by Professor
                            Maspero and his staff in successfully moving a
                            vast mass of antiquities from Ghizeh to the
                            new museum without the loss or injury of a
                            single object of importance, and in arranging
                            them. The achievement was most remarkable;
                            it demands and deserves the sincere homage
                            of all who can realise the difficulties and
                            the risks involved in so great an undertak-
                            ing. But there is a certain incomplete-
                            ness, a something lacking in the new
                            Museum of Antiquities. The building, the
                            antiquities, the staff of the Service — all
                            are there, but we miss the educational
                            functions of a museum, and their absence
                            inspires the present criticism, made with no
                            intention of mere fault-finding or causing
                            pain to officials who have laboured strenuously
                            in the cause of Egyptology, but rather to
                            point out to the authorities the right way
                            to make the museum more interesting and
                            of greater value to the world than is the case
                            at present.</p>
                        <p>What is the purpose of a museum? Is it
                            merely a safe in which curious or valuable
                            objects are preserved, or is it an educational
                            institution appealing, it is true, more to those
                            already instructed than to the general public,
                            but educational in its functions none the less?
                            We oould not justify the large sums of public
                            money, that have been expended on the
                            museum building if this were not the case,
                            and it is only on such grounds that the annual
                            grant of public funds to the Antiquities
                            Department can be justified. But, if the object
                            of the museum is educational, why is so little
                            done to fulfil it? Why is the museum so
                            useless for purposes of study, so poorly
                            equipped for them in comparison with all the
                            first-class collections of the Continent and
                            Great Britain? What other museum but pos-
                            sesses a large stock of folly descriptive labels
                            attached to all important objects, whether they
                            be Greek vases, rare lepidoptera, or unique
                            geological specimens?</p>
                        <p>We may be referred to the catalogue, but
                            the small catalogue does little but give the
                            visitor who chooses to buy it a. superficial idea
                            of the general arrangement of the objects
                            while the great catalogue—a monumental work—
                            is so vast, so cumbersome, and so expensive
                            as to be inaccessible to the majority. Descrip-
                            tive labels are entirely lacking in some cases,
                            while in others the objects are provided with
                            cards bearing perhaps the name of a king or a
                            dynasty. But this is not enough. How can
                            comparative study be carried on unless we are
                            told whence an object comes, and of what it
                            is a part. A statue or a piece of sculpture
                            bearing the name of Thothmes III. may come
                            from anywhere between Dongola and the
                            Mediterranean, but the cards are dumb.</p>
                        <p>And this neglect is worse than unwise, it
                            is not business when it affects a series of
                            objects which the museum may owe to the
                            special liberality of donors, among whom we
                            include those who pay  the cost of special
                            excavations. Would it not be well, pour en-
                            courager les autres, to give their names, and to
                            provide fully descriptive labels for the objects
                            which their efforts or their money have caused
                            to be brought to light? All who have the
                            pleasure of knowing the genial and kindly
                            Director of the Department of Antiquities
                            must realise that this neglect to which we call
                            attention is due to forgetfulness, and could
                            never arise from any desire to overlook or to
                            exclude what we venture to claim as no more
                            than a public right.</p>

                        <p>The "Slovo” states that a naval battle took
                            place on Tuesday at Sevastopol. It lasted two
                            hours. The rebel ships opened fire on the forts.
                            The cruiser Otchakoff was pierced and burst
                            into flames; the cruiser Dnieper, another ship,
                            and several torpedo-boats were sunk. Lieutenant
                            Schmidt, chief of the rebels, having been
                            killed, the squadron surrendered. Half the city
                            of Sevastopol is demolished.</p>

                            is that the mutineers lost heart when a rebel
                            torpedo-boat was sunk and two cruisers
                            damaged. They endeavoured to make the shore
                            in boats, but were intercepted by the loyal
                            torpedo-boats. Meanwhile; the loyal Bielostock
                            Regiment attacked the barracks held by the
                            mutinous seamen, 1,500 of whom surrendered
                            with 10 Maxims, owing to the attitude of the

                            there were only 7,498,167 bales. There was

                    <p>Mr. Cooke, secretary of the Cheshire Liberal
                        Unionist Association, recently directed Mr.
                        Chamberlain’s attention to the fact that the
                        removal of the octroi duties in Cairo made
                        provisions dearer, proving Protection often
                        cheapens and Free Trade raises prices to the
                        consumer. Mr. Cooke also urged that the
                        navigation laws required amendment. In his
                        reply to Mr. Cooke, Mr. Chamberlain said
                        he was in Cairo last year and could confirm
                        the statement as to the effect of the octroi.
                        He was also aware of the effect of the one-
                        sided navigation laws, which undoubtedly
                        tended to the disadvantage of British shipping

                        metres of water, has been emptying itself into

                        work of the bridge showed signs of having

                        the delay to traffic with Upper Egypt.</p>
                    <p>The rumour arose from the fact that the
                        earth fillings of the approaches to the bridge
                        had given way. The Railway Administration
                        is in consequence laying rails across an iron

                    <p>A Consular report just published in Berlin
                        shows a continued large increase of German
                        trade with Egypt. In the ten years to 1904
                        the exports from Germany to Egypt have
                        increased by £750,000, the totals being £350,000
                        in 1894 and £1,100,000 in 1904.</p>
                    <p>The German coal depots, established at Port
                        Said to compete with the British coal depots,
                        are doing a large trade, and are extremely
                        prosperous. The export of German coal to
                        Egypt reached a total of 63,000 tons last year.</p>
                    <p>During 1904 seventy German ships, of an
                        aggregate tonnage of 150,000, touched at
                        Alexandria. The Hamburg-Amerika Line is
                        starting a steamship service to the Nile, by
                        means of which it is expected that German
                        trade with the interior will be considerably
                        increased. German trade in Egypt is carried on
                        by a German colony of 1,300 persons, of whom
                        600 live at Alexandria, and 500 in Cairo.</p>

                    <head>TWO RECENT WORKS UPON
                        EGYPTIAN NUMISMATICS.</head>
                    <p>M. George Dattari, of Cairo, whose cabinet of
                        coins is so celebrated among numismatists, has
                        recently presented a paper to the Antiquarian
                        and Nomismatic Society of Montreal, Canada
                        referring to the celebrated statue of Serapis,
                        by Bryaxis. The raison d'etre of this monograph
                        is the deciding of the date of the statue’s
                        arrival at Alexandria, which M. Dattari
                        succeeds in achieving by means of evidence derived
                        from coins the effigies upon which be
                        considers completely settle the question. When
                        the essay is printed in extenso, we hope to be
                        permitted to publish a oomplete summary of
                        its contents.</p>
                    <p>Another and longer treatise of M. Dattari
                        may be found in that most excellent work the
                        “Journal International d’Archeologie
                        Numismatique" of Athens. It contains the learned
                        author’s comments upon a board of Athenian
                        tetradrachms found in Egypt. The thesis is
                        as follows. The Saitic dynasty to secure Egyptian
                        independence hired Greek mercenaries and
                        the Mendesian dynasty to oppose the Persians
                        went further, concluding an alliance with
                        Macedonia and Athens. From this period Macedonian
                        and Athenian coins are common in
                        Egypt Tachos of the 30th dynasty employed
                        90,000 Greek troops, and to pay the expense
                        of his Persian war he ordered his subject's to
                        deposit all their gold and silver in the Treasury.</p>
                    <p>From his time Athenian tetradrachms are
                        plentiful, but they are in most cases of very
                        inferior workmanship compared to the splendid
                        specimens of Athenian coinage. Athens at
                        this time was wealthy and powerful and her
                        coinage practically international in the Greek
                        world. M. Dietary argues from the coins that
                        Tachos struck “Athenian" tetradrachms here,
                        and absolutely proves his case by producing
                        a photograph of the die employed, which
                        was found in Egypt with the hoard of
                        tetradrachms, which are beautifully illustrated in
                        prototype plates accompanying the essay.
                        M. Dattari thinks Egypt imitated other Greek
                        coins, but reserves his remarks upon this for
                        another occasion.</p>

                        AND
                        THE BAGDAD RAILWAY.
                        GERMAN OPINION.</head>
                    <p>The significance and details of Sir William
                        Willcocks’ scheme for reconstructing the an-
                        cient system of irrigation works in Mesopota-
                        mia were discussed on Friday week at Berlin
                        at an important meeting of the German Asiati
                        Society. Dr. Wiedemann suggested that a rail
                        way should be built without farther delay from
                        Basra to Bagdad. No useful purpose, he argued:
                        could possibly by served by postponing work
                        on that section, which would open up to
                        cultivation the most fruitful part of Mesopo-
                        tamia, until after the completion of the
                        railway connecting Bagdad with the north.</p>
                    <p>Here Rashdau, of the German Diplomatic
                        Service, observed that Dr. Wiedemann’s pro-
                        posal had already been considered. It was
                        abandoned in deference to the interests of
                        Turkey, which required that the railway
                        should be built from north to south in order
                        that the mobilisation of its troops might
                        be accelerated, and also to furnish the Con-
                        stantinople authorities with the means of en-
                        forcing obedience on the Kurds.</p>
                    <p>He warned his hearers not to cherish op-
                        timistic views regarding the speedy prolonga-
                        tion of the railway. The country traversed
                        hitherto was of a comparatively easy character,
                        but the next sections offered great engineer-
                        ing difficulties, quite apart from the disor-
                        dered state of their administration. Who, he
                        asked, was to provide the money required
                        for the continuation of the enterprise ? Tur-
                        key could not, because the foreign Powers,
                        and particularly Great Britain, had been ren-
                        dered suspicious by the fantastic political
                        views imprudently aired by German writers,
                        and had refused to assent to any increase
                        in the Turkish Customs, with the object of
                        producing the requisite revenue.</p>
                    <p>Herr Rashdan also urged that German
                        manufacturers, merchants, and architects should
                        now employ their time in creating large
                        German interests and values in Mesopotamia.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Vosberg Reckow observed that the main
                        significance of the Bagdad Railway for Ger-
                        many's oversea policy must consist in the
                        circumstance that it would provide a new
                        highway to Asia, and thus be of political
                        importance to the whole world. It would
                        be quite easy, he said, to block the Suez
                        Canal for a considerable time. Moreover, the
                        Suez Canal was in control of the British, and
                        it was absolutely necessary that another over-
                        land and oversea route should be opened to
                        Asia.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Wiedemann did not agree with the argu-
                        ment that the Bagdad Railway would be of
                        vast importance as a means of communication
                        with Asia. The Siberian Railway he remarked,
                        had not acquired the importance with which
                        anticipation had invested it as a means of pro-
                        moting international traffic in goods. It had
                        merely exercised a certain effect on passenger
                        traffic to the Far East, by compelling compa-
                        nies to reduce their tariffs. The Bagdad Rail-
                        way, except in times of war, would fulfil its
                        chief function in fostering communication be-
                        tween the interior and the coasts. A railway
                        joining Basra with Bagdad would be a most
                        profitable undertaking, for it would give an
                        immense impetus to the culture of cotton.</p>
                    <p>Professor Otto Warburg, whose botanical
                        studies in the tropics have earned for him an
                        international reputation, argued that the Bag-
                        dad Railway would be of incalculable value
                        economically, and especially for the European
                        cotton industries. He  observed that the hopes
                        cherished in Germany of cultivating sufficient
                        cotton for the needs of the Empire in Africa
                        were illusory. The one country which was
                        suited for the growth of cotton was Mesopo-
                        tamia, and the northern portion of Syria.
                        The realisation of Sir William Willcocks's
                        project would open up, at an expense of
                        twenty millions stoning, two millions of
                        hectares to cultivation, but there were at
                        least two more millions of hectares in those
                        regions where artificial irrigation would be
                        unnecessary, and where cotton was already
                        grown in small quantities. A German company
                        had achieved very good results in the south of
                        Asia Minor.</p>
                    <p>Professor Warburg suggested that in-
                        ternational colonisation society should be
                        formed to acquire certain rights of adminis-
                        tration and jurisdiction in the territories to be
                        traversed by the Bagdad Railway, and to
                        colonise those territories with a labouring
                        population numerous enough to render practic-
                        able the cultivation of cotton on a large scale.
                        If such a society could be formed it would be
                        comparatively an easy matter to find the
                        money necessary for the reconstruction of the
                        ancient system of canals, and for assisting
                        settlers to attain economical prosperity. “In
                        this way alone,” concluded Professor Warburg,
                        "will it be possible for European cotton in-
                        dustries to liberate themselves from the
                        tyranny of America. The problem is one that
                        affects the entire European Continent, and it
                        must be solved, unless Europe is prepared to
                        abandon its cotton industries."</p>

                    <head>MEDICAL DISEASES OF EGYPT</head>
                    <p>The first volume of Dr. Sandwith's work,
                        published by Henry Kimpton, London, deals
                        mainly with infectious diseases. The value of
                        the work is greatly increased by the free
                        expression of personal opinion given by the
                        author, which, in view of Dr. Sandwith's many
                        years of Egyptian experience, renders the book
                        invaluable' to “Egyptian students of medicine
                        —and newly appointed English doctors—with-
                        out any knowledge of what sort of diseases
                        they are likely to meet among natives.” At the
                        same time the author has taken great trouble
                        over his references, a list of which is given
                        after each disease, and has endeavoured suc-
                        cessfully, we think to put before his readers a
                        compendium of the knowledge and the various
                        views on the diseases of Egypt.</p>
                    <p>The book is well printed and the articles on
                        the various diseases are easy and pleasant
                        reading. Occasionally we come across an opi-
                        nion with which we are not in agreement, as
                        for instance in the article on enteric fever
                        (page 71), where the author states: "the pangs
                        of hunger are only felt by those convalescents
                        who have undergone a mild case, for after a
                        long bout of fever the individual is too
                        exhausted to be hungry.” Our own personal
                        experience is distinctly contrary to this. On
                        page 114, in his article on infectious jaundice,
                        Dr. Sandwith passes a formidable sentence on
                        our great port town : "the drains of Alexan-
                        dria, constructed before the English Occupa-
                        tion by ignorant engineers, remain a disgrace
                        to that prosperous city, and when they are

                        taken in hand infectious jaundice will prob-
                        ably disappear.” Errors are few—on page 125
                        we notice in lines 8 and 9 a statement about
                        the British army of which the sense is not clear.</p>
                    <p>We notice in  page 152 a most excellent
                        table giving the differential diagnosis of in-
                        fluenza and dengue. This table should be most
                        useful, as all practitioners know the difficulty
                        sometimes experience in arriving at a certain
                        opinion in such doubtful cases. Two of the
                        most interesting articles in this volume are on
                        plague and pellagra. The historical and prac-
                        tical article on plague occupies 59 pages and
                        has over 40 references given of the measures adopted in
                        Egypt for dealing with this disease. The arti-
                        cle on pellagra is excellent. It is a matter
                        which Dr. Sandwith has made his own and the
                        disease is investigated carefully from every
                        point of view, and notes on no less than seven
                        cases are given fully. On page 312 are the
                        measures recommended to the Government by
                        Dr. Sandwith for dealing with the disease,
                        which are moderate and practical, though we
                        fear it will be difficult to deal with the cases
                        mentioned in paragraph 2, where he states
                        that poor peasants grow their own maize and
                        eat the "worst cobs which they cannot sell."
                        The opinion expressed on page 312 is well
                        worthy of notice : "Of all endemic disease to
                        which Egypt is subject I believe pellagra to be
                        the most important."</p>
                    <p>Without expressing absolute agreement with
                        all the statements contained in this volume, we
                        would cordially recommend it to all interested
                        in Egyptian medical matters, as a valuable
                        compendium of modern knowledge on the
                        subject.</p>

                    <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure
                        in presenting to its subscribers the accompany-
                        ing description of some of the many interesting
                        routes by which they may travel homewards.
                        Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it
                        will be found that none of them are fraught
                        with difficulty. In choosing the route home
                        there are several things to be considered. To
                        begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which
                        you may arrive in Europe.</p>
                    <p>This depends partly upon the month in
                        which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in January
                        may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and
                        possibly not so warm as Sicily, but in March
                        it will be warmer than Rome, and more uni-
                        formly warm than many other places in Europe
                        Many people leave Egypt fartoo early in the
                        year, for as a rule the weather in April and
                        May is perfect. The warmest place to go to
                        on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration
                        the number of days to be spent at sea, and we
                        therefore subjoin a list showing the time oc-
                        cupied on each of the various routes between
                        Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>
                    <p>They are as follows:-</p>
                    <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or
                        Alexandria to Plymouth, Southhampton, London
                        or Liverpool—occupy about 4 days. The
                        short ones are as follows:—</p>

                    <p>The steamers, of the P.&amp;0. North German
                        Lloyd, Orient and Messageriea Maritimes
                        are the largest. The Anchor, British India,
                        and Bibby Lines are also excellent, and their
                        steamers, are largely patronised by travellers
                        to Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo,
                        the shortest is that to Alexandria, without
                        change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now
                        be made without change in 4.5 hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by
                        the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and Westcott
                        lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool.
                        The German Levant line has also good steamers
                        from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                    <p>The most expensive but quickest through
                        Continental routes are by P.&amp;O. Brindisi
                        express from Port 8aid, and the Austrian
                        Lloyd Trieste Vienna express from Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne
                        in mind that very little luggage is allowed
                        free on the railways of Europe, but there are
                        several good and responsible forwarding agents
                        in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>

                        from Port Said is undoubtedly by the fast
                        Mail Steamers “Osiris" and “Isis” to Brindisi.
                        One of these leaves port Said every week, as
                        soon as possible after receiving the, Indian
                        mails from the great liner arrived from
                        Bombay.</p>
                    <p>These small but comfortable ships have
                        enormously powerful engines, and attain a
                        very high rate of speed. They are called the
                        "Ferry Boats" having been specially built to
                        carry the British mail from Port Said to
                        Brindisi. If you are going straight through to
                        England you will find the train waiting at
                        Brindisi which will take you to Calais without
                        changing. It has complete arrangements for
                        sleeping and eating on board, and you should
                        arrive in London on the fifth day from leaving
                        Port Said.</p>

                    <p>The, direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-
                        Rubattino Co.’s steamers which leave Alex-
                        andria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes
                        train to TAORMENA, one of the most charm-
                        ing and popular places on the island. Giardini
                        is the station at which to alight, and the drive
                        up to Taormina is most delightful, occupying
                        about one hour. In and around the town is
                        much to interest the visitor. The theatre is of
                        Greek origin, but restored under the Romans.
                        CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent
                        of Etna and here also is a fine Cathedral. The
                        Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that
                        are found all over the island, are an endless
                        sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an
                        interesting history, having been a Greek
                        city, which was designed by Demosthenes in
                        B.C. 413, and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212,
                        when Archimedes was slain—his tomb is to be
                        seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan
                        temple. PALERMO, with about 300,000
                        inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and
                        enjoys a delightful climate. Much of interest
                        is to be found in this fine city. The Palazzo
                        Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the
                        church of S. Giovannia degli Eremiti with its
                        picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral, Museum,
                        Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park
                        are also worth a visit.</p>

                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German
                        Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        during the season for Naples, the voyage
                        being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from
                        Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.’s steam-
                        ers, which leave daily. One cannot approach
                        Naples or leave it without wishing to explore
                        some of its islands, besides the lovely places
                        on its bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The
                        small steamer that takes you to Sorrento [you
                        can drive too] will tike you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of
                        but five hours. All who can will devote at
                        least one week to visiting the many historical
                        and interesting portions of the Eternal City,
                        whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret,
                        a railway journey of five hours brings you to
                        FLORENCE, where another week can well be
                        spent admiring the City of Flowers and its
                        surrounding country. In Florence itself the
                        churches and galleries are of absorbing inte-
                        rest, whilst the local promenades and excur-
                        sions should not be omitted. The Cascine is
                        the most attractive and fashionable promenade
                        in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of
                        the finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years
                        ago, goes winding up through the hills a
                        distance of four miles. The most delightful
                        excursion outside Florence is that to Vallom-
                        brosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the
                        sea level. This is made first by ordinary train
                        from Florence to St. Ellero, thence by cog-
                        wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through
                        groves of oaks takes an hour, and most
                        striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in
                        about 2 hours ; hero there is a fine Cathedral
                        and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one
                        night should if possible be made in order to
                        enjoy the view from the Campanile at sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful
                        places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa and on
                        the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a
                        very convenient half-way house between Egypt
                        and England, and where living is reasonable
                        and the air and surroundings exceptionally
                        good.</p>

                        beautiful windows illustrating the History of
                        the Bible. The public gardens and the monu-

                    <head>NORTHERN ITALY (Continued)
                        and The ITALIAN LAKES.</head>
                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from
                        Milan, and one of the most delightful places
                        imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total 
                        absence of vehicular traffic strikes one as very
                        strange ; no horse, cart, carriage or bicycle is
                        to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life
                        at every turn. The approach to Venice from
                        the Adriatic is unlike that of anyf other sea
                        port. The town seems to be gradually, like
                        Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills behind, no
                        stretches of rock, but first the tops of Cam-
                        paniles appear above the horizon, then slowly
                        the whole glittering town rises like a fairy
                        mirage out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the
                        tour of the beautiful Italian lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny,
                        is reached in one-and-a-quarter hours by train 
                        by way of Monza :</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other
                        towns on the lake, which is very beautiful, and
                        the scenery on either side going up the lake is
                        most enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming
                        spot; then come Tremezzo, Cadenabbia, and
                        Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of
                        Bellaggio opposite. The walk from Tremezzo
                        along the shore of the lake to Menaggio is most
                        enjoyable. A steam tram runs from Menaggio
                        to Porlezza on Lake Lugano in three-quarters
                        of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in two-and
                        -three-quarter hours.</p>

                        The church Madonna del Sasso, situated above

                    <p>By, Sir Hanburt Brown, K.C.M.G.. late Inspector-General of
                        Irrigation in Lower Egypt, and formerly in Upper Egypt.</p>
                    <p>v.</p>
                    <p>The Assouan reservoir of the Nile supple-
                        ments a summer discharge in the river ; but
                        in India there are storage reservoirs formed by
                        dams constructed across, gorges in the hills
                        which entirely, furnish, the summer supply of
                        the tracts depending on them without help
                        from any associated river. In the preparation
                        of the projects for such works as these, careful
                        calculations of the rainfall and "flow off" of the
                        catchment must be made, as there are no
                        better means of arriving at the figures which
                        represent the amount of water that will flow
                        into the reservoir. In the case of the Nile
                        storage the river discharges at the very site
                        of the reservoir, for all seasons and for all
                        years of varying levels, were known, so that
                        the quantity of water available in any year for
                        filling the reservoir could be calculated with
                        much greater precision than is possible when
                        the calculation has to be based on rainfall
                        statistics and on an assumed proportion of
                        “flow off.”</p>
                    <p>There is one more source of water supply
                        deserving of mention in connection with irri-
                        gation, namely, wells. It is estimated that in
                        British India no less than 13 million acres are
                        watered from wells, or more than 25 per cent
                        of the whole irrigated area of India. So that
                        this source has its importance, but from an
                        agricultural point of view rather than from
                        that of the engineer.</p>
                    <p>Mention has been made above of pumps as
                        a means of artificially raising water tor irriga-
                        tion on a comparatively small scale. In India
                        pumping stations have hitherto taken no part
                        in the irrigation of the country. But in Egypt
                        pumps play an important part; and, at one
                        time, 1883, it was proposed by the then Direc
                        tor-General of Public Works to abandon all
                        attempts to make the Delta Barrage do the
                        work of artificially raising the water level of
                        the Nile to the extent necessary for the irriga-
                        tion of the Delta, and to erect powerful pump-
                        ing stations as a substitute. The cost of work-
                        ing these stations was estimated at £250,000 a
                        year. At this critical moment of Egyptian irri-
                        gation Sir Colin Scott Monecrieff was given
                        charge of it, and the question whether the
                        Delta should depend for its irrigation on the
                        barrage restored or on pumping stations, prac-
                        tically rested with him to decide. Fortunately
                        for Egypt he preferred the barrage, add forth-
                        with took steps to make it do its work, and
                        with complete success. The barrage costs less
                        than £10.000 a year to maintain and regulate,
                        and without any farther expense is capable of
                        distributing any increased supply that may be
                        provided to meet the growing area of cultiva-
                        tion ; whereas the cost of lifting the water by
                        pumps—estimated at £250,000 a year in 1883,
                        before the development of the Delta that has
                        taken place during the past twenty years—
                        would increase with the quantity of water to
                        be lifted, and fluctuate with the price of coal.
                        Moreover, a war might at some time have cut
                        off the coal supply, and Egypt's cotton, now
                        worth £5,000,000 a year, would have been
                        lost. The barrage was undoubtedly the best
                        servant to engage in the interests of Egypt. It
                        has, since its restoration, become so efficient,
                        and so unmistakably the proper instrument
                        for the water distribution of the Delta, that
                        one large pumping station, that had already
                        been erected before Sir Colin's time, has since
                        been dismantled and its engines and pumps
                        transferred to another station which provides
                        for the drainage of certain lands below sea
                        level.</p>
                    <p>This instance is given to show that the
                        merits of pumping stations, as an alternative
                        method of raising water, have sometimes to
                        be considered in working out a project of
                        irrigation. At the present moment there is a
                        scheme under construction in Madras for the
                        irrigation of 50,000 acres by pumping, the lift
                        being from 10ft. to 12ft.</p>
                    <p>Though the Government scheme of irriga-
                        tion in Egypt dispenses with the aid of pumps
                        —with the exception of an unimportant sur-
                        vival at one point of the Delta-still a con-
                        siderable area of its cultivation depends for
                        its irrigation on pumping stations owned by
                        private estates and individuals, as there is a
                        large proportion of the cultivated area which
                        is above the reach of “free flow" from the
                        canals.</p>
                    <p>As a conclusion to the consideration of the
                        points which affect the drawing up of a canal
                        scheme, a few words more concerning drainage
                        may be added to what has already been said
                        about its importance. The subject must not
                        be set on one side to receive consideration
                        after the canals have been made, and until it
                        forces itself into prominence by the evils that
                        result from its neglect The natural drainage
                        lines, as has been said, should not be obstructed.
                        They follow, as a rule, the depressions which
                        lie between the ridges on which the canals
                        should be run. But if there be no decided
                        depressions, or if the land is flat, drains should
                        be dug on the most convenient alignment
                        between the canals, and, in such a case, it is
                        the distribution of the canals rather than the
                        physical features of the ground which de-
                        termines the position of the drains.</p>
                    <p>It is not an easy matter to decide what
                        dimensions should be given to the drains. It
                        is desirable, if the outfall allows, to keep the
                        water surface in the drains 2ft. or 8ft. below
                        soil. The maximum discharge which should
                        be provided for will be proportional to the
                        area to be drained and will depend on the
                        rainfall as well as on the description of irriga-
                        tion practiced. Rice land will discharge at
                        least double the amount that ordinary crops
                        do. In Egypt it was at one time assumed that
                        one third of the water used for the irrigation
                        of such crops as cotton and maize found its
                        way into the drains, and 8 cubic metres a day</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>per acre of area commanded was considered to
                        be the quantity that represented this third.
                        But, though this allowance may be sufficient
                        for the main drains, it is not enough for the
                        branches. For on the main drains a fairly
                        constant discharge is maintained as the
                        average drainage of a large extent of country,
                        as some branch drains may be discharging one
                        day and some another, the ones that are dis-
                        charging being balanced by those that have
                        ceased discharging. But the branch drains dis-
                        charge under different conditions, flowing and
                        not flowing alternately for let us assume, equal
                        periods. Consequently, as the maximum flow
                        must be that which determines the drain sec-
                        tion, and, accepting 8 cubic metres a day per
                        acre served by the drain as the average run
                        off, we must allow a section that will carry the
                        same allowance in half time, that is, we must
                        allow for a discharge at the rate of 16 cubic
                        metres a day per acre. On the minor branches
                        the discharge is still more fitful, and the allow-
                        ance of section most be still greater. Now the
                        maximum discharge allowed in the canals for
                        purposes of irrigation has been usually calcu-
                        lated at the rate of 25 cubic metres a day per
                        acres of gross area, the drainage maximum in
                        any drain should, therefore, be something less
                        than this, and it would seem to be sufficient to
                        make the main drain below the inflow of the
                        lowest branch drain capable of carrying a
                        discharge calculated at the rate of 8 cubic
                        metres a day per acre of land draining into it;
                        and to make the minor branches, at the other
                        or upper extremity of the drained area, capable
                        of carrying 18 cubic metres a day per acre,
                        while the intermediate drains would be given a
                        discharging capacity at the rate of 15, 12, and
                        10 cubic metres a day per acre according to
                        their position on the drainage system to which
                        they belonged. This example is given merely
                        as a general illustration of the principle on
                        which a drainage system should be designed,
                        and not as laying down any details as to the
                        amount of drainage which should be provided
                        for, as different countries have different condi-
                        tions which require to be met in each case.</p>

                    <p>A return has been prepared by Mr W.

                        in Lancashire by limited liability companies.
                        From this it appears that seven mills contain-
                        ing 540,000 spindles using Egyptian cotton
                        have got fully to work within the last few

                        yarn mills with 610,000 spindles have partly
                        commenced. In addition to these, 16 mills, to
                        contain 1,605,000 spindles, all of which will
                        spin Egyptian cotton, are in course of erection,
                        making a total of 30 mills and 2,755,000

                    <head>EGYPTIAN BANKS.</head>
                    <p>In a leaderette on the subject of Egyptian
                        Banks, the “Financial Times" says: Although
                        movements in the shares of Egyptian banks
                        play rather a prominent part in the market for
                        Egyptian securities, it must be understood that
                        the decline recently seen in no way reflects
                        upon the working of these concerns. Owing to
                        the fact that a large Continental interest is
                        attached to the development of Egypt, several
                        of the newer banks, such as the National of
                        Egypt and the Agricultural Bank of Egypt,
                        have their capital in the form of "bearer"
                        shares, which, of course, lenders speculation in
                        them easier than in the English form of re-
                        gistered shares. Speculators in Cairo and on the
                        Continent would seem to have been dazzled by
                        the great prosperity shown by Egypt of late
                        years, and have pushed up the price of these
                        shares to such a pitch that those well con-
                        versant with business in the country have for
                        a long time past considered that they were
                        above the level which ordinary conditions
                        should warrant their reaching. In consequence,
                        many of the shares have been lifted from
                        Europe, and have gone to Egypt, where the
                        operators, relying upon loans from some of the
                        purely local banks, have been carrying them as
                        a speculation. When the usual pinch for money
                        occasioned by the moving of the cotton crop
                        was felt in the country, these speculators have
                        found themselves in a rather awkward position,
                        and, no doubt, they have had to throw over-
                        board some of their holdings. This is the history
                        of the present depression in the shares, and it
                        does not in any way reflect upon the manage-
                        ment of the concerns themselves.</p>

                            in command. Major Hickman joined the 19th
                            Yorkshire Regiment in 1880, and was trans-

                            and he was with the 1st Battalion in its

                            medicine was first invented, and we might
                            leave them to fall out, to the end of the chapter,
                            were it not for the mischievous results that
                            sometimes follow. There is a controversy rag-
                            ing at this moment between the champions and
                            opponents of a new scheme for minimising, if
                            not eliminating, enteric fever from troops both
                            in peace and war. An eminent civil doctor, Dr.
                            Leigh Canney, of Assouan, has established a
                            theory that with a proper system of sterilising
                            drinking water the terrible outbreaks of disease
                            might be practically avoided. It only needs
                            organisation, a little elaborate; perhaps, but
                            perfectly feasible, by means of which pure
                            water can always be within reach of the
                            soldiers, in camp and quarters, on the march,
                            and in the fighting line. Carts with water on
                            the boil are to be perpetually available, and
                            their presence near the front is deemed of im-
                            portance  only second to that of bringing up
                            ammunition. The principle was, as a matter of
                            fact, accepted soon after it was propounded,
                            and the system seemed likely to be introduced
                            in our Army a couple of years ago. But the
                            proposal has hung fire ever since, mainly
                            because it did not commend itself to our Army
                            Medical Advisory Board. The only reason
                            given is that the authorities contend that the
                            enteric bacillus is not invariably water-borne.
                            There are other avenues of infection, such as
                            air, dust, and flies, although it is not denied
                            that water is the principal. In other words,
                            because opinions an not quite agreed on the
                            sources of the disease no steps are to be taken
                            to combat it when it appears, and we shall

                            as in the Boer War, with the same lethal con-
                            sequences . It must be accepted as a reproach
                            to us that the Japanese have shown a more
                            enlightened spirit and carried out the essentials
                            of the sterilising scheme in their recent great
                            campaign.</p>

                        <p>A good deal of fun has been poked at the
                            Army Council for their late order with regard
                            to polo playing. It can hardly be possible that
                            the game is so little understood by the rulers
                            of the British Army that it is found necessary
                            to forbid officers to ride their chargers when
                            playing it. A polo pony might and has been
                            need as a charger, but the contrary is hardly
                            possible. We shall hear next that the automo-
                            bile, of which there are some now on public
                            charge, or the elephant, is tabooed. The atti-
                            tude of the authorities towards polo is rather
                            strange. This last order grew out of a humble
                            request from those interested in the game that
                            the War Office should express its wishes and
                            lay down rules and regulations for polo. The
                            answer was a contemptuous repudiation of the
                            game entirely; it did not care for polo or
                            recognise it in any way. It did not quite like
                            to forbid it—that would have been too retro-
                            grade in regard to a sport which is universally
                            admitted to have its uses far beyond mere
                            amusement. The game develops high qualities,
                            skill, and readiness of hand and eye, great
                            promptitude in action, and encourages fine
                            horsemanship. It may, of course, lead to 
                            extravagance—prohibitory prices are sometimes
                            paid for ponies - but this could be regulat-
                            ed by authority, and the advantages gained
                            are far in excess of the possible drawbacks.</p>
