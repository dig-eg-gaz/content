                    <head>CHRISTMAS TIDE.</head>
                    <p>''Christmas comes but once a year, And when it comes it brings good cheer."</p>
                    <p>So runs the old couplet—and as far as the first line is concerned it is almost 
                        universally correct. But it fails to take into account such an exceptional 
                        state of things as that to be found in this country. Here we have a large 
                        Greek element, and while the Anglican Protestant Church and the Latin Churches 
                        generally celebrate the birth of Christ on December 25th, the Greek and Eastern 
                        Churches defer their celebration till the 7th of January—the period of the 
                        Epiphany. Consequently we get in Egypt two Christmas Days in the year, each 
                        observed by a large number of commercial men ; indeed, so large is the Greek 
                        com munity here that practically business is suspended in most houses on the 
                        later as well as the earlier date. What a boon would this be considered in the 
                        busy City of London-at least by the employes, for such a state of things would 
                        hardly commend itself to the heads of firms, so greatly would it interfere with 
                        business of all kinds in that world's centre.</p>
                    <p>It is interesting to study the early records of the observance of Christmas Day. 
                        In a previous Christmas article we showed that its origin was distinctly pagan and 
                        quite unconnected with the birth of Jesus Christ. Indeed, many early writers hold 
                        that it was a special</p>

                    <p>providence that appointed the birth of Christ to take place in the-midst of 
                        pagan festivals. Neander gives a long account of these, and considers that a 
                        festival held on the shortest day—the winter solstice—presented the 
                        opportunity of a transition to the Christian point of view ; Christ, the sun 
                        of the spiritual world, being compared with the sun of the material world. 
                        The comparison was carried still further, for as in the material world it is 
                        after darkness has reached its highest point that the end of its dominion is 
                        already near, and the light begins to acquire fresh-power, so, too, in the 
                        spiritual world Christ, the spiritual sun, must appear to make an end of the 
                        kingdom of darkness. But the date to be observed presented a difficulty, and 
                        while the Western Churches decided on the 25th December, the Eastern Churches
                        deferred it till the Epiphany. Hence the difference of dates at the present time.</p>
                    <p>Christmas is a time when absent friends claim a goodly share of our thoughts. 
                        Coupled with these, no doubt, in the minds of many Englishmen resident in Egypt, 
                        is the regret that they cannot be in the old country "to put their legs under 
                        the parental mahogany," and enjoy the roast beef of Old England, or the plump 
                        Norfolk Turkey. These are things that are perhaps not obtainable in this 
                        country. But we would say to our young friends, "Cheer up! Cold storage has 
                        been introduced, and if you cannot feast on a good sirloin of Scotch beef, 
                        you may get that excellent substitute, a joint of the rich meat that comes 
                        from all parts, North Central, and South, of the American continent and which 
                        loses so little of its flavor in the freezing process, that it is often enjoyed 
                        as much as, and even preferred before,—when the source from which it comes is 
                        not known —the home-fed beef. And the children—(bless them !), what of them at 
                        Christmas time ? A glance at the shop windows fully assures us that they are 
                        not forgotten. It is worth while to pay a visit to the bazaars and large drapery 
                        establishments if only to note the plethora of dolls, mechanical toys, and 
                        novelties of all descriptions that are offered to the purchasers of present 
                        s for the little ones. The Christmas tree, too, is quite an institution in 
                        Egypt. So we wish to "one and all, both great and small," a very Merry Christmas 
                        and a Happy New Year. Now a-days it is the custom to alter the wish to that for a
                        Happy Christmas, and taking into consideration the very many cases where the 
                        season from various causes cannot be a merry one, the old wish often seems a 
                        mockery. We can wish everybody happiness from the bottom of our hearts.</p>
                    <p>The "good cheer of Christmas is too well established a thing for the old customs 
                        ever to be broken. The fashions may change and the Yule Log disappear, but never 
                        will Christ-mastide cease to be associated with family reunions and general 
                        feasting. Of late years a growing tendency has manifested itself to make the 
                        festival a time for a more general loosening of the purse-strings than formerly. 
                        That Christmastime is the only period of the year that many open their hearts 
                        and their purses for the benefit of the poor is a sad reflection, and reminds 
                        us of so many people who only put on religion with their Sunday clothes and 
                        feel when they take them off that there is lo necessity to think about spiritual 
                        matters for another six days. None the less do we rejoice to see the movement 
                        extend year after year, and if the progress is slow we trust that it will be 
                        sure. In the large cities of Cairo and Alexandria we have many destitute 
                        wanderers who will be glad to receive some of the g. od things of the season, 
                        and no doubt the Rudolph and other Homes will receive an increase of support 
                        that will enable them to give the poor who apply to them a good Christmas meal.</p>

                    <head>A BROKEN-DOWN SYSTEM.</head>
                    <p>This is a condition (or disease) to which doctors give many names, but which few
                        of them really understand. It it simply weakness—a break-down, as it were, of
                        the vital forces that sustain the system. No matter what may be its causes (for
                        they are almost numberless), its symptoms are much the same; the more prominent
                        being sleeplessness, sense of prostration or weariness, depression of spirits
                        and want of energy for all the ordinary affairs of life. Now, what alone is
                        absolutely essential in all such cases is increased vitality—vigour--</p>
                    <p>VITAL STRENGTH &amp; ENERGY</p>
                    <p>to throw off these morbid feelings, and experience proves that as night succeeds
                        the day this may be more certainly secured by a course of the celebrated
                        life-reviving tonic</p>
                    <p>THERAPION No.3</p>

                        "used up," and valueless. This wonderful medicament is purely vegetable and
                        innocuous, is agreeable to the taste —suitable for all constitutions and
                        conditions, in either sex; and it is difficult to imagine a case of disease or
                        derangement, whose main features are those of debility, that will not be
                        speedily and permanently benefited by this never-failing recuperative essence,
                        which is destined to cast into oblivion everything that had preceded it for this
                        wide-spread and numerous class of human ailments.</p>
