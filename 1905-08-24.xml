                    <p>Although the proposed Constantinople-Bag- dad railway has attracted, perhaps,
                        more attention than any other line in the Near Bast, it is not by any means
                        the only railway whioh has been oonstruoted in the Moslem oountries whioh
                        lie between the -ffigean and the Persian gulf The line from Soutari to
                        Angora via Beki-shehr has been open to traffic for some time, and has now
                        been linked with the Smyrna railway at Kara-Hissar, the Soutari-Eski-ehehr-
                        Eara-Hissar railway being the first great sec- tion of the
                        Constantinople-Bagdad railway. The seoond section, Kara-Hissar to AH»n» has
                        reached Bregli, and a line of some 30 miles in length runs from Mersina to
                        Adana, and will one day meet the grand trunk line as it debouohes from the
                        pastes of the Taurus. The British scheme for a Bagdad railway whioh was put
                        forward a good many years ago, and foiled owing to want erf support from the

                        'ohemin de guerre' to the Turk is abundantly justified by an examination of
                        the oouree of the German line, and the branch lines projected to the north.
                        A line an "the left bank of the Eu- phrates between Aleppo and Deir does not

                        difficulties in the south to call upon the warlike Turkish population that
                        surrounds this important military oentro.lt may be argued that the Kurds are
                        unrelia- ble and undisciplined, but the foot that a war with the infidel, or
                        with Arab rebels ih Irak Arabi, would give them excellent opportunities for

                        as foes, however poor their discipline may be. Another line, whioh will link
                        Angora with Siwas and Erxeroum is proposed. The close proximity of the last
                        named town to the Rn««i»r. frontier sufficiently explains the purpose of

                        dominions We have already discussed the Hodjaz line, of whioh the Damascus—

                        as a whole, can never pay. The Beyrout—Da- masous and Reyak—Hama railway

                        trunk line from north 40 south, whioh may and one day at Mecca. The
                        Jaffa-Jerusalem line is well enough known to the tourist, and is of some
                        economic im- portance, whioh will be increased when it is carried
                        north-eastward over the Jordan to join the Hodjas Railway. A soheme to link

                        Egyptians, and long ago fsarod by those Turks whose memory of the exploits
                        of Mohamad All, or dislike of enlightenment, makes thapi dread the invasion
                        of Syria by Egyptian influence. Were it possible to persuade the Turkish go-
                        vernment that Egypt is not a home of Anti" ~ Ottoman conspiracy,the
                        oonstruotion and main- tenance of suoh a line would be of gnat benefit to
                        Egypt and Syria alike, but unfortunately the Turkish authorities do not aim
                        so much at benefiting Syria as at strengthening their own military position,
                        and the fact that Syria and Palestine are garrisoned by some ninety

                <head>SYRIA’S TRADE IN 1904.</head>
                <head>DAMASCUS</head>
                <p>Mr. Richards, H.B.M.'s Consul at Damasons, wiuts out in his report on the trade
                    of the Syrian oapital in 1904, that absolutely, or even, in some oases,
                    relatively* accurate data ; are unattainable. owing to the absenoe of any !
                    official figures of the amount and value of the - exports and imports Of the
                    vilayet In 1901 , trade seems to have been normal, though a , bad harvest had,
                    of ooune, considerable . influence on the purchasing powers of the , peasantry.
                    Sogar appears to have risen enorm- ously in prioe owing,' it is said, to the .
                    withdrawal of the Austro-Hungarian Govern- , ment bounty hitherto granted to
                    Bogar exporters, and the failure of the beetroot . crop in'Austria and Rustia.
                    Another oause - was the oessation of the cholera epidemic ; whioh had raged for
                    nearly a year inthe oountry, The oonnectioD does not seem ob- ‘ vions at first
                    sight but is easy enough to realise, when the foot is grasped that the
                    onsumption of tea, and consequently of , sugar, rises abnormally during an
                    epidemo ; whioh makes evta the waters of Abana and j Pharphar suspect , Egyptian
                    rice completely ousted the Genoa artiole in the vilayet, and appears to be the ;
                    best obtainable, the Rangoon produot coming , second. No loss than 70 % of the
                    whole , import of rioe came from Egypt and Egyptian sugar was also more freely
                    imported than before. Tbe export of native silk and ootton fabrics to Egypt
                    increased, and Cairo took nearly all the handsome silver girdles, which every
                    tourist knows, amounting to some £7,000 in value. These girdles, Mr. Richards
                    states are made as a rule, oat of melted Maria- Teresa dollars imported from
                    Aden and the Straits Settlements, and are sold at about two shillings each. To
                    tarn to the trade with the United Kingdom and with India, British imports con-
                    sist mainly of cotton goods, ootton and woollen yams, doth, hardware and metals.
                    The slight decline reoorded is easily explained by the bad harvest, and it is
                    satistaotory to note that despite dismal forecasts of the ousting of British
                    ootton goods and yarn by Italian and German product i, these dangerous
                    competitors are losiog ground. British ootton yarn advanoed from 41 to 60 % of
                    the whole trade in this artiole and the United Kingdom is responsible for 82 %
                    of the whole import of ootton goods. Hardware fell off owing to the faot that
                    one throwing machine only was imported in the oourae of tha year. Mr. Richards
                    remarks that Syria is extraordinarily backward in this respeot,even for an
                    Oriental country,land^notas the conservatism of the few large land owners who
                    oould afford- to purchase up-to-date agri- cultural machinery. On the other hand
                    a con- siderable number of stocking-knitting maohinee are yearly imported,
                    selling for £9 12s. eaoh, and there is some demand for sewing machines Bioyoles—
                    mirabiU dicta I — have also bdffli sent to Syria, bat as the author of the
                    report justly remarks, "the execrable state of the roads makes the demand for
                    this means of looo- mation less and less every year.” It is perhaps a sign
                    of'the times that while the lawful im- portation of cheap andinferior sporting
                    smooth- bores fell off in 1904,the illicit import trade in serviceable rifles
                    showed an inoreaae. The Martini-Henry was the favorite pattern, but Mansers and
                    Miionliohera found their way into the oountry. This year the trade is said to be
                    prospering, and quite a number of Mausers have found their way to the Hauran,
                    while Martinis, with eaoh of whioh fifty rounds of ammunition are given away,
                    are as popular as ever. ► The report throws some interesting side- lights on the
                    eoonomic condition of the oountry, and on the changes that, even in the East,
                    affect the demand for certain goods. Marble is no longer so freely used in
                    domestio arehi- teotare. The Damascenes 'are nowadays more economically inclined
                    than they used to be in the matter of the adornment of the oonrtyards, and still
                    more of the interiors of their houses, into ^rhich marble^)lain and riohly
                    sculptured, entered largely and lavishly to the extent of many thousands of
                    pounds. All this extra- vaganoe is how a thing of the past, to the I great' loss
                    of Italian importers Who have a monopoly of the article.’ We have not ^he spaoe
                    for farther dis- oussion of the leading fodtureeiri these interesting reports,
                    but would like to point out to British merchants in the Near East that there are
                    plenty of openings for trade in Syria and Palestine, and that, thanks to the
                    high rapntation of British goods, and, we may add, of British traders,energy
                    oombined with a readiness to attend to the eoonomio needs of the people, will
                    meet with their reward. The town population shows a wish to better itself that
                    may be manifested in strange ways—eg. in an increasing demand for ready-made
                    sails of exceptional atrocity—bnt should none the less be olosely studied by
                    British firms and their agents of travellers.</p>
