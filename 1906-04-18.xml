                    <head>The Education Bill</head>
                    <p>The Bishop of London, in a letter condeming the Education Bill yesterday,
                        annonnces the summoning of a mass meeting in the Albert Hall for the 11th
                        May, which is to be the first of a series dealing with the question which ii
                        naturally absorbing so much attention at home, While many of the detail* of
                        Mr. Birrell’a scheme most necessarily remain obscure until the text of the
                        Bill is printed, the main principle emerge* without possibility of
                        oontradiction. The old voluntary schools, which since the Act of 1902 have
                        been referred to in state documents as "non-provided,” are to be swept away.
                        After January 1, 1908, no public elementary school will be allowed to
                        receive * peony of public money, either from rates or taxes, if it does not
                        abandon its character and become a “provided” school within the meaning of
                        the Act. That is to say, managers appointed by the local Education authority
                        are to be substituted for the existing boards on which the clergy are
                        represented ; there is to be no inquiry into the religions beliefs of the
                        head teachers, and, with a certain exception to be mentioned immediately, no
                        distinctive religions teaching in the shape of Catechistn or formulary is to
                        be imparted within the schools. Where, however, the local authority can come
                        to terms with the owners of an existing “noty provided ’ school, the
                        following arrangement may be made. From Monday to Friday during the boon
                        between nine and tour these schools are to belong absolutely to the local
                        authority, their used during Saturday and 8nnday, and in the evenings, being
                        reserved to the owners. And “facilities” ate to be provided by the local
                        education authority for special denominational teaching in these schools, by
                        enabling children whose parents desire it to receive such teaching lor half
                        an boar on two mornings in the week, presumably during school hours. Sock
                        teaching is to be provided at the expense of the parent, and the school
                        teachers are expressly prohibited film giving it. By a further provision,
                        which is obviously and almost avowedly intended to “square” the Roman
                        Catholic, > public inquiry may be held in the oaae it any transferred
                        voluntary sshool in an urban ares, and where funr-fifths of the parents
                        desire that the exiating denominational education may be continued,
                        “facilities for religions instruction of a special character," as it is
                        euphemistically expressed, may be provided. Snob, to put it as briefly and
                        teohnically as possible, is the scheme by which the Church oi England is to
                        be robbed of her schools and her clergy driven ignominiocsly not of the
                        buildings for the very existence of which they and their predecessors are to
                        largely responsible. When it is remembered that more than half the children
                        in public elementary schools at the present moment an being educated in
                        “non-provided” schools, the extent of the revolution may be imagined. As the
                        "Globe” says, a blow is being dealt at the Church, only comparable with its
                        foimtl disestablishment. Not the slightest recognition ia made of the
                        sacrificed by which past generations of Chnrohmen have provided ont rif
                        their own pooketa for the neglect and the shortcomings of the State. No
                        allowance is made for the millions which have been raised by Churchmen for
                        elementary education since 1171, when the State first took up its
                        obligations. Even since 19G2 the sums expended by tbs friends of voluntary
                        schools in order to- compete with the exacting requirements of unfriendly
                        educational authorities have amounted to a very considerable figure. In ths
                        urban areas it is possible that the “fonr- fifths” olaose may not aot
                        exclusively in favour of the Roman Catholios. The demand for dogmatio
                        teaohing is not oonfined to Homan Catholic parents, and if the public
                        inquiry is conducted with any semblanoe of fairness, we shall be surprised
                        if "extended opportunities for denominational teaohing” have not to be
                        sopplied to Church of England echools, whose tendenoy is of the type moBt
                        abhorrent to Dr. Clifford and Mr. Hollowell. But, as would inevitably happen
                        in the parallel oase of diaestablisbment, it is the ratal districts which
                        will suffer most f recent inquiries in many dioceses have shown that there
                        are numbers of village sohools where not merely fonr-fifths but bine-tenths
                        of the parents desire the continuance of the existing religions instruction.
                        There is to be one law, however, for the children of town parente, smother
                        for the children of rural parente.One contingency has apparently been
                        overlooked by the promoter of the Bill- There are plenty of parithre in
                        rnral England qnite wealthy enough to refose to snrrend?r the sshool

                    <head>DEATH OF EMIR MAHMOUD</head>
                    <p>HIS CAPTURE AND CAPTIVITY. The death of the. Emir Mabmond, whose funneral
                        took place yesterday at Damietta, will recall to oar readers the history of
                        the battle of Om Debrikat, better known as the battle of the Atbara, which
                        took place on the 8th April, 1898. Mahmoud, who commanded the Dervish
                        forces, was taken prisoner on this occasion and after being led in triumph
                        through the streets of Berber was sent down to Wady Haifa, where he wa9
                        interned for two and a half years. He was then sent to Damietta, where he
                        remained a State prisoner in an honourable captivity till his death. The
                        deceased Emir, before his defeat and capture, accomplished several notable
                        feats of arms, his last success being the captare of Metemmeb, then held by
                        the Jaalin, who had revolted against the Khalifa after the capture of Abou
                        Hamed by the Egyptian forces. Of the Emir Mahmoud the late G. W. Steevens
                        wrote in his admirable sketch of the campaign “With Kitohener to Khartonm”
                        Now to see what we had done and suffered. And first, for a new fillip to
                        exaltation, Msh- mond was a prisoner. Some soldiers of the 10th Sudanese had
                        found him as they swept through the zariba—found him sitting on his carpet,
                        his weapons at his side, after the manner of defeated war chiefs who await
                        death. He was not killed, and presently he was brought bareheaded before the
                        Sirdar—a tall, dark brown complexioned man of something between thirty and
                        forty. He wore loose drawers and a gibba —the dervish uniform which still
                        mimics the patched shirt of the Mahdi, but embroiders it with gold. His face
                        was of the narrow-cheeked, high-foreheaded type, for he is a pore-bred Arab
                        : his expression was cruel, but high. He looked neither to right nor to
                        left, but strode op to the Sirdar with his head erect “Are yon the man
                        Mabmond ?” asked the Sirdar. , “Yes ; I am Mahmoud, and I am the same as
                        you.” He meant commander-in-chief. ‘ Why did you come to make war here 1” “I
                        came because I was told, - the same as you.” Mahmoud was removed in custody
                        ; but everybody liked him the better for looking at his fate so straight and
                        defiantly. Bat small leisure had anybody to pity Mabmond : the pity was all
                        wanted for our own people. Describing the triumphal entry of the Sirdar into
                        Fort Atbara, with Mahmond a prisoner, Mr. Steevens says ...Farther behind,
                        in a dear space, came one man alone, his hands tied behind his back. Mahmoud
                        ! Mahmoud, holding his head up and swinging his thighs in a swaggering
                        stride—but Mahmoud a prisoner, beaten, powerless. When the people of Berber
                        saw that, they were convinced. It was not a lie, then : the white men had
                        conquered indeed. And many a dark skinned woman pressed forward to call
                        Mahmond ‘ Dog” to his face: it was Mahmond, last year, who massacred the
                        Jaalin at Metemmeb.</p>

                    <head>THE PLAGUE</head>
                    <p>Yesterday there were seven cases of plague and eight deaths in hospital at
                        Deshna and one case at Samalont. 10 cases were under treatment. Nine oases
                        and seven deaths are reported to-day. Sir Horace Pinching reports to the
                        Minister of the Interior:- During the week ending on April 15, 1906, 35
                        oases of plagae occurred in the whole of Egypt, distributed as follows: 2 at
                        Awlad Amron (Keneh Markaz and Province),' 16 at Deshna (.Keneh), 13 at
                        Mankatein (Sa- malont Makaz. Minieh), 3 at Tantah (Ghar- bleb), 1 at
                        Wasta(Beni-8ooef),the victim being a person who had come from Mansonrab.
                        Though the number of cases in the whole of Egypt is not alarming, isolated
                        oases and deaths suspected to be caused by plague are reported in various
                        districts and it is consequently very necessary to limit the movements of
                        individuals from one district to another and their aggregation in large
                        numbers as far. as is humanly possible. For this reason I have suggested to
                        your Excellency that the celebration of the Motiled el Nebi should be
                        limited to one night instead of the usual seven, and that this feast should
                        be localised as far as possible and the admission thereto of strangers in
                        any locality avoided. From January 1 to April 15, 1906, 63 oases of plague
                        were reported, against 40 in the for responding period of last year. </p>

                    <head>THE EGYPTIAN DEBT</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian Debt Office (Administration de la Dette Publique d’Egypte) has
                        just i published its annual report for the year 1905, which is the thirtieth
                        year of its administration. As particular interest attaches to this year’s
                        figures, which show for the first time the result of the new financial
                        arrangement legalised by the Degree of the Khedive, dated 28th November,
                        1934, we give below the main I features of the report, in anticipation of
                        Lord Cromer’s usual yearly statement. It will be remembered that the above
                        Decree, in conformity with the desires of the European Powers, substituted
                        the gross receipts of the land taxes as the guarantee for the interest
                        service of the Debt, the old guarantee consisting of the provincial tributes
                        ! and the railway and telegraph receipts, etc. The substitution is now
                        proved to be thoroughly justified. On the 28th November, 1904, the revenue
                        raised by the old system of taxation amounted to L.E. 4,200,000 per annum,
                        while the service of the Debt, including the expenses of its administration,
                        required a sum of dose upon L E. 3,600,000. There existed also, and of
                        course still exists, a reserve land of L.E. 750,003, to assure the service
                        of the three sections of the Debt—the Guaranteed, the Privileged and the
                        Unified—in the order of priority named, and on the possible absorption of
                        this sum the general resources of the Treasury were to be called into
                        requisition. It now appears from the report that the reserve fond of
                        L.E.750,000 is still intact The revenues of the thirteen provinces of

                        Keneh alone was set apart by the Decree to guarantee the Domain Loan) amount
                        to L.E.3,648,000, to which must be added L.E.87,000 for interest on
                        investments and L.Kl,ot)0 for taxes due but not collected—in all,
                        L.E.3,636,000. On the other side of the account are Interest service;
                        Guaranteed 3 per Cent Debt L.E. 307,000 ; Privileged 3} per Cent. Debt, L.E.
                        1,062,000 ; Unified Debt L.E.2,183,000 ; expenses of administration, L.E.
                        36,000; total, L E. 3,688,000. The credit balance available for the Treasury
                        is consequently L.E. 48,000. It also appears from the report that L.E.
                        129,400 of the Guaranteed Debt was amortised daring 1905 and L.K 42,700
                        during the first two months of the present year ; so that on the 1st ultimo
                        the Guaranteed Debt stood at L.E. 7,805,700. The Privileged at the same date
                        was L.E. 31,127,780, and the Unified Debt LE, 55,971,960, so that at the
                        present moment the total amount of the Egyptian Debt may be stated
                        approximately at L.E. 94,905,000, requiring an interest service of some L.E.
                        3,552,000 annually, which, as seen above, is well covered by the land

                    <p>Mr. Constantine Meimarachi, chairman of Walker and Meimarachi, Limited, has
                        returned to Cairo after having visited Vienna, Berlin, London; Paris, and
                        Brussels for the purpose of inspecting the stores in these capitals in order
                        to form a model for the mammoth establishment which his company intend
                        erecting on the new site they have purchased in the Ismailia quarter of
                        Cairo. Of all the stores in the capitals of Europe which he visited he was
                        chiefly impressed with the establishment of Harrod’s in London, which he
                        deoclares has no equal elsewhere, and he intends to establish Walker and
                        Meimarachi’s new stores at. Cairo on the model of Harrod’s. The services of
                        Messrs. Frederick Sage and Company, the well-known shop-fitters of London,
                        have been engaged for the new building.</p>

                    <head>A NOVELTY FOR CAIRO</head>
                    <head>LATEST TELEPHONE DEVELOPEMENT</head>
                    <p>Egypt is advancing so rapidly and day by day is being endowed with the latest
                        products of European invention, that we are not surprised to learn that
                        Cairo is soon to see the installation of one of the latest and most
                        wonderful inventions known in Europe. For some years past Buda-Pesth has had
                        a curious development of the telephone known as the “Speaking Gazette.” This
                        is a development of the theatrophone and the tape news machine, which have
                        been in vogue for some years in London and Paris and other European
                        Capitals. Most of the houses of the well-to-do inhabitants of Buda-Pesth are
                        fitted with a telephone instrument, which tells its hearers all the news of
                        the world all the day through, beginning in the morning and ending late at
                        night with the last strains of the operas that are being given. A well-known
                        Hungarian has been in Cairo for some months organising the installation of a
                        similar system of vocal newspapers in the capital of Egypt The patents have
                        already been registered at the Mixed Tribunals and a petition for the grant
                        of a concession has open made to the Egyptian Government. This system of a
                        simultaneous telephone for news will be worked in the following manner. A
                        central office in Cairo will distribute the news by means of a special
                        microphonic apparatus installed at the house of every subscriber. The
                        machine will give vent to the local news of Egypt and the chief events that
                        are taking place throughout the whole world. The latest Stock Exchange
                        quotations, market reports, and all the most interesting intelligence of
                        every sort and kind will be offered by this machine at regular intervals. At
                        certain times of the day the machine will note the exact astronomic time and
                        from hour to hour personal and social news items, reports of the latest
                        fashions, the fullest details of the latest crimes, religious news, Court
                        intelligence, hotel information, shipping items, arrivals of mails, and, in
                        a word, every possible item of information that can interest anybody Will be
                        repeated by this machine in the many and various languages spoken in Egypt.
                        This will obviously be a very surprising addition to the amenities of life
                        in Cairo. Besides acting as a transmitter of news, the machine will be an
                        educational force, for it will report scientific and literary lectures, will
                        tell stories for the children, and will impart instruction in foreign
                        languages. The central station at Cairo will, it is hoped, be in direct
                        communication with the Khedivial Opera House and the theatres, so that
                        subscribers may hear everything at their own homes, and whenever a concert
                        or other entertainment is given a full vocal reproduction will ensue. Every
                        subscriber will receive each month a programme of the time when the various
                        classes of news are to be transmitted so that they need not be worried to
                        have to listen to matters for which they have no taste. The utility of such
                        an invention is indisputable and few families at Bada-Pesth but subscribe to
                        the “Speaking Gazette.” The invention is also of extreme utility for blind
                        and illiterate people and affords a pleasant alleviation to the invalid. It
                        is expected that before the end of the year Cairo will be fitted with a
                        complete installation of “Speaking Gazette” machines.</p>

                    <p>The Legislative Council met yesterday to consider the Government project with
                        regard to the monopoly of wireless telegraphy in Egypt, but no decision was
                        arrived at and the sitting was postponed till the 25th in«t. The council,
                        however, decided to request an official of the Ministry of Public Works to

                    <p>The ulema of Alexandria, who went out on strike lately, have made the three
                        following demands: to be exempt from the duty of taking care of the talaba
                        (scholars) after lessons, to be granted the certificate of ulemaship, and to
                        have a council of administration analogous to that of Al-Azhar. The first
                        condition was granted, but the consideration of the second and third was
                        postponed! The ulema have resumed work in compliance with the commands of H.
                        H. the Khedive. In compliance with the -request of the Alexandria Ulema
                        board, the board of Al-Azhar University has appointed Sheikh Yonssef

                        Mohamed el- Dunyari, nlema of Al-Azhar, as teachers to the Ulema board of

                    <head>THE COURSES IN THE TRAINING COLLEGE</head>
                    <p>The Training College at Khartoum has two sides, an Education side and a Law
                        side. On the former students are trained to act as teachers of all subjects
                        except English in the higher elementary schools of the department; The
                        object of the Law side is to secure qualified officials to fill posts in the
                        Mohamedan Courts. It is hoped that the teachers will eventually become
                        headmasters or inspectors, and the Law students eventually Cadis. All
                        instruction is in Arabia Ultimately all will be expected before entrance to
                        have passed through one of the elementary vernacular schools, and also to
                        have spent Borne years listening to the lectures given in mosques and
                        khalwes by men of re- organized learning and authority. Hitherto it has been
                        easier to find candidates who have fulfilled the second of these conditions,
                        but every year marks progress : in 1905 six of the new entrances—about 25
                        %—came from the elementary schools at Berber, Rafaa, and Suakin, as compared
                        with two only from Rafaa in 1904. For three years after entrance all the
                        students work together irrespective of their final destination, the subjects
                        taught being religion and law, Arabic language and literature, history and
                        geography, arithmetic, geometry, algebra, and drawing. ' Students who have
                        completed their third year to the satisfaction of the examiners are then
                        distributed between the two sides, but even after this all continue to work
                        together at the above-mentioned subjects for 21 hours out of the 83. The
                        remainder of the week is devoted partly to these general subjects with which
                        deeper acquaintance is desirable in the future professions of the students.
                        The Law students, besides studying the methods of procedure in Mohamedan
                        Courts, receive farther instruction in the principles of administration and
                        law as obtained in both the civil and religions courts of the country. The
                        education side meanwhile studies the theory and practice of teaching (the
                        theory being at present reduced to a minimum, and the practice consisting
                        chiefly of model and criticism lessons) and, in addition, those secular
                        subjects which will be useful to them hereafter. The College has now been in
                        existence for over four years and numbers 102; who are distributed among tne
                        different classses thus : first year 30, second year 27, third year 21.

                    <head>K. OF K. AND THE EGYPTIAN ARMY</head>
                    <p>A long communication on “Lord Kitchener and the Indian Army” from the “Times”
                        special correspondent in India appears in the unusual form of a letter to
                        the editor, and embodies a grave indictment of the methods of the Indian
                        Commander-in-Chief. He concludes his criticism of Lord Kitchener with the
                        following reference to events in Egypt:— The great success achieved largely
                        by Lord Kitchener’s unquestionedability in the reconquest of the Sudan was
                        very nearly wrecked not long afterwards in a disaster due to the same
                        defects of which many people dread the consequences in India. Only a short
                        time before Lord Kitchener was ordered to South Africa, an incipient mutiny
                        amongst the native troops in the Sudan, which arose out of his disregard in
                        peace time for pecnliar idiosyncrasies that he had actively ignored so long
                        as the excitement of active service lasted, was only detected and suppressed
                        at the eleventh hour. The suppression of Lord Cromer’s "opinion" on Lord
                        Kitchener’s scheme is easily explained when one remembers that he alone
                        combined with an intimate knowledge of the Indian aspects of the question a
                        still more intimate knowledge of the defects of Lord Kitchener’s qualities.”
                        “I am fully conscious,” adds the writer, "of my responsibility in making
                        these grave statements.”</p>

                        various monetary centres concerned ; hence gold withdrawals are unlikely.

                    <head>EFFORTS AT EXTERMINATION</head>
                    <p>(From our Correspondent.) Port Said, April J3 The Mosquito Conference held
                        here, as far as the numbers of the audience and their appreciation of the
                        lecturer, Dr. Piessant, went, was an unqualified success. The clever
                        doctor's treatment of his subject was punctuated from time to time by
                        applause, and the vote of thanks was most enthusiastically given. Should our
                        energetic and capable sanitary inspector, who has already made great strides
                        in cleaning up the town, also succeed in clearing out the mosquito, he will
                        win the thanks of all residents and passengers. As the sum required is not
                        one beyond the resources of the town, there should not be much difficulty in
                        obtaining it. The many people, who have already tried the methods advocated
                        for dealing with these insects, speak highly of the results. Now that the
                        conscience of the town has been aroused to the necessity of dealing with the
                        subject, and it has been pointed out that co incident with the disappearance
                        of the mosquito there is reason to believe that the weekly visitation of the
                        sanitary officials will assist in correcting other evils, probably the
                        dangers of plague and other nuisances will be removed. Should Port Said
                        succeed even half as well as lsmailia a great nuisance will have been
                        mitigated. When the wholesale destruction of mosquitoes commences great
                        interest will be taken in the result It behaves all and sundry to give their
                        assistance, financial or otherwise, in such a work. Thus the progress of the
                        town will be one not only of stones and mortar, but also of progressive
                        sanitation, leading up, possibly, eventually to the entire removal of the
                        sites where the mosquitoes breed, the natural corollary being the
                        introduction of a cheaper and more modern method of sewage disposal. Russian
                        Transports. Russian transports come through the Canal almost every day now.
                        Most of these ships pass in voluntary quarantine as it is difficult
                        otherwise to keep the men from obtaining vodka. The men are fine, strapping
                        fellows, and as far as physique goes, are in striking contrast to the less
                        bulky Japs. The Persia. Considerable disappointment was caused to people
                        desirous of leaving or visiting the Persia by some suspicions oases of
                        illness having caused the authorities to make the ship pass through in
                        quarantine. We were pleased to bear that there were no further oases in the
                        least suspicious—that as a matter of fact there were no patients at all in
                        hospital after leaving Suez. Entente Cordiale. The new French Consul, ML/
                        Meyrier, has taken up his duties at Port Said. It has been suggested that
                        some attempt should be made to bring the Preach and English people more
                        together. After the Mosquito Conference it was mooted that to raise funds a
                        Universelle Entente Cordials be held at which children of different nations
                        might form a procession and join in sports and games whilst their elders
                        enjoyed some music. The Late Governor. As evidencing the interest taken in
                        the town by the late Governor, it is noteworthy that he presided at the two
                        public meetings in the El Dorado the day previous to his departure. He has
                        always lent a strong support to the formation of the International Sporting
                        Club, the ground of which is now completed. Under his chairmanship a
                        committee was appointed from the founders and ordinary members. This
                        committee was representative of all nationalities. -(Die subscription for

                        28 members shot. The principal scores are given below. ’ On Monday morning
                        the club shot off a match against the 1st Royal Dublin Fusiliers, the latter
                        being this time the winners, with the respectable total ot675, the more
                        commendable because both wind and light were somewhat changeable. The wind

                        Alexandrie C’est un fait aujourd’hui constant qne les conditions matérielles
                        du Port d’Alexandrie sont et deviennent de jour en jour plus insuffisantes
                        pour répondre aux besoins de commerce da pays. \ A cet effet les
                        préoccupations du Gouvernement se sont traduites par une série de projets
                        tout au long énumérés dans la lettre que Lord Cromer écrivait eu date du 13
                        Décembre 1904 au Président de la Chambre Internationale de Navigation. Parmi
                        ces projets se trouve la construction de nouveaux quais dans le Port
                        extérieur sur la côte du Gabbary. Tout le monde connaît également
                        l’impulsion considérable qu’une série d’entreprises privées a donné ces

                        vacation, wore out my nervous system. I lost my appetite and felt weak and
                        exhausted nearly all the time. “Peruna restored me to perfect health In five
                        week*. It la the finest tonic for a weary woman that / know of. / gladly

                    <p>Mias Estelle Campbell, HO N. High street, Nashville, Tenn., writes: "Peruna
                        helped me whenalmoot everything else tailed. I was rundown from overwork, as
                        I had not been able to take a vacation for three years and naturally my
                        nerves were all unstrung and I was greatly In need of rest and n tonic. “I
                        went away for two months, but did not seem to get my strength back, although
                        I was taking a prescription which the doctor gave me before I went away. “At
                        the request of my relatives, with whom I was visiting, I began to use
                        Peruna, and you cannot realize how glad I was when within a week I found I
                        was feeling so much better. Inside of a month I was feeling splendidly,
                        ready and able to take up my work again."—Estelle Campbell. </p>

                        suffered with malaria and a run down condition which seemed very difficult
                        to overcome. “I tried several different tonics but did hot seem to get mnch
                        better until I began using Peruna. My recovery was slow, but 1 was improving
                        and 1 was glad to continue using it. “At the end of two months my health was
                        restored and I looked and felt mnch better than I had for years. Your remedy

                        in so many homes Is that it contains no narcotic of any kind. Pernna is
                        perfectly harmless. It can be used any length of time without acquiring a
                        drug habit. Pernna does not produce temporary results. It is permanent In
                        Its effect. It has no bad effect upon the system., and gradually eliminates
                        catarrh by removing the canse of catarrh. There are a multitude of homes
                        where Pernna has been used off and on for twenty yean. Such a thing could
                        not be possible If Pernna contained any drags of a narcotic nature. All

                    <head>EASTER SERVICES</head>
                    <p>ALL SAINTS’ CHURCH, CAIRO. The Easter services at All Saints’ Church, Cairo,
                        were numerously attended. The Holy Communion was celebrated four times, at
                        6.30 а. m., 7.30 a.m., 8.30 a.m., and after morning service. The number of
                        communicants at the four celebrations was 286. The services were conducted
                        by Very Rev Dean Butcher D. D., Rev. Professor Sayce, Rev. H.U. Weitbrecht,
                        Pb. D, Rev. Thompson Burns, M. A., and Rev. G. II. Rankinge. The Dean took
                        his text from Luke 16.31. “If they hear not Moses and the Prophets neither
                        will they be persuaded though one rose from the dead.” The musical part of
                        the service was directed by Mr. Serle Peacock and a very efficient choir.
                        The hymns were 131, 134, and 499 in the morning, and at evensong 135, 125
                        and 140. The church was decorated with palms, iris, arums, white and red
                        lilies and white roses. ST. MARK’S CHURCH, ALEXANDRIA. The attendance at all
                        the services on Easter Day at the above church must be a source of
                        gratification to the Chaplain. At the 7.30 service the chapel was too small
                        to hold all the communicants and the attendance at the 8 o'clock and midday
                        services far exceeded that of last year, amounting to 141. At the 11 o’olock
                        service every seat was taken including the extra chairs placed in the aisle.
                        The choir acquitted themselves with great credit, the rendering of the
                        psalms both morning and evening being bright and were given with excellent
                        precision. “Break forth into joy” (J. Barnby) TeDeum and Jubilate (Tours in
                        F) were well sung and showed great care. The offertory sentences, "Let your
                        light so shine” and “Lay not up for yourselves,” by Vine Hall, were given,
                        and we hope the choir will repeat them at no distant date. At the choral
                        celebration Baptise Calkins’ Communion service in B flat was sung, and at
                        the dose of the morning and evening services the choir and congregation sang
                        “God save the King." The collections for the Poor Fund at St. Mark’s at 7.30
                        a.m. and 8 a.m. amounted to P.T. 622. The collections at 11 a.m. and at б.
                        15 p.m., which were presented as an Easter offering to the assistant
                        chaplains, amounted to P.T. 4105 2/10. Last year the Easter Offering was
                        P.T. 1727 5/10. The church was beautifully decorated, the font, pulpit,
                        lectern, choir stalls, and the altar vases meriting special mention. Those
                        responsible for the decorations were Mmes. Eyre, Roberts, Steinschneider,
                        Ward, Misses Dodd, Barwell, Batcheller, Morrison, and Talbot. Among those

                        Berthelot has announced to the members of the Academy of Science of Paris
                        that a notice had been received from Professor Lortet in which he gave a
                        description of the heart of Raineses II. This was discovered during the
                        recent excavations of the hypogeums of the Egyptian kings of the early
                        dynasties. Its well-preserved state enabled Professor Lortet to make a
                        detailed study. Professor Bouchard remarked that this preservation was
                        nothing extraordinary as bodies had been discovered beneath sand at. a depth
                        of 240 ft., belonging to a period of civilisation considerably anterior to
                        that of Ramoses II., and in these remains it had been possible to study the
                        fibres of the eye and the muscular tissues. HOW MARRIAGES HAPPEN.

                    <p>MEETING IN ALEXANDRIA. On Saturday evening last an important session of Blue
                        Cap Pride Lodge, M. 107, was held in the Sailors and Soldiers’ Institute,
                        Alexandria. There was a good attendance of members. The session was an open
                        one and was availed of by many friends of temperance, who contributed to the
                        evening’s programme. Bro. R. Ireland, C. T., presided. The Chief Templar
                        spoke at some length on the temperance question, and urged on members the
                        desirability of remaining faithful to their obligation and true to their
                        noble order. The Lodge Deputy also spoke at some length during the course of
                        which he said he was proud to say their membership was increasing, and be
                        had every confidence it would farther increase. What was required were
                        members of the proper stamp who would show by their conduct that they are a
                        credit to themselves and the order to which they belong. He continued:—“It
                        has been suggested to open a sleeping lodge for the benefit of the
                        Alexandria garrison, viz. 'The White Nile.’ The suggestion has' my approval.
                        A station lodge established at this home would be an inestimable boon to
                        maty. A lodge properly officered with an educational programme having on its
                        agenda essayd, debates, readings, recitations, &amp; would go a long way to
                        bring thinking men to their proper sphere. We intend to accomplish this
                        daring the next month.” An interesting address was delivered by an Egyptian
                        friend, and Bro. Miles also said a few words on temperance reform. An

                        the Negns, according to which the railway company was to collect a special
                        tax of 10 per cent, ad valorem on the merchandise traffic between Abyssinia
                        and the Red Sea. If this treaty had been conscientiously repeated, not only
                        would a dividend on the capital sunk in the venture have been possible, but
                        the means would have been available for the building of the second section
                        of the line to Addis Abeba. At the same time, the unexplained attitude of
                        Colonel Sir John Harrington is widely commented upon in Franco-English
                        financial circle. The French Government is again being urged to take
                        immediate steps in the matter, as a freshly constituted banking syndicate—to
                        which the new Bank of Abyssinia is said to be no stranger— is reported to be
                        working against the present holders of the concession.</p>

                    <head>A COMPANION OF LIVINGSTONE</head>
                    <p>The death occurred last week of Mr. John Reid, the second last white man who
                        travelled with Dr. Livingstone in his African exploring journeys. Mr. Reid,
                        who was 74 years of age, was with Livingstone during part of his second
                        journey, going out as a carpenter on the same boat as Mrs. Livingstone and
                        Mr. James Stewart in order to fit together a Lake Nyassa steamer which was
                        taken out in parts. He was away three years, and came home with the
                        explorer. He went out again with the Livingstone search expedition, under
                        Young and Faulkner, and on his return, finding that there was a strike at
                        home, which rendered it difficult for him to obtain work, he accepted an
                        engagement which took him to Peru for three years. He had many exceedingly
                        interesting reminiscences of the famous traveller, of Mrs. Livingstone, of
                        Dr. Stewart, of Love- dale, and of Sir John Kirk—the latter now the only
                        white survivor of Livingstone’s travels. Mr. Reid had a good knowledge of
                        (he management of vessels, and was on this account of great value to the
                        explorer. He shared many of his hardships, and was sometimes ab long as nine
                        months without seeing another white face. Of Dr. Livingstone he had the
                        sincerest admiration, and when the news of his death came to England he said
                        emphatically that “the natives of Africa never did it.”</p>

                    <head>RESULT OF COURT-MARTIAL</head>
                    <p>The grounding of the orniser Donegal, after passing through the Suez Canal on
                        her way to China, on March 1, was the subject of an inquiry by a court
                        martial on the battleship Empress of India at Devonport last week. Captain
                        William J. Grogan, Navigating- Lieutenant L. T. Jones, Lieutenant C. R
                        Hemans, and Sub-Lieutenant H. W. Best of the Donegal pleaded not guilty to
                        negligently or by default stranding or hazarding their ship. Captain Grogan
                        in a letter to the Admiralty stated that he saw the correct course, “S.
                        35'K,” marked off on the chart, and then inspected the physical drill.
                        Lieutenant Jones brought down the card to him with the coarse marked "S. 25
                        E.” He signed the card, not noticing the electrical error. Sub-Lieutenant
                        Best steadied the ship on the course “S. 25 B.,” and reported having done so
                        to Lieutenant Jones, bat he did not report that this bearing would place the
                        vessel at 5.21 p.m. 1.17 miles from Rhas el Gbarib. Lieutenant Hemans
                        relieved at 6 p.m., and sent the card to Lieutenant Jones. The latter had
                        just noted that the ship was too near to the land and was altering the
                        course when she struck. Captain Grogan stated that from Wednesday he would
                        be superseded in command of the Donegal by order of the Admiralty, and
                        public notice of this punishment had been given prior to his trial by
                        court-martial. He accepted fall responsibility as captain for the whole
                        occurrence. The court sentenced Captain Grogan to be severely reprimanded,
                        Lieutenant Jones to lose a year’s seniority and to be dismissed his ship,
                        Lieutenant Hemans to be reprimanded, and Sub-Lieutenant Best to be severely
                        reprimanded. NORTH GERMAN LLOYD. The North German Lloyd last year landed
                        more passengers at New York than any other company. The total was 177,871,
                        as against 139,972 for the, Hamburg-American Line, 98,419 for the Canard,
                        and 91,435 for the White Star. It is also noticeable that the ' cabin
                        passengers conveyed by the N. D. L. | amounted to 42,817, or almost doable
                        that of I the Hamburg-American Line, which took 23,109 while the Canard took
                        21,032 and the White Star 27,946. N COTTON TRADE IN MARCH. The Board cf
                        Trade returns of the exports of cotton yarn and manufactures and the imports
                        and exports of raw material for March are to hand. From these we gather that
                        daring that month Egypt imported cotton yarn to the extent of 240,100 lbs.,
                        as compared with 814,800 lbs. in the same month last year, and 252,700 lbs.
                        in 1904. Germany and Holland were the largest importers with 3,532,300 and
                        3,412,100 lbs. respectively, Italy taking the smallest quantity, viz. 1,600
                        lbs. With regard to imports of cotton manufactures, Egypt last month
                        received 19,131,100 yards, as against 24,248,800 yards in March, 1905, and
                        15,806,400 yards in 1904. Thus it will be seen that March, 1905, was an
                        abnormal month in the matter of the imports of both these articles. Last
                        month, however, the exports of cotton from Egypt exceeded both those of both
                        previous years, the figures being 445,327 owts., as compared with 403,497
                        owts. in 1905, and 273,624 owts. in 1904. OPERATIONS IN EGYPTIAN MINES. Mr.

                    <p>At one time favourite speculative counters in all the European Stock Markets,
                        Egyptian Unified bonds have, says a writer in the “Financier,” long passed
                        into the strictly investment and humdrum category. “From a cosmopolitan Tom
                        Tiddler's ground the Land of the Pharaohs has, likewise, under the fostering
                        care of the British roarer, become a veritable safe-deposit, the financial
                        position revesding unparalleled prosperity. The Budget shows that in the
                        conne of last year no less than £4,791,460 of the Public Debt was redeemed,
                        leaving a total of £96,483,880 outstanding at December 81«t. The 8nrplns
                        amounted, after liberal appropriations for reproductive works, to

                        lines I would recommend a purchase in anticipation of the May coupon.”' The
                        same writer, in referring to the large basinets done in the Shares of
                        Egyptian Options daring the past few days, mentions that the company
                        possesses mineral concessions covering as area of 12/ 00 square miles, upon
                        which its prospectois are at work under the direction of Mr Merton, of
                        Merton's Reward fame. According to market rumonr, some important discoveries
                        have been made, and, as the issued capital is only £20,000, any definite
                        news of gold discoveries should lead to a big rise in the price of the
                        shares. Indeed, £10 is talked of as a possible figure by some sanguine
                        people. The company is also interested in robber propositions, particularly
                        the Abyssinian concession recently granted by King Menelik. The shares
                        certainly look worth picking up round about present prices. THE STEAM ENGINE
                        IN ANCIENT EGYPT. Mr. G. Gerald Stoney, in a recent lecture at Carpenters’
                        Hall, London, on “Steam Turbines,” said it was among the relics of ancient
                        Egyptian civilisation, 20 centuries ago, that the first records of the steam
                        engine were found. In Alexandria, the home of Buclid, Hero wrote his
                        “Spiritnalia sen Pneumatics,” wherein he described two machines of special
                        interest. The one utilised the expansive force of air in a closed vessel
                        heated externally, the pnenmatic force being applied upon the surface of
                        water in other vessels, and the hydranlic force utilised for opening the
                        doors of Grecian temples, and working other pseudo-magic contrivances. The
                        other was a veritable steam turbine engine, snoh, in principle, as they were
                        disonssing that night. It seemed doubtfnl whether this machine was ever more
                        than a toy, or whether it was used by the Greek priests for producing motion
                        of apparatus in their temples. Bat from the experience of the last 20 years,
                        it appeared that with some improvement in design and constraction it could
                        have been applied to perform useful work, and might have claimed a place
                        among steam engines even up to the middle of the last century.</p>
