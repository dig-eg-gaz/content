                            severed from his body. Both men were of bad character and the quarrel is

                        <p>A comparative aioe of the Sudan Govern- ment Reports brings out many
                            interestings facts, says the "Sudan Times," and indicates the rapid
                            strides of progress, at which the country has beén advancing. In 1900,
                            when Sir R.F. Wingate assumed the administration of the Government of
                            the Sudan, the refe- 'nue of the country did not exceed LE. 150,000. In
                            the budget for 1908, the revenue is estimated at L.E. 1,000,000. In'
                            other words, in the' period of seven years the revenue has increased
                            sevenfold which is a very remarkable development.</p>
                        <p>In 1905, the revenue from the land tax, inclusive otusbur, was about LE.
                            30,000. In the budget for 1908, this source: of revenue is estimated at
                            about LE. 100,000.</p>
                        <p>These figures need no comment. They testify to theable financial
                            management of the coun- try, and to the wholesome general admitiistra-
                            tration, which. has rendered such sncoéss possible.</p>
                        <p>Among other interesting facts in the Sudan Budget, we.notice that the
                            revenue of the Sudan Government Railways for 1908 is esti- mated' at L.
                            E 300,000. It is anticipated that the revenue for the present year,
                            1907, will reach the figure of L. E. 300,0°:0 against an es- timate of
                            L.E. 250,00). The revenue for 1905, prior to. the construction of the
                            Nile Red-Sea | Railway, was only L.E, 171,000. These figures are aii
                            eloquent testimony to the remarkable development of trade and to the
                            benefits result- } ing from the construction of this line, which |
                            connects the interior of the country with its natoral outlet.</p>
                        <p>We have no definite idea of the capital ex- pended on the constraction of
                            the Sudan Rail-. ays, bat we have no doubt, judging by the re- !

                            Winter Palace has seen a huge success. Over 100 people 'had assembled
                            .in the hotel by Christmas Eve, when a small dance was giver as a sort
                            of foretaste of things to come the next day. These numbers were largely

                            <p>Dear Sir,~-Since giving my lecture at the last meeting of the
                                Khedivial Geographical society Ihave gone more thoroughly into the
                                question of the levels of the White Nile and have found that the
                                White Nile is of more' value to Egypt than the Rand gold deposits
                                are to the Transvaal. If we take the highest flood level at
                                'Khartoum at 0 metres, we have :—at Renk, 500 kilo- metres above
                                Khartoum, still 0 metres, at the Saubat mouth 840 kilometres above
                                Khartoufh still 3.50.metres, at Lake No—mouth, 970 kilo- metres
                                above Khartoum, still 4.75 metres. In other words we have tor half
                                the distance a level lake and for the other half a slope of
                                1/100,000, or for the whole distance. a slope of 1/200,000.</p>
                            <p>These fighres are of extraordinary interest to Egypt. 'They mean that
                                reservoir barrages could be built at Khartoum, at any place between
                                Khartoum and the Saubat-month like the Abu Zeid bar, and at the
                                Saubat month. Such barrages, would form reservoirs capable of
                                storing over 7-milliards: of .cubic metres of water and settling for
                                ever the summer supply question for Egypt and the Sudan. These
                                barrages morever could be built ih three years at a cost under
                                £3,000,000.</p>
                            <p>The Government to-day has it in its power to put an end to the
                                depression which is weighing on Egypt, and to put life into every
                                land enterprise in: Egypt and. the Sudan. | began my 1894 Teport
                                with the words. "Of all the methods which Egypt has ever employed
                                for the increase of her material:wealth, there is only one which has
                                never « failed her. Whenever the country has turned-to the Nile it
                                has not been disappointed." 1 repeat them to-day.</p>
                            <p>It will be possible to so control the waters of the White Nile
                                thatthe summer supplies, of the Nile will be greater than the winter
                                supplies and the Nile willbecome likethe Tigris and the Euphrates,
                                those typical rivers of peren- nial irrigation whose summer supplies
                                are in excess of their winter supplies, and' where perennial
                                irrigation had its birth and flourished for thonsands of years and
                                will again.</p>

                            <p>Sir,</p>
                            <p>Not a few of your readers were 'struck with amazement at the
                                favorable comments in your coluamna upon the approaching release of
                                the Denishwai convicts. Though conspicuously fair to those who
                                differ from you, the policy of the "Egyptian Gazette" has been
                                hitherto uniform- ly Imperialist. To-endorse the decision ofa
                                Liberal Government, which in this instance was actuated solely by
                                interested motives, reads uncomménly like a dereliction of
                                principle.</p>
                            <p>Political mémories are proverbially short ; but» most: of us, here in
                                Egypt at all events, have preserved a recollection that the prosecu-
                                tion of the Denishwai villagers arose out of an attack upon British
                                officers in which some were badly injured, and one: of them ost his
                                life. Sir Edward @réy assured the ~House of Com- mons that
                                the..tribunal before which the. trial took place was composed ofthe
                                ablest judges in thé land, and Lord Cromer expressed his opinion
                                that~the~ sentences "were just and necessary." For what reason,
                                then, are the convicts to be liberated ? The Liberal Govern- ment,
                                puta it on the-ground of clemency. But clemencyis a luxury which
                                from past experience has cost our country dear. It was an act of
                                clemency indulged in by Mr. Gladstone after the reverse of our arms
                                at Majuba Hill which necessitated the second Boer War with all its
                                attendant suffering, privation and carnage and the expenditure by
                                the British Exchequer of two hundred aud fifty million pounds.</p>
                            <p>Absit omen!</p>
                            <p>Do not let: us deceive ourselves with any such clap-trap sentiment.
                                No one who has intelligently followed current events is likely to be
                                misled by it. For all the tall taik there is no clemency in this
                                case—not the semblance of it The convicts owe their freeduin_ to one
                                fact and to one fact alone - fear. Fear, yot of anything that might
                                happen in Exypt—there is happily no cause for anxiety at the present
                                time —but fear of an adverse vote which might hurl the Government
                                from power. His Majesty's present advisers, with. the. largest
                                majority ever obtained in our-time, cannot rely upon their own
                                supporters. It is not considerations of mercy which weigh with them.
                                The dictates of humanity have played no part in their deliberations,
                                The truth is that they.have not the courage of their professed
                                convictions. Their wire-pullers have told them that the continued
                                'incarceration of the Denishwai convicts renders their position
                                perilously insecure. That. is enough for them. At the bidding of
                                party exigencies they fling consist- ency to the winds. Theirs is an
                                ignominious capitulation: to 'expediency. That is the long and the

                                pretend -to think that the crime for which the prisoners were
                                sentenc- ed was anything but participation in a murder ofa
                                peculiarly brutal kind. Wedo not forget that the assailants of the
                                British officers dragged them out ofthe carriages in which they had
                                taken refuge, beat them when they lay on the ground and, further,
                                robbed their bodies. None of these acts are consistent with the
                                theory that the officers. were killed or in- jured in the course of
                                the natural and legiti- mate effort of the peasants to prevent their
                                pigeons being shot by trespassers on the vil- lage lands. The
                                officers were no doubt in the wrong, though they were not aware'of
                                the fact, in interfering with the property of the natives, We
                                cannot, however, hold that so mild a violation of the rights of

                                exactly the same if in sithilar circumstances an Englisman beat a

                            <p>Sir,~—A few days since you. published a letter from a
                                correspondent,Mr Gooding, under the above heading, asking to be
                                informed if such: an article as that which he quotes, is imposed as.
                                a usual 'and customary condition under which shareholders are
                                invited to sus- cribe capital for joint stock' companies. I am
                                surprised that Mr. Gooding should ask this question,-or that it
                                should be thought neces- sary to refer to London for @ reply. If Mr.
                                Gooding will only 'read the Companies Act, 1862, section 67. he will
                                find the following words, which are a complete ariswer to his
                                question : —</p>
                            <p>''All acts done by such directors &amp; c. shall be deemed to be
                                valid, notwithstandingavy defect that may afterwards be discovered
                                in their appointments or qualifications."</p>
                            <p>This is the law on the question'raised by Mr. Gooding, whether it
                                forms part of the Articles of Association of any Limited Liability
                                Com- pany or not, and the article of which Mr. Gooding complains so
                                much, is only a rough translation of'the law, and means*neither more
                                or less, and if did, it would be valid.</p>
                            <p>In common with most. other people knowing
                                anything~about—English—company law, I was much astonished during
                                last autumn, to see that the shareholders of a local English com-
                                pany were convened at a general meeting and asked to confirm the
                                previous acts of their directors, because it was discovered that
                                they might not have been duly qualified, and that, without any
                                suspicion whatever that their acts were not perfectly
                                "bona-fide."'</p>
                            <p>It is only necessary to refer to the law as above quoted, to see that
                                such a proceeding was perfectly unnecessary and uncalled for.</p>
                            <p>Soch questions nearly always turn on. the due deposit of a share

                                but if, as is.'usually -the case, it is.required, and rightly so, by
                                the Articles of Association of any Company, it must be respected.

                                penalty was attached to their observance, but now we have the Act of
                                the 28th Angnst 1907 which improves and very clearly defines, a
                                large number of penalties, hitherto unheard of. It is true that its
                                penal clausesde not. come into force until the Ist of July 1908, so
                                that we are still given some time to put our house in order, and

                    <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                        January may be a little warmer than the Riviera and possibly not so warm as
                        Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm
                        than many other places in Europe. </p>
                    <p>Many people leave Egypt far too early in the year, for as a rule the weather
                        in April and May is perfect. The warmest place to go to on leaving Egypt is
                        Sicily.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                        sea, and we therefore subjoin a list shewing the time occupied on each of
                        the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>
                    <p>They are as follows:-</p>
                    <cb n="3"/>
                    <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southhampton,
                        London or Liverpool—occupy about 14 days. The short ones are as
                        follows:—</p>

                    <p>The steamers of the P.&amp;O., the Egyptian Mail S.S,. Co., North German
                        Lloyd, Orient, and Messageries Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor,
                        British India, Bibby and Henderson Lines are also excellent, and their
                        steamers are largely patronised by travellers to Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 hours). That to Port Said can now be made without change
                        in 4 ½ hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p>The quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp;O. Brindisi express
                        from Port Said, by the Egyptian Mail S.S. Co., from Alexandria to Marseilles
                        and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna express from Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe. The Egyptian Mail S.S. Co., have
                        also made arrangements whereby luggage can be collected and sent to any
                        address.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail<cb n="6"/> Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis" to Brindisi. One of these
                        leaves Port Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian
                        mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                    <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                        attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats" having
                        been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi.
                        If you are going straight through to England you will find the train waiting
                        at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete
                        arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in
                        London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <head>SICILY.</head>
                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMENA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. <hi rend="italic"
                            >Giardini</hi> is the station at which to alight, and the drive up to
                        Taormina is most delightful, occupying about one hour. In and around the
                        town is much to interest the visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but
                        restored under the Romans. CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of
                        Etna, and here also is a fine Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic
                        remains that are found all over the island, are an endless sources of
                        pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting history, having been a Greek city,
                        which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C. 413, and taken by the Romans in
                        B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb is to be seen. The cathedral
                        was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with about 300,000 inhabitants,
                        is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a delightful climate. Much of
                        interest is to be found in this fine city. <hi rend="italic">The Palazzo
                            Reale</hi> is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of <hi
                            rend="italic">S. Giovannia degli Eremiti</hi> with its picturesque
                        cloisters. The Cathedral, Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal
                        Park are also worth a visit.</p>

                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                            bay—<hi rend="italic">Castellamare</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                            >Sorrento</hi>. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento [you can
                        drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                            <hi rend="italic">City of Flowers</hi> and its surrounding country. In
                        Florence itself the churches and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst
                        the local promenades and excursions should not be omitted. <hi rend="italic"
                            >The Cascine</hi> is the most attractive and fashionable promenade in
                        Florence, whilst the <hi rend="italic">Viale dei Colli</hi>, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to <hi rend="italic">Vallombrosa</hi>, with its <hi
                            rend="italic">Monastery</hi> 3,300 feet above the sea level. This is
                        made first by ordinary train from Florence to <hi rend="italic">St.
                            Ellero</hi>, thence by cog-wheel railway to <hi rend="italic"
                            >Saltino</hi>. The ascent through groves of oaks takes an hour, and most
                        striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; here there is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                        and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                        house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                        and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                    <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                        the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and deliciously cool
                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>

                    <head>NORTHERN ITALY (Continued) and The ITALIAN LAKES.</head>
                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea port.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea. No hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from <hi rend="italic">Milan</hi> you make the tour of the
                        beautiful Italian lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza.</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come <hi rend="italic"
                            >Tremezzo</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Cadenabbia</hi>, and <hi rend="italic"
                            >Menaggio</hi> with the prettily-situated town of <hi rend="italic"
                            >Bellaggio</hi> opposite. The walk from <hi rend="italic">Tremezzo</hi>
                        along the shore of the lake to <hi rend="italic">Menaggio</hi> is most
                        enjoyable. A steam tram runs from <hi rend="italic">Menaggio</hi> to <hi
                            rend="italic">Porlezza</hi> on Lake Lugano in three-quarters of an hour,
                        then steamer to Lugano in two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                    <p>LUGANO is some 20 miles from Como and reached by train in one-and-a-half
                        hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated on
                        the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San
                        Salvatore, M. de Caprino.and M. Generoso.</p>
                    <p>LOCARNO may be reached by rail from Bellinzona in forty minutes. This pretty
                        town, situated at the top of Lake Maggiore, has a mild climate and is an
                        excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated above the
                        town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings, "Entombment,"
                        by Ciseri, and 'Tho Flight into Egypt," by Bramantion.</p>

                    <p>Many people visit Greece after wintering in Egypt, as it is so easily reached
                        from Alexandria ; the climate in April is charming. The best steamers are
