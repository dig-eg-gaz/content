                <p><hi rend="bold">“THAIS, ”</hi></p>
                <p>“Thais” is full of the usual Massenet charac- teristics, his ‘sensuous’ delicacy
                    and melodious continuity into which break nowandagain points ofirony: this last
                    feature was, as in his “Jon- gleur de Notre Dame,” most marked in’ his treatment
                    of the Monastic- and conventical scenes. Somehow to me certain phases of, for
                    instance, the ‘Meditation” had a slightly Italian flavour, and lacked the light
                    grace so notable in the rest of the Opera. ‘That ‘“Medi- tation” was ;by the
                    way, beautifully played by. M. Martellini, his tone saggested all the soft
                    caressing mystery of Thais, herself—or Mile Genevois as Thais, for that matter:
                    for she was, charming; ‘her voice and technique were. Linstinct with variety,
                    cleat, and faultless. Her invocation to Venus was really excellent. M. de Ryle
                    regained his lost prestige, and) sang quite well throughout. M. Vernet had
                    little enough to do, but gave the impression that the part did not really suit
                    him. The chorus was not q ‘ite 80 good as usaal: there were occasional lapses of
                    decision-in the malé voices. The orchestra was excellent, as was M. Baron, but
                    he occasionally seem’ to lose the sense of the movement of the music, to become
                    slightly professorial.</p>

                <p>Some evil sprite must have got mistaken in the calendar this last week, and
                    mistaken the ist January for the Ist April. Wedo not know how originated the
                    rumour that the Empre Eugenie had arrived in Cairo: but it was substantiated.
                    sufficiently to appear in print, with the result that the Savoy was besieged by
                    all the notables of the place all ahxious to pay their devoirs to the august
                    visitor. Hardly had this rumour collapsed than another was set going to the
                    effect thatthe Savoy was on the eve of closing ite~teors, presdmably ‘from
                    disappointment that the Empress was not within them. This also Aurney out , to
                    bea canard of the most onwarrantable kind. Fat from shutting its doors, the
                    Savoy is preparing many new rooms for the accumodation: of the many guests who
                    are expected within the next few days. Numberless are the applications that have
                    Been received of late :. there have been no less than seven for the suite of
                    apart- ments which aré being reserved for Sir Ernest ‘Cassel and his party; and
                    there are many evidences to prove that even if the season has tarried long in

                <head>THE SUDAN BUDGET.</head>
                <p>A comparative aioe of the Sudan Govern- ment Reports brings out many interestings
                    facts, says the “Sudan Times,” and indicates the rapid strides of progress, at
                    which the country has beén advancing. In 1900, when Sir R.F. Wingate assumed the
                    administration of the Government of the Sudan, the refe- ‘nue of the country did
                    not exceed LE. 150,000. In the budget for 1908, the revenue is estimated at L.E.
                    1,000,000. In’ other words, in the’ period of seven years the revenue has
                    increased sevenfold which is a very remarkable development.</p>
                <p>In 1905, the revenue from the land tax, inclusive otusbur, was about LE. 30,000.
                    In the budget for 1908, this source: of revenue is estimated at about LE.
                    100,000.</p>
                <p>These figures need no comment. They testify to theable financial management of
                    the coun- try, and to the wholesome general admitiistra- tration, which. has
                    rendered such sncoéss possible.</p>
                <p>Among other interesting facts in the Sudan Budget, we.notice that the revenue of
                    the Sudan Government Railways for 1908 is esti- mated’ at L. E 300,000. It is
                    anticipated that the revenue for the present year, 1907, will reach the figure
                    of L. E. 300,0°:0 against an es- timate of L.E. 250,00). The revenue for 1905,

                    These figures are aii eloquent testimony to the remarkable development of trade

                    thousand odd coolies came down ‘from the Arab town with their skeikhs and asked
                    the masters what arrange- ment they would make. About‘10 a.m. the sheiks
                    reported that thé men were ready to tesume work under the old agreement. The

                    as,soon as the “black legs” had left the ships. At 11 a.m. everything was ready
                    for the men to \resume work, but in answer to the first call orily 30 men pot in
                    an appearance and it was not till‘after 5 p.m. that a proper start was made.
                    To-day the men baye worked when watited and it is considered that the stnke is

                        the Standard Life Buildings.</p>

                    <p>Mme Wyatt’s visit to Cairo is with the object of starting a high class
                        business here’ in con- nection with the one she is so ably conducting in
                        London ; and an examination of the Jovely | models she has brought with her
                        © will convince most of us’ that she is supplying a long felt want.</p>

                    <p>Mme: Wyatt is accompanied by a sister, also an experienced dressmaker, who
                        ‘will re- main throoghout the season. taking orders, measprements and

                        tissue. which distinguish. the fashions of the moment. In fact «:.visit:

                        best. we have-read ‘of in the latest fashion ‘papers.</p>

                    <p>A lovely evening gown showing in its folds the veiled fire of the opal, is
                        composed! of several layers of grey chiffon over an under- dress of rosy
                        satin oriental. The clinging skirt meets into.a deep shaped flounce of lace
                        dyed grey, headed by folds-of panne, and is farther ornamented: by long
                        wreaths of flowers and foliage expressed'in dull silver and faint pink
                        tissue. The same glistening embroidery appears upon: the short full bodice
                        which is arranged to show, a’ dainty vest run with row after row of narrow
                        cream valenciennes. The price of this is thirty: guineas;bat it is one of
                        Mmé Wyatt's lovliest models and is well worth:the money.</p>

                    <p>Among those less expeusive is a dainty little frock-most suitable for a young
                        girl, the soft cream silk bearing a tiny floral device, ‘and. the trimming
                        consisting of bands of silk embroidery outlined by double frills of cream
                        lace. These. bands define the square cut corsage which is softened byes
                        tucked net and lace vest and wreath of tiny roses, and pass down one side of
                        bodice and skirt encircling the latter. Bands ot the narrow black velvet
                        caught by tiny paste buckles keep together the lace on both sleeves and
                        bodice. This frock 1s priced at fifteen guineas ; and for thirteen we
                        noticed a charm- ing old-world’ figured Chené silk of almost fawn colour;
                        trimmed aboat the skirt with square battlements of, narrow ruching; touches
                        of purple velvet, long silk fringe and flat rosettes appearing on the Empire

                        and_.panne. Heavy motifs “d’Ireland” are, arranged upon the sleeves and
                        bodice which is, a bewildering but entirely fascinating _ medley. of panne,,
                        lace and finely tucked chiffon, canght at the back with a large soft

                        plain skirt tightly. racked across the front of the waist according to, the

                        and the high up- standing collar which is en regle in snch garments.</p>

                    <p>Dear Sir,~-Since giving my lecture at the last meeting of the Khedivial
                        Geographical society Ihave gone more thoroughly into the question of the
                        levels of the White Nile and have found that the White Nile is of more’
                        value to Egypt than the Rand gold deposits are to the Transvaal. If we take
                        the highest flood level at ‘Khartoum at 0 metres, we have :—at Renk, 500
                        kilo- metres above Khartoum, still 0 metres, at the Saubat mouth 840
                        kilometres above Khartoufh still 3.50.metres, at Lake No—mouth, 970 kilo-
                        metres above Khartoum, still 4.75 metres. In other words we have tor half
                        the distance a level lake and for the other half a slope of 1/100,000, or
                        for the whole distance. a slope of 1/200,000.</p>

                    <p>To THe Eprror or THE “EGYPTIAN GAZETTE.”</p>

                    <p>Sir,</p>

                    <p>Not a few of your readers were ‘struck with amazement at the favorable
                        comments in your coluamna upon the approaching release of the Denishwai
                        convicts. Though conspicuously fair to those who differ from you, the policy
                        of the “Egyptian Gazette” has been hitherto uniform- ly Imperialist.
                        To-endorse the decision ofa Liberal Government, which in this instance was
                        actuated solely by interested motives, reads uncomménly like a dereliction
                        of principle.</p>

                    <p>Political mémories are proverbially short ; but» most: of us, here in Egypt
                        at all events, have preserved a recollection that the prosecu- tion of the
                        Denishwai villagers arose out of an attack upon British officers in which
                        some were badly injured, and one: of them ost his life. Sir Edward @réy
                        assured the ~House of Com- mons that the..tribunal before which the. trial
                        took place was composed ofthe ablest judges in thé land, and Lord Cromer
                        expressed his opinion that~the~ sentences “were just and necessary.” For
                        what reason, then, are the convicts to be liberated ? The Liberal Govern-
                        ment, puta it on the-ground of clemency. But clemencyis a luxury which from
                        past experience has cost our country dear. It was an act of clemency
                        indulged in by Mr. Gladstone after the reverse of our arms at Majuba Hill
                        which necessitated the second Boer War with all its attendant suffering,
                        privation and carnage and the expenditure by the British Exchequer of two
                        hundred aud fifty million pounds.</p>

                    <p>Absit omen!</p>

                    <p>Do not let: us deceive ourselves with any such clap-trap sentiment. No one
                        who has intelligently followed current events is likely to be misled by it.
                        For all the tall taik there is no clemency in this case—not the semblance of
                        it The convicts owe their freeduin_ to one fact and to one fact alone -
                        fear. Fear, yot of anything that might happen in Exypt—there is happily no
                        cause for anxiety at the present time —but fear of an adverse vote which
                        might hurl the Government from power. His Majesty’s present advisers, with.
                        the. largest majority ever obtained in our-time, cannot rely upon their own
                        supporters. It is not considerations of mercy which weigh with them. The
                        dictates of humanity have played no part in their deliberations, The truth
                        is that they.have not the courage of their professed convictions. Their
                        wire-pullers have told them that the continued ‘incarceration of the
                        Denishwai convicts renders their position perilously insecure. That. is
                        enough for them. At the bidding of party exigencies they fling consist- ency
                        to the winds. Theirs is an ignominious capitulation: to ‘expediency. That is
                        the long and the short of it.</p>

                    <p>We fail to see how “ Imperialist” can ac- cuse us of inconsistency. In
                        announcing the decision to release the prisoners we stated that it. was
                        anvact of political clemency ofa similar character--to what ie known as the
                        “ King’s Pardon. ”“The decision was obviously arrived at for political

                        owing to politic- al pressure, .we may express our satisfaction that the
                        authorities, British and Egyptian, have seen their way to exercise that
                        right of clemency which should exist in every executive |, Government for
                        tempering in exceptional circumstances the course of justice. At the same
                        time, we cannot pretend -to think that the crime for which the prisoners
                        were sentenc- ed was anything but participation in a murder ofa peculiarly
                        brutal kind. Wedo not forget that the assailants of the British officers
                        dragged them out ofthe carriages in which they had taken refuge, beat them
                        when they lay on the ground and, further, robbed their bodies. None of these
                        acts are consistent with the theory that the officers. were killed or in-
                        jured in the course of the natural and legiti- mate effort of the peasants
                        to prevent their pigeons being shot by trespassers on the vil- lage lands.
                        The officers were no doubt in the wrong, though they were not aware’of the
                        fact, in interfering with the property of the natives, We cannot, however,
                        hold that so mild a violation of the rights of property gives either black
                        men or white men the right to kill without being. held responsible. for
                        their acts. We should say exactly the same if in sithilar circumstances an
                        Englisman beat a native to death who entered his. garden, trampled'down his
                        flower-beds, and: destroyed his vegetables.</p>

                    <p>To THE Epiror oF THE “Eayprian -GaZeTre.”</p>

                    <p>Sir,~—A few days since you. published a letter from a correspondent,Mr
                        Gooding, under the above heading, asking to be informed if such: an article
                        as that which he quotes, is imposed as. a usual ‘and customary condition
                        under which shareholders are invited to sus- cribe capital for joint stock’
                        companies. I am surprised that Mr. Gooding should ask this question,-or that
                        it should be thought neces- sary to refer to London for @ reply. If Mr.
                        Gooding will only ‘read the Companies Act, 1862, section 67. he will find
                        the following words, which are a complete ariswer to his question : —</p>

                    <p>‘‘All acts done by such directors &amp; c. shall be deemed to be valid,
                        notwithstanding- avy defect that may afterwards be discovered in their
                        appointments or qualifications.”</p>

                    <p>This is the law on the question‘raised by Mr. Gooding, whether it forms part
                        of the Articles of Association of any Limited Liability Com- pany or not,
                        and the article of which Mr. Gooding complains so much, is only a rough
                        translation of'the law, and means*neither more or less, and if did, it would
                        be valid.</p>

                    <p>In common with most. other people knowing anything~about—English—company law,
                        I was much astonished during last autumn, to see that the shareholders of a
                        local English com- pany were convened at a general meeting and asked to
                        confirm the previous acts of their directors, because it was discovered that
                        they might not have been duly qualified, and that, without any suspicion
                        whatever that their acts were not perfectly “bona-fide.”’</p>

                    <p>It is only necessary to refer to the law as above quoted, to see that such a
                        proceeding was perfectly unnecessary and uncalled for.</p>

                    <p>Soch questions nearly always turn on. the due deposit of a share
                        qualification. Now in ail the Acts. forming: the law of Limited Liability
                        from 1862 to 1907, no such qualifica- tion is required, but if, as
                        is.’usually -the case, it is.required, and rightly so, by the Articles of
                        Association of any Company, it must be respected. But the Legislator who
                        drew up the Act of 1862, wisely saw, that unless he made*some such provision
                        as that contained in section 67 above referred to, the unfortunate
                        shareholders .of Limited) Companies, would never have been able to find out
                        when anything connected with their business was’ definitely settled, and
                        their most importart - affairs might have-been, at any moment thrown into a
                        state of chaos, on’ the. slightest grounds, bys the unscropulous holder of a
                        single share.</p>

                    <p>Many of the provisions of the manifold Acts from 1862 to 1901 have been.
                        hitherto. but little respected, becaise no very definite penalty was
                        attached to their observance, but now we have the Act of the 28th Angnst
                        1907 which improves and very clearly defines, a large number of penalties,
                        hitherto unheard of. It is true that its penal clausesde not. come into
                        force until the Ist of July 1908, so that we are still given some time to
                        put our house in order, and those who. are wise will not neglect to do so
                        before that date.</p>
