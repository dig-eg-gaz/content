                    <head>THE EGYPT EXPLORATION FUND.</head>
                    <p>The lecture which Professor Naville deli- vered on Monday evening last week
                        at King's Collage on hia fourteen yesre' work on the exploration of the
                        great Hathor temples at Deir-el-Bahari was, ays ^fr. W. St Chad Boa- eawen
                        in the "Globe," an add res" of great importance, not only on aocount of the
                        ur- oheologial matter, bat alao on aooount of the statements he made at the
                        oloee as to the future plans of the Egyptian Exploration Fund. In his
                        diaoourse the laturer txaoed the progress of the work from the first om- it
                        in 1898 to ita condition in 1907, and as the various stages of work were
                        explained and the progress made illustrated by beautiful photographs, it was
                        made clear what a great work had been* accomplished. When Mariette gave up
                        his work none of the greattemple was clear except the forecourt. The remain*
                        of the colonnade*, the shrine", and the great alter were all hidden beneath
                        tons of débris and landslips from the great western mountain. In addition,
                        the remains of a Coptic monastery and village filled the portions above
                        gronnd. This applied to die great temple built for Hatsbepsn by the
                        architect SenrouL The very existence of the older temple of the eleventh
                        dynasty built by Mentuhetep, and the shrine* of the Hathor Cow, one of the
                        moat important discoveries ever made, on which Professor Nnville waxed
                        justly eloquent, wae quite unsnspected. The work of the daring of the old
                        temple belongs to years ago, in the present rapid progress of events ; but
                        there was ODe spécial point of interest which the lecturer referred to, and
                        which was oertainly new. In the forecoort at the top of. the camp lading np
                        from the plain was discovered an immense aquare altar, approached by steps.
                        As the Egyptians did not use burnt offering", its use was obscure, but
                        Professor Naville show- ed that it resembled the great altars shown in the
                        sculptures of Ankh-en Aten, at Tel-el- Amarna-whioh were piled with flowers,
                        fruits, and various offerings of braad-caka and other objects what time the
                        King amended to offer his prayer to the noonday sun. When conclud- ing his
                        remarks on the exploration) of the eighteenth dynasty temple, the lecturer
                        showed a photograph of the absolutely cleared and partially., restored
                        building, and remarked, "that it was now in a muoh better condition than it
                        had ever been sinoe the latter days of ths Egyptian Empire." Por he said the
                        Egyp- tians seldom or ever repaired a building, and more frequently when in
                        partial deoay it be- oamea quarry for the workmen of later. times. This had
                        oertainly been the fate- of the older temple which preoeded the building of
                        the great queen. This work bad oooupied ten years. Passing now to the work
                        on the older temple, buried benrath mounds of débris only partially natural,
                        the lecturer brought out many most important points hitherto un- known, and
                        especially interested his audience by exhibiting photographs of many of the
                        sculptures retained at Cairo. Among these were a beautifnl painted portrait
                        group of Mentuhetep and hia negro queen. There i" also another interesting
                        group of one of the queens sated on a throne and receiving offerings of milk
                        and aka from attendants, while two waiting maids plait her hair and put the
                        hairpins in it ; certainly the earliest picture of an early breakfast The
                        king, Profes- sor Naville said, was a polygamist, two wives being priestess"
                        of Hathor, and they were buried in tombe in a courtyard behind the pyramid
                        and bautifolly deoorated shrines erected in the oolonnade above the tombs.
                        The lecturer showed photographs of the very beau tiful sarcophagus of
                        Prinoea or Queen Kareit now at Cairo. Professor Naville devoted much time to
                        the account of the discovery of the perfect shrine of the goddess Hathor,
                        under the form of -a cow- which has been so often described. He mentions
                        that careful rosoaich had shown that there was a distinct association
                        between the Hathor cow and the Apis bnIL He bad said that the peculiar
                        markings on the body of the cow were not stars, as at first sup- posed, but
                        laves of a "four - leafed clover." Ia tliis anotheqgroof of the antiquity of
                        the sham- rock t The most important point in the lecture was Professor
                        Naville's exposition of the ques- tions of the King's tomb. He showed mo*t
                        clearly that tho great vaulted puisage extending fivod hundred fat into the
                        mountain could not be the tomb ; but ratiier that great alabaster shrine,
                        with its red granite roof, was. the chamber of the Ca, or doublo of the
                        king, which was worshipped by the later kings ITsertesen, Amenophis II., aud
                        others. He then prooeedod to show that there was much evidence to identify
                        tho tomb with that found in the south-west corner of the oourt by Lord
                        Dufferin in 1889, which Dr. Naville cleared again, and in which le found a
                        large uninscribed sarcophagus. In the oouree of the lecture, Pro- fessor
                        Naville referred to the great help be had received from Mr. Hall, of the
                        British Museum, aud Mr. Aryton. The most important statement of all came at
                        the conclusion of this interesting lecture. Mr. Naville, in peaking of the
                        future work of the Egypt Exploration Fund, said that it was feared that the
                        intended exavations at Abydo* would have to be given up this season. Tho
                        work on Deir-el-Bahari had oat so many thousands of pounds that unless
                        subscriptions were forthcoming, a season's rest would be necessary. Surely
                        there must be many wbo, while unable to visit Nile land, have had its beet
                        art and literature brought to them year after year by the Fund, who would
                        contribute their guinea, or as much more as they like, in order that thia
                        should be remedied, and the twenty-five years work be continued. </p>

                    <p>A-Cairo Bey, rich anil well known in the district, two years ago married an
                        Israelite dancer named Latifa,and handsomely furnished for her a flat at
                        Daher. Uuliappily the fickle iinturo of the Bey was not proof against the
                        blandishments of other artistes and his infi- delity was the cause of many
                        domestic squab- bles. These only served to exasperate the husband with the
                        result that, he completely deserted the home. On Monday morning, ac-
                        iunqianieiTby a servant and several porters, he went to the house, and
                        expressed his intention f taking away the household goods. This procedure
                        the wife energetically opposed, and her cries soon brought several
                        Israelites on the x-ene. One, a certain Leon Sion, interfered and a sharp
                        combat followed, during which l/pon Sion sUbbed the servant with a knife.

                        considerable difficulty stopped the fray, and arrested Leon Sion, consigning
                        him to the French Consulate, and transporting the wounded servant to the
                        hospital, wherq he lies in a grave condition. </p>

                        Alexandria during the year 1906 was 3,695,829 tons. In 1903 the total
                        tonnage was 3,591,281. The increase during the jiast year, therefore,
                        amounts to. 104,548 tons. Great as the increase is, it falls short of the
                        average yearly increase of the five preoedfrig yearn, which was 243,132
                        tons. The tonnageofBritish, French and Italian shipping has decreased in
                        almost identical proportion* to the total ton- nage of each, whereas Greek,
                        German, Belgian, Austro-Hungarian, Danish and Ottoman shipping have
                        increased in varying degreen. British shipping claims 1,473,087 tone, or 40
                        per cent of the total amount, and more than the Ottoman, Anstro-Hungarian,
                        Italian and French shipping combined. , There has, nevertheless, been a
                        decrease in British shipping of 48,792 tons as compared with the year 1905,
                        whereas the average year- ly increase during the five preceding years w"s
                        99,809 tons. Ottoman shipping, as in 1905, occupies the second place with
                        344,238 tons, or abont 9 per cent of the shipping of the port, representing
                        an increase of 4,003 tons' during the year. The average yearly in- crease
                        during the five preceding years was 32,868 tons. Austro-Hungarian shipping,
                        which occupied the fifth place in 1905, has risen above France and Italy to
                        the third place with a total of 325,549 tons, or 9 per cent of the tonnage
                        of the port, and has rea- lised an increase of 14,881 tons, the average
                        yearly increase 'for the five preceding year* having been 12,357 tons.
                        Italian shipping, which occupied the third place lost year, now stands
                        fourth, having yielded a place to Austria Hungary, with 323,942 tons, or 9
                        per cent of the shipping of the port, hut has sustained a decrease of 8,342
                        tons. French shipping, which bold the fourth place in 1905, having likewise
                        beeu passed by Anstrio-Huiigary, now stands fifth with 316,500 tons, or 9
                        per cent of the port, ami has sustained a decreaso of 9,629 tons as compared
                        with 1906, the average yoarly in- crease during the five preceding years
                        liaving Itoeu 6,697 tons. Genn shipping holds the sixth place with 296,647
                        tons, or 8 per cent, of the total tonnage of the port aa compared with
                        7percent forl905and4 percent forl904.There has been an increase daring the
                        past year of 34,976 tons, the average yearly increase during the five
                        preceding yearshaving been 40,442 tons. Greek shipping h-s risen from the
                        eighth to the seventh place with a tonnage of 241,290 tons,oi6 percent of
                        the tonnage of the port, as compared with 6 per cent for 1908, 4 per cent,
                        for 1904, 3 per cent for 1908 and 2 percent in 1902. It has shown the
                        consider- able increase of 68,229 tons during tho year, tho average yearly
                        increase during the five years preceding having been 18,510 ton*. Russian
                        shipping occupies the eighth place with 176,819 tons, or 5 per cent bf the
                        total shipping of the port. Belgian shipping has risen from the tenth to the
                        ninth place with 63,628 tons, or 2 per cent of the tonnage of tho port as
                        compared with 1 per cent, in 1905. It ha" increased by the considerable
                        amount of 29,*267 tons during the past year, the aver- age yoarly increase
                        for the five preceding years having been 2,083 tons. Danish ship- ping
                        occupies the tenth place with 86,785 tons, as compared with 10,996 tons in
                        1"00 and 23,052 tons in 1905. It has increa- sed by 12,733 tons during the
                        post year. Swedish and Norwegian shipping accounted for 32,736 and 25,871
                        tons, respectively. Their tonnage united'fall slightly short of their
                        combined tonnage for 1905 Dutch ship- ping claims 15,634 tons, or 2,772
                        tons, more than in 1905. Roumanian shipping, unrepresented in.1905,
                        contributed 12,811 tons. This i* due to the service organised by the
                        Rouinainian Maritime Company betwéen Constant and Uiis port. Cyprus lias
                        during the past year been oon nected with Alexandria by a regular weekly

                    <head>A WONDERFUL TRANSFORMATION.</head>
                    <p>Writing on the 19th inst. a.correspondent of "Pall Mall Gazette" says :-
                        After an absence of quite eighteen months, I find myself again at Assuan,
                        and, perforce, I have paid a visit to the Dam. I was exceedingly surprised
                        at the transformation achieved on the west side of that marvellous
                        structure. There is, as before^ very little to interest the eye on the drive
                        out, which takée about thirty minutes from the time of leaving the hotel.
                        The way leads across the sandy expanse which, broken here and tliere by
                        overpower- ingly high mosacs of sandstone and granite, causes the casual
                        observer to imagine be ia traversing the soene of aonio prehistoric vol-
                        canic upheaval Bat oq a closer observation one sees in the formation and lay
                        of tho rocks that the right bank was in reality in former times the bed of a
                        river, fpnning, in all pro. bability, an outlet or tributary to the great
                        inland sea, which is said by ihe geologists to have existed in the Sahara D
                        esert At the reservoir there is quit* a little colony. Where, a little over
                        a year ago, only a relentless stretch of sand existed, there appear now
                        numbers of neat and cool-looking buildings, standing in their own grounds,
                        which are developing into produoe-bearing and shade-providing gardens,
                        affording a restful spot on which the eye, tired with the glare of the sun
                        and the surrounding desert, can repose.. These houses are the residences of
                        the offioials attachod to the Dam, and of the engineers engaged on the new
                        works. I entered one of them, and found it delightfully cool and com-
                        fortable, fitted with electric light and various conveniences with which the
                        ordinary resident has to dispense. Some of the houses are excellently
                        situated, standing at the summit of a series of terraces covered witJi the
                        green plant, which out here cakes the place of tnrf. All this shows the
                        riohness of Egypt's soi!, and proves that with care and attention even the
                        sand can be inado fruitful. I do not mean that fhe sand alone can be
                        transformed. What I intend to convey is the fact that with modem appliances
                        and careful supervision no spot in Egypt need lie bàfréh. At present it is
                        rather " critical tiino in Assuan from a hygienic point of viow. It is the
                        period of tho green water, a stretch of water computed to be 500 miles in
                        length, and con- taining a fungus whose colour gives the name to tho water.
                        This piece of water takes from seven to fourteen days to pass Assuan, aud
                        daring tliat timo it ia extremely dangerous to drink the water, OH it brings
                        on fever and colic. The smell is also most offensive. The residents at the
                        Dam get the frill benefit of this water, if one may call it benefit, and at
                        present they do not feel over happy at their lot Butin time all this will be
                        a tiling of the past, and I feel quite loth to leave what appears to be, and
                        certainly is, a delighful spot to reside in </p>

                    <p>As announoed in onr oable of the 81st ult the Royal Message recommending the
                        grant of £50,000 to the . Earl of Cromer for his great servioee to Egypt waa
                        diaoaued in both boasee of Parliament on Tuesday week. In the House of
                        Lords, the Marqness of Ripon, (Lord Privy Seal).in moving that their
                        lordships concur with the Commons in making the grant, said :- It ie with
                        great personal gratification that I rise to perform the doty which falls to
                        my lot on this occasion. Lord Cromer's great services are ao well known to
                        yonr lordships and to his countrymen, that it would be ont of place, and
                        almost waste of time, if I were to go through any lengthy description of
                        them now. The great success of Lord Cromer's administration in Egypt has
                        afforded justification for the belief that Englishmen are eminently
                        qualified for the administration of affaira in any part of the world, and on
                        behalf of any nation. During the 24 years in which my noble friend has been
                        at the head of Egyptian administration, be has done a work of infinite
                        difficulty and of the highest importance-a work beneficial to the people of
                        that country, bringing order out of chaos and laying firm aud solid the
                        foundation of a pros- perity calculated to confer much honour npon the
                        British name. To most of ns here, and to many outside the Honse, Lord
                        Cromer's name is chiefly connected with the great work which be has done in
                        Egypt, but it would be a great mistake to suppose that his servioes bave
                        been entirely confined to that country Lord Cromer was trained in a good
                        school of administration. He was private secretary to my noble friend the
                        late Lord Northbrook, and I Jiad the advantage of having Lord Cromer as a
                        finan- cial member of the Indian Council during the chief part of the time
                        that I had the honour to fill the office of Viceroy of India, I waa able
                        then to wsteh, from day to day, Mb devotion to doty, hia firm grasp of
                        financial principles, and his high administrative ability. It ia, therefore,
                        with no hesitation that I submit to. yod a resolution, and aakrou to express
                        to the Sovereign your readinem'to concur doing an honoor to one who has
                        renderiAsrvice* alike to the Crown and the this country (hear. hear). A
                        recognition snch as that which it is intend- ed to be offered to Lord Cromer
                        has very generally been confined to members of the naval and military
                        servioes, bat I rejoice that npon this occasion, 'we are about to concur in
                        conferring a similar hononr npon one whose services have been of a civil
                        nature. I think that we shall do well if we do not hesitate to place Lord
                        Cromer in the same position and on perfect equality with the eminent
                        soldiers and sailors who have been honoured iu this way, I therefore beg
                        to.move :- '"^hat an humble address of concurrence and thanks be addressed
                        to his Majesty in answer to his most gracious message" (cheers). The
                        Marquess of lansdowne.-We, on this side of the House, do not yield to noble
                        lords opposite in onr appreciation of Lord Cromer's services, and we desire
                        to associate ourselves with all that has been said by the noble marquess,
                        and to accept onr full share of res- ponsibility for the proposal which the
                        Govern- ment has made. Lord Cromer has, indeed, conferred signal services
                        upon this country, and upon the Empire. I was glad that the noble marquess
                        reminded us tliat, although we dre apt to connect Lord Cromer's name almost
                        exclusively with Egypt, it was not in Egypt alone that Lord Cromer did good
                        work for his country. 1 can well remember the réputation which Lord Cromer
                        left behind him in India as fi- nancial member of the Council but it ia upon
                        Egypt that Lord Cromer lias left an indelible mark, and it is tho affairs of
                        Egypt which have ennhled him to write a page in the history ol this country
                        which is all his own. On snch an occasion as this one is apt to look for a
                        parallel, but 1 really believe there is no case which stands exactly on all
                        fours with that-.of Lord Çroiner. Our position in Egypt is an altogether
                        exceptional position, and Lord Cromer's position in that oountry was also
                        exceptional. I think that it would be almost trae to say of him that during
                        his long term of office lie was able to serve two masters with equal
                        fidelity and success. Of British interests he was a watchful custodian.
                        Nobody need be'reininded of the nature of British interests in Egypt It is
                        due to Lord Cromer that our position in that oountry, at one time undefined,
                        and, indeed, somewhat precarious, became assured and consolidated. </p>

                        not a less faith; fnl guardian of the interests of the oountry committed to
                        his charge. Nothing oould have been more whole hearted than his devotion to

                        a marvellous achievement in the intere*t* of Egypt We *ee how, under hia

                        footing, we may indeed claim for him that, under the geidanoe of no other
                        man, could *o much have been done for the people of Egypt I daresay many of
                        your lordships may have, from time to time, perused those admirable reports-

                        under which that work was performed, tokbowin the face of what great

                        was so admirably accomplished. Lord Cromer had to oontsod with many
                        disappoint- ments ; he had to overcome many rivalries, but be triumphed over
                        them ail, hem am he possessed in thé highest degree two great qualities
                        indispensable in a public mao-the qualities of tact and tenacity. It would
                        be un- just to Lord Cromer if I did not refer to my conviction that the
                        satisfactory understanding obtained by the late Government with Prance iu
                        regard to many outstanding question^ and notably with regard to Egyptian
                        affaira, would not have been obtainable, or, at all events, attainable upon
                        so satisfactory a basis, if it had not been for the exceptional position
                        which Lord Cromer occupied among the repre- sentatives of the other Great

                        upon his health. We trust that he may live long to see others carry out the

                        had done work in India the effect of which is felt to this day. We all know
                        how. Lord Cromer's administration of the affaira of Egypt has been marked by
                        striking material progress, but his oountrymen are even proud er of the
                        security and liberty which his labour secured-of the revival of jostioe and
                        work he did for education. When we reflect that 24 years ago, when he began
                        this task, Egypt was bankrupt, and almost effa- ced under the burden of
                        taxation and in- debtedness, and that all his efforts for .re- form had to
                        be carried out under a system surely ' the most grievous to be borne that
                        ever hampered an administrator, it is diffi- cult to find words in which to

                    <p>Lord Cromer belongs to the school that holds it wise to hasten slowly if

                        disbelieved in any attempt lo force the Egyptiou people into Western mould.
                        If lie had cared to ilaczle the world with swift and sensational results,
                        there were plenty, of capitalists ready to go up end develop Egypt on the
                        lines of European finance, and Lord Cromer would have saved himself infinite
                        trouble if he had accepted their assistsnoe and yielded to pressure and let
                        them in. Bot be saw that the regeneration of Egypt oould ohly be effected
                        through the Egyptians themselves, and in devising meeeuras for the
                        emapeipatiea of the peasantry from the bondage of debt and preserving them

                        civil servants, however distinguished their services. We Imve before us in
                        Egypt the fruits of the work of one great men. It stands out as isolated and
                        sin- gular a work of genius as the more sudden glories of some great
                        military triumph, and, is separated from the ordinary work of even the
                        greatest of the great race of oivil servants abroad who have done such
                        inestimable ser- vice to the British Empire by special char ao tens tics
                        which mark it off and render it matter for differential treatment (cheers).
                        Within a quarter of.a century Lord Cro- mer has raised Egypt from the lowest
                        pitch of social and economic degradation until it now stands among Oriental
                        nations, I believe, absolutely alone in ita prosperity. Everything he has
                        touched he has succeeded in. Every cause he has taken in hand he lias
                        furthered. He leaves Egypt able to look back open an administration longer,
                        more beneficent, qpd more fruitful than, perhaps, can be boasted by any one
                        of those great predecessors who have csrrie*I out great civilising work

                        great, and ["quires sympathy, courage, and stead- fastness. Lord Cromer has
                        all these qualities. He has dealt successfully with diplomatic and social
                        difficulties in a manner which has earned the permanent gratitude of the
                        Egyptian people, and which is well deserving of some distinguished mark of

                        The grant to Sir Rowland Hill was the nearest case which could be
                        discovered, but the resemblancebetween the circumstance-! in which it*was
                        made and those of the present vote is not very close. Lord Ripon said that,
                        had no precedent existed, he should have l"een glad to create one, and, in
                        effect, that is what the Government have doue. We congratu- late them upon
                        their action and upon its exceptional timeliness. It is meet and wise that à
                        nation such as ours should pay homage to splendid achievements in other
                        fields than in the field of war. They demand gifts not less rare, labours as
                        arduous and more prolonged, and courage equally high. At a time when the
                        mind of the whole world is. lient on furthering the cause of peace, it is

                        for that cause should bestow a signal mark of ifs favour upon à statesman
                        whose life work lias been a work of peace. Iiord Lansdowne, who followed the
                        leader of the House, called to mind tho difficulties and the obstacles under

                        cares and anxieties they laid upon him, he never suffered them to divert his
                        course from the goal he liad set himself to reach. It has been his happiness
                        to reach that goal amidst the felicitations of the whole world. It remained
                        for his Sovereign and his countrymen to confer upon him a material token of
                        tlie deep appreciation they entertain of |iia achievements, and they have
                        discharged this duty to themselfes and to him by the vote of last night. The
                        work, which Lord Cromer lias done is there for all the world to see ; all
                        the world -has looked u|ion it, and lias declared with one accord that it is

                    <p>Among all tho great servants of the Empire, Lord Croinet holds a very special
                        position, lie has by universal admission achieved successes which twenty
                        three years ago would have seemed impossible. lie has extricated the.
                        finances of tlie State from the confusion and lespnir in which -lie found
                        them. He has rescued tho peasants from oppression end overwhelming taxation.
                        He Iras introduced order and justice into public life. He has worked wonders
                        In engineering and irrigation. Not least pf his claims to public gratitude
                        is tlie strong hand with which he has defended Egypt from the private
                        avarice and the finan- cial conspiracies which have made up so much of tho
                        history of Imperialism elsewhere. Such a career stands out conspicuously in
                        tho ad- ministrative successes of a nation that ii not poor in the records
                        of honest and public-spirited government </p>

                        again boon very quiet in tone, with only a very limited business doing
                        outside of tho professional trading. There have been frequent moderate
                        fluctuations anil to-day's prices are 7^ @ 8 points higher for the Current,
                        month and Augiist(Septemher delivery, and 8J @ 4 points higher for the other
                        positions, than those of last Thu relay. The slight improvement is more due
                        to a certain sensitive- ness about the real condition of tJiKCrop, because
                        more or less tlie weather has continued dry with high temperatures. There is
                        not apparently so far any serious anxiety, but there is anxiety of a kind.
                        We are also awaiting with considerable interest the Bureau report to be
                        issued in New York to-morrow after our market is closed, and as Liverpool

                            gold will necessarily amount to f. large figure, as we have said before,

                        <p>Business on the Stock Exchange has be- come so scarce of late that many
                            members concluded this week that their time would be much more
                            profitably spent on the moor or by the sea, and the consequenoe has been
                            that during the past two or three days the "House" has had a somewhat
                            de- serted^ appearance. Idleness has prevailed in most sections, and the
                            tone lias been any- thing but/satisfactory. It is gratifying to note,
                            however that the Egyptian section lias been firm and that an appreciable
                            amount of investment buying has been going on. This bears out what we
                            said last week, tliat the leading bro- kers are taking an optimistic
                            view of the trade troubles connected with the .crisis. The announcement
                            that the assets of Messrs Salmi Brothers were considerably in excess of
                            the liabilities has had a reassuring effect, and it is believed that in
                            the case of Messrs Harriraan Brothers, whose creditors moet next

                            bounds of possibility that before the next settlement they will lie down
                            to 80. Large quantities of tho stock were delivered at the settlement
                            this week, and heavy buying on behalf of the Government lias totally

                        <p>The home railway market lias been very flat, and prices have given way
                            heavily in spite of good traffics and excellent holiday prospects. The
                            labour agitation is exercising a depressing effect, as investors refuse
                            to have anything to do with these shares in tho present state of unrest
                            The directors of the railways are adopting a firm attitude, which if
                            pursued must result in the employes moderating their demands. The
                            possibility of a strike Is remote, as the railwaymens' union represents
                            only a small section of the total employes. The Scotch shares Beem to be

                        <p>Shares in the American railway section have moved rather irregularly,
                            Wall Street having been pessimistic regarding the future outlook.
                            Yesterday the market here was affected by uncertainty over the Pacific
                            dividend!, and during the morning there was considerable selling of the
                            leading shares Later the tone became firmer. In the "Street" it was an-
                            nounced that the Southern Pacific dividend had been declared at the rate
                            of 6 per cent as against the previous distribution of 5 per cent, but
                            that no action has been taken with regard to tbs Union Pacific dividend.
                            The news seemed to have been fully discoanted. Southern Pacific fell to

                        the Métropole Theatre, Birmingham, to gather some details of her career.
                        Miss Corallie - in private life Mrs. Finlay- is twenty-four, and has been
                        before the foot- lights since childhood. "Yes, 1 can spare a few minutes,"
                        she said ; "time enough to tell of the good I derived from Dr. Williams'
                        Pink Pills for Pale People. "I have had the honour of appearing before
                        Royalty, and the late j. L. Toole often com- plimented me upon my stage work
                        ; yet for a long time 1 was acting under a positive prose cation. Sharp
                        pains in my back dragged me down ; sometimes I went to the theatre feeling
                        more dead than alive, with scarcely enough strength to drag one leg after
                        the other. My blood felt chilled ; rheumatic pains flew all over me, and my
                        limbs became almost useless. "1 struggled against these ailments, but it was
                        of little use. My face grew pallid, and I felt entirely worn out, yet all
                        night long I scarcely closed my eyes in sleep. 1 lost all vitality, and felt
                        depressed and weary, while my memory failed. Pood upset rue, and I always
                        had a nasty taste in my mouth. "Friends noticed the change in me, for at the
                        least exertion I gasped for breatli, and my heart throbbed. Often I have
                        returned to the dressing room fainting and exhausted. Every noise got on my
                        nerves, and made me tremble from head to foot. * "I took so many medicines
                        that my digestion was quite upset. Then fortunately 1 accepted the advice of
                        a friend, and tried Dr. Williams' Pink Pills. Relief followed, and so I
                        continued with these pilla Then I improved rapidly, and soon could enjoy
                        meals without being tormented by indigestion. "My blood was nourished, and a
                        healthy colour returned. I felt more energetic in everjfc- way. My memory
                        was clear. I was quitela new woman in a few weeks after taking Dr Williams'
                        Pink Pills, never really tired, blessed with a healthy appetite, and able to
                        sleep well at night In my opinion Dr. Williams' Pink Pills build up the
                        brain as well as the body, blood and nerves." When the Blood becomes thin
