                        enter into the details of the measures of every kind due to the prudent ls
                        of Lord Cromer, which have, as we all know, genth permitted forei ident in

                        on Saturday afternoon, was in every way worthy of the great occasion, and
                        the committee are to be congratulated on and thanked for having organised so
                        thoroughly a representative assembly. Every nationality was well
                        represented, and throughout the meeting sincere and immense enthusiasm was
                        manifested by all. The ceremony was timed to commence at six o'clock and as
                        he stepped upon platform the band of the Inniskilling Fusiliers played "God
                        Save the King". The Sirdar then called for three cheers for Lord Cromer and
                        this was responded to with unbounded enthusiasm. The front row of the seats
                        plaved on the stage were occupied by Lord Cromer, Sir Eldon Gorst, Mustapha
                        Pasha Fehmy, and Coont de Serionne. In the second row were the

                        side were Prince Hussein Pasha Kamel and the Princes Halim ; and in the left

                    <p>My Lord — The Committee of Honour, formed since the day following the
                        announcement of your Lordship's approaching departure,represents, without
                        distinction of nationality or residence, all those who, united in a deep
                        feeling of regret and gratitude, desire to express to you with all sincerity
                        the grief which they experience in witnessing you, for reasons of health,
                        cut short a career closely associated for nearly thirty years with the
                        establishment and realisation of every kind of progress, such as the
                        prosperity of Egypt bears testimony to. His Excellency Mustapha Pasha Fehmy
                        will address you in the name of the natives and the officials of the
                        Egyptian Government. As for me, 1 have to express to you, in the name of the
                        Committee, whom thank with all my heart for having entrusted to me this
                        signal honour, the feelings of those who, without being attached to this
                        country by bonds of nationality or officialdom, heartily testify to you
                        their regret and their gratitude.</p>
                    <p>It in not for me, gentlemen, to ennmerate at this time the numberless
                        services which Lord Cromer has rendered to this country since the day when
                        he was called to collaborate in its administration as Commissionner of the
                        Public Debt up to the very hour at which he leaves us, surrounded by a
                        respectful admiration a thousand times more eloquent than all the words
                        which I could use in retracing a career which belongs to history. It is not
                        that I would fear, in recording the important acts which have marked Lord
                        Crower's mission in Egypt, to go beyond the lines which have been traced for
                        me. Those in whose names I speak have profited, equally with the local
                        subjects, by the infinite progress which makes this country one of the most prosperous
                        regions of the world, and probably the most hospitable, It is their right
                        and duty, therefore, to associate them-selves with those who recapitalate

                    <p>Toe enthusiasm of the audience had risen to its utmost pitch, and amidst
                        immense and</p>
                    <p>longed applause Count de Seri 4 his seat. Lord Cromer, then rose and replied
                        (in French) as follows -—</p>
                    <p>Count andgentlemen : My Gbly regret at this moment is not to possess a
                        sufficient knowledge of the beantiful French language to be able to express
                        to yon in a fitting manner all the teelings of my heart. All the same I
                        would ask you to believe, Count, that I thank , you most sincerely, as mach
                        from my own part as from thatvo? Lady Cromer, for the more than kind words
                        which you have just uttered. What shall I say, gentlemen, to the welcome
                        which you have so kindly given me by the flattering speech of Count de
                        Serionne ? Words fail me. I car only say that it is to me a revelation to
                        know that I have so many indulgent friends up to this moment. What touches
                        me especially, gentlemen, is that this meeting can be considered, as I
                        believe it to be, of a truly international character. I hope that I may be
                        allowed to draw this conclusion from it : that notwithstanding the
                        inevitable and very con- siderable difficulties which the position which I
                        have occapied for twenty four years presents, I have not shown myself, in
                        the opinion of several who are certainly able to form a sound opinion, to be
                        a too bad internationalist. Indeed, gentlemen, I have always told myself
                        that it was my first duty to do my utmost to safeguard the interests of my
                        own country and of Egypt. I put Great Britain and Egypt in the same category
                        because I refuse to consider them apart. | uphold that, once well
                        understood, the interests of these two countries are absolutely identical.
                        But, gentlemen, beyond my quality of Englishman or I have never, | hope,
                        forgotten that Lam at the same time an European. The well-being of the
                        numerous and important European communi- ties in this country is an Egyptian
                        interest and therefore a British interest of the first order. It is with the
                        thorough conviction of the trath of this fact that I leave Egypt, and if
                        opportan- ity and necessity arise 1 will not fail to raise my voice in its
                        defence, In thanking you again, gentleman, from the bottom of my heart I beg
                        you to excuse the brevity of these few observations ; I am shortly going to
                        have the honour of expressing myself in English.</p>

                    <p>ian,</p>
                    <p>On the conclusion of Lord Cromer's speech, which was most heartily applauded,
                        Mustapha Pasha Fehmy, President of the Council of Ministers, rose and,
                        speaking in French, eaid:—</p>
                    <p>My Lord :—Allow me to express to your Lordship, in the name of the Government
                        and of the great majority of the Egyptian people, the sincere regret which
                        your departure canses them-a regret all the keener in that your departure is
                        necessitated by the state of your health, sacrificed in the constant and
                        excessive labour which your attachment to this country and your fervent
                        desire to incessantly contri bute to its welfare have imposed apon you.
                        Egyp® cannot forget, my Lord, that it is to the most pradent counsels, fo
                        the help and suppers which you have given her, that she owes a
                        transformation which evokes a general feeling of admiration. It is for
                        history to tell and to appreciate all the progress realised by this country.
                        I only wish to emphasise that the fellah has felt the benefits of the accom
                        plished transformation, and has participated above all others in the general
                        prosperity. By the raising of her moral and material condition she has been
                        able to experience happy days. It is to this work, my Lord, that your name
                        will be attached, and it is this which claims to-day and will always assure
                        the sincere and deep gratitude of Egypt. Allow me also to express our
                        regrets to Lady Cromer, to her who, by her goodness and her charity, has
                        gained the hearts of the mistortanate, to whom she has given _reliefand
                        comfort, and who has thus merited general gratitude. My Lord, you have
                        sincerely loved our Egypt, you have consecrated to it the best years of your
                        life ; we are then confident of the continuance of that goodwill of which
                        you have given such constant proof, and, in testifying to you our deep
                        affection, allow us to consider you always as one of us.</p>

                    <p>I must ask you to receivethe remarks I am about to make with some indulgence,
                        It is, indeed, @ considerable effort for me, both morally and physically, to
                        address you at all— physically, because T have to muster all my strength in
                        order to do so ; morally, because 1 am fairly overwhelmed by all the great
                        kindness which I have received from all classes during the last few weeks,
                        and be- caupe it costs mea very bitter pang to part finally with «country
                        where I have so many friends, and with which all the incidents of my public
                        career, as well as the joys and sorrows of my domestic life, have been
                        close- ly connected for well nigh a generation of men. I am leaving,
                        gentlemen, not for any po- litical reasons, but because the hand of has
                        begun to press hardly upon me ; because, after nearly half-a century spent

                    <p>like to say a few words in reply to the graceful allusions which both the
                        Count de Sérionne and the President of the Council have made to the lady who
                        has been my helpmate, and which have touched me—and, I am sure I may</p>
                    <p>I confine myself tosaying that, whilst I was listening to the two speeches we
                        have just heard, I felt a strong desire to change places with the speakers.
                        I should have preferred to eulogise Lady Cromer, rather than to reply to the
                        very flattering remarks which have been made about myself. Perhaps I may
                        take this opportunity of saying that one of the objects which Lady Cromer
                        has had most nearly at heart bas been to assist, in common with other
                        philanthropic ladies, in arresting the terrible infant mortality in
                        thiscountry. I venture to express a hope that thi) work, which has been well
                        begun, will not in future be neglected.</p>
                    <p>Lord Cromer's Coadjutore.</p>
                    <p>Gentlemen, I am not going to dwell at any length on the history of the past,
                        neither can I allude to all of those with whom it has been my privilege to
                        co-operate in the creation of the new Egypt. I will only say that I have
                        always felt that Ihave had much more than my share of public praise for
                        whatever good has recently been done in this country. | could have effected
                        nothing without the hearty co- operation of others—Egyptian and European, —
                        my own countrymen anij those of other nationalities.</p>
                    <p>Amongst these, I 'should like to say that none*has done useful work than</p>
                    <p>Mr, Findlay, who, ae. my absence, has, of late years, acted for mip under
                        circumstances of somewhat peculiar difficulty, I do not doubt that, in the
                        course of |the twenty-four years during which I have my present post, Thave
                        made many mistakes, and possibly I may have incurred some enmities ; but
                        your presence here this afternonn is, I hope, a sufficient proof that I have
                        also contracted many friendships. Let, me add that I am particularly touched
                        Hy the presence of so many of my foreign golleagues, with whom, as with
                        their predecegsors, I have always entertained the most friendly personal
                        rela tions,</p>
                    <p>Khedive; Towfik Pasha.</p>
                    <p>Although, as I have said, I cannot, speak of all with whom I have
                        co-operated, yet there are one or two personalities who come so vividly to
                        my mind) on the present occa- sion that I must perforce mention their names.
                        In the first place, I should like tosay a word-or two of one to whom, ih my
                        opinion, the public have never, as yet, done sufficient justice. I allude to
                        the iate Khedive, his Highness Tewfik Pastin, Gentlemen, I am not going to
                        use the language of empty compliment, or to employ conventional phrases What
                        I say, I mean, Tawfik Pasha understood his country and his gountrymen well.
                        He constituted an admirable link between the reformers, whose zeal he at
                        times tempered, and the people, whose gltra-conservative fears of reform he
                        ased his influence to allay, History will be unjust if it does not accord to
                        Tewfik Pasha a somewhat important niche in the Valhalla of oriental
                        potentates. He did not himself take any very agtive part in the 5 eration of
                        Egypt, but he was wise wach sb encourage and support those who were working
                        for its regeneration.</p>
                    <p>Wubar Pasha.</p>
                    <p>Another great figure of the pdst comes prominently to my mind on the present
                        occasion, Gentlemen, those who afe acquainted with the past history of
                        Egypt, dnd who have als read my recent annual Report, will recognize that
                        the proposals I have brdaght forward in con- nection with modifying the
                        regime of the Capitulations are the natural complement of the great and
                        statesmahlike work originally projected by Nubar Pasha Riaz Pasha. i</p>
                    <p>I would mention the |aame of another Egyp- tian statesman, whom {am glad to
                        see here this afternoon. I allude }o myold and trusted friend, Riaz Pasha,
                        Géntl little or no courage is now required on the part of the young Egyptian
                        who pases as a reformer. It was not so always. Isriail Pasha had some very
                        drastic methods ¢f dealing with those who did not bow befor him.
                        Nevertheless, some thirty years ago, Biiaz Pasha stood forth</p>
                    <p/>
                    <p/>
                    <p>boldly to protest maladministration which then prevailed pt. He was not
                        afraid to bell the cat red his courage, time | and though, at su periods, I
                        frequently</p>
                    <p>diftered from my old friend and colleague, I have never ceased to pe him with
                        the</p>
                    <p/>
                    <p>esteem —I might almost say the affection— which his sterling qualities s0
                        well merit. The Prime Minister.</p>
                    <p>What can TI say of my valued friend, Moustapha Febmy Pasha, with whom I have
                        been) for so many years on terms of intimate personal friendship? In the
                        first place, I can say that he is one of the most thorough gentlemen I
                        haveever met in my life. Perfect loyalty, straightforwardness, and
                        truthfulness have been conspicuous in every act of his life, In the second
                        place, I can say that, in a quiet, unobtrusive manner, he has rendered the
                        most valuable services to his countrymen. I feel that these very few remarks
                        do justice to his eminent qualities, or to the personal esteem in which I
                        hold him ; but I have still much to say,and I must be brief. Boutros Chali
                        Pasha.</p>
                    <p>Tt has been a great pleasure to me to be associated for so long with the
                        present Min- ister of Foreign Affairs, Boutros Ghali Pasha, whose versatile
                        intellect has been of the utmost service in solving many of the tangled
                        ques- tions to which the special political situation in this country so
                        frequently gives rise.</p>
                    <p>Sand Iagioul Pasha.</p>
                    <p>Lastly, gentlemen, I should like to mention the name of one with whom I have
                        only recently co-operated, but for whom, in that short time, I have learned
                        to entertain a high regard, Unless I am much mistaken, a career of great
                        public usefulness lies before the present Minister of Education, Saad
                        Zagloul Pasha He possesses all the qualities necessary to serve his country.
                        He is honest ; he is capable; he has the courage of his convictions; he has
                        been abused by many of the less worthy of his own countrymen. These are high
                        qualifications, He should go far.</p>
                    <p>European Coadjutors.</p>
                    <p>Of my European coadjutors, all I need say is that I thank them all most
                        heartily for the invaluable help and support which I have received from
                        them, under ciream stances of great difficulty. I cannot under- take to
                        mention all their names, but if there be any whose names deserve specially
                        to be cherished by the people of this country, they are, perhaps, Sir Colin
                        Scott-Moncrieff, Sir William Garstin, and their able subordinates, who have
                        given the Egyptians what they most of ail require—water, And to these I may
                        add th® name of a distinguished French- man, M, Maspero, whose erudite
                        researches into the past history of Egypt have rightly secured for him a
                        fame which is world- wide,</p>
                    <p>Sir Reginald Wingate.</p>
                    <p>Tastly, gentlemen, I wish to say that no part of my duties has interested me
                        more than that connected with the Sudan, It will al- ways be asdurce of
                        pride and satisfaction to me that I have been associated with Sir Reginald
                        Wingate and his zealous and capable coadjutors in the remarkable work of
                        regeneration which has for some years past been pro- ceeding in that
                        country,</p>
                    <p>The People's Gratitute.</p>
                    <p>With the help of those I have mentioned, and many others, we have, I think,
                        in spiteof many shortcomings, work here during the last quarter of a
                        century, T am often told that the Egyptians generally fail to show any great
                        amountof gratitude for the benefits which have unquestionably been conferred
                        upon them. I do not know what their feelings are in this respect, A French
                        philosopher once said something to this effect— T cannot quote the words
                        exactly,</p>
                    <p>"Lorsqu'un peuple a trop souffert c'est a peine qu'il a la force de remercier
                        ceux qui le sauve," and assuredly the people of Egypt in past times suffered
                        grievously. Whatever may be their feelings, I refuse to be reasoned out of
                        what, if it be a delusion, is at all events a noble delusion. I refuse to
                        believe that the Egyptians, or at all events the best amongst them, do not
                        recognize that it was the hand of western civilization, acting mainly,
