                        the month of September, and the results of my analyses indicate that it
                        performs to the standard for Pot Still Scotch Whisky set up in the London

                <p>LORD CROMER’S SPEECH.</p>
                <p>For the first time in her history Egypt has heard a great political speech. No
                    other termm can he applied to the clear concise and weighty pronouncement made by
                    Lord Cromer in reply to the address of the President of the Council of
                    Ministers, and there are many recent political speeches that been termed
                    great that suffer by comparison with Lord Cromer's words. True, we had expected
                    that the last speech delivered by the retiring British Ageut and Consul General
                    would be worthy of his reputation as a statesman and a scholar, but we confess
                    that we are as surprised as we were delighted that Lord Cromer, in spite of his
                    illness which had caused not a little apprehension among his more intimate
                    friends, before the demonstration in his honour should not only have vanquished
                    all physical obstacles but have achieved a notable oratorical triumph. His
                    speech was notornate but its every sentence was pointed and polished as a rapier.
                    There was none of the frills and furbelows of the platform : whether reviewing
                    the careers of great Egyptians of the put or dealing with the problems of the
                    future every word told, and when Lord Cromer the criticisms that have of
                    late been lavished on his policy, by a vigorous counterattack, the happy
                    combination of dignity, irony and wit, that has marked his previous speeches,
                    did not fail him. He carried the war with a vengeance into his opponents' camp :
                    we shall see what will he their defence against his vigorous assault. We have no
                    doubt that a few members of the audience did not share the views expressed by
                    the speaker and acclaimed by the</p>
                <p>majority of those present. But they cannot fail to have been impressed by the
                    greatness of the occasion and the importance of its cause, the personality of
                    the leading actor in a historic scene and the enthusiasm with which some of the
                    best elements in Egyptian society welcomed the chief captain of the forces of
                    progress now retiring from the scene of his labors and triumphs. A statesman
                    of ripe experience and proved courage, who had known the ruin of Ismail's days,
                    the weary task of reconstruction that followed Tel el Kebir, the long agony of
                    the Khartoum tragedy, the slow re-conquest of the lost land from barbarian
                    oppressors, who had met representatives of the East and the West on equal terms
                    in council or on the diplomatic battle field, addressed a gathering that felt
                    more than a passing emotion to think that in two more days Egypt would see no
                    more of the statesman who had re-created and enriched her. We do not deny the
                    able assistance that has been rendered to Lord Cromer in the past by his
                    colleagues and friends—many of whom we were glad to see around him on Saturday
                    night. No leader could afford to dispense frith the diplomacy of a Nubar, the
                    courage of a Riaz, the technical knowledge of a Garstin, when these high
                    qualities were placed at his service, famous words in the administrator's
                    armoury. But history will recognise that the wielder of these weapons, the one
                    man that could direct the workers of Egypt's regeneration was the officer of
                    artillery who became Earl of Cromer and virtual ruler of Egypt—once “the little
                    gunner” now "the Lord."</p>
                <p>Our readers will find in Lord Cromers farewell to Egypt what we may describe as
                    the “root of the whole matter,” the enunciation by a responsible statesman of
                    the two great factors of the present situation of Egypt, the continuance of the
                    Occupation and the control by the British Parliament of the general
                    administration of the country with the continuance of the present system of
                    Government. Friends and enemies alike will do well to ponder over this open and
                    Unambiguous declaration. The former will be encouraged by it to Like a more
                    optimistic view of the general state of affairs than has been recently the
                    fashion : the latter will do well to remember that it may be accounted romantic
                    and courageous to battle with feats but that common sense forbids the exhibition
                    of great sympathy with those who, unfortified by faith, injure themselves in the
                    vain attempt to move mountains. Moreover, we would urge tho critics in and out
                    of Egypt of Lord Cromers policy and administration to remember that they and
                    their criticisms are alike Lord Cromers creation. What would have been the fate
                    of some of our most rigorous critics of to-day in Ismail Pasha's days? Exile to
                    the Sudan or tho ruthless application of the grim maxim “stone dead hath no
                    fellow.’ What would be the fate of an editor w ho criticised a Turkish Pasha of
                    Egypt, with the virulence expended by a native journalist we might name on the
                    British Occupation ? Banishment to the Yemen or the khanjar of a wild cherkess.
                    Let them remember that the privileges and rights —free speech, free Press, free
                    meeting—which the Western world battled and bled for 400 years, have been
                    granted them through the representations of the great statesman whom they affect
                    to regard as a tyrant and that the educated Egyptian regards these things as
                    his unquestioned rights, and then —then let them speak of the “Tsar of Kasr el
                    Doubara. But time will only emphasise the verdict of the historians of to-day
                    and to those whom the future alarms we repeat the message of the great
                    pro-consul “Be of good courage.” union, courage, and truthfulness, such is Lord
                    Cromer's political testament to the heirs of his labour. Thankful for the great
                    example he has shown his fellow country men, who wish him long life, health, and
                    happiness in the mother country to which one of the most illustrious of her
                    sons is returning after life of toil in her service and in the service of
                    civilisation, progress, and humanity.</p>

Lord Cromer, arrived punctually at six o’clock and as ha stepped upon the platforpi the band of thd Inniskilling Fusiliers played “God Save the King.” The Sirdar then called for tlired cheers for Lord Cromer and this was responded to with unbounded enthusiasm.. The front row of the seats placed on the stage were occupied by Lord Cromer, Sir Eldon Gorst,1 Mustapha Pasha Fehmy, and Count dei Serionne.

                    <p>COUNT DE SERIONNE’S SPEECH</p>
                    <p>The first speech was delivered by Count de Serionne, who spoke inFrench to the* following eff ect:—</p>
                    <p>My Lord — The Committee of Honour, formed since^the day following the announcement of your vLordship’s approaching departure, represents, without distinction of nationality or residence, all those who, united in a deep feeling of regret and gratitude, desire to express to you with all sincerity the grief which they experience in witnessing you, for reasons of health, cut short a career closely associated for nearly thirty years with the establishment and realisation of every kind of progress, such as the prosperity of Egypt bears testimony to. His Excellency Mustapha Pasha Fehmy will address you in the name of the natives and the officials of the Egyptian Government As for me, I have to express to you, in the name of the Committee, whom I thank with all my heart for having entrusted to me this signal honour, the feelings of those who, without being attached to this country by bonds of nationality or officialdom, heartily testify tb you their regret and their gratitude.</p>
                    <p>It is not for me, gentlemen, to enumerate at this time the numberless services which Lord Cromer has rendered to this country since the day when he was called to collaborate in it§ administration as Commissionner of the Public Debt up tb the very hour at which he leaves us, surrounded/by a respectful admiration a thousand times more eloquent thah all the words which I could use in retracing a career which belongs to history It is not that I would feai, in recording the important acts which have marked Lord Cromer’s mission in Egypt, to go beyond the lines which have been traced for me Those in whose names I speak have profited, equally with the local subjects, by the infinite progress which makes this country one of the most prosperous regions of the world, and probably the most hospitable. It is their - right and duty, therefore, to associate them- selves with those who recapitulate to-day,</p>
                    <cols n="6"/>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>as a measure of their gratitude, the acts of a career made wonderful by the unity, intensity, an^ efficacy of the effort expended. I will not, however, enter into the details of the measures 'of every kind due to the prudent counsels of Lord Cromer, • which have, as we all know, gentlemen, permitted foreigners resident in this country to participate so largely in its prosperity, jn an atmosphere of safety and tolerance, the equivalent of which it would be difficult to find in other quarters of the Globe.</p>

                    <head>The Capitulations</head>
                    <p>Allow me, however, to allude reservedly to the great conception of a new organisation which Lord Cromer leaves to be carried out. You would, certainly, my Lord, be pleased that I should allow myself, unofficially and in no spirit of adulation, which would contrast strangely* with the ready sincerity W my words, to tell you that the various ^colonies of Egypt unreservedly hope for the (realisation of your views in this matter. But /what, at least, I feel myself fully authorised to declare is how much all of us, without excep-’ Uion, have been touched by the care with which ^ ou have, in preparing the project to which 4 refer, consul ted the wishes of the greatest humber; how greatly. you* have impressed {Europeans in this matter that it is your desire };o work with them for the more complete ^melioration of their material and moral standing.</p>
                    <p>$ Fear nothing, gentlemen, I will not trespass further upon a ground touching, whether one wills or not, on high politics. I do not forget that we are only met here, my Lord, to assure you, by a manifestation in which all ranks, jill classes, and all communities are united, at [lie moment when you are on the point of jeaving tlds beautiful land of Egypt, which /;ives so generously to man of its most precious treasures, that the intelligent and worthy gratitude is developed under a sun as bene-ficent as the products of the soil, offering to 4*ou in this hour, at once sad and sweet, the idlest harvest in which you could rejoice.</p>

                    <head>Lady Cromer.</head>
                    <p>Allow me also to associate with your name, lb qnr expression of regret and respectful Sympathy, the name of her who has so well Iteconded by her charm and her inexhaustible fjharity the necessarily severest qualities which Jjave been evident in your mission—a gracious Associate in the efforts which have each day li.eeii expended abundantly for the prosperity rif the country. I/idy Cromer will ever live in rtnr memories as the living imago of goodness, theessantly tending, as kind consolator, the jjpisery and the sufferings of the poor. It is to {j|er as much its to you that we address our Lushes from the depths of our hearts for the ^ establishment of ybur health.

                        <p>$ Gentlemen, I have firirehed ; but Lord jfcomer will certainly allow me to add two p/ords only, at the risk of exceeding for a poment the established order of the pro- lamme I have just spoken in the name of J|ie committee which id constituted as I have -(ready indicated. My mandate is ended, 4it, however, my Lord, it appears to me that J would not have fulfilled in entirety my fission if I did not offer for the homage of bother committee, which has done me the reat honour of appointing me president. It is imposed of European notables of Cairo not dding aiiy official position, but it decided give preference to the manifestation which is organised after it had been constituted— manifestation more general, and more fitted offer the homage which is your due. I will |Cot, therefore, make in the name of this committee a second speech ; which would be but prepetition of that which I have just delivered (♦lie truth is one, and all the resources of fpetoric which I might apply to vary, more or less happily, the phrases destined to express dnr sentiments, would not be able to add to pose two words which are alone of moment i nd which you will always remember, (we fisk it of you, my Lord as we shall guard them 1lithfully in ours) regret and gratitude. If, however, I have abused my position of official Sitor in putting before you this private ,itiative, it is because it has seemed to me hat it would, perhaps, enhance the tribute Ihich I have been bidden to offer to you. </p>

                    <p>My second word is more personal It seems to e my Lord that it would be impossible for e to conclude, after having spoken in the ime of those who have entrusted to me the ipression of their feelings, without expressing lie highest degree of pleasure that this honour iiould be confided to a Frenchman. It appears Ity me that I would be ungrateful if I did not | jiblicly say to my colleagues ot the committee Ijhich I represent, bow much I feel the delicate Intention which has dictated the choice of one R[TO should address a statesman of the foremost rtnk before those who have more efficaciously Wntribnted to what is so fittingly named the Entente Cordiale”.</p>

                        <p>Tie enthusiasm of the audience had risen to its utmost pitch, and amidst immense and prolonged applause Count de Serionne resumed bis seat. Lord Cromer then rose and replied (in French) as follows :—</p>
                        <p>Coup? and gentlemen : My only regret at this morr.ent is ndt to possess a sufficient knowledge of tlie beautiful French language to be able to express to yon in a fitting manner all the feeling of my heart. All the same I would ask you to believe, Count, that I thank you most rely, as much from my own part as from that of Lady Cromer, for the more than kind words which you have just uttered. What shall I say, gentlemen, to the welcome which you have so kindly given me by the flattering uh of Count de Serionne ? Words fail me.</p>
                        <p>I cat cnly say that it is to me a revelation to know that I have so many indulgent friends up to this moment. What touohes me especially, gentlemen, is that this meeting oan be considered, as I believe it to be, of a truly inter national character. I hope that I may be allowed to draw this conclusion from it: that notwithstanding the inevitable and very considerable difficulties which the position which 1 have occupied for twenty four years presents,
                            I have not shown myself, in the opinion of several who are certainly able to form a sound opinion, to be a too bad internationalist. Indeed, gentlemen, I have always told lyself that it was my first duty to do my utmost to safeguard the interests of my own ceun :ry and of Egypt. I put Great Britain and Egyptrin the same category because I refuse to consider them apart. I uphold that, once well understood, the interests of these two countries absolutely identical. But, gentlemen, beyond my quality of Englishman or Anglo-Egyptian,
                            I have never, I hope, forgotten that 1 am at the same time an European. The well-being of the numerous and important European communities in this couutry is an Egyptian interest and therefore a British interest of the first order. It is with the thorough conviction of the truth of this fact that I leave Egypt, and if opportunity and necessity arise I will not fail to raise my voice in its defence. In thanking you again, gentleman, from the bottom of my heart I beg you to excuse the brevity of these few observations ; I am shortly going to have the honour of expressing myself in English. *

                        <head>THE PREMIER'S SPEECH</head>
                        <p>On the conclusion of Lord Cromer’s speech, which was most heartily applauded, Mustapha Pasha Fehmy, President of the Council of Mini.nters, rose and, speaking in French, said:—</p>
                        <p>My Lord : —Allow me to express to your Lordship, in the name of the Government and of the great majority of the Egyptian people, the sincere regret which your departure causes them—a regret all the keener in that your departiire i8 necessitated by the state of your health, sacrificed in the constant and excessive labour which your attachment to this country and your fervent desire to incessantly contribute to its welfare have imposed upon you. Egyp’; cannot forget, my Lord, that it is to the moat prudent counsels, to the help and supper: which you have given her, that she owes x transformation which evokes a general feeling of admiration. It is for history to tell and to appreciate all the progress realised by this country. I only wish to emphasise that the fellah has felt the benefits of the accomplished transformation, and has participated above all others in the general prosperity. By the raising of her moral and material condition she has been able to experience happy days. It is to this work, my Lord, that your name will be attached, and it is this which claims to-day and will always assure the sincere and deep gratitude of Egypt. Allow me also, to express our regrets to Lady Cromer, to her who, by her goodness and her charity, has gained the hearts of the misfortunate, to whom she has given relief and comfort and who has thus merited general gratitude. My Lord, you have ’sincerely loved our Egypt you have eonseorated to it the best years of your life ; we are then confident of the continuance , of that goodwill of which you have given such constant proof, and, in testifying to you our deep a,flection, allow us to consider you always s one of us.</p>

                            I must, ask you to receive the remarks I am about to make with some indulgence. It is, indeed, a considerable effort for me, both morally and physically, to address you at all— physically, because I have to muster all my strength in order to do so ; morally, because I am fairly overwhelmed by all the great kindness which I have received, from all classes during the last few weeks, and because it costs me a very bitter pang to part finally with a country where I have so many friends, and with which all the incidents of my pulilic career, as well as the joys and sorrow! of my domestic life, have been close-ly connected for well nigh a generation of men. I am leaving, gentlemen, not for any political ieasons, but because the hand of time has begun to press hardly upon me ; because, after iri»rly half a century spent in the public</p>

                        <p>Before dealing with other matters, I should like to say a few wonls in reply to the graceful allusions which both tlie Count de Serionne and the President of the Council have made to the lady who has been my helpmate, and which have touched me—and, I am sure I may add, her—very deeply. I might wax very eloquent on this theme, but, for obvious reasons, will exercise some control over my feelings. I confine myself to saying that, whilst I was listening to the two sjpeeches we have just beard, I felt a strong desire to change places with the speakers. I should have preferred to eulogise Lady Cromer, rather than to reply to very flattering remarks which have been made about myself. Petbaps I may take this opportunity of saying that one of the objects which Lady Cromer haw had most nearly at heart has been to assist/in common with other philanthropic ladies, in arresting the terrible infant mortality in this country. I venture to express a hope that thin work, which has been well begun, will not in future be neglected.</p>

I will only say that I have always felt that I have had much more than my share of public praise for whatever good has recently been done in this country. I could have effected nothing without the hearty cooperation of others—Egyptian and European,— my own countrymen anil those of other nationalities.</p>

I do not doubt that, in tlie course Of the twenty-four years during which I have held my present post, I have made many mistakes, and possibly I may have incurred some enmities; but your presence here this afternonn is, I hope, a sufficient proof that I have also contracted many friendships.

In tho first place, I should like to say a word or two of one to whom, in my opinion, the public have never,! as yet, done sufficient justice. I allude to the late Khedive, his Highness Tewfik PasBa. Gentlemen, I am not going to use the language of empty compliment, or to employ conventional phrases What I say, I mean. Tejwfik Pasha understood his country and his Countrymen well. He constituted an admirable link between the reformers, whose zeal he at times tempered, and the people, whose ultra conservative fears of reform he used his influence to allay. History will be unjust if it does not accord to Tewfik Pasha a somewhat important niche ii the Valhalla of oriental potentates. He did not himself take any very active part in the regeneration of Egypt, but he was wise enough to encourage and support those who were working for its regeneration.</p>

                    <p>What can I say of my valued friend, Moustapha Fehmy Pasha, with whom I have been for so many years on terms of intimate personal friendship ? In the first place, I can say that he is one of the most thorough gentlemen I have ever met in my life. Perfect loyalty, straightforwardness, and truthfulness have been conspicuous in every act of his life. In the second place, I can say that, in a quiet, unobtrusive manner, he has rendered the most valuable services to his countrymen. I feel that these very tew remarks scarcely do justice to his eminent qualities, or to the personal esteem in which I hold him ; but I have still much to say, and I must be brief.</p>

Unless I am much mistaken, a career of great public usefulness lies before the present Minister of Education, Saad Zagloul Pasha He possesses all the qualities necessary to serve his country.

I cannot undertake to mention all their names, but if there he any whose names deserve specially to be cherished by the people of this country, they are, perhaps, Sir Colin Scott-Moncrieff, Sir William Garstin, and their able subordinates, who have given the Egyptians what they most of all require—water.

                    <p>With the help of those I have mentioned, and many others, >re have, I think, in spite of many shortcomings, done a good piece of work here during the last quarter of a century. I am bften told that the Egyptians generally fail to show any great amount of gratitude for the benefits which I have unquestionably been conferred upon them. I do not know what their feelings are in this respect. A French philosopher once said something to this effect— I cannot quote the words exactly.</p>
                    <p>“Lorsqu’uu peuple a trop souffert e’est peine qu’il a la force de remercier ceux qui le sauve,” and assuredly the people of Egypt past times suffered grievously. Whatever may be their feelings, I refuse to bo reasoned out of what, if it he a delusion, is at all events noble delusion. I refuse to believe that the Egyptians, or at all events the best amongst them, do not recognize that it was the hand of western civilization, acting mainly, during the last twenty five years, tllrvsgh the instrumentality of England, that raised them from the slough of despond in which their lot was formerly cast, and pointed out to them the way which leads to material prosperity and to moral elevation of thought. And if, which far from being the case, I were convinced that the present generation does not recognize this manifest truth, I should still cherish the hope that their posterity will do so.

                    <p>The main political object I kept in view was to contribute to the restoration of that good understanding between France and England udiich the force of circumstances, rather than any intentions or ambitions on the part of the rulers of populations of either country, had</p>

Gambetta, whose masterful iriil during the period he was in office exercised an abiding effect on the course of Egyptian history, otice said to his countrymen, “Ne rompez jamais avec l’alliance anglaue." My creed in international politics, which is, I believe, shared by a large number oL-iny couibtrymen, may almost be summed up in the {phrase, “Ne rompez jamais avec l’entente frta^aise.” This entente, to which Count de Serionne has alluded in sympathetic terms, • is lwwod on common interest^ on close neighbourhood, on community of political institutions, on the mutual respect acquired by past rivalry in on many a well-fought field, and on a recognition of the fact that the characteristics and qualities of the two nations serve as a complement to each other. Further, itthi?fctens le ; it is based on a common desire to maintain the peace of the world. If ever there were two nations marked out by the force of circumstances to be friends, they are certainly
                        France and England.

                    <p>Well, gentlemen, it was clear; to the merest tyro in diplomacy that, so long as this Egyptian sore continued to rankle, that, friendship would necessarily be impaired; Therefore,when I came to Egypt in 1883, 1 determined, so far as the limited sphere of my action enabled to do so, to use my utmost endeavours to repair the breach. It was a long, uphill work. For years the two natioils looked at each other askance—comme chu\r chunt de faiencet os our French friends would say. We exchanged some hard, but fortunately, only verbal knocks. I came in (for my fair share of them. There was a time vhen my name rarely mentioned in a French newspaper without the addition of some rather uncomplimentary epithet, of which, I think, “ le brutal Cromer ” was that which was most commonly used. Indeed, if I remember rightly, I was on one occasion likened to the most bloodthirsty of heathen gods. I was termed Moloch. These journalistic amenities, which give zest and life to political discussion, need not be taken too seriously, more especially as they are now, happily, things of the past. Recently, I have been on more than one occasion termed, “ cet illustre vteijlard, ’’which clearly denotes a change of tone.</p>

                    <p>Seriously, however, gentlemen, 1 did my best for many years to lead up to an understanding between the two nations, and I may say that one of the happiest days of my Egyptian career was April 8th, 1904, when the Ang?o-Frenth Agreement was signed. I do not> of course, r one moment, claim to have boon one of the principal authors of that Agreement. The chief merit of its conclusion lies with the statesmen w|io conducted the foreign affairs of either country, in Paris and in London, and also, 1 trust I may be allowed to add without dis-respect, with tlie talented sovereign whom I have had the privilege to serve. But I think 1 may go so far as to say that the continuous efforts made, by all concerned, in Egypt, over a series of years, to avoid unnecessary friction, and to deal in a frank and friendly spirit with any small grievances which arose out of the fact of the British occupation of Egypt, payed the way to a settlement, and facilitated the
work of the negotiators.
