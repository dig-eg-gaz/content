                    <head>RUSSIA TO-DAY.</head>
                    <p>What has happened in Russia, what it happening, and what is likely to happen
                        form the components of a problem. The sudden resolution of any constituent
                        elements, like the subsidence of some huge structure of masonry, must always
                        be accompanied by a vast amount of destruction through the mutual concussion
                        of its various parts. What we are witnessing in Russia at the present moment
                        is not so much revolution, <cb n="4"/> which implies arms and a leader, as
                        the violent disintigration of an impossible union of anta- gonistic and
                        ill-assorted materials.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, we have had bloody massacres and even battles in which people,
                        bureaucratic agents, intellectuals, industrials, revolutionists, sailors,
                        soldiers, socialists have been engaged in almost indiscriminate destruction,
                        inspired, amidst the sudden strophy of centralised government, either by
                        predatory lust or by an anthusiasm for the particular social or religious
                        theory they have adopted and made their own. And, remmeber, there is not in
                        the wide world a more fanatical theorist than the half-educa- ted Russian.
                        There would be a better prospect of the emergence of a Liberal Constitution
                        if the various elements of disorder were in rough and ready agreement with
                        one another. When, however, the political and economic machinery of the
                        empire was suddenly put out of gear, the shock threw every one off their
                        mental and moral balance, and while the Government cannot cope forcibly with
                        the new tactics of the revolutionaries, and re-establish the status quo by
                        arms, there is not sufficient revolu- tionary cohesion for an encounter,
                        corps a corps, with the still concrete fact of bureaucratic reaction.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless so much has been gained that a fire has been kindled which,
                        although it may smolder, can never be put out. The revolution has discovered
                        a power before which all the force of Tsardom is important. And even should
                        chaotic extravagance of thought and action and lack of cohesion conduce to a
                        temporary check of the Liberal movement and the withdrawal or nullification
                        of the privileges obtained, it has amply proved the temper of its weapons,
                        and can look with confidence to the future.</p>
                    <p>Now, it is precisely for this smouldering of the fire that the bureaucratic
                        power has been watching and waiting, trusting for ultimate salvation to the
                        stomach to drive the revolu- tionary spirit of the great strike movement
                        back to the paths of subordination and wage- earning labour.</p>
                    <p>In the forefront of bureaucratic oppression, the influence which, like a
                        heavy stone impos- ed upon grass, has for many generations dwarf- ed and
                        stunted the moral and material deve- lopment of the Russian people, has been
                        the foreign ambition of their masters. In the inte- rests of these they have
                        been sacrificed, rob- bed bled; and the prospects of genuine reform are
                        inseperably bound up with the inaugura- tion of a moderate, unambitious, and
                        economic foreign policy which, on the basis of good rela- tions with all,
                        will permit the fullest concen- tration of national energy on the moral and
                        economic regeneration of the race. What is happening in Russia to-day is no
                        more than a reflection of what took place in this land of Egypt several
                        thousand years ago; and the Pharaoh of the Neva will prove as obdurate of
                        heart as his prototype of the Nile, until, in the fulness of time, the fire-
                        which naught can quench- will burst forth once more, with furious
                        finality.</p>
                    <p>It has been frequently asked whether, and to what extent, the Russian
                        peasantry have been affected by revolutionary teaching and principles. This
                        is a very material question, because until the Russian proletariat is ready
                        to think, speak, and act in unison there can be no revolution, in the
                        fullest sense of the term. At the present day, however, there is no material
                        for a Jacquerie- and if active revolution is to come, and the events of the
                        last few days at Sevastopol look as though it has come with a vengence, it
                        will be brought about by a revolt of the sons of the people in the armies of
                        the Tsar.</p>

                            <p>Things in Russia are undoubtedly going from bad to worse. There are
                                rumours to-day that a great coup d’etat has taken place at St.
                                Petersburg, and large numbers of Cossacks are said to be assembling
                                in the Capital.</p>
                            <p>A great run on the savings banks through- out the country is taking
                                place, and there exists a general financial panic.</p>

                            <p>Reuter's Agency learns from St. Petersburg that the attitude of the
                                Government is consi- dered as suicidal, playing into the hands of
                                the revolutionaries. Financial and commercial circles are aghast.
                                There was a further heavy drop in prices both at St. Petersburg and
                                at Moscow yesterday. It is openly declared in the Bourse and
                                elsewhere that the days of the present regime are numbered.</p>

                            <p>When the garrison of Fort Peter and Paul assembled for roll call, the
                                artillery demanded the immediate release of the electrical students
                                arrested on the 29th November. This demand was transmitted to the
                                Commandant of the fortress, who complied.</p>
                            <p>It is officially confirmed that the loyal troops have captured the
                                barracks occupied by the mutineers at Sevastopol. 2,000 of these
                                with quick-firing guns have surrendered. The cruiser Otchakoff is
                                gutted, but is still floating. The town is not damaged.</p>
                            <p>A number of Guardsmen have been arrested at Tzarskoe Selo for
                                presenting demands ob- jecting to being obliged to act as police. It
                                is reported that the mutineers at Sevastopol have regained the upper
                                hand.</p>

                            <p>It is rumoured that a Grand Duke partici- pated in a plot against the
                                Tsar. There are some indications of conspiracy of the officers of
                                the Guards, but it is impossible to say defi- nitely whether any
                                Grand Duke participated. Officials, however, admit the reports of
                                grave events at Tzarskoe Selo.</p>

                    <head>THE SUCRERIES MEETING OF CREDITORS.</head>
                    <p>The meeting of the creditors of the Societe des Sucreries et de la Raffinerie
                        d'Egypte, postponed from Thursday last, took place yesterday at the Mixed
                        Courts, Cairo. At 3.15 p.m. <persName>Judge Tuck</persName> opened the
                        proceedings by stating that he had received communications from cultivators
                        in Upper Egypt hoping that the Sucreries Co. would continue to exist. He
                        then read a letter which he had received from the directors of the Sucreries
                        Company, who criticized the last report of the experts on two
                        grounds-firstly, the though it had been agreed that a copy of the report
                        prepared by <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q386694">Sir
                            William Willcocks</persName>, <persName>Fourneron Bey</persName>, and
                            <persName>Professor Sampaolo</persName> should be put into the hands of
                        the board of directors 48 hours before the meeting of creditors convoked
                        under the concordat preventif, the members of the board were not, as a
                        matter of fact, supplied therewith, and were in consequence compelled to
                        hear its criticisms in silence, unable to offer a prepared defence. The
                        criticisms of the ex- perts who had two months' time to prepare their attack
                        reached the public, through the medium of the press, unbalance by the
                        defence which the directors would otherwise have been in a position to
                        offer. Secondly, they protested against the excessive animus that marked the
                        criticisms passed on the administration of the company by the three
                        experts.</p>
                    <p><persName>Judge Tuck</persName>, in reply, stated that on the first occasion
                        when the report was to be read, the three experts found themselves unable to
                        complete it in time to deliver a copy to the representatives of the
                        Sucreries Company forty- eight hours before the meeting of the creditors
                        took place. The legal representative of the company was warned but demanded
                        no post- ponement. No engagement was entered into the delivery of a copy
                        forty-eight hours in advance on any later occasion.</p>
                    <p><persName>The Judge</persName> then called upon <persName
                            ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q21334364">M. Zigliara</persName>,
                        the clerk of the court, to read the correspon- dence that had arisen re the
                        letter written by <persName>Me. Fatica</persName> and addressed to
                            <persName>Judge Tuck</persName> on the subject of the Ibrahimieh
                        Ploughing Company. The correspondence consisted of the experts' answer to
                            <persName>Me. Fatica</persName> and a com- munication from the board of
                        the Sucreries Co. on the same subject, with a covering letter from the
                            <persName>Hon. A.J. Davey</persName>.</p>
                    <p>The correspondence having been read <persName

                            Wiart</persName> mentioned the results of the Sucreries shareholders'
                        extraordinary general meeting of the Saturday last and stated that certain
                        further delays in the acceptance of the proposals made under the concordat
                        pre- ventif were inevitable owing to the appoint- ment of <persName>MM.
                            Letort</persName> and Cozziks, who were to study these proposals and
                        watch the nego- tiations connected therewith on behalf of the shareholders
                        at Paris and at Cairo respectively. These gentlemen had not been as of yet
                        able to come to an entirely satisfactory arrangement with one another and
                        the board would not be able to bring its proposals before the court till
                        Monday or Tuesday next. He in conse- quence asked for a postponement during
                        which the verification of the claims of the creditors could be made or at
                        least begun, and the meeting was in consequence adjourned till Tuesday and
                        Saturday next.</p>

                    <head>CAIRO IMPROVEMENTS. THE GHEZIREH BRIDGE.</head>
                    <p>Another new bridge is to be built across the Nile, the Government having
                        decided on the construction of a magnificent structure to unite Boulac and
                        Ghezireh. The work will be taken in hand shortly.</p>
                    <p>The new bridge will be twenty metres in width and will form a most convenient
                        connect- ing link between the centre of Cairo and the fashionable new suburb
                        of Ghezireh by the Boulac avenue. The Ghezireh quarter will thus soon form
                        an integral portion of the Capital, especially as a double line of tramway
                        is to be laid across the river. The Ghezireh end of the bridge will be about
                        two metres to the north of the Ghezireh Palace Hotel and will divide the
                        estate of the Egyptian Hotels Company in two parts.</p>
                    <p>It is obvious that with the universal tend- ency of all great
                        cities-Alexandria being on of the very few exceptions to the general rule-
                        to extend, so far as concerns their fashionable quarters, in a westerly
                        direction, Ghezireh is inevitably destined to become the "Champs Elysees" of
                        the Capital of Egypt. The only drawback to the development of Ghezireh has
                        been its distance from the centre of the city, but this will be now entirely
                        obviated by the new bridge, which will bring it in direct communica- tion
                        with the centre of Cairo.</p>

                    <head>THE SAMANOUD AFFAIR. TRUE VERSION OF INCIDENT.</head>
                    <p>As certain exaggerated statements have been published with regard to a
                        disturbance at Sa- manoud, Gharbieh province, we are glad to be able to give
                        the true account of the concurrence there, which we have from official
                        sources.</p>
                    <p>It appears that on the morning of the 27th November, a telegram from a number
                        of Copts and Europeans reached the moudirieh head- quarters, stating that a
                        number of Muslims had insulted the Christian religion by holding a mock
                        funeral, imitating the officiating priest and cross-bearer.</p>
                    <p>On enquiries being made it proved that seven men of the lowest class had
                        insulted both Christian and Muslim religions. On the morn- ing of the 27th
                        they entered the El Adawi- mosque, interrupted prayers, and created a great
                        disturbance. After leaving the mosque they indulged in a travesty of a
                        Christian funeral, and having insulted both religions found themselves
                        pursued by the police.</p>
                    <p>five have been arrested and have confessed their guilt. The remaining members
                        of the gang are the object of careful search.</p>

                        came on for bearing yesterday morning before <persName>Judge
                            Cator</persName> at the British Consular Court in Cairo. <persName>Major

                        the lower Court for loss of goods pilfered from luggage which he had
                        entrusted to the defendant firm to forward from Cairo to London. Against
                        this decision the defendants appealed, but the judge dismissed the appeal
                        with costs.</p>
                    <p>The case was made interesting by several points of public interest, amongst
                        which was the fact that the plaintiff had insured his luggage against marine
                        risks only and for a sum inferior to the amount of his claim.</p>

                        <p>The meeting of the Railway Institute F.C. and F. Co. of the K.R.R. on
                            Tuesday, proved to be a capital game. The slight rain which fell in the
                            forenoon had no effect on the ground,- if anything it improved it. The
                            railway men's full team turned out to opposed their antagon- ists. From
                            the very start off and all through the first half the home team were the
                            superior XI., and they were continually attacking the visitors'
                            custodian. The consequence was, that when the first half terminated, the
                            railway men had 5 goals to their credit. In the second half F. Co.
                            struggled with the desperate energy, and by the 'cute understanding of
                            the left wing pair, managed to score a couple of goals. Thus the Railway
                            Institute were left the victors by 5 goals to 2. Mr. Allport was the
                            referee.</p>

                    <docAuthor>By Sir Handury Brown, K.C.M.G., late Inspector-General of Irrigation
                        in Lower Egypt, and formly in Upper Egypt.</docAuthor>
                    <head>VI.</head>
                    <p>The preceding articles have dealt with the considerations which affect the
                        designing of a canal projet. After the designing comes con- struction, and
                        after construction the use of the works to serve the end for which they were
                        designed and constructed. To one class of engineers the construction period
                        is the only one that is interesting; and, no doubt, the satisfaction of
                        seeing an important work grown under one's hands is a solid one. Moreover,
                        the "gallery" applauds, and honors are distributed when a work of suffi-
                        cient importance to attract the attention of the public is successfully
                        brough to a comple- tion; and there is satisfaction also in that, though not
                        so solic. All the world, for instance, has heard of the Assonouan dam,
                        though many have very inaccurate ideas as to whom should be given the credit
                        of the original conception of the design and of the actual construction. But
                        the dam is there, whoever fathered it, and it is doing its duty , regarding
                        which little will be known by any but those who are specially in- terested
                        in Egypt and watch its further develop- ment. Fortunate, indeed, is the
                        engineer whose duties comprehend the work of each of the three period of
                        design, construction and administra- tion, and who has the satisfaction of
                        converting his design into material structures, and of using them to produce
                        prosperity among the people for whose benefit they were designed.</p>
                    <p>Already, in the first article, a list has been given of the different
                        descriptions of works that an irrigation engineer has to design, con- struct
                        and utilise. They are many and various. The ordinary principles and methods
                        of con- struction apply to most of them. But from among them there may be
                        selected as belonging peculiarly to the province of the irrigation engineer
                        such masonry works as high dams to create storage reservoirs, anicuts and
                        barrages to raise the summer level of rivers, canal head- works to control
                        the main supply; also syphons, aqueducts, super-passages, to carry one
                        watercourse past another; and lastly navigation locks. Most of these would
                        have their founda- tion level below the lowest water level, and would
                        present more or less difficulty of con- struction according to the nature of
                        the foundation bed and the strength of springs over the foundation area. The
                        ordinary method of getting in the foundations is to surround the area of
                        operations by banks to exclude the outside water, and to get rid of the
                        inside water by pumping. The concrete is then laid, so to speak, "in the
                        dry," an expression not to be understood literally, as where springs are
                        working the conrete may have to be laid in about a foot of water. This was
                        the method of construction adopted in the case of the Assiout barrage,
                        lately built in Upper Egypt simultane- ously with the Assouan dam. The
                        advantage of this method over others is that all the work done is in sight
                        at the time of execution. But it has this disadvantage- that, unless the
                        springs are intelligently and skilfully treated defects in the floor will be
                        created by the water forcing its way either under or through the floor. It
                        happens sometimes that the super- vising staff has not the experience
                        necessary for successfully dealing with the springs, but gains it as the
                        work proceeds, so that the first season's work is not without its mistakes.
                        The principle to be observed in dealing with springs is that no attempt
                        should be made to stop them working until they have been surrounded on all
                        sides by masonry of sufficient strength to resisit the efforts of the spring
                        to find a new outlet through it. If the cement concrete, which forms the
                        bottom layer of the foundation platform, is advanced from one extremity of
                        the work in an even line towards the other, the springs will form runs for
                        themselves through the unset edge of the concrete layer. And, as it
                        advances, more and more springs will assert themselves in the same way,
                        until there is a strong outflow along the advancing edge of the concrete,
                        due to the combined action of all the springs, except such as have forced
                        their way sideways to the margins of the concrete layer; where they will
                        continue to work. The cementing material of the con- crete will thus be
                        washed away as soon as it is laid and runs will thus be formed under and
                        through the foundation platform, which will give trouble afterwards. The way
                        to avoid this is carefully to locate all springs, and, as the concrete
                        advances, to carry it all round them, but not over them. As the springs will
                        continue to work, their water must be led away in pipes, or chan- nels al
                        set masonry, over or through the con- crete layers, until they are
                        completely surroun- ded by masonry too strong for them to burst through.
                        They can then be forcibly stopped with safety, and they will be powerless to
                        work <cb n="2"/> harm. The methods of dealing with springs vary in detail
                        with the ingenuity of those in charge of the work, but the guiding principle
                        is the same with all, namely to attempt no violence to the spring till
                        sufficient forces are marshalled all round it to compel submission.</p>
                    <p>The disadvantages of putting in foundations with strong springs in action
                        over the founda- tion bed have caused other methods to be resorted to. In
                        India the method of getting in foundations by well-sinking is in favor, and
                        has repeatedly been employed with much success. Circular or rectangular
                        wells are built on well- curbs which rest on the sand at the natural
                        water-level, or at the level to which it may be judged convenient to lower
                        the water by pumping. The wells are weighted, and the sand excavated from
                        within by special plant, so that the wells sink below water level as the
                        excavation continues. More height is added to them and teh sinking is conti-
                        nued till the bottom of the well has reached the required depth. The
                        superstructure is afterwards built on a platform covering the wells.</p>
                    <p>There is also the method of getting in foundations by the help of compressed
                        air. which, however, has not been much used in irrigation work in India or
                        Egypt. It requires special plant and labour skilled in the pro- cess, as
                        there are dangers attending its em- polyment by untrained hands.</p>

                    <head>MARRIAGE STILL POPULAR.</head>
                    <p>Dr. Prinzing, of Berlin, denies that the number of bachelors and old maids is
                        increas- ing in Europe. As a matter of fact, says the "Daily Telegraph," he
                        states that marriage is decreasing only in Sweden, France, and Ireland. In
                        Germany the number of bachelors steadily decreases, and only in certain
                        limited areas can any increase of old maids be found.</p>

                    <p>Monte Carlo has just put in force a most important scheme to tax all
                        foreigners engaged in business in the principality. A large num- ber of
                        licences granted during the summer are being held back. If the new rule is
                        made retrospective it will affect all English limited liability companies,
                        besides a large number of English, French, Italian, and German mer- chants
                        and shopkeepers. Villa holders may also be liable to taxation.</p>

                    <p>Pe-ru-na, Used as a last resort, cured her of a severe attack of Catarrh of
                        the lungs.</p>
                    <p>The sensational care of Mrs. Caldwell is the talk of her acquaintances.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Ida Caldwell, 506 Pearl street, Sioux City, Ia., Vice-President Order of
                        Washington, writes:</p>
                    <p>"I suffered with catarrh of the res- piratory organs off and on for the last
                        three years until I thought it was chronic. My chest and lungs were ir-
                        ritated and I had to use the greatest care not to expose myself to chilly
                        air or dampness as it increased my troubles.</p>
                    <p>"My physician advised me to try a change of climate, but I was unable to
                        leave my family. Reading of the won- derful cures performed by Peruns, I
                        bought a bottle.</p>
                    <p>"It was with the greatest satisfaction that I found it the one medicine among
                        them all which cured me. I was re- lieved within three days and after two
                        months and a half the irritation was gone, my lungs perfectly healed and my
                        health restored." -Ida Caldwell.</p>
                    <p>Thousands of women owe their lives to Peruna. Hundreds of thousands owe their
                        health to Peruna. Hundreds of thousands are praising Peruna in every state
                        of the Union.</p>
                    <p>We have many thousands of letters from grateful women, with permission to use
                        them in public print, which can never be used for want of space.</p>
                    <p>Catarrh would not be such a curse in this country if the people thuroughly
                        understand its nature. It must be treated at once to prevent it from mak-
                        ing inroads upon vital organs.</p>
                    <p>If you suffer from catarrh, buy Pe- runa to-day, for a day gained on the
                        enemy, catarrh, means a day nearer recovery.</p>

                    <p>For special directions everyone should read "The Ils of Life," a copy of

                            not on the Share Registers of the Company, are reminded that if they
                            wish to attend this General Meeting of the Company, they must first
                            deposit their Bearer Warrants, together with a statement in writing of
                            their names and addresses, at the Registered Offices of the Company in
                            London two clear days before the date of the General Meeting, viz., not
                            later than the <date when="1905-12-10">18th December, 1905</date>. The
                            Share Warrants remaining so deposited until after the General Meeting
                            shall have been held. Each Depositor will receive a Certificate of
                            Deposit in exchange for the Share Warrants deposited, which must be
                            produced by the Holders attending the Meeting.</p>
                        <p>The Directors have to report that in consequence of the extension of the
                            Company's system by the construction of new lines, and by the absorption
                            of other railway companies, the work entailed in preparing the Accounts
                            has so increased as to render it impossible to prepare the Balance Sheet
                            and Revenue Accounts in time to complete the Audit and the Directors'
                            Report for the Annual General Meeting, which, in conformity with the
                            Companies Acts, must be held during 1905. It is therefore the intention
                            of the Directors, at the General Meeting, which this notice convenes, to
                            submit a formal resolution of adjournment of the Meeting until 30th
                            January, 1906, at hich adjournment the business referred to on the
                            Notice will be transacted.</p>
                        <p>In view of the above, and as the present Financial Year of the Company
                            closes during the busiest season of the year, it is considered necessary
                            to alter the date of closing from 30th September to 31st March. A
                            Half-Yearly Report and Statement of Accounts will therefore be issued in
                            1906 as at 31st March, after which they will be issued annually.</p>

                    <byline>(From our own Correspondent).</byline>
                    <dateline>London, <date when="1905-11-24">November 24</date>.</dateline>
                    <p>I find it hard to see the exact reason of all the pother of "resignation" and
                        "dissolution" that has come about. The ordinary course of events might well
                        have entailed a dissolution early in next session. What has happened to
                        hasten that course of precipitate a "crisis"? Mr. Chamberlain has enunciated
                        no views that he was not well known to entertain, nor does there seem any
                        crying need for instant action that would be distrubing to many and
                        agreeable to few. All politics are constantly on the knees of the gods, and
                        all things are possible. But, judging by such signs as are plain to see,
                        many thoughts that occupy many minds may by the offspring of prolific Father
                        Wish.</p>

                    <p>A movement is on foot among leading men in Great Britain and Germany to
                        promote a better understanding between the two countries. A committee has
                        been formed, and a meeting is arranged to take place next week at
                        Westminster, at which Lord Avebury will preside. Amongst those who have
                        signified their intention of being present are the Bishop of Southwark, Lord
                        Stanmore, Sir Michael Foster, Sir Ernest Tritton, M.P., Sir John Kennaway,
                        M.P., and the Rev. Dr. Horton, President of the Free Church Counsil. An
                        address expressing the desire for a more cordial feeling between the two
                        nations has been signed by a number of influential gentlemen. Similar action
                        taken by public men in Germany is being equally well supported.</p>

                    <p>It seems more like centuries than years since we have been groaning under the
                        "made in Germany," "made in Holland," "made in Austria" labels. And what was
                        at first a fund of Jocosity for the self confessedly comic papers has long
                        been diagnosed as a grave peril to trade, industry, and employment. This,
                        then, is an auspicious moment for the birth of that "British-made League,"
                        to which I offer me best wishes for success. The name of the League explains
                        its ideals and activities. It is actuated by the large hope of gaining the
                        support of so many people as to enable it to <q>regain employment for the
                            thousands who are now workless, owing to foreign competition in articles
                            which could be made at home.</q></p>

                    <p>Apart from other uses of the Motor-car Exhibition just opened at Olympia, it
                        has served once more to emphasise the remarkable progression- geometrical
                        rather than arithmetical- of this great industry. As Mr. Arthur Stanley
                        pointed out, the cars now running in the United Kingdom represent a value of
                        some fifteen millions sterling, and the prospects for the future promise a
                        more than proportionate increase. The motor-car has now served its
                        probabtion, and the time has surely come when its interests should receive
                        full, if not the first, consideration upon our roads and highways. And the
                        chief point for attention here is that of the upkeep of the roads, the
                        condition of which affects the mechanical so muh more than the horse-drawn
                        vehicle. Mr. Stanley suggests, nor is he alone in the idea, the need of a
                        central board of some kind to supervise all the roads of the kingdom. The
                        £1,800,000 now being spent in this direction, if supplemented by the income
                        derived from motor fines and licences, would be fully sufficient to provide
                        the necessary funds. And the prospect of broad, level, dustless highways on
                        all the chief routes is a dream not only attractive but quite possible of
                        realisation.</p>

                    <p>The magnificent pile of buildings erected on what was known as the Carrington
                        House site, opposite the Admirality and Horse Guards, in which to house the
                        aggregation of military and administrative departments that comprise the War
                        Office, is rapidly approaching completion, and it is hoped that by midsummer
                        of next year the whole of the sections, several of which at present outlie
                        the dingy premises in Pall Mall, will have been transferred to
                        Whitehall.</p>

                    <p>The removal of the hoarding and scaffolding the previously obscured the view
                        of the new building on each of its four sides has revealed a pile that is in
                        every way worthy of its unique position in one of the most remarkable and
                        best known thoroughfares in Europe. The design not only accords with its
                        surroundings, but is appropriate to the purpose for which the building has
                        been erected. Years have passed out of recollection since the premises
                        numbered 80 to 93, Pall Mall, housed all the headquarter departments of the
                        Army, and it will be a great convenience to those charged with the
                        administration of the War <cb n="2"/> Office when all its business comes to
                        be transacted under one roof.</p>

                    <p>I sincerely hope the movement we are promised in London for the erection of
                        "skyscrapers" will not be initiated. New York and other American towns are
                        made hideous by these huge steel erections, which would destroy all the
                        charm of London. The idea of "office towers" about the height of the
                        campanile of the Westminster Roman Catholic Cathedral is simply detestable,
                        and I trust that a vigorous resistance will be offered to any proposals to
                        amend the building laws so as to permit their erection.</p>

                    <p>The sinking of the L. and S.-W. steamer Hilda and the burning of the model
                        lodging-house in Glasglow are both remarkable among the defeats inflicted
                        upon humanity by the elements, because help was apparently so near. The
                        rocks upon which the unfortunate vessel struck are only a few cables' length
                        from St. Malo, while the Central Fire Station of Glasglow is only five
                        hundred yards away from the scene of the fire by which thirty-nine people
                        lost their lives. It might have been supposed that in both cases help would
                        have come in ample time to save life, but in the first disaster the weather
                        prevented the people in St. Malo from knowning anything of what had happened
                        until it was too late; while in the second, though the alarm was given at
                        once, not even the prompt energy of the Glasglow Fire Brigade could
                        neutralise the start which the fire had obtained. People are horrified by
                        such tragedies, but I believe it is rather the drama in them that appals
                        than the actual loss of llife. We are all instinctly moved to the very
                        depths of our being by the thought of the suddenness and the extent of these
                        calamities, because we can picture to ourselves the terror of the scene.</p>


                    <p>But a rise in the death-rate inplying the loss of ten times as many lives as
                        were claimed by sea and fire in these two recent catastrophe would,
                        probably, pass unnoticed save by a few statisticians. Even had the same loss
                        of life been caused in the same ways it would have given the average man
                        very little distress if it had been spread over a week or fortnight, and had
                        it happened in some distant part of the world to people of another race, he
                        would scarcely have noticed it at all. In such cases the dramatic element is
                        wanting, and therefore sympathy is not aroused. It may be a sad fact to have
                        to acknowledge, but to deny that it is a fact would be absurd.</p>

                    <p>At last the "All Blacks" have met their match. Although the New Zealanders
                        won on the posrt at Inverlieth on Saturday, the game throughout was of the
                        most even character, and up to ten minutes before time Scotland was leading.
                        How far the result was affected by the disablement at this point of the
                        Scottish wing forward, which caused the New Zealanders to be reprimanded for
                        deliberately rough play, it is not easy to decide. But the fact remains that
                        it was a battle on absolutely equal terms. All honor to Scotland, which has
                        demonstrated the possibility and established the precedent. May it speedily
                        be followed, and may the narrow margin of victory fall next time upon the
                        other side!</p>

                        <p>Two years ago, when the formation of a British North Sea Squadrom was
                            motted, the German Press went into a paroxysm of fury, and denounced the
                            plan as a direct menace to Germany's naval power and expansion, despite
                            the fact that Germany was forming a small but compact battle squadron
                            for service in the shallow waters of that sea. There is every reason to
                            believe that the formation of the squadron, delayed by the
                            redistribution of our naval forces at home and abroad, will be
                            ultimately proceeded with. The material is to hand in the group of
                            shallow draught battleships of the Canopus class, six in number:
                            Canopus, Albion, Vangeance, Glory, Goliath, and Ocean. They have
                            displacement of 12,950 tons, a speed of 18 ¼ knots, and they carry crews
                            of 750 officers and men, and an armament of four 12-inch 46-ton guns,
                            twelve 6-inch guns, twelve 12-pounders, six 3-pounders, and the usual
                            machine gun and torpedo equipment. Their comparatively shallow draught
                            of 26 feet makes them very suitable for manoeuvring in shallow waters
                            off the coasts of the North Sea. They are amply protected by armour
                            belts on the water line, and the barbettes and other guns positions are
                            heavily armoured. The six form a formidable suadron.</p>

                    <p>A BROKEN-DOWN SYSTEM. This is a condition or disease to which doctors give
                        many names, but which few of them really understand. It is simply weakness-
                        a break-down, as it were, of the vital forces that sustain the system. No
                        matter what may be its causes (for they are almost numberless), its symptoms
                        are much the same; the more prominent being sleeplessness, sense of
                        prostration or weariness, depression of spirits and want of energy for all
                        the ordinary affaires of life. Now, what alone is absolutely essential in
                        all such cases is <hi rend="italic">increased vitality</hi>- vigor- VITAL
                        STRENGTH &amp; ENERGY to throw off these morbid feelings, and experience
                        proves that as night succeeds the day this may be more certainly secured by
                        a course of the celebrated life-reviving tonic THERAPION No. 3 than by any
                        other known combination. So surely as it is taken in accordance with the
                        printed directions accopanying it, will the shattered health be restored,
                        THE EXPIRING LAMP OF LIFE LIGHTED UP AFRESH, and a new existence impatred in
                        place of what had so lately seemed worn-out, "used up," and valueless. This
                        wonderful medicament is purely vegetable and innocuous, is agreeable to the
                        taste- suitable for all conspentions and conditions in either sex; and it is
                        difficult to imagine a case of disease or derangement whose main features
                        are those of debility, that will not be speedily and permanently benefited
                        by this never-failing recuperative essence which is destined to cast into
                        oblivion everything that had preceded it for this wide-spread and numerous
                        class of human ailments, THERAPION is sold by the principal chemists
                        throughout the world. Price in England 29 and 4/6. Purchasers should see
