                    <head>RUSSIA TO-DAY.</head>
                    <p>What has happened in Russia, what it
                        happening, and what is likely to happen
                        form the components of a problem. The
                        sudden resolution of any constituent elements,
                        like the subsidence of some huge structure
                        of masonry, must always be accompanied
                        by a vast amount of destruction through
                        the mutual concussion of its various parts.
                        What we are witnessing in Russia at the
                        present moment is not so much revolution,
                        <cb n="4"/>
                        which implies arms and a leader, as the violent
                        disintigration of an impossible union of anta-
                        gonistic and ill-assorted materials.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, we have had bloody massacres
                        and even battles in which people, bureaucratic
                        agents, intellectuals, industrials, revolutionists,
                        sailors, soldiers, socialists have been engaged in
                        almost indiscriminate destruction, inspired,
                        amidst the sudden strophy of centralised
                        government, either by predatory lust or by an
                        anthusiasm for the particular social or religious
                        theory they have adopted and made their own.
                        And, remmeber, there is not in the wide world
                        a more fanatical theorist than the half-educa-
                        ted Russian. There would be a better prospect
                        of the emergence of a Liberal Constitution if
                        the various elements of disorder were in rough
                        and ready agreement with one another. When,
                        however, the political and economic machinery
                        of the empire was suddenly put out of gear, the
                        shock threw every one off their mental and
                        moral balance, and while the Government
                        cannot cope forcibly with the new tactics of
                        the revolutionaries, and re-establish the status
                        quo by arms, there is not sufficient revolu-
                        tionary cohesion for an encounter, corps a corps,
                        with the still concrete fact of bureaucratic
                        reaction.</p>
                    <p>Nevertheless so much has been gained that
                        a fire has been kindled which, although it
                        may smolder, can never be put out. The
                        revolution has discovered a power before which
                        all the force of Tsardom is important. And
                        even should chaotic extravagance of thought
                        and action and lack of cohesion conduce to a
                        temporary check of the Liberal movement and
                        the withdrawal or nullification of the privileges
                        obtained, it has amply proved the temper of
                        its weapons, and can look with confidence to
                        the future.</p>
                    <p>Now, it is precisely for this smouldering of
                        the fire that the bureaucratic power has been
                        watching and waiting, trusting for ultimate
                        salvation to the stomach to drive the revolu-
                        tionary spirit of the great strike movement
                        back to the paths of subordination and wage-
                        earning labour.</p>
                    <p>In the forefront of bureaucratic oppression,
                        the influence which, like a heavy stone impos-
                        ed upon grass, has for many generations dwarf-
                        ed and stunted the moral and material deve-
                        lopment of the Russian people, has been the
                        foreign ambition of their masters. In the inte-
                        rests of these they have been sacrificed, rob-
                        bed bled; and the prospects of genuine reform
                        are inseperably bound up with the inaugura-
                        tion of a moderate, unambitious, and economic
                        foreign policy which, on the basis of good rela-
                        tions with all, will permit the fullest concen-
                        tration of national energy on the moral and
                        economic regeneration of the race. What is
                        happening in Russia to-day is no more than a
                        reflection of what took place in this land of
                        Egypt several thousand years ago; and the
                        Pharaoh of the Neva will prove as obdurate of
                        heart as his prototype of the Nile, until, in the
                        fulness of time, the fire- which naught can
                        quench- will burst forth once more, with
                        furious finality.</p>
                    <p>It has been frequently asked whether, and
                        to what extent, the Russian peasantry have
                        been affected by revolutionary teaching and
                        principles. This is a very material question,
                        because until the Russian proletariat is ready
                        to think, speak, and act in unison there
                        can be no revolution, in the fullest sense
                        of the term. At the present day, however,
                        there is no material for a Jacquerie- and if
                        active revolution is to come, and the events
                        of the last few days at Sevastopol look as
                        though it has come with a vengence, it
                        will be brought about by a revolt of the
                        sons of the people in the armies of the Tsar.</p>

                            <p>Reuter's Agency learns from St. Petersburg
                                that the attitude of the Government is consi-
                                dered as suicidal, playing into the hands of
                                the revolutionaries. Financial and commercial
                                circles are aghast. There was a further heavy
                                drop in prices both at St. Petersburg and at
                                Moscow yesterday. It is openly declared in the
                                Bourse and elsewhere that the days of the
                                present regime are numbered.</p>

                            <p>When the garrison of Fort Peter and Paul
                                assembled for roll call, the artillery demanded
                                the immediate release of the electrical students
                                arrested on the 29th November. This demand
                                was transmitted to the Commandant of the 
                                fortress, who complied.</p>
                            <p>It is officially confirmed that the loyal troops
                                have captured the barracks occupied by the
                                mutineers at Sevastopol. 2,000 of these with
                                quick-firing guns have surrendered. The cruiser
                                Otchakoff is gutted, but is still floating. The
                                town is not damaged.</p>
                            <p>A number of Guardsmen have been arrested
                                at Tzarskoe Selo for presenting demands ob-
                                jecting to being obliged to act as police. It is
                                reported that the mutineers at Sevastopol have
                                regained the upper hand.</p>

                                of the Guards, but it is impossible to say defi-
                                nitely whether any Grand Duke participated.
                                Officials, however, admit the reports of grave

                    <p>The meeting of the creditors of the Societe
                        des Sucreries et de la Raffinerie d'Egypte,
                        postponed from Thursday last, took place
                        yesterday at the Mixed Courts, Cairo. At 3.15
                        p.m. <persName>Judge Tuck</persName> opened the proceedings by
                        stating that he had received communications
                        from cultivators in Upper Egypt hoping that
                        the Sucreries Co. would continue to exist. He
                        then read a letter which he had received from
                        the directors of the Sucreries Company, who
                        criticized the last report of the experts on two
                        grounds-firstly, the though it had been
                        agreed that a copy of the report prepared by
                        <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q386694">Sir William Willcocks</persName>, <persName>Fourneron Bey</persName>, and
                        <persName>Professor Sampaolo</persName> should be put into the
                        hands of the board of directors 48 hours before
                        the meeting of creditors convoked under the 
                        concordat preventif, the members of the 
                        board were not, as a matter of fact, supplied
                        therewith, and were in consequence compelled
                        to hear its criticisms in silence, unable to offer
                        a prepared defence. The criticisms of the ex-
                        perts who had two months' time to prepare
                        their attack reached the public, through the
                        medium of the press, unbalance by the
                        defence which the directors would otherwise
                        have been in a position to offer. Secondly, 
                        they protested against the excessive animus
                        that marked the criticisms passed on the
                        administration of the company by the three
                        experts.</p>
                    <p><persName>Judge Tuck</persName>, in reply, stated that on the
                        first occasion when the report was to be read,
                        the three experts found themselves unable to
                        complete it in time to deliver a copy to the
                        representatives of the Sucreries Company forty-
                        eight hours before the meeting of the creditors
                        took place. The legal representative of the
                        company was warned but demanded no post-
                        ponement. No engagement was entered into
                        the delivery of a copy forty-eight hours in
                        advance on any later occasion.</p>
                    <p><persName>The Judge</persName> then called upon <persName ref="https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q21334364">M. Zigliara</persName>,
                        the clerk of the court, to read the correspon-

                        by <persName>Me. Fatica</persName> and addressed to <persName>Judge Tuck</persName>
                        on the subject of the Ibrahimieh Ploughing
                        Company. The correspondence consisted of
                        the experts' answer to <persName>Me. Fatica</persName> and a com-
                        munication from the board of the Sucreries Co.
                        on the same subject, with a covering letter

                        Sucreries shareholders' extraordinary general
                        meeting of the Saturday last and stated that
                        certain further delays in the acceptance of
                        the proposals made under the concordat pre-
                        ventif were inevitable owing to the appoint-
                        ment of <persName>MM. Letort</persName> and Cozziks, who were
                        to study these proposals and watch the nego-
                        tiations connected therewith on behalf of the
                        shareholders at Paris and at Cairo respectively.
                        These gentlemen had not been as of yet able to
                        come to an entirely satisfactory arrangement
                        with one another and the board would not be
                        able to bring its proposals before the court
                        till Monday or Tuesday next. He in conse-
                        quence asked for a postponement during which
                        the verification of the claims of the creditors
                        could be made or at least begun, and the
                        meeting was in consequence adjourned till

                    <p>Another new bridge is to be built across the
                        Nile, the Government having decided on the
                        construction of a magnificent structure to
                        unite Boulac and Ghezireh. The work will be
                        taken in hand shortly.</p>
                    <p>The new bridge will be twenty metres in

                    <p>It is obvious that with the universal tend-
                        ency of all great cities-Alexandria being on
                        of the very few exceptions to the general rule-
                        to extend, so far as concerns their fashionable
                        quarters, in a westerly direction, Ghezireh is
                        inevitably destined to become the "Champs
                        Elysees" of the Capital of Egypt. The only
                        drawback to the development of Ghezireh has
                        been its distance from the centre of the city, but
                        this will be now entirely obviated by the new
                        bridge, which will bring it in direct communica-
                        tion with the centre of Cairo.</p>

                        has been formed in London to pen up com-

                    <p>On the evening of Wednesday a grand
                        concert was given by the band from an Austrian
                        first-class cruiser in the little garden adjoining
                        the Eastern Exchange, in aid of the Austrian
                        Benevolent Society of Port Said. The garden
                        was magnificently decorated with flags of all
                        nations. The band played 10 very select pieces
                        and were twice encored. It is hoped that the
                        society will be able to make a few homes com-
                        fortable with the proceeds of this concert.</p>

                    <head>THE SAMANOUD AFFAIR.
                        TRUE VERSION OF INCIDENT.</head>
                    <p>As certain exaggerated statements have been
                        published with regard to a disturbance at Sa-
                        manoud, Gharbieh province, we are glad to be
                        able to give the true account of the concurrence
                        there, which we have from official sources.</p>
                    <p>It appears that on the morning of the 27th
                        November, a telegram from a number of Copts
                        and Europeans reached the moudirieh head-
                        quarters, stating that a number of Muslims had
                        insulted the Christian religion by holding a
                        mock funeral, imitating the officiating priest
                        and cross-bearer.</p>
                    <p>On enquiries being made it proved that
                        seven men of the lowest class had insulted both
                        Christian and Muslim religions. On the morn-
                        ing of the 27th they entered the El Adawi-
                        mosque, interrupted prayers, and created a
                        great disturbance. After leaving the mosque
                        they indulged in a travesty of a Christian
                        funeral, and having insulted both religions
                        found themselves pursued by the police.</p>
                    <p>five have been arrested and have confessed
                        their guilt. The remaining members of the
                        gang are the object of careful search.</p>

                        the judge dismissed the appeal with costs.</p>
                    <p>The case was made interesting by several
                        points of public interest, amongst which was
                        the fact that the plaintiff had insured his

                        and F. Co. of the K.R.R. on Tuesday, proved to
                        be a capital game. The slight rain which fell in
                        the forenoon had no effect on the ground,- if
                        anything it improved it. The railway men's
                        full team turned out to opposed their antagon-
                        ists. From the very start off and all through
                        the first half the home team were the superior
                        XI., and they were continually attacking the
                        visitors' custodian. The consequence was, that
                        when the first half terminated, the railway
                        men had 5 goals to their credit. In the second
                        half F. Co. struggled with the desperate energy,
                        and by the 'cute understanding of the left
                        wing pair, managed to score a couple of goals.
                        Thus the Railway Institute were left the

                    <docAuthor>By Sir Handury Brown, K.C.M.G., late Inspector-General of
                        Irrigation in Lower Egypt, and formly in Upper Egypt.</docAuthor>
                    <head>VI.</head>
                    <p>The preceding articles have dealt with the
                        considerations which affect the designing of a
                        canal projet. After the designing comes con-
                        struction, and after construction the use of
                        the works to serve the end for which they
                        were designed and constructed. To one class
                        of engineers the construction period is the
                        only one that is interesting; and, no doubt,
                        the satisfaction of seeing an important
                        work grown under one's hands is a solid one.
                        Moreover, the "gallery" applauds, and
                        honors are distributed when a work of suffi-
                        cient importance to attract the attention of
                        the public is successfully brough to a comple-
                        tion; and there is satisfaction also in that,
                        though not so solic. All the world, for instance,
                        has heard of the Assonouan dam, though many
                        have very inaccurate ideas as to whom should
                        be given the credit of the original conception of
                        the design and of the actual construction. But
                        the dam is there, whoever fathered it, and it is
                        doing its duty , regarding which little will be
                        known by any but those who are specially in-
                        terested in Egypt and watch its further develop-
                        ment. Fortunate, indeed, is the engineer whose
                        duties comprehend the work of each of the three
                        period of design, construction and administra-
                        tion, and who has the satisfaction of converting
                        his design into material structures, and of
                        using them to produce prosperity among the
                        people for whose benefit they were designed.</p>
                    <p>Already, in the first article, a list has been
                        given of the different descriptions of works
                        that an irrigation engineer has to design, con-
                        struct and utilise. They are many and various.
                        The ordinary principles and methods of con-
                        struction apply to most of them. But from
                        among them there may be selected as belonging
                        peculiarly to the province of the irrigation
                        engineer such masonry works as high dams to
                        create storage reservoirs, anicuts and barrages
                        to raise the summer level of rivers, canal head-
                        works to control the main supply; also syphons,
                        aqueducts, super-passages, to carry one
                        watercourse past another; and lastly navigation
                        locks. Most of these would have their founda-
                        tion level below the lowest water level, and
                        would present more or less difficulty of con-
                        struction according to the nature of the
                        foundation bed and the strength of springs
                        over the foundation area. The ordinary method
                        of getting in the foundations is to surround the
                        area of operations by banks to exclude the
                        outside water, and to get rid of the inside
                        water by pumping. The concrete is then laid,
                        so to speak, "in the dry," an expression not
                        to be understood literally, as where springs are
                        working the conrete may have to be laid in
                        about a foot of water. This was the method of
                        construction adopted in the case of the Assiout
                        barrage, lately built in Upper Egypt simultane-
                        ously with the Assouan dam. The advantage of
                        this method over others is that all the work
                        done is in sight at the time of execution. But
                        it has this disadvantage- that, unless the
                        springs are intelligently and skilfully treated
                        defects in the floor will be created by the water
                        forcing its way either under or through the
                        floor. It happens sometimes that the super-
                        vising staff has not the experience necessary
                        for successfully dealing with the springs, but
                        gains it as the work proceeds, so that the first
                        season's work is not without its mistakes. The
                        principle to be observed in dealing with springs
                        is that no attempt should be made to stop
                        them working until they have been surrounded
                        on all sides by masonry of sufficient strength
                        to resisit the efforts of the spring to find a
                        new outlet through it. If the cement concrete,
                        which forms the bottom layer of the foundation
                        platform, is advanced from one extremity of
                        the work in an even line towards the other,
                        the springs will form runs for themselves
                        through the unset edge of the concrete layer.
                        And, as it advances, more and more springs
                        will assert themselves in the same way, until
                        there is a strong outflow along the advancing
                        edge of the concrete, due to the combined
                        action of all the springs, except such as have
                        forced their way sideways to the margins of
                        the concrete layer; where they will continue
                        to work. The cementing material of the con-
                        crete will thus be washed away as soon as it is laid
                        and runs will thus be formed under and through the
                        foundation platform, which will give trouble
                        afterwards. The way to avoid this is carefully
                        to locate all springs, and, as the concrete
                        advances, to carry it all round them, but not
                        over them. As the springs will continue to work,
                        their water must be led away in pipes, or chan-
                        nels al set masonry, over or through the con-
                        crete layers, until they are completely surroun-
                        ded by masonry too strong for them to burst
                        through. They can then be forcibly stopped
                        with safety, and they will be powerless to work
                        <cb n="2"/>
                        harm. The methods of dealing with springs vary
                        in detail with the ingenuity of those in charge
                        of the work, but the guiding principle is the
                        same with all, namely to attempt no violence
                        to the spring till sufficient forces are marshalled
                        all round it to compel submission.</p>
                    <p>The disadvantages of putting in foundations
                        with strong springs in action over the founda-
                        tion bed have caused other methods to be
                        resorted to. In India the method of getting in
                        foundations by well-sinking is in favor, and has
                        repeatedly been employed with much success.
                        Circular or rectangular wells are built on well-
                        curbs which rest on the sand at the natural
                        water-level, or at the level to which it may be
                        judged convenient to lower the water by
                        pumping. The wells are weighted, and the
                        sand excavated from within by special plant,
                        so that the wells sink below water level as
                        the excavation continues. More height is
                        added to them and teh sinking is conti-
                        nued till the bottom of the well has reached
                        the required depth. The superstructure is
                        afterwards built on a platform covering the
                        wells.</p>
                    <p>There is also the method of getting in
                        foundations by the help of compressed air.
                        which, however, has not been much used in
                        irrigation work in India or Egypt. It requires
                        special plant and labour skilled in the pro-
                        cess, as there are dangers attending its em-
                        polyment by untrained hands.</p>

                        number of bachelors and old maids is increas-

                        is decreasing only in Sweden, France, and
                        Ireland. In Germany the number of bachelors
                        steadily decreases, and only in certain limited

                    <p>Monte Carlo has just put in force a most
                        important scheme to tax all foreigners engaged
                        in business in the principality. A large num-
                        ber of licences granted during the summer are
                        being held back. If the new rule is made
                        retrospective it will affect all English limited
                        liability companies, besides a large number of
                        English, French, Italian, and German mer-
                        chants and shopkeepers. Villa holders may
                        also be liable to taxation.</p>

                        three years until I thought it was
                        chronic. My chest and lungs were ir-
                        ritated and I had to use the greatest
                        care not to expose myself to chilly air
                        or dampness as it increased my troubles.</p>

                        change of climate, but I was unable to
                        leave my family. Reading of the won-
                        derful cures performed by Peruns, I
                        bought a bottle.</p>

                        them all which cured me. I was re-
                        lieved within three days and after two
                        months and a half the irritation was

                        in this country if the people thuroughly
                        understand its nature. It must be
                        treated at once to prevent it from mak-
                        ing inroads upon vital organs.</p>

                            wish to attend this General Meeting of the Company, they must first
                            deposit their Bearer Warrants, together with a statement in writing of
                            their names and addresses, at the Registered Offices of the Company in
                            London two clear days before the date of the General Meeting, viz., not

                            Company's system by the construction of new lines, and by the absorption
                            of other railway companies, the work entailed in preparing the Accounts
                            has so increased as to render it impossible to prepare the Balance Sheet

                            Report for the Annual General Meeting, which, in conformity with the
                            Companies Acts, must be held during 1905. It is therefore the intention
                            of the Directors, at the General Meeting, which this notice convenes, to
                            submit a formal resolution of adjournment of the Meeting until 30th
                            January, 1906, at hich adjournment the business referred to on the

                        <p>In view of the above, and as the present Financial Year of the Company
                            closes during the busiest season of the year, it is considered necessary
                            to alter the date of closing from 30th September to 31st March. A
                            Half-Yearly Report and Statement of Accounts will therefore be issued in
                            1906 as at 31st March, after which they will be issued annually.</p>

                        <p>I find it hard to see the exact reason of all the pother of "resignation"
                            and "dissolution" that has come about. The ordinary course of events
                            might well have entailed a dissolution early in next session. What has
                            happened to hasten that course of precipitate a "crisis"? Mr.
                            Chamberlain has enunciated no views that he was not well known to
                            entertain, nor does there seem any crying need for instant action that
                            would be distrubing to many and agreeable to few. All politics are
                            constantly on the knees of the gods, and all things are possible. But,
                            judging by such signs as are plain to see, many thoughts that occupy
                            many minds may by the offspring of prolific Father Wish.</p>

                        <p>A movement is on foot among leading men in Great Britain and Germany to
                            promote a better understanding between the two countries. A committee
                            has been formed, and a meeting is arranged to take place next week at
                            Westminster, at which Lord Avebury will preside. Amongst those who have
                            signified their intention of being present are the Bishop of Southwark,
                            Lord Stanmore, Sir Michael Foster, Sir Ernest Tritton, M.P., Sir John
                            Kennaway, M.P., and the Rev. Dr. Horton, President of the Free Church
                            Counsil. An address expressing the desire for a more cordial feeling
                            between the two nations has been signed by a number of influential
                            gentlemen. Similar action taken by public men in Germany is being
                            equally well supported.</p>

                        <p>It seems more like centuries than years since we have been groaning under
                            the "made in Germany," "made in Holland," "made in Austria" labels. And
                            what was at first a fund of Jocosity for the self confessedly comic
                            papers has long been diagnosed as a grave peril to trade, industry, and
                            employment. This, then, is an auspicious moment for the birth of that
                            "British-made League," to which I offer me best wishes for success. The
                            name of the League explains its ideals and activities. It is actuated by
                            the large hope of gaining the support of so many people as to enable it
                            to <q>regain employment for the thousands who are now workless, owing to
                                foreign competition in articles which could be made at home.</q></p>

                        <p>Apart from other uses of the Motor-car Exhibition just opened at Olympia,
                            it has served once more to emphasise the remarkable progression-
                            geometrical rather than arithmetical- of this great industry. As Mr.
                            Arthur Stanley pointed out, the cars now running in the United Kingdom
                            represent a value of some fifteen millions sterling, and the prospects
                            for the future promise a more than proportionate increase. The motor-car
                            has now served its probabtion, and the time has surely come when its
                            interests should receive full, if not the first, consideration upon our
                            roads and highways. And the chief point for attention here is that of
                            the upkeep of the roads, the condition of which affects the mechanical
                            so muh more than the horse-drawn vehicle. Mr. Stanley suggests, nor is
                            he alone in the idea, the need of a central board of some kind to
                            supervise all the roads of the kingdom. The £1,800,000 now being spent
                            in this direction, if supplemented by the income derived from motor

                            funds. And the prospect of broad, level, dustless highways on all the

                            that is in every way worthy of its unique position in one of the most
                            remarkable and best known thoroughfares in Europe. The design not only

                            which the building has been erected. Years have passed out of

                            of "skyscrapers" will not be initiated. New York and other American
                            towns are made hideous by these huge steel erections, which would
                            destroy all the charm of London. The idea of "office towers" about the

                            simply detestable, and I trust that a vigorous resistance will be
                            offered to any proposals to amend the building laws so as to permit

                        <p>The sinking of the L. and S.-W. steamer Hilda and the burning of the
                            model lodging-house in Glasglow are both remarkable among the defeats
                            inflicted upon humanity by the elements, because help was apparently so
                            near. The rocks upon which the unfortunate vessel struck are only a few
                            cables' length from St. Malo, while the Central Fire Station of Glasglow
                            is only five hundred yards away from the scene of the fire by which
                            thirty-nine people lost their lives. It might have been supposed that in
                            both cases help would have come in ample time to save life, but in the
                            first disaster the weather prevented the people in St. Malo from
                            knowning anything of what had happened until it was too late; while in
                            the second, though the alarm was given at once, not even the prompt
                            energy of the Glasglow Fire Brigade could neutralise the start which the
                            fire had obtained. People are horrified by such tragedies, but I believe
                            it is rather the drama in them that appals than the actual loss of
                            llife. We are all instinctly moved to the very depths of our being by
                            the thought of the suddenness and the extent of these calamities,
                            because we can picture to ourselves the terror of the scene.</p>

                        <p>But a rise in the death-rate inplying the loss of ten times as many lives
                            as were claimed by sea and fire in these two recent catastrophe would,
                            probably, pass unnoticed save by a few statisticians. Even had the same
                            loss of life been caused in the same ways it would have given the
                            average man very little distress if it had been spread over a week or
                            fortnight, and had it happened in some distant part of the world to
                            people of another race, he would scarcely have noticed it at all. In
                            such cases the dramatic element is wanting, and therefore sympathy is
                            not aroused. It may be a sad fact to have to acknowledge, but to deny
                            that it is a fact would be absurd.</p>

                        <p>At last the "All Blacks" have met their match. Although the New

                            throughout was of the most even character, and up to ten minutes before
                            time Scotland was leading. How far the result was affected by the
                            disablement at this point of the Scottish wing forward, which caused the
                            New Zealanders to be reprimanded for deliberately rough play, it is not
                            easy to decide. But the fact remains that it was a battle on absolutely
                            equal terms. All honor to Scotland, which has demonstrated the
                            possibility and established the precedent. May it speedily be followed,

                        <p>Two years ago, when the formation of a British North Sea Squadrom was
                            motted, the German Press went into a paroxysm of fury, and denounced the
                            plan as a direct menace to Germany's naval power and expansion, despite
                            the fact that Germany was forming a small but compact battle squadron
                            for service in the shallow waters of that sea. There is every reason to
                            believe that the formation of the squadron, delayed by the
                            redistribution of our naval forces at home and abroad, will be
                            ultimately proceeded with. The material is to hand in the group of
                            shallow draught battleships of the Canopus class, six in number:
                            Canopus, Albion, Vangeance, Glory, Goliath, and Ocean. They have
                            displacement of 12,950 tons, a speed of 18 ¼ knots, and they carry crews
                            of 750 officers and men, and an armament of four 12-inch 46-ton guns,
                            twelve 6-inch guns, twelve 12-pounders, six 3-pounders, and the usual
                            machine gun and torpedo equipment. Their comparatively shallow draught
                            of 26 feet makes them very suitable for manoeuvring in shallow waters
                            off the coasts of the North Sea. They are amply protected by armour
                            belts on the water line, and the barbettes and other guns positions are
                            heavily armoured. The six form a formidable suadron.</p>

                    <p>A BROKEN-DOWN SYSTEM. This is a condition or disease to which doctors give
                        many names, but which few of them really understand. It is simply weakness-
                        a break-down, as it were, of the vital forces that sustain the system. No
                        matter what may be its causes (for they are almost numberless), its symptoms
                        are much the same; the more prominent being sleeplessness, sense of
                        prostration or weariness, depression of spirits and want of energy for all
                        the ordinary affaires of life. Now, what alone is absolutely essential in
                        all such cases is <hi rend="italic">increased vitality</hi>- vigor- VITAL
                        STRENGTH &amp; ENERGY to throw off these morbid feelings, and experience
                        proves that as night succeeds the day this may be more certainly secured by
                        a course of the celebrated life-reviving tonic THERAPION No. 3 than by any
                        other known combination. So surely as it is taken in accordance with the
                        printed directions accopanying it, will the shattered health be restored,
                        THE EXPIRING LAMP OF LIFE LIGHTED UP AFRESH, and a new existence impatred in
                        place of what had so lately seemed worn-out, "used up," and valueless. This
                        wonderful medicament is purely vegetable and innocuous, is agreeable to the
                        taste- suitable for all conspentions and conditions in either sex; and it is
                        difficult to imagine a case of disease or derangement whose main features
                        are those of debility, that will not be speedily and permanently benefited
                        by this never-failing recuperative essence which is destined to cast into
                        oblivion everything that had preceded it for this wide-spread and numerous
                        class of human ailments, THERAPION is sold by the principal chemists
                        throughout the world. Price in England 29 and 4/6. Purchasers should see
                        that the word "THERAPION" appears on British Government Stamp (in white
