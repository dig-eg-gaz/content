                                <p>Things in Russia are undoubtedly going
                                    from bad to worse. There are rumours to-day
                                    that a great coup d’etat has taken place at
                                    St. Petersburg, and large numbers of Cossacks
                                    are said to be assembling in the Capital.</p>
                                <p>A great run on the savings banks through-
                                    out the country is taking place, and there
                                    exists a general financial panic.</p>

                                <p>Reuter's Agency learns from St. Petersburg
                                    that the attitude of the Government is consi-
                                    dered as suicidal, playing into the hands of
                                    the revolutionaries. Financial and commercial
                                    circles are aghast. There was a further heavy
                                    drop in prices both at St. Petersburg and at
                                    Moscow yesterday. It is openly declared in the
                                    Bourse and elsewhere that the days of the
                                    present regime are numbered.</p>

                                <p>When the garrison of Fort Peter and Paul
                                    assembled for roll call, the artillery demanded
                                    the immediate release of the electrical students
                                    arrested on the 29th November. This demand
                                    was transmitted to the Commandant of the 
                                    fortress, who complied.</p>
                                <p>It is officially confirmed that the loyal troops
                                    have captured the barracks occupied by the
                                    mutineers at Sevastopol. 2,000 of these with
                                    quick-firing guns have surrendered. The cruiser
                                    Otchakoff is gutted, but is still floating. The
                                    town is not damaged.</p>
                                <p>A number of Guardsmen have been arrested
                                    at Tzarskoe Selo for presenting demands ob-
                                    jecting to being obliged to act as police. It is
                                    reported that the mutineers at Sevastopol have
                                    regained the upper hand.</p>

                                <p>It is rumoured that a Grand Duke partici-
                                    pated in a plot against the Tsar. There are
                                    some indications of conspiracy of the officers
                                    of the Guards, but it is impossible to say defi-
                                    nitely whether any Grand Duke participated.
                                    Officials, however, admit the reports of grave
                                    events at Tzarskoe Selo.</p>

                                    forces of the Empire will be mobilised.</p>

                        postponed from Thursday last, took place
                        yesterday at the Mixed Courts, Cairo. At 3.15
                        p.m. <persName>Judge Tuck</persName> opened the proceedings by
                        stating that he had received communications
                        from cultivators in Upper Egypt hoping that
                        the Sucreries Co. would continue to exist. He
                        then read a letter which he had received from
                        the directors of the Sucreries Company, who
                        criticized the last report of the experts on two
                        grounds-firstly, the though it had been
                        agreed that a copy of the report prepared by

                        hands of the board of directors 48 hours before
                        the meeting of creditors convoked under the 
                        concordat preventif, the members of the 
                        board were not, as a matter of fact, supplied
                        therewith, and were in consequence compelled
                        to hear its criticisms in silence, unable to offer
                        a prepared defence. The criticisms of the ex-
                        perts who had two months' time to prepare
                        their attack reached the public, through the
                        medium of the press, unbalance by the
                        defence which the directors would otherwise
                        have been in a position to offer. Secondly, 
                        they protested against the excessive animus
                        that marked the criticisms passed on the
                        administration of the company by the three
                        experts.</p>
                    <p><persName>Judge Tuck</persName>, in reply, stated that on the
                        first occasion when the report was to be read,
                        the three experts found themselves unable to
                        complete it in time to deliver a copy to the
                        representatives of the Sucreries Company forty-
                        eight hours before the meeting of the creditors
                        took place. The legal representative of the
                        company was warned but demanded no post-
                        ponement. No engagement was entered into
                        the delivery of a copy forty-eight hours in
                        advance on any later occasion.</p>

                        meeting of the Saturday last and stated that
                        certain further delays in the acceptance of
                        the proposals made under the concordat pre-
                        ventif were inevitable owing to the appoint-
                        ment of <persName>MM. Letort</persName> and Cozziks, who were
                        to study these proposals and watch the nego-
                        tiations connected therewith on behalf of the
                        shareholders at Paris and at Cairo respectively.
                        These gentlemen had not been as of yet able to
                        come to an entirely satisfactory arrangement
                        with one another and the board would not be
                        able to bring its proposals before the court
                        till Monday or Tuesday next. He in conse-

                        old family property of Crackenthorpe, in West-
                        moreland, which was in the possession of his

                        <persName>Lord Lonsdale</persName> in 1877. Mr. Machell's mother,

                    <head>CAIRO IMPROVEMENTS.
                        THE GHEZIREH BRIDGE.</head>
                    <p>Another new bridge is to be built across the
                        Nile, the Government having decided on the
                        construction of a magnificent structure to
                        unite Boulac and Ghezireh. The work will be
                        taken in hand shortly.</p>
                    <p>The new bridge will be twenty metres in
                        width and will form a most convenient connect-
                        ing link between the centre of Cairo and the
                        fashionable new suburb of Ghezireh by the
                        Boulac avenue. The Ghezireh quarter will thus
                        soon form an integral portion of the Capital,
                        especially as a double line of tramway is to be
                        laid across the river. The Ghezireh end of the
                        bridge will be about two metres to the north of
                        the Ghezireh Palace Hotel and will divide
                        the estate of the Egyptian Hotels Company in
                        two parts.</p>
                    <p>It is obvious that with the universal tend-
                        ency of all great cities-Alexandria being on
                        of the very few exceptions to the general rule-
                        to extend, so far as concerns their fashionable
                        quarters, in a westerly direction, Ghezireh is
                        inevitably destined to become the "Champs
                        Elysees" of the Capital of Egypt. The only
                        drawback to the development of Ghezireh has
                        been its distance from the centre of the city, but
                        this will be now entirely obviated by the new
                        bridge, which will bring it in direct communica-
                        tion with the centre of Cairo.</p>

                        has been formed in London to pen up com-

                    <p>Port Said, Friday.</p>
                    <p>On the evening of Wednesday a grand
                        concert was given by the band from an Austrian
                        first-class cruiser in the little garden adjoining
                        the Eastern Exchange, in aid of the Austrian
                        Benevolent Society of Port Said. The garden
                        was magnificently decorated with flags of all
                        nations. The band played 10 very select pieces
                        and were twice encored. It is hoped that the
                        society will be able to make a few homes com-

                    <p>It appears that on the morning of the 27th
                        November, a telegram from a number of Copts
                        and Europeans reached the moudirieh head-

                        insulted the Christian religion by holding a
                        mock funeral, imitating the officiating priest
                        and cross-bearer.</p>
                    <p>On enquiries being made it proved that
                        seven men of the lowest class had insulted both
                        Christian and Muslim religions. On the morn-
                        ing of the 27th they entered the El Adawi-
                        mosque, interrupted prayers, and created a
                        great disturbance. After leaving the mosque
                        they indulged in a travesty of a Christian
                        funeral, and having insulted both religions
                        found themselves pursued by the police.</p>
                    <p>five have been arrested and have confessed
                        their guilt. The remaining members of the

                    <p>The meeting of the Railway Institute F.C.
                        and F. Co. of the K.R.R. on Tuesday, proved to
                        be a capital game. The slight rain which fell in
                        the forenoon had no effect on the ground,- if
                        anything it improved it. The railway men's
                        full team turned out to opposed their antagon-
                        ists. From the very start off and all through
                        the first half the home team were the superior
                        XI., and they were continually attacking the
                        visitors' custodian. The consequence was, that
                        when the first half terminated, the railway
                        men had 5 goals to their credit. In the second
                        half F. Co. struggled with the desperate energy,
                        and by the 'cute understanding of the left
                        wing pair, managed to score a couple of goals.
                        Thus the Railway Institute were left the
                        victors by 5 goals to 2. Mr. Allport was the
                        referee.</p>
