                        <p>We would draw the attention of manufacturers and merchants to the work of the British Chamber of Commerce of Egypt, which was formed in 1896 with the sole object of assisting British trade in this country. The services of the Chamber are always at the disposal of any member desiring information on trade matters generally, including the question of appointing suitable agents. As no fee is charged for snob advice, it is obviously in the interests of all British traders here to become members, especially when it is remembered that the annual subscription is merely the nominal one of £1. The latter payment also includes a copy of the monthly Journal issued by the Chamber. Home enquirers can obtain farther particulars from our London office, 86, New Broad-street, which acts as agents to the Chamber.</p>

                        <head>REPORT FOR 1904.</head>
                        <p>The sixth annual report by the director of the Ghizeh Zoological Gardens affords most interesting reading. It seems to be complete in every detail, even to the noting that "one Egyptian pound (L.E. 1) equals ₤l.0s.61/4d. or 25 francs and 92 centimes.” We may be sure that after the precision shown in this matter we may rely upon the other statements in the report being equally exact</p>
                        <p>Passing over the details as to the staff, which seems to he selected with a view to complete efficiency, not only as regard the animals, but also for the upkeep of the ornamental grounds, we notice that the number of visitors shows a steady increase year after year. There was a slight falling off in 1902 in consequence, no doubt, of the bad season that year, but with this exception the increase has been steady, and whereas in 1899 the number of visitors was 43,567, in 1904 it reached 64,711, the gate receipts amounting to LE. 1,388.150. December, February,and March wore the months that brought in</p>
                        <p>most visitors and gate money, June and August being those in which the gardens were least frequented. The accounts for the year showed a useful credit balance of L.E. 189.848, an increase of L.E. 80.288 on the previous year's figures, although rather considerable new building, joining and repairing work had to be undertaken. The result shows clearly enoug that the present director's abilities are not by any means confined to administration and natural history.</p>
                        <p>Deaths among the animals, birds and reptiles—not including in the casualty list the results of the raids of foxes, wild cats, etc. or purely accidental fatalities—totalled 267 against 235 in the previous year; the winter mouths November and December, which were marked by outbreaks of influenza and dengue among human beings at Cairo, being exceptionally severe. There were some important departures and deaths to chronicle, Lord Kitchener’s giraffe dying, and the two Indian elephants being sent off to Europe; while the champauzee presented by the Sirdar, which has since unfortunately died, the pair of zebras, the sacred shrew and sacred ibis, and the giraffe and other animals from the Sudan all deserve mention among the numerous new arrivals. The note on the aquarium is most interesting, containing, as it does, evidence of close personal observation of the various species of Nile fish kept in captivity there, and Dr. Franz Werner of the University of Vienna has sent a list of the grasshoppers and kindred insects to be found in the Gardens which, should interest entomologists.</p>

                        <p>The Paris Press shows a bitter unanimity in its reception of the proposals of Prince von Buelow as to a Franco-German alliance. Even a rapprochement between France and Germany would, it is declared, be highly distasteful to the French people, which has not forgotten the loss of Alsace and Lorraine. Any attempt to reduce France to the position of a submissive ally of the German Empire is certainly doomed to failure, whether brute force or diplomatic persuasion be employed. Prince. von Buelow's suggestions, in whatever spirit they may have been concived, are roundly declared to be as tactless as they are provocative. "They add insult to injury.” — Such is the opinion of the general French public.</p>

                        <p>The "Standard” has received the following letter from Sir Reginald Wingate Pasha appealing for funds for the construction an English Church at Khartoum :—</p>

                            <opener>
                                <salute>Sir,</salute>
                            </opener>
                            <p>I should esteem it a great favour to be allowed to make an appeal to the readers of your valuable paper on behalf of an English Church in Khartoum. Designs and plans for the building are under the consideration of the Church Committee, and is hoped the work of construction will be commenced in the autumn of this year. The estimated cost is £7000, and towards this amount £3000 have already been raised, almost entirely by local subscriptions. The Government has provided an excellent site, close to the Gordon Statue, where the foundation stone of the chuchh was laid by Prinoess Henry of Battenberg on her visit last year.</p>
                            <p>The Rev. L. Gwynne has been appointed Archdeacon of the Sudan by the Bishop in Jerusalem, and he is now organising our church work with a view to providing service for our rapidly increasing population, not only at Khartoum, but also in the outlying station, such as Suakin, Wady Haifa, and Shendi.</p>
                            <p>The generosity of the British officials and residents in the Sudan will be taxed to the utmost to provide chaplains, and to build churches necessary for these far-scattered stations. Therefore, in order to rect a building at Kharatoum worthy of our Church and nation, we are forced to ask help from those at home.</p>
                            <p>Other communions are making progress with their churches. The aged Patriarch of the Coptic Church in Egypt set a noble example by undertaking a prolonged and arduous journey up the Nile, daring which he collected some £1000 for the building of a chuch in Khartoum, the foundation stone of which he laid on his arrival, and now the edifice is approaching completion. The Roman Church has already a suffient sum for its proposed cathedral, whilst a very handsome mosque has been constructed at a cost of over £13,000.</p>
                            <p>We, therefore, more earnestly ask for the generosity and sympathy of our people at home to enable us to complete the building of our church in Khartonm,</p>
                            <p>Subscriptions will be recieved and acknowledged by A. Dyke Acland, Eq., 186 Strand, W.C. Cheques should be crossed Bank of Egypt, and made payable to the "Khartonm English Church Fund."</p>

                        <p>Roughly speaking there are 1,700 passengers delayed either here or at Suez, and at tie lowest computation some 231,000 tons of cargo and one of the large British India turret ships having 12,500 tons of cargo on board, is expected to-day. A fair estimate of probable arrivals between now and Sunday will be five ships at each end per day, say at least 25 mail vessels by Sunday morning, which will bring up the number of waiting ships to about a hundred and five. In Port Said harbour practically every possible good berth is occupied and in many oases, on the main buoys, there are two ships lying. The Dutch Basin which so far has been used solely for men-of-war has five ships in it The berth "No. 6 Black" has five ships at anchor where one usually lies. The Yam and Oxus lie side by side, as do also the Melenaus and hector; in fact, ships are everywhere, and I think I may safely say, never before has Port Said seen such a sight</p>

                    <p>Il y a Peru de choses à ajouter à ce que none avons dit dans notre dernière chronique concernant la pénurie de numéaire, l'élévation du taux d’escompte, les veraement à opérer t' es liquidations de fin du mois, sinou que l'effet déprimant de ces divers facteurs semble dev i subsister quelques jours encore sur notre marché.</p>
                    <p>Durant la semaine qui vient de s'écouler la cots a subi une baisse presque générale, bien qu'une certaine animation n'ait cassé de prévaloir. Dés lundi las cours fléchissent et aprés un semblant de reprise mercredi la réaction ne fait que s'accentuer jusqu'à la clôture d'ajour-d'hui.</p>
                    <p>Quant aux transactions, alias n'ont au de réelle importance qu'en National Bank, au Agricole et en Nungovich.</p>
                    <p>Le Consiel d’Administration de la D ïra Sa nieh s'est réuni jeudi à la National Bank et a décidé le paiement à la date du 16 courant de £10 par action et de £78 par part de fondateur.

                    <p>Le capital de £500.000 de 1’Anglo-Egyptian Land Allotment Co., (dont Sir W. Wilcocks est le président) a été plus que couvert. Un tiers des actions sera néanmoins offert en souscription publique afin d'obtenir la cotation officielle. Les promoteurs de l’affaire n'ayont pas touché da rénumération pécuniaire, il a été créé poor let dédommagsr, an certain, nombre de ports de fondateurs. Les actions auront droit à un dividende cumulatif de 4 % et le surplus des bénéfices sera divité entre les parts de fondateurs 30 pour cent et les actions 70 pour cent.</p>
                    <p>Aux Sucreries la situation ne s’est pas améliorée: le cours a meme fléchi d'une façon sensible mais purs reprendre en clôture à 43. Le rapport des experts qui a paru le 4 courant n'est pas pour rassurer let actionnaires: on y voit, en effet, que les exercise éjaulés ce soldent tous par das pertes croisssantes variant de 2000 à 120000 Livres; ces pertes étaient combléas par an compte annuel d'arbitrages envoyé de Paris par Crouier et dounant un bénéfice suffisant pour distribuer un dividende et laisser un reliquat.</p>
                    <p>Le prolongement à bréva échéance du Nubarieh dont on a beaucoup parlé deraiérement vient d’etre officiallement démenti, Ce travail a été renvoyé à une date indéterminée et le Gouvernement a suspendu la vents de ses terrains dans la région intéressée attendant d'étre fixé sur ce point</p>
