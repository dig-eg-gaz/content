                        <p>Made in 70 Colors</p>
                        <p>An artistic wall covering.</p>
                        <p>This celebrated water paint is made in two qualities for Inside and
                            Outside work</p>
                        <p>HALL’S SANITARY WASHABLE DISTEMPER is rapidly superseding wall papers in
                            all tastefully furnished homes. It is made in 70 artistic tints, and
                            only requires the addition of water to make it ready for use. It is
                            quickly and easily applied with a whitewash brush, with half the labour
                            and at one third the cost of paint. HALL’S DISTEMPER ensures
                            cleanliness, and is pleasing to the eye. It appeals alike to artistic
                            and practical house decoration. HALL’S DISTEMPER is of special value in
                            hot climates. Owing to its cool, pleasing colours, great
                            weather-resisting and germ-destroying properties, it lends itself to
                            every kind of wall, wood, brick or stone coating, possessing all the
                            advantages of paint, colour- wash, and disinfectant at one third the
                            cost of oil paint. It never blisters in the hottest sun, and the fact
                            that it can be washed adds greatly to its sanitary advantages.</p>

                                however often denied. In a leading article the ‘Westminster Gazette’

                                which is revealed to us is certainly very far from edifying. The

                                or interests which might hare beaa "settled in two hours“ than of
                                the delightful opportunity which presented itself of giving France a
                                good pinch for certain. slights, real or imaginary, which she had
                                offered to Germany in the pterions year. In answer the “Matin" calls
                                us all to witness what a horrible pinch it was, and how dreadfully
                                she suffered between the Ger- man thumb and fore finger. Now, with

                                cannot, help saying that this, seems to us exactly how not to deal

                                badly out of this affair. She has had very good backing throughout;
                                she has not, so far as the rest of us know, yielded anything that
                                was vital to her interest Instead of procceoding with these
                                recrimina- tions, it is surely well for serious politicians in all
                                countries to see if they cannot between them impart a little more
                                sobriety and good . sense into the affaire of Europe. If we are to
                                believe the correspondents, everybody is at present engaged in a
                                singularly foolish game' of trying to detach somebody from somebody
                                else. Germany, having failed to alienate France. from Great Britain,
                                is now trying to detach Russia from France. Great Britain is a
                                supposed to be pulling at the other end of the rope, but also trying
                                to detach France from Russia, or, failing that, to lease an

                                is alternately alarmed feet Great Britain should desire to force a
                                quarrel with Germany, and lest, by making up her differ- ences with
                                Germany, she should withdraw or seem to withdraw her support from

                                into an unwilling partnership with Germany. Is there not something
                                more than a little absurd about this 1 For after all, there is no
                                policy on the board, and nobody can tell as what would happen if the
                                diplomatic cards were reshuffled into any of tho proposed- new
                                heaps. When we ask what it is all about, we are told by Frenchmen
                                that Germany is seek- ing to bring France into “vassalage," and by
                                Germans that France is seeking to “isolate" Germany, and by all the
                                rest that they fear some new combination which may at some future
                                date bring mischief to themselves. Bat when we ask whore the
                                mischief is expected or what would happen if Prince Buelow or M
                                Witte or anybody else succeeded in their nefar- ious designs, the
                                answer is for the most part a pure effort of imagination. It would
                                be for the comfort if not for the pesce of Europe if we would banish
                                most of the vague and abstract 'folk which in there days constitutes
                                so much of foreign politics, and ask ourselves what We fear, or if
                                anything serious is to be feared here and now and in the concrete.
                                Long views are good in their place, bat constant preoccupation with
                                alleged dangers in a remote future leads to a vast deal of the
                                trouble which ‘doesn’t happen”. </p>

                        were mostly suffering from t dysentery, the ship was sent to Moses’ Wells

                    <p>We mentioned a few days ago a serious infringement of the new Pharmacy
                        regulations, whioh came into operation about a year ago, by a Greek named
                        Pistis, who when applying for permission to open a pharmacy, sent in a
                        diploma that was ascertained to have belonged to a man who had.been dead
                        sinoe 1896. Three other oases of quite as serious a nature are now occupying
                        the attention of the Cairo police and Hellenic oonsular authorities. In eaoh
                        instance the applicant for the necessary authorisation to praotise as a
                        ohemist, sent in a diploma purporting to have been issned by the Faculty of
                        Medeoina of Athens, but which has been found to be false. The three
                        individuals, two of whom are Greek subjeots, and the third also Greek but a
                        local subject, have been ar- rested and will be soon brought up for trial,
                        When we mention that in Cairo and suburbs there are no less than 150
                        pharmaoie*, our readers will be able to appreciate the great oire that has

                    <p>The returns of the Nile Valley for September show that the crushing during
                        the month was not quite so satisfactory as in August. The 288 tons crushed
                        yielded 222 ounces of bullion, an average of 15 dwts., compared with a yield
                        of 365 ounces, average 18 dwts. from 405 tons crushed the previous month.
                        The Um Rus results, on the other hand, are an improvement, a crushing of 610
                        tons giving 444 ounces, an average of 14 dwts, against 350 ounces, average
                        10 dwts., from 670 tons in August. </p>

                        Tuesday evening. On the voyage out the company gave a charity matinee
                        performance which realised 485 francs, the sum being divided be- tween the
                        Calabrian sufferers and the Italian National Institute for the orphans of
                        sailors. Sig. Silvini has done much to popularise Shakespearian drama in
                        Italy, having made it his speciality for the last twenty-six years. Sig.
                        Salvini’s repertoire includss the principal roles in Othello, King Lear,
                        Hamlet, The Taming of the Shrew, Much ado about Nothing and Romeo and
                        Juliet, and the Alexandria thea- tre going public should be delighted, at

                    <p>The details to hand of the shooting made by the battleship Bulwark, flagship
                        of Lord Charles Beresford, commanding the Mediterra- nean Fleet, show that
                        the practice was at first simply magnificent. The practice was carried out
                        on two successive days. The first day two 1 12-inch guns recorded seventeen
                        hits out of 1 eighteen rounds, thus constituting a world’s . record.
                        Curiously on the second day, with the same men behind the guns, five rounds
                        were fired and mot one reached to mark. Notwith- standing this rather
                        remarkable occurrence, the big performance of the flagship gave her a goodly
                        percentage, and no doubt she will top the list of the returns. </p>

                        <p>Kafr-el-Zayat station : presents a pitiable spectacle; all traces of the
                            railway accident have disappeared, thanks to the energetic measures
                            taken by the railway officials, but the main platform is dotted here and
                            there with the scorched remnants of the twenty-three bales of cotton
                            which caught fire the same evening, and indeed were so I now understand,
                            in no slight measure the cause of the collision. From the details which
                            I have been able to obtain it appears that the bales caught fire about
                            half past seven, and though all danger of a serious conflagration was
                            almost immediately averted, the smouldering continues throughout the
                            night and occupied the, fall attention of the officials. The consequence
                            of this was that five trucks were left on the line over which the goods
                            train from Alexandria should have passed about midnight and this train
                            collided with the trucks with such force that the engine ran dear over
                            the two trucks, crush- ing them, and derailing several of its own
                            trucks. All the other details as given in the "Egyptian Gazette” on
                            Friday are in every way correct. </p>

                    <p>Carmelo Pisani, a native of Malta, was brought up before Mr. Alban, at the
                        British Consular Court in Cairo, on Saturday morning, charged with the
                        attempted murder of Victoria Dehan, an Austrian subject,who, it was alleged,
                        was his former mistress. The accused, who is about 45 years of age, and. is
                        employed at Port Said by the Suez Canal Company, was brought into court in
                        charge of a consular janissary with his head bandaged. After being
                        charged,the prisoner was remanded until Tuesday at 10 a.m. his Honor, at the
                        same time intimating that he would have to find sureties before he could be
                        released from prison.</p>
                    <p>As far as can be ascertained at present, it seems that Pisani had been living
                        with the Young woman at Port Said for some time, but In consequence of
                        disagreements she left him with another lover, and proceeded to Cairo. The
                        prisoner soon followed the pair, and on discovering their where-abouts he
                        went on Friday afternoon to the house, a small lodging house near Ataba El
                        Khadra, kept by a friend of the young woman. On her refusing to return with
                        him to Port Said, the prisoner, it is alleged, drew a revolver out of his
                        coat pocket and fired at his former mistress, wounding her in the left
                        breast and arm, after which he turned the weapon on himself and fired a
                        second time, but only caused a slight wound. Pisani attempted to run away,
                        but was arrested on the spot, and lodged in Mecshieh prison by one of the
                        janissaries from the British Consulate. </p>

                    <head>PARRICIDE AT TANTA </head>
                    <p>A native of Ridanieh, Tanta Markaz, was on his way to Kiman Sail, Abu-Teeg
                        Markaz, when his sons, who were in ambush for him, suddenly attacked him,
                        bound him, robbed him, ripped him up, flung him into the canal, and made
                        off. The same day they forwarded a forged letter to their step mother,
                        informing her that her husband had left for Syria. The woman, who did not
                        know what could be the cause of this unexpected journey, had her suspicions,
                        and after four days informed the omdeh of her husband’s disappearance. The
                        latter made enquiries and learning that tie man was accompanied by his
                        nephew when he went to Kimam Said, made a thorough search of the nephew’s
                        house. The nephew confessed everything to the omdeh, who sent word to the
                        authorities of Abu-Teeg Markaz. They communicated with their confreres of
                        Tahta Markaz, and-all started to the scene of the murder. At first they
                        found no traces of the murdered man, but at last his corpse was dis- covered
                        in the canal and taken out. They also found in the cross-examination that
                        the sons were the real murderers of their father. It ap- peared that several
                        months ago the father pro- ceeded against his sons on the ground that they
                        had forged a deed of sale in his name, transferring to them four feddans of
                        his lands. The Court, discovering the forgery, condemned them to six months’
                        imprisonment. The mis- creants, in consequence bore a bitter spite against
                        their father, and killed him, disregard- ing the closest human ties. </p>

                        considerable de l’emploi des machines agricoles a vapeur,— deja employees

                        grandes fermes, cest une charrue a vapeur D’une construction tres puissante,
                        tres solide. et pouvant fournir, dans un temps determine. un-travail
                        considerable, e ce qui concern aussi bien la profondeur du labour que la
                        superficie. Dans cet ordre. d'idess, le poids la dimension do la machino,
                        ainsi quo lo prix de la charrue complete, entrent moins en con- sideration,

                        satis- faisante. </p>

                        reduites n'empechant pas toutefois machine d’executer une somme de travar im
                        portante, et une mise en marche facile. Com- me on le comprend aisement, la
                        capacité de travail d'une telle charrue ne peut pas si comparer a celle de
                        la lourde construction dont il est question plus haut, mais cet appa reil

                        qu’on obtient avec des betas de trait, et s'il exige pas, actant quo
                        possible, des fraia exploi- tation plus élevés. Co nest pas seulement pour

                        conditions indiques, presentent une grande importance ; elles sont utiles
                        dune facon generale pour tous les territoires coloniaux et d’outre-mer, eu,

                        nouveaux sont manies par la population arabe des campagues, savent quelle
                        valeur on doit attacher a unc construction solide de ces machines. </p>

                        et suscep- tibles de produire beaucoup de travail, serait possible, car
                        l'alcool-eat fabrique sur une grande echelle dans les environs du Caire, et
                        cet alcool employe pour moteur, poarrait être achete a bas prix. En tous
                        cas, sux prix actuels de l'aloool en Egypte, 1'emploi d’une charrue a alcool
                        reviendrait a peine meilleur marche que celui d’une obarrue a vapeur

                    <p>The St. Petersburg Correspondent of the "Globe" writes :</p>
                    <p>Seeing that the strategic railway, which Russia has been engaged in laying
                        down steadily during the recent war, will enable the military authorities to
                        transport troops from Orenburg, in S.E European Russia, to Tash- kend, the
                        capital of Russian Turkestan and the military headquarters, in the space of
                        96 hours, or four days, this new line of railways running right into tho
                        heart of Russian Central Asia directly from European Russia deserves no
                        little attention outside Russian circles. Since January 14 (new style), the
                        railway has been open to regular passenger and goods traffic. Until that
                        date trains had been run- ning since the end of July, 1904, on the northern
                        section of the line 1 between Orenburg and Kaaalinsk, on the north-east
                        corner of the Sea of Aral, and since the end of last September on the
                        southern section from Kaaalinak to Tashkend. From the end of next January
                        the mails will travel by the line. The total length of the line is 1,734
                        versta, or 1,160 miles ; the northern section is 698 miles in length, and
                        the southern is 689 miles in length. There are 78 railway stations and 104
                        sidings. The principal stations are Orenburg, Kasalinsk, and Tashkend, and
                        then Aktyubinsk, south-east of Orenburg, in the Khirgiz Steppe, Chelkary,
                        Fort Perovaki, on the Syr Daria in the Syr Daria Territory, and the town of
                        Turkestan, farther southwards, near the Syr Daria river, and on the eastern
                        most fringe of the desert of Kisil Kum. As in tho case of laying down the
                        trans-Caspian Railway, now known as the Russian Central Asian Railway, so in
                        the present instance the technical difficulties that had to be overcome were
                        by no means trivial, for, in avoiding the southern spurs of the Urals, the
                        line had to be taken across a waterless steppe for a long distance, and thus
                        a supply of water had to be found. Although artesian wells were sunk in many
                        places, and often to a depth of over 600 feet, vary little water was found,
                        and, when it was found, the water could not be used by the locomotives,
                        because it contained so much salt. Thus, in order to supply such a supreme
                        neces- sity, water-pipes were laid down for a distance of 84 miles, and
                        water s»as obtained from Lake Makpatsa, which is connected with tho Syr
                        Daria, and six stations were equipped with large reservoirs built of iron
                        and concrete. Fur- ther south, water becomes the dreaded foe of the
                        undertaking, for the railway runs along the right bank of the SyrDaria, and
                        every precaution had to be taken to protect the line from being flooded, as
                        tho Syr Daria’s level is higher than the surrounding country, and tho river
                        over- flows its banks in the spring and floods the country for a distance of
                        seven miles. Thus it was necessary to build an embankment and bridge , lay
                        down drainage works, for carrying off tho water supplied by tributary
                        streams and build dams.</p>
                    <p>The Orenburg and Tashkend Railway was taken over by the Government
                        authorities and thrown open to regular traffic at the end of last July on
                        tho northern section, and full regular traffic will be opened on the
                        southern section on November 97 next. On that day a new branch line of the
                        Samara and Slatoust railway will be thrown open between Vinzl and Orenburg
                        in connection with the railway thence to Tashkend, and thereby the length of
                        the Orenburg and Tashkend Railway will be increased to at least 1,340 miles.
                        The "Russki Invalid," the well-known offi- cial organ of the Russian War
                        Office, asks very opportunely : Of what value to Russia will tho Orenburg
                        and Ta*h!,end Railways be from a military aspect, and how great is its
                        importance. The journal referred to then replies with the following
                        observations : — "For maintaining its influence and for pro- tecting our
                        possessions in Central Asia, as also with a yiew to paralysing certain .
                        mani- festations unfavorable to us, which have cropped up in the sphere of
                        international politics, Russia is compelled to maintain an immense body of
                        troops in the General'Go- Vernment of Tarkestan. In the present state of the
                        development of the defensive strength of every nation it is difficult to
                        count upon win- ning decisive victories by means of the Tark- estan troops,
                        in spite their excellent soldierly qualities, so that they are to be
                        regarded as being only an advanced detachment, whose duty it is to keep the
                        line for, and to support, the main army on its way to the front. As a result
                        of the great distances which separate out Central Asian possessions front
                        European Russia as a base the timely dispatch of rein- forcements from home
                        into Central Asia is of very great importance. If the importance of the
                        Orenburg and Tashkend Railway is consi- dered from this aspect then we must
                        arrive at the condoaion that Russia's tasks in Centras Asia are rendered now
                        so much earner, that we can look into the future with absolute composure. At
                        every season of the year large bodies of troops will be able to be conveyed
                        quickly into the heart of Central Asia by Means of the Orenburg and Tashkend
                        Railway whenever such a step shall becalled for by the march of political
                        events. This it is which represents the great Advantage of having sad a
                        railway as that between Orenburg and Tashkend. We hope that circumstances
                        will not compel us to let the consideration expressed above become an actual
                        fact. It remains to be pointed out that this northern section of the railway
                        sugared las winter severely from snowdrifts, with which the authorities were
                        enable to cope and the trains could not run for many days at a time This,
                        with snowdrifts in the northern section and inundations by the Syr Daria in
                        the southern section, the immediate successful working of the railway it ly
                        no means full; assured during the winter and spring sea- sons. But Russian
                        railway engineers won the day in laying down the Trans-Caspian Rail- way
                        against great odd-, and they may be suc- cessful again in the snow swept
                        steppe and low lying region of Syr Daria. As to the real object of the
                        railway there can be not the Smallest doubt. </p>

                    <head>FROM CHINA TO HADES.</head>
                    <p>A VERY COSTLY JOURNEY. </p>
                    <p>In the city of Fungtu is a temple which is regarded with unspeakable awe, for
                        under this shrineiiapaMagewhi.hu supposed to lead ( far down beneath the
                        surface of the earth. No native would care to investigate this subter-
                        ranean way. Here is tho traditional avenue from the Flowery Land to Hades.
                        Of course, there are very various doctrines about this Avenues, but it is
                        astounding how positive they all are. My missionary friends have given me
                        different versions of the Chinese beliefs concerning the realms below. .All
                        agree in certain particulars, while in different pro- vinces details
                        diverge. From the Fungtu Temple of Hades tho descent is through about twenty
                        levels, in each of which are many ramifications leading to subterranean
                        cities, presided over by gods who once were great, rich, and good men. These
                        were able to buy the highest Hadean dignities with what was paid for them by
                        surviving relatives, to whom they left large sums for the purpose. The idea
                        that every position of honor may be gained by bribery is, in the Chinese
                        creed, applied to other worlds besides this. Indeed, it is evident that
                        bribery flourishes far more in the subterranean spheres than in this
                        sublunary region.</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, if a citizsn of the Middle King- dom is wealthy, his journey,to
                        Hades will be expensive indeed.He will be able to secure there everything
                        that he wants if he can take with him the cash. He will be able to practice
                        "graft” on a stupendous scale. He will find it easy -to ‘bribe porters,
                        gatekeepers, demon guards, torturing fiends, and gods, if he can command as
                        a ghost the funds needed. And he needs immense resources as soon as he
                        leaves this world, for he has much to encounter. The nature of his
                        experience we will consider presently. For the moment we may take special
                        note of the grotesque but really formid- able financial aide of his
                        extraordinary phase of life throughout the whole Chinese Empire. All the
                        millions of the people, from the Imperial family downward, are affected by
                        the considerations involved.</p>
                    <p>An American missionary of my acquaintance, who has resided many years in
                        China, had a long conversation the day after Li Hung Chang's death with a
                        highly educated China- man living next door to that famous states man’s
                        palace. It is we'l known that Li Hung Chang was one of the wealthiest men in
                        the world. The missionary asked this member of the literati how much it
                        would cost for Li to get into Hades so as to find favor with the
                        subterranean powers. The answer was given in precise terms, without the
                        slightest hesitation. "The cost for that great and very rich man will be
                        five millions of taels.” Now, 5,000,000 taels would be about equivalent to
                        £600,000. "How much," continued the interrogator, "would it cost for an
                        Emperor or Empress “ "Not less than ten million taels.” “How mach would bsbe
                        the passage to the other world of a Viceroy” "About three million taels.” As
                        a missionary from Southern China said to me. "There are three great
                        religions in China, bot this does not mean that some of the people are
                        distinctively Confocianists, others Taoists, and others Buddhists. It means
                        this, that every typical Chinaman is a Con- fucianist in his everyday
                        philosophy if he is at all educated ; but is a Taoist at his wedding and at
                        all the great functions of his active life and is a most earnest Buddhist at
                        his death. The three cults are inextricably mixed. At Li Hung Chang's death
                        the Empress Dowager contributed munificently towards the paraphernalia of
                        the funeral, and also towards his journey to the other world. She gave a
                        million taels, a golden shovel as an em- blem of the grave-digging, a gem
                        hoe, a baton a dragon-embroidered gown, a wonder- ful coffin cover, and a
                        string of the most august titles. Dr. Macklin, the American missionary from
                        whom I have already quoted, who knows the Chinese intimately, and is a most
                        accomplished scholar in the language, says that the universal notion of the
                        people is that only when money can be used in the next world are the
                        departed happy, and accordingly only the rich can enjoy felicity there. For
                        the poor the outlook is infernal indeed. What, then, can be done on behalf
                        of the poor with regard to their fateful journey The answer to this question
                        throws vivid light on the curious and universal use of paper money for the
                        dead, and of all sorts of articles manufactured in gold and silver tinsel,
                        which are need in funeral ceremonies. Great officials leave elaborate
                        directions and large sums of money for the for the erection of their temples
                        after their death. In these their tablets are placed, and offerings of
                        incense and paper money are burned. Dr Mioklin “I have seen the funeral of a
                        Tartar General when the people placed tables in front of their doors, with
                        pots of incense burning. Possibly the idea is that a great man has gone, and
                        that ho may say some- thing evil against them to the devil, and so they do
                        something to secure the goodwill of the great man."</p>
                    <p>According to popular belief the poor cannot get into Hades at all unless the
                        charitable supply the neccesary where with hal in sacri floes of paper
                        money. They are ghosts wander- ing in the gloom, and may be sent back to
                        earth to haunt the places where they lived, and where they may play all
                        sorts of havoc. Large numbers of people to all parts of China gain their
                        livelihood by make- ing the paper money for the use of the spirits. As the
                        work is easy it employs thousands of women and of people who are not strong
                        enough for hard manual labour. The gifts of paper money are most elaborately
                        regulated by the psychological doctrine prevailing. A homes being is
                        supposed to prossess three spirits, and so has a triple immortality. The
                        three spirits are imprisoned in the body in this earthly life, but they part
                        company entirely at death. One remains by the grave. This it the largest
                        spirit of the three and it sometimes reckoned to be twelve feet tall! For
                        its use copions quantities of the cheapest sort of the mock money are
                        supplied at the annual family visit to the grave. These coins, sprinkled
                        over the tomb, are merely circular bits of tissue paper. The second spirit
                        looks hospitality in the old home, and every son is axious that all due
                        courtesy should be displayed to this permanent guest The accom- modation is
                        supplied in the ancestral tablet The little wooden structure which is
                        regarded with such boundless veneration. The third is, of course, an exile
                        from this world, for it 3 goes to the lower regions. Now, as all three
                        spirits exact punctilioos respect is it wonder- ful that the people are
                        incessantly engaged in attending to the wants of their defunct rela-
                        tives.</p>
                    <p>The mock mint is abundant in its make- believe commodities. Though the grave
                        spirit of the departed is contented with tissue coin, the ghost in the
                        ancestral tablet must have silver coin put before him with the incense. This
                        is made for the most part of course yellowish paper, a square of tinsel
                        adorning the centre of the disc. But the spirit is not supported to
                        distinguish between this rubbish and real silver dollars. For the spirits in
                        Hades gold coin must be expended, and this species of spiritual pocket-money
                        is also a very cheap cheat, as it is made of exactly the same stuff,
                        varnished over with vivid gamboge. It can only be conveyed to the Hadean
                        bank by fire, so that it is burned with the incense. Many authorities have
                        to be; propitiated in Hades, and this is the reason why so much money is
                        needed there. Yen Lo Wang, Em- peror of the whole lower world, is avaricious
                        enough, but his two assessors, the cow headed and the horse-headed
                        divinities, seen seated one on each side of him. in many of the pictures the
                        Buddhist temples, are about as covetous. Then there are ten gods who guard
                        the various chief gates. He ask for money. The white and black demons who
                        act as marshals all exact tribute. And so do the many demons of torture, for
                        they are all open to bribery, And as the rich on earth have generally prac-
                        tised the art of "graft" on a very liberal scale indeed, they have nothing
                        to complain of when they become the subjects of it in their ghostly shape.
                        There it nothing in all the philosophies or religions of the world so
                        fantastic or grotes- que as this doctrine of the mammon of Hades, cherished
                        tenaciously by the Chinese mind, And the general testimony of my missionary
                        friends is that the wonderful fidelity shown by in the converts, as
                        heroically proved during the Boxer tribulation, is largely, due to the joy
                        they feel at their emancipation from this fright- ful tradition.</p>

                    <head>THE SCRIPTURE PLAY</head>
                    <p>The production at tbt Coliseum Music-hall of "Joseph and His Brethren" is a
                        noteworthy „ event. The title suggests I believe, correctly that the
                        familiar story of Joseph, with the n incidents of the well, the temptation
                        by Poti- Phar’s wife, the interpretation of dreams, and the reconciliation,
                        is given upon the stage. The presentation is contrived partly by per-
                        formance in dumb show and partly by stage tableaux, whilst more or less
                        explanatory music is sung by Mr. Franklyn Clive and the Coliseum chorus.
                        Perhaps it is advisable to state at once that I have not seen the enter-
                        tainment. The important aspect is that for the first time in London the
                        general paying public has been permitted to see upon a stage representation
                        of Script oral characters deem- ed by a large number of people to be sacred.
                        It has long been understood that the Censor has a fixed law that personages
                        named in the Scriptures shall not be presented in the the thea- tree under
                        his control, and it is a curious feature of oar licensing system that a
                        piece; the performance of which presumably would have been forbidden in any
                        London playhouse, is permitted at the music-hall in St Martin’s- lane.
                        Perhaps an even stranger aspect lies in fact that whilst nothing may be
                        presented in a Metropolitan playhouse that has not been considered in
                        advance and approved by an official, dramatic works are offered to the
                        patrons of variety theatres which have never been considered officially by
                        anybody, the only material check upon the managers of the halls being the
                        fear if trouble at the yearly application for the renewal of licences. It is
                        notorious that, owing to a fantastic compro- mise between the Theatrical
                        Managers’ Asso- ciation and the owners of music-halls, dramatic pieces of a
                        certain length, and requiring no more than a specified number of performers
                        are given in the halls, though forbidden by law. A lawyer might wonder why
                        the L.C.C., when the applications for renewal of licences are made, does not
                        concern itself with the fact that these illegal entertainments are given. No
                        doubt the L.C.C. adapts a judicious hide-your- head-in-the sand kind of
                        policy, hot the result is amusing.</p>
                    <p>The singular fact emerges that a piece which may not be performed at His
                        Majesty’s because of its nature is presented at the Coliseum illegally and
                        yet without fear of - inconvenient consequences. The result is the breach of
                        an old tradition in the English enter- tainment world—that Scriptural
                        personages shall not be presented for the sake of gain as dramatic persons
                        of a play. Some people will rejoice at this gain of freedom; to me the
                        advantage seems doubtful. The Censor, the abolition of whose office I would
                        hail with joy, has adopted a very safe working rule. It may be the foot that
                        the Coliseum entertainment will not give offense to anyone. Certainly
                        Scriptural characters and subjects might be presented—and are—under
                        extraordinary cir- cumstances in such a fashion as to shook nobody ; but the
                        task of deciding upon the reading of a M.S. or even after a dress rehearsal,
                        whether a particular work would be offensive or not to persons whose
                        feelings ought to be taken into account is one of such terrific difficulty
                        that the Censor w y be well excused, for shirking it Presumably his
                        arguments can be summed up in a few lines : he would say that there are
                        plenty of other subjects for treatment which, under the circumstances of the
                        stage, would have quite as great a moral effect, if any, as Scriptural
                        subjects; that there is always a real risk of offending many people, and
                        certainly of grieving some: that no exercise of judgment by an individual
                        censor can prevent errors of judgment that would involve disrespect to
                        religion ; and that in cases where such entertainments are intended to be
                        given primarily for the sake of filthy lucre it is better to run the risk of
                        erring on the side of intolerance than on the side of licence.</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, it will be said that many persons are in favor of the
                        production of Scriptural plays and that I am plus royalists que le roi;
                        indeed, I understand that one of the cloth assisted at the rehearsals. Of
                        him personally I know nothing, but I am aware I that many persons possess
                        very little judg- ment, and that not a few are very simple, minded and can
                        be induced to lead the sanction of theory status to very questionable
                        entertain- ments. For instance, in my opinion, "Thieving of the Cross" was a
                        very harmful work. No doubt the lesson it preached was sound, but the
                        methods were deplorable. Many people who had never been before to the
                        theatre went to see it, and either were (booked by the revels of the young
                        women in rights, not being case- hardened to the indedency of each
                        “xhibitions as ordinary playgoers are, and never visited the theatre again;
                        or were shocked and delight- ted and injured. To me, though it is quite
                        possible that the result was unintentional, there seemed a most adroit
                        combination of the world, the flesh, and the devil, in which an ingenious
                        catoh-penny method was adopted of providing an exouse for going to the
                        theatre and seeing a fleshly ballet, to those who other- wise would have
                        kept out of the way of temptation, Nevertheless dreams of parsons,
                        simple-minded creatures, were induced in- nocently to co-operete with the
                        management In rendering the work popular, in attracting to the
                        sense-exciting spectacle young men and young women lacking the training of
                        the ordinary playgoers, who after seeing pantomime ballets from childhood
                        are able to look upon the most daring efforts of the costumiers and stage
                        director without a blush or an extra throb of the pulse. I, of course do not
                        pretend to be shocked by ballets And the like, since I belong to the
                        case-harden- Ed and to me performers, whatever their costumes, are more
                        puppets whose movements, and forms sometimes, but too rarely, are beau-
                        tiful It appears to me that a relaxation of the Censors rule would result in
                        many unsavoury combinations of the Scriptures and step dano- g, of Biblical
                        stories and ballets which must prove injurious; and that the utmost
                        vigilance licensing would not prevent scandal. For What object is the risk
                        to be run. For the sake Of drama. Surely no ; there are plenty of subjects
                        for treatment without trespassing on These grounds, and the time has gone
                        when man could write such a native work as "Every- man.” To the real

                        managers and shareholders to make money by exploiting the scriptures. Why
                        should they, seeing there would be no gain to art, and much offence to any
