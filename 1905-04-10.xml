                            be held at the Khedivial Opera House. The prices, considering the
                            expense of such a large company, are most reasonable, and even off these

                    <head>THE ASSOUAN DAM. NEW THEORY OF STRAIN EXPLAINED.</head>
                    <byline>(FROM A CORRESPONDENT.) </byline>
                    <dateline>London, April 3. </dateline>
                    <p>There has hardly been time yet to have received the criticisms of the wise
                        men of Europe and America on the recent decisions of the Egyptian Government
                        to postpone—for tho present-the completion, as some eminent men are pleased
                        to call it, of the dam at Assouan by increasing the height by some eighteen
                        feet. Such men do not care to commit themselves in a hurry when a fresh
                        proposition, of a nature such as this, is first put before them. We must
                        have patience yet before we can expect to receive the general opinions of
                        scientific authorities. </p>
                    <p>For one, however, who has been familiar with all the details of this great
                        work from the commencement, as is tho case with the consulting engineer, Sir
                        Benjamin Baker, it is not surprising that he should give the public the
                        benefit of his views, however slight, as early as possible. They have indeed
                        a right to expect it. Sir Benjamin has informed a reporter of the "Daily
                        Mail" that this decision of tho Egyptian authorities is by no means entirely
                        due to tho theories recently propounded by the learned mathematicians.
                        Primarily it is due, according to Sir Benjamin, to the fact that during his
                        recent visit he found it neccessary to advise the authorities that the
                        apron, or floor of masonry, a small portion of which was put down last year,
                        must be extended along the whole length of the dam, so as to protect the
                        base of the structure from any mischief in future, such as might be caused
                        by the great rush of water through the sluices which at times, when it rises
                        to the sixty feet level, has such a pressure that it flows through the
                        sluices at the rate of over 36 miles an hour. </p>
                    <p>The diagrams below, which I have taken from the "Daily Mail," will better
                        enable your readers to understand this:— </p>
                    <!-- image and notes -->
                    <p>In the opinion of several engineers with whom I have discussed the question,
                        this alone is sufficient reason for "going slow" for the present, although
                        some think the necessity for this work should have been foreseen from the
                        commencement and therefore undertaken earlier. However that may be, the
                        decision is considered a wise one, if there were no other reason to justify
                        it. But there is yet another reason, for some months ago the theory of Mr.
                        Atcherley and Professor Karl Pearson that the stresses are also in a
                        vertical direction as well as horizontal, was propounded in a pamphlet,
                        which, as soon as it came into the hands of the Egyptian authorities set
                        them, "a-thinking." Their consulting engineer was called out to examine and
                        discuss the theory on tho spot, with the result as is known. </p>
                    <p>I have seen some hard things said of the Egyptian authorities as to their
                        action being too sudden, and influenced more by the present condition of
                        land speculation than the question of the stability of the dam. These ideas
                        have found little favor among those who know Egypt,—quite the contrary. It
                        is thought that the country should be congratulated as having a strong and
                        capable Government, who at once took the public into their confidence, and
                        told them the true state of affairs. Nothing could justify the Government in
                        taking the slightest risk on what for Egypt is a most interesting question.
                        If anything were to happen to the dam—of which now there is not the
                        slightest chance—it would mean that, the Blue Nile would in future would
                        have to be spelt Blue Ruin, so fearful would be the consequences of its
                        escape. </p>
                    <p>No doubt this has been a disappointment to several people, who are interested
                        in helping to develop the uncultivated lands of Egypt, and who were rightly
                        expecting that the additional supply of water would soon enable them to do
                        this. Some of these are adversely criticizing the action of the Government,
                        as for the moment they have received a cold douche. But are they justified,
                        in face of all the facts which have been given to the public? If they only
                        have patience they will get all the water they want, and this sooner than is
                        generally anticipated. Land companies, which are started under proper
                        auspices and conditions, will no doubt do a great deal of good for this
                        country; for they not only find the necessary capital and organization which
                        the fellaheen have not got, but they also bring the land into cultivation
                        and a paying condition, with a view to selling it to the natives afterwards,
                        so that eventually the people will own a still further quantity of land than
                        at present. This is all in the right direction and "marking time," which the
                        "dam question" now calls for, can only be for the good of the country, from
                        whatever point of view it is looked at. </p>

                        first magnitude is being talked of in certain City circles, which would own
                        various concessions and have a total capital of £600,000, of which £450,000
                        would be allocated to working capital. It remains to be seen, of course,
                        whether theo nature of the concessions is such as to afford sufficient
                        justification for the expenditure of so large a sum upon them. </p>

                        day. This was too much, and the writer of the petition was also "sent down"
                        on Thursday last. </p>
                    <p>Friday was a dies non, and on Saturday the pupils returned in the morning and
                        having arranged a plan of campaign departed in the afternoon, and on to the
                        present have not returned. Only four appear to have declined to join the
                        strike. </p>
                    <p>The situation is not pleasant and great sympathy is felt with Dr. Mackenzie,
                        the head master, whose relations with his pupils have always been excellent. </p>
                    <p>It is impossible to say what will be the upshot of this movement among the
                        pupils. We are inclined to think that it has been engineered from Cairo
                        "pour embeter les Anglais." </p>

                    <p>The ball began at 9.30 p.m. and dancing was kept up with great vigour until
                        an early hour this morning. A well-stocked buffet was prepared for the

                        <p>Operations have at last been started on the Norwegian ship "Congal",
                            which, it will be remembered was sunk in harbour by the Harrison liner
                            "Craftsman'' and has for a long time lain there, causing great
                            inconvenience to the Canal Company. The Constantinople Salvage
                            Association were approached by the owners and insurers of the vessel and
                            two of their salvage steamers have been here, but left again without
                            doing anything, and it appears that they asked £60,00 for raising her.
                            This sum was not accepted. She is insured for £5,000 and is vessel of
                            some thirty years old, so It Is easily understood that the Insurers
                            would have nothing to do with the salving of her at such a cost. The
                            result was that a court case was started, and she was handed over to the
                            Canal Company to do what they wished with her. </p>
