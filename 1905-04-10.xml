                <p>PENANG, April 8. Steamers arriving here report the sighting of both Russian and
                    Japanese warships in the Straits. An engagement is expected. (Reuter.) LONDON,
                    April 8. The Standard learns from Singapore that 27 warships, believed to be
                    Japanese, have been sighted emerging 70 miles to the south west of Penang.
                    (Reuter.) SINGAPORE, April 8. The British S.S. Tara reports that she sighted 17
                    Russian ships 130 miles north of Singapore. (Reuter.) SINGAPORE, April 8. 4p.m.
                    The Russian warships, including 25 transports, are now passing Singapore,
                    steering north east. (Reuter.) SINGAPORE, April 9. The Baltic fleet, composed of
                    6 battleships, 9 scullers, 8 destroyers, 3 converted Hamburg-American liners, 3
                    volunteer ships, 16 colliers, one salvage ship and one hospital ship was
                    steaming at a speed of 8 knots. The fleet showed evidence of a long voyage in
                    tropical waters.All the ships had seaweed along their waterline. The fleet
                    passed 7 miles out and, consequently, exchanged no salutes. The Russian Consul
                    visited the Vice Admiral’s ship and conversed from a launch without going on
                    board. The fleet was burning soft coal giving off tremendous smoke which was
                    visible for miles. The fleets submarine men were at their posts all day, and on
                    the alert, and the fleet disappeared eastwards at 5 o’clock in the afternoon.
                    There is no further news regarding the Baltic fleet. (Reuter.) SINGAPORE, April
                    10. The Baltic fleet mentioned yesterday did include the most important fighting
                    units, the flagship “Kniaz Suvaroff,” the “Imperial Alexander II,” and the
                    “Borodino”-with the implement of cruisers and destroyers. Their whereabouts are
                    unknown. (Reuter.) </p>

                    <head>THE ASSOUAN DAM. NEW THEORY OF STRAIN EXPLAINED.</head>
                    <p>(FROM A CORRESPONDENT.) London, April 3. There has hardly been time yet to
                        have received the criticisms of the wise men of Europe and America on the
                        recent decisions of the Egyptian Government to postpone—for tho present-the
                        completion, as some eminent men are pleased to call it, of the dam at
                        Assouan by increasing the height by some eighteen feet. Such men do not care
                        to commit themselves in a hurry when a fresh proposition, of a nature such
                        as this, is first put before them. We must have patience yet before we can
                        expect to receive the general opinions of scientific authorities. For one,
                        however, who has been familiar with all the details of this great work from
                        the commencement, as is tho case with the consulting engineer, Sir Benjamin
                        Baker, it is not surprising that he should give the public the benefit of
                        his views, however slight, as early as possible. They have indeed a right to
                        expect it. Sir Benjamin has informed a reporter of the "Daily Mail” that
                        this decision of tho Egyptian authorities is by no means entirely due to tho
                        theories recently propounded by the learned mathematicians. Primarily it is
                        due, according to Sir Benjamin, to the fact that during his recent visit he
                        found it neccessary to advise the authorities that the apron, or floor of
                        masonry, a small portion of which was put down last year, must be extended
                        along the whole length of the dam, so as to protect the base of the
                        structure from any mischief in future, such as might be caused by the great
                        rush of water through the sluices which at times, when it rises to the sixty
                        feet level, has such a pressure that it flows through the sluices at the
                        rate of over 36 miles an hour. The diagrams below, which I have taken from
                        the “Daily Mail,” will better enable your readers to understand this:— In
                        the opinion of several engineers with whom I have discussed the question,
                        this alone is sufficient reason for “going slow” for the present, although
                        some think the necessity for this work should have been foreseen from the
                        commencement and therefore undertaken earlier. However that may be, the
                        decision is considered a wise one, if there were no other reason to justify
                        it. But there is yet another reason, for some months ago the theory of Mr.
                        Atcherley and Professor Karl Pearson that the stresses are also in a
                        vertical direction as well as horizontal, was propounded in a pamphlet,
                        which, as soon as it came into the hands of the Egyptian authorities set
                        them, “a-thinking." Their consulting engineer was called out to examine and
                        discuss the theory on tho spot, with the result as is known. I hate seen
                        some hard things said of the Egyptian authorities as to their action being
                        too sudden, and influenced more by the present condition of land speculation
                        than the question of the stability of the dam. These ideas have found little
                        favor among those who know Egypt,—quite the contrary. It is thought that the
                        country should be congratulated as having a strong and capable Government,
                        who at once took the public into their confidence, and told them the true
                        state of affairs. Nothing could justify the Government in taking the
                        slightest risk on what for Egypt is a most interesting question. If anything
                        were to happen to the dam—of which now there is not the slightest chance—it
                        would mean that, the Blue Nile would in future would have to be spelt Blue
                        Ruin, so fearful would be the consequences of its escape. No doubt this has
                        been a disappointment to several people, who are interested in helping to
                        develop the uncultivated lands of Egypt, and who were rightly expecting that
                        the additional supply of water would soon enable them to do this. Some of
                        these are adversely criticizing the action of the Government, as for the
                        moment they have received a cold douche. But are they justified, in face of
                        all the facts which have been given to the public? If they only have
                        patience they will get all the water they want, and this sooner than is
                        generally anticipated. Land companies, which are started under proper
                        auspices and conditions, will no doubt do a great deal of good for this

                        the fellaheen have not got, but they also bring the land into cultivation
                        and a paying condition, with a view to selling it to the natives afterwards,
                        so that eventually the people will own a still further quantity of land than
                        at present. This is all in the right direction and “marking time," which the
                        “dam question" now calls for, can only be for the good of the country, from
                        whatever point of view it is looked at. </p>

                        divided gives a total dividend which could be given to present shareholders
                        of 10.45 %. These figures do not include the net profit earned on overdrafts
                        at the National Bank of Egypt, which is an unknown and variable quantity,
                        but which must nevertheless be considered as an important factor in any
                        estimate of profits. The effect of issuing £1,250,000 new shares of £5 each
                        will be as follows. Existing shareholders will lend another £5, making a
                        total of £10 advanced by each shareholder on the old and new issues. The new
                        issue put out at 9%. will yield a gross profit of £112,500 Deduct 5%

                        first magnitude is being talked of in certain City circles, which would own
                        various concessions and have a total capital of £600,000, of which £450,000
                        would be allocated to working capital. It remains to be seen, of course,
                        whether theo nature of the concessions is such as to afford sufficient
                        justification for the expenditure of so large a sum upon them. </p>

                    <p>A regrettable incident, or rather a series of incidents, has taken place at
                        the Polytechnic School at Ghizeh. It appears that last Tuesday a pupil, on

                        and, backed the objection by comments that resulted in his being reported to
                        the head master. It seems that be refused to apologize and was “sent down”
                        for a week, whereupon a number of his fellow students sent in a petition on
                        his behalf. The petition was not granted and his sympathetic friends struck

                        departed in the afternoon, and on to the present have not returned. Only
                        four appear to have declined to join the strike. The situation is not
                        pleasant and great sympathy is felt with Dr. Mackenzie, the head master,
                        whose relations with his pupils have always been excellent It is impossible
                        to say what will be the upshot of this movement among the pupils. We are

                        that the Insurers would have nothing to do with the salving of her at such a
                        cost. The result was that a court case was started, and she was handed over
                        to the Canal Company to do what they wished with her. </p>
