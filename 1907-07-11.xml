                        other ancient ruins and the Venetian fortifications, the finest in the

                            <p>THE EGYPTIAN BOOM. BY SIR R. HAMILTON LANG. ( Concluded.) All the
                                same, it is important to ascertain he causes which have created that
                                discontent d party and the grievances of which it com blains. The
                                causes are essentially human,and n some degree natural. The motto on
                                Mustapha Kamel's newspaper, The Egyptian Standard, hose first number
                                was issued in March last, is "Egypt for the Egyptians," This is a
                                catching entiment, and indicates that the aim of the arty is to get
                                rid of British guidance. It is be ery of the petulant boy, against
                                the disapline of his tutor, and in that respect is very buman, but
                                not necessarily reasonable. It ignore the fact that British guidance
                                has delivered Egypt from a system of autocratic rule which ruined
                                Egypt for the Egyptians, has developed to an andreamed of extent.
                                the natural resouroes of the country, has substituted progress for
                                stagnation and civilising, influences for barbaric ways. These
                                results are not denied by the National ist party, but its contention
                                today is that it is now able to do without its mentor and govern
                                alone. That this pretension is unfounded even impartial Egyptians
                                acknowledge. After an absence from the country of ten years, I was
                                rejoiged to observe the marked progress which the spread of
                                education is making. I saw a type of young Egyptians at the
                                Government offices, at the railway stations and steam-boat agencies,
                                well-mannered, educated, intelligent, which scarcely existed a
                                decade ago; and when I made this remark to the best informed
                                education ist in the country, he replied, "You forget that every
                                year, we have been turning out from our schools six to seven hundred
                                such young men, and in ten years that counts." I noticed that at
                                important Mediries where ten years ago British functionaries were in
                                charge, I found their place occupied, and most creditably ocupied,
                                by Peyptians. Progress is evident. Education and inocula tion from
                                hodest surroundings and good example are showing their fruits on the
                                Payptinn character. But it requires more than decade for a nation
                                which only began its education when British guidance made it
                                possible to acquire the qualities which reoder it capable of
                                self-government. The essential is that the growth in the acquisition
                                of these qualities should be gradual and continuous, and I had
                                pleasure in being satisfied that such is the case in Egypt. The
                                pretension, however, implied in the motto of the Nationalist
                                part-"Egypt for Egyptina--is prematare, and must at present be
                                declared unreasonable Of actual grievances I could hear of none
                                which justify the hostile attitude of the Nationalist party to the
                                present rígime. In the second number of Mustapha Kamel's paper, "The
                                Egyptian Standard," there is a lengthy denunciation of what is
                                called Lord Cromer's policy, qualified antiEgyptian It asserts, in
                                the first place, that "not all Egyptians have profited by the
                                apparent state of prosperity, and that misery is common among the
                                poorer classes"; in the second place, that "the Egyptians did not
                                revolt in 1889 in order to pre several millions sterling more in the
                                excbequer, but to obtain a constitution, just laws, and a national,
                                bonest, and respected goremament." It is ridiculous to talk of
                                misery among the poorer classes when wages are at least 40 per cent
                                higher than ever before. Of the revolt of 1882 the least said, the
                                better. It was its failure which brought to Egypt just laws and an
                                honest government. The article goes on to say that the same policy
                                strack down the late Menabawi Pashs, and it did not hesitate in
                                ponishing the poor fellaheen in the horrible Denshawi case, simply
                                because they had defended their property and their wives." This
                                latter is a ourious travesty of panishments inflicted for brutally
                                Assaulting British officers. As to Menshawi Pasha, rich and
                                influential, he was justly arrested and punished by a court of law
                                for mistreating a poor subordinata The article proceeds to criticise
                                the pre motion of a judge, against whom the only fault alleged is
                                that how members of the court which tried the Denshawions, the
                                dismissal of two other judges" because they were patriots." The fact
                                is, serious gries anoes there are one. The solo grievance of the
                                discontented party is that they are not in power but it would be
                                unwise to put men in power who cry for parliamentary government
                                before the country is educated up to it to who declare themselves
                                hostile to a regime which has made the country prosperous, in which
                                administers even-handed justice to small and great. Discontent
                                springing from intentional ambitions requires only a firm and jus
                                hand to deal with it. With the freedom, pe haps too. grost, allowed
                                to the Preseth noise of the discontented is out of all proportion to

                                ones no serion alarm. Our duty is steadfastly to pursue firm, jast,
                                and strong policy, having only i view the true interests, moral and
                                material of Egypt. Such, undoubtedly, was the policy of Lord Cromer,
                                and it was the secret of his great success It would have been

                            the shares fully paid up. Up to now £2 of the £4 have only been paid.
                            Probably both these decisions will be voted and then the company will

                        <p>The tug "Hercule," which has been built for the Suez Canal Company by
                            Messrs. J.P. Rennoldson and Sons, of South Shields, has just taken up
                            her duties in the Canal. It is claimed that she is the most powerful tog
                            afloat, and this may well be 80, seeing that her machinery is of
                            8,000.i.h.p. She is a twin screw.vessel, 158 ft. long by 32 ft. beam and
                            17 ft. deep, classed 100 A1 at Lloyd's. Two centrifugal salvage pumps
                            capable of discharging 700 tons per hour, and a fire-pump by Messrs.
                            Merryweather, with a capacity of 650 gallons per minute, are installed
                            on board. The deck machinery consists of a steam windlass, tiro steam
                            capstans, and two steam-driven reels for working the towing hawsers.
                            There is a saloon in the fore part, and electric light, including a
                            powerful Suez type projector, are fitted. The "Hercule" is an improved
                            sister ship of the WTitan," built by the same firm for the Suez Canal
                            Company about eight years ago.</p>

                        which took place yesterday evening at 7 o'clock at his residence 17
                        Rosetta-street, Alexandria. Mr. Campos was in his usual health up to last
                        Saturday when an abscess gathered in his throat to which he succumbed. Mr.
                        Campos arrived in Egypt in 1854 and was among the first Alexandrian cotton
                        operators. He was a courteous and genial old gentleman and his death will be
                        regretted by a large number of friends among all classes of society in
                        Egypt. He was over seventy years of age. As a mark of sympathy the

                    <p>A Cairo correspondent writes -</p>
                    <p>Complaints against the Cairo City Police are very frequent and although in
                        many cases reasonable grounds of complaint are produced, yet complainants
                        are frequently ignorant of the real facts of the case. For example: it is a
                        well known fact, or should be, that the Cairo City Police are very much
                        understaffed ; not on paper, but for practical purposes, and great deal, in
                        fact by far the larger part of the capital 18 patrolled by ghaflirs owing to
                        the shortness of the uniformed staff. The explanation is not very difficult
                        to find. A very large number of uniformed staff are on duty at banks and
                        other public institutions. In fact the public would be surprised to know the
                        actual percentage of the public forces soconded in this manner. Consequently
                        the police are subjected to all sorts of criticism from individuals who do
                        not know the real facts.</p>

                    <head>THR KHEDIVE'S RAILWAY.</head>
                    <p>The Khedive's line, which is advancing gradually westwards from its .
                        terminus at Wardian to Marsa Matrouh, has been of great benefit in
                        developing the Mariout district. Last week the big condensing station, which
                        his Highness bas been constructing at Hammam was completed. It cost £3,500
                        and will purify the water for the engines on bịs line. Although the water at
                        Hammam is excellent for drinking purposes, it contains lime which has bad
                        effects on the boilers and makes a condensing apparatus a necessity. The
                        machinery, which is of Austrian make, is of the latest pattern. Another
                        similar installation of condensing plant is to be set up at Dabbah.</p>
                    <p>One of the important factors in the development of the Mariout district is
                        the exploitation of gypsum, which is such a valuable commodity for building.
                        The Khedive has built a new siding on his line at Cherbanyet for
                        transporting the gypsum, as his Highness has about 400 feddans of gypsum
                        there."</p>
                    <p>THE MARKETS.</p>
                    <p> The market at Sidi Abdul Rahman, which was instituted by the Khediye last
                        year, is growing in importance and is attended by an increasing number of
                        people from the neighbourhood. There are four markets in Mariout, all of
                        which were established by the Khedive, Hamman, Mondays, Beheig, Tuesdays,
                        Amrieh Wednesdays, and Sidi Abdul Rahman, Saturdays.</p>
                    <p>THE MARIOUT SURVEY. </p>
                    <p>The survey of the Mariout district is proceeding satisfactorily and Mr.
                        Montagu and Mr. Murray, who have been entrusted with this work, have reached
                        Amrich, where their camp is now pitched. The operations of the survey of the
                        north western district of Egypt is to extend up to the frontier of Tripoli
                        at Salloum, and is to include the Oasis of Siwa on the South. It is expected
                        that the work will take at least three years. There is at present no map of
                        the country to the West of Alexandria. In fact even the frontier line is not
                        determined, a fact of which the Turks took advantage of in occupying the
                        important position of Sollom with its excellent harbour The survey will also
                        be of considerable importance in the delimitation of the cultivated land
                        which is increasing every year in area in this district</p>
                    <p>THE TELEGRAPH.</p>
                    <p> The telegraph line from Alexandria to Marsa Matronh was completed on the
                        28th ulta. Communication from Mersa Matrouh to the extreme westerly coast
                        guard post at Sidi Berand is conducted by telephone</p>
                    <p>THE POLICE</p>
                    <p> The general state of public security in the Marion district is very good.
                        Last month there were only seven police cases, which consisted of petty
                        quarrels among the Bedonin inhabitants. The lawlessness prevailing there has
                        greatly lessened during the past few years since the district was
                        transferred to the control of the Alexandria Police from the Behera
                        Moudirieb.</p>
                    <p>The police will probably make a new station at El Anned shortly. There are
                        now three stations, at Antrieb, 14 men and 8 horses. Beheig, I men and 6
                        horses, and Hamman, where the Camel Corps is stationed consisting of 10 men
                        and 8 camels. These stations are under the inspection of Sagh. Kelham, and
                        under the command of Yousbashi Mahmoud Sidky, the Mamour.</p>

                    <p>Another case of plague occurred at Alexandria at the Hotel de la Poste
                        yesterday, the victim being Mme. Agolhon, widow of the proprietor, who died
                        from the plague the day before yesterday. Mme. Agulhon was taken to the

                    <p>The origin of the outbreak at this hotel is believed to be from a young

                    <p>STATISTICS OF NAVIGATION</p>
                    <p>A most interesting and useful compilation of statistics of the movement of
                        shipping in the ports of Egypt has been issued by the Statistical Department
                        of the Ministry of Finance. The most interesting statistics given will be
                        published in our columns in and future issue. Meanwhile we publish the
                        introductory remarks of the Director of the Department, which, we trust,
                        will receive the fullest consideration from all shipping agoricios hero. The
                        Director writes:</p>
                    <p>The object of this Department in undertaking the organization of this enquiry
                        was to collect and publish fall information on both the maritime commerce
                        and navigation, and not only the movement of shipping which the pregent
                        volume deals with. It is true that the quarterly returns issued during the
                        year 1906, which are summarized in this volume, contained some data
                        concerning passengers. But figures relating to landing passengers only, have
                        a real value, for, this information is sapphed by the Quarantine Board whose
                        officials Bre in a position to collectit with due accuracy. As to passengers
                        embarked, the data furnished to this Department are very far from being
                        correct The Bureau of Passports, which ought to be in a position to collect
                        this information, has, on the one hand, a rather defective method of
                        registering and, on the other hand, travellers are not obliged by the local
                        regulations to make any statement at their departure and no passport is
                        strictly required. Therefore, no information on passengers is given in this
                        volume.</p>
                    <p>From the beginning of 1906 this Department established a method of direct
                        information by franchised postcards, which must be sent to this Department
                        by the shipping agents at every departure and arrival of boats. In these
                        nostoards the agents have to put down the tonnage of goods and the number of
                        passengers embarked and landed. Very many among the most important shipping
                        agencies established in the four principal ports of Egypt have agreed to
                        send and are still forwarding the required statements. I am very grateful to
                        these agents for their kind support, and bog to request that they will
                        persevere in their cooperation in the future. Unfortunately many other
                        agencies have not answered to the demand of this Department. I take the
                        liberty of assuring them their reluctance pre indices both the interests of
                        the companies they represent and the interests of the countries to which
                        these companies belong and for whose benefit this enquiry is chiefly
                        intended.</p>
                    <p>The Government is, in this behalf, mainly inspired by its duty of throwing
                        light on every field of the country's activity, in order to place at the
                        disposal of those who are interested the means of increasing their own
                        well-being. Nevertheless, this Department, trusting in the support given by
                        the important agencies, persists in its first purpose, and hopes to soon be
                        able to obtain the consent and co-operation of the hesitating minority of
                        agents..</p>
                    <p>With a view of facilitating the desired achievement, this Department has
                        elaborated a new scheme which will be applied from January next, replacing
                        the postcards system, This new plan is much simpler than the former. Thus, I

                        despatched on the 3rd inst, is of especial interest</p>
                    <p>It having been ascertained that active steps were being taken at
                        Constantinople and in high quarters, by the chiefs of the party that had
                        been in the ascendency during the regime of Naoum Pasha for the renomination

                        numbering over two thousand Lebanese Christians and Druses, came down to
                        Beyrout and made an important demonstration at the Seraglio at different
                        Consulates General. An eye witness says that at the Seraglio the
                        representative heads of the crowd clamoured for justice and appealed to the
                        Vali to solicit His Majesty to see that a just and upright Governor should
                        at last be sent to Lebanon and save the further oppression of the desperate
                        population. His Excellency haying calmed them with kind promises loud cheers

                        has not yet been made known, but we understand that no new frots have been
                        elicited in addition to what is already known about this unfortunate

                    <p>The enquiry does not imply any unfavourable reflection upon the military

                        met with many hardships. The heat was so intense that even the Bedouins who
                        accompanied the party sufig red from it. Their supply of water was used up
                        so fast that they could not extend their search as they had first

                    <head>THE BATTLE OF ROSETTA.</head>
                    <p>A hundred years ago the most serious defeat that England ever met with in
                        Egypt happened and by a curious coincidence the Scotch general, who led the
                        troops and perished in the disaster, bore the same name and belonged to the
                        same family as the general who fell a few years ago in the most serious
                        disaster that befell us in the Boer war, The following is the first account
                        of the calamity, which reached England and appeared in the "Times" of June
                        12th, 1807 :</p>
                    <p>The "Pompée," Sir Sidney Smith, whose Approval from the Mediterranean we
                        announced yesterday, has brought intelligence of a very unpleasant nature.
                        That part of our army, which was detached from Alexandria against Rosetta,
                        has been defeated with great loss. Our readers will recollect, that in our
                        anticipation of the Hamburg Mailon Wednesday, we alluded to this melancholy
                        ovent. The private information which we then were in possession of, would
                        have justified as in announcing it in a much stronger manner.</p>
                    <p>That we did not was owing to the peculiar delicacy of the circumstance, as
                        well as the difficulty of the situation in which we were placed. Thó bouro
                        from which we derived our intelligence,' has in no one instance ever misled
                        us, and its communications are entitled to implicit confidence and respect;
                        but we shrunk from being the first to announce great public calamity. We,
                        therefore, restricted, our communication to hinting at the disaster, and
                        stating the scene of the misfortune, confident that the melancholy
                        corroboration of our intelligence could not be long delayed.</p>
                    <p>The particulars of this unfortunate affair, as well as we have been able to
                        collect them, are these. It is known, though the fasot is not stated in
                        General Fraser's dispatch, that immediately after the surrender of
                        Alexandria, and respectable force was detached by him against Rosetta, the
                        command of which was confided to Major General Wanchope. They advanced
                        against it under the impression that they should moot with no resistance. No
                        forco appeared for the purpose of obstructing their march. The head of the
                        column had, however, scarcely entered the town, when it was assailed by a
                        destructive fire from a vast number of Turks and Albanians, who were posted
                        in the houses and different buildings. The contest was unequal, and our
                        troops were under the necessity of retreating. They accordingly evacuated
                        the town, and took the best position they could, under the circumstances ;
                        but kaving, as we are informed, been joined by some reinforcements from
                        Alexandria, they again advanced, and gave battle to an enemy infinitely
                        superior to them in numbers. The result was such as we set out with stating;
                        they were defeated, with very great loss indeed. In the first affair, the
                        extent of our loss was about 150 killed and wounded. In the second, it was
                        upwards of s thousand. We have not been able to ascertain whether any
                        prisoners were made; bot the total loss was probably not much under 1200
                        mer, or half perhaps of the force which was engaged. The remains of this
                        gallant little band made good their retreat to Alexandria where they remain.
                        The Commander of the expedition, Major General Wauchope, fell. Brigadier
                        General Meade, the next in command, was wounded, but, we are happy to bear,
                        not badly. Several other officers were also slightly wounded, who were fast
                        recovering - when the dispatches were sent off.</p>

                    <p>Saturday, June 18</p>
                    <p>We have little to add to the particulars of the recent disaster in Egypt
                        which we gave yesterday. A Packet from Malte arrived at Falmouth on Tuesday,
                        but it has not brought 30 late intelligence as the "Pompée," which sailed
                        some days after. The official account of the second action, fought, as it is
                        said, on the 19th of April, bas not we understand, been yet received; that
                        of the first has, and will probably appear in the Gazette of this
                        evening.</p>
                    <p>We are not yet sufficiently in porsession of the circumstances of this
                        unexpected event to be able to pronounce an impartial opinion upon it. The
                        first action, as we have before stated, took place in the town of Rosetta,
                        into which, it is said the division under General Wauchope incautiously
                        entered. It is possible that the little resistance made at Alexandria, and
                        the persuasion that the population of the country were friendly, might have
                        lulled that officer into a confidence, which has been attended with fatal
                        results. This is some excuse for him; and the manner and gallantry of his
                        fall is sufficient atonement for his indiscretion, if any there has been.
                        But to such indulgence we cannot admit the second attempt is in the least
                        entitled. Nothing but the certainty of a décisive victory, or to avoid the
                        horrors of impending famine, should have induced the officer, who had the
                        chief command, to risk a second action.</p>

                        <head> The Money Market</head>
                        <p>There has been quite a glut of floating credit in Lombard Street this
                            week, which continues in spite of heavy repayments to the Bank. This
                            plethora of money is likely to be further increased to-day by the
                            dividend payments. Yesterday no more than 1 to 2 per cent could be
                            obtained for short loans, while three months bills were easy at 8
                            percent.</p>
                        <p>Egypt has not taken any more gold this week, but in the best-informed
                            circles it is now anticipated that when the present crisis is passed,
                            further imports will be made in order to assist in restoring things to a
                            normal position. The prospects of an excellent cotton crop, and the high
                            prices now obtained for yarn make it certain that a considerable
                            quantity of gold will be required for Egypt in the autumn. Besides,
                            inasmuch as we shall probably ere long need still higher quotations for
                            Egyptian cotton, in view of the possibility of &amp; short American
                            supply, the amount of gold required next winter will surely be
                            considerable.</p>
                        <p>On the other hand, there are some who say that since only a small portion
                            of the nine millions taken for Egypt last autumn was returned, it is
                            reasonable to suppose that some, at least, of the balance will be
                            available for use in the moving of this year's crop</p>
                        <p>The Bank return this week shows a heavy shrinkage in the reserve as the
                            result of the half-yearly currency requirements. The amount of
                            £1.097,000 was received from abroad, but £1,432,000 in coin and £768 00
                            in notes went into home currency, and the reserve there tore £1,103.000
                            lower. at £23,681,000, the proportion to liabilities being down 4.39 per
                            cent. to 39.34 per cent. Last year at this date the reserve stood at
                            £24,968,889, and the proportion at 41.23 per cent.</p>
                        <p>The price of har gold is unchanged on the wook at 77/97.</p>

                        <p>Since our last the big financiers connected with affairs Egyptian have
                            experienced a week of more or less anxiety, as a result of the
                            difficulties created by the suspension of the Cassa di Sconto e di
                            Risparmio. So great is the confidence of the Egyptien investing public
                            in Sir Emest Cassel that as soon as it was known that he and his friends
                            were interesting themselves in the affair, a great deal of the anxiety
                            regarding the ultimate settlement disappeared ; nevertheless, it is
                            obvious that there was much work to be done before this much-to-be
                            desired result was accomplished. The final arrangements were come to
                            yesterday for the voluntary liquidation of the Cassa, and the thanks of
                            the whole backing and financial community in Egypt, as well as those who
                            desire to 100 thou proliant unsatisfactory 1 position liquidated, are
                            due to Sir Ernest Cassel and his colleagues for the masterly way in
                            which they have overcome the present difficulties.</p>
                        <p>These astute financiers, as we informed you in our cable to day, have
                            placed around quarter of a million, or more, if necessary, at the
                            disposal of the Cassa to enable the Bank to meet its present
                            liabilities, so that the process of winding-up voluntarily can be
                            carried out quietly, and the sold securities liquidated without haste.
                            This is eminently satisfactory, and now that this very serious matter is
                            cleared up, we may hope that we have seen the worst of the crisis. Of
                            course, it must be proven that there will be still more wreckage to be
                            dealt with, but none of it is likely to prove of serious import, and is
                            mainly connected with smaller companies, who have been trading beyond
                            their means. With the prospect of a bumper cotton crop, and increasingly
                            high prices, referred to above, we may look forward to the future with
                            confidence, secure in the knowledge that the unhappy crisis through
                            which we have been passing is but temporary, and has not the
                            potentiality to seriously check the course of Egypt's prosperity. The
                            country is sound in every respect and the lessons of the present
                            difficulties, if taken to heart, will prove wholesome. Genuine investors
                            have had a splendid opportunity, of Requiring some of Egypt's sound
                            securities at well below their intrinsic worth, and the amount of money
                            which has been found for the purpose both here and in Paris runs into
                            very large figures and has been pleasant surprise to those behind the
                            scenes</p>
                        <p>The Bourse speculating punter must not again be allowed to resume the
                            reckless gambling so much in evidence last winter, and the
                            indiscriminate formation of new companies will also have received a
                            wholesome check.</p>
                        <p>The announcement that the Cask difficulties had been satisfactorily
                            settled had a good effect upon the stock markets generally yesterday,
                            and the tone became much more cheerful. There was an appreciable amount
                            of investment buying in several departments, and prices were firmer.</p>
                        <p>Today there is little business passing, but the tone is on the whole
                            favourable.</p>

                        <p>After the temporary improvement recorded last week, home railway shares
                            have agaia been neglected, and have been one of the dullest markets in
                            the house. This is somewhat surprising, taking into consideration the
                            splendid series of traffics published this week, and the imminence of
                            the half-yearly dividend announcements. It is customary to lay blame for
                            most of this world's ills upon the weather, but there can be no doubt
                            that the present unseasonable conditions have not been without effect

                            towards the close there was some hardening of prices. Today the tendency

                        <p>The traffic returns are very gratifying. The North Western, for instance,
                            report an increase of £16,000, which follows a gain last year of £21

                        <p>The American section opened very firm on Monday, thanks to strong support
                            from New York, and substantial advances were recorded. The upward
                            movement was speedily checked, however, and for the greater part of the
                            week the tendency has been much easier. The unsatisfactory reports
                            regarding the prospects of the cotton crop, and uncertainty as to the
                            monetary situation, largely account for this weakness.</p>

                            correspondingly, but business was almost at a standstill in consequence
                            of the Independence Day holiday in Wall Street. As a rule closing prices
