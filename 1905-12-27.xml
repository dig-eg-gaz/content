                    <head>The New Railway</head>
                    <p>We give elsewhere some details as to the invitations to be issued in
                        connection with the opening of the Nile-Red Sea line, which is to be as
                        important a ceremony as was that on the opening of the <placeName>Assouan
                            Dam</placeName>. The idea of a railway dates back to the days of
                            <persName>Ismail Pasha</persName>, who, when Khedive realised that if
                        Egypt was to maintain its hold on the Sudan trade down the Nile, he was led
                        to abandon its natural outler by the route from
                            <placeName>Suakin</placeName> to <placeName>Berber</placeName>, and
                        determined to make a railway along the Nile from <placeName>Wady
                            Halfa</placeName>, past the cataracts. On this project, which collapsed
                        in 1877, half a million was spent on building fifty miles of rails, which
                        ended en fair, or, rather, in the desert. The Suskin-Berber line was later
                        on strongly advocated by <persName>General Gordon</persName>, and in 1885,
                        after Gordon's death, the Ministry of <persName>Mr. Gladstone</persName>
                        actually authorised the construction of a railway to the Nile from
                            <placeName>Suakin</placeName>, and a feeble start was made in the
                        building of the line. Then <persName>Mr. Gladstone</persName> decided to
                        abandon the Sudan; and the work came to an end- at considerable cost to the
                        British taxpayer. When at length the Sudan was reconquered by <persName>Lord
                            Kitchener</persName>, a rail- way, as all thw world knows, was built
                        across the desert from <placeName>Wady Halfa</placeName> to
                            <placeName>Khartoum</placeName>, and the dream of Ismail realised after
                        a quarter of a century. The Khartoum line was built, however, for military
                        purposes, and as a commercial highway it has been well nigh useless, for it
                        is impossible to force trade into an unnatural channel. No one has re-
                        cognised this more clearly than <persName>Lord Cromer</persName>, and to his
                        determination to give the Sudan a chance of becoming self-supporting, to
                        bring prosperity (and therefore happiness) to its in- habitants, we owe the
                        building this line.</p>
                    <p>It is almost impossible to exaggerate the important results expected to flow
                        from the opening of this railway. Lest it be thought that our optimism has
                        no substantial founda- tion, we will not go beyond the language used by
                            <persName>Lord Cromer</persName> on the subject. The line, it must be
                        observed, passes through no territory capable of much development, save for
                        the few miles it follows the <placeName>Atbara</placeName>; it is but a
                        means to an end, a bridge over the waste of desert which separates the
                            <placeName>Eastern Sudan</placeName> from the outer world. But it will
                        be a bridge of sur- passing importance. To mention one item, it will
                        immensely sheapen the cost of fuel (coal) at
                        <placeName>Khartoum</placeName>, and thus will permit commercial
                        developments impossible while, as at present, coal costs at
                            <placeName>Khartoum</placeName> some 4 a ton. Again, it will render
                        possible the construction of subsidiary railways in the fertile regions of
                        the <placeName>Sudan</placeName>; a branch line to
                            <placeName>Kassala</placeName>, and a railway from <placeName>El
                            Obeid</placeName> to <placeName>E. Dueim</placeName> on the Nile are
                        already contemplated. The Kassala-line will tap a region rich in cereals;
                        that from <placeName>El Obeid</placeName> will enable the gum arabic of
                            <placeName>Kordofan</placeName> to be put on the world's markets at a
                        consider- ably reduced price, while giving the merchants greater profit. Of
                        more immediate importance is the line now being built, from <placeName>Abon
                            Hamed</placeName> to the <placeName>Dongola province</placeName>; by
                        this means it is believed that <placeName>Dongola</placeName> will capture
                        the trades in cereals with <placeName>Arabia</placeName>. Besides all these
                        things, there is the probability- the great probability -of the Sudan
                        becoming a very large producer of cotton.</p>
                    <p>It is a mistake to suppose, as is sometimes done, that the new line will
                        injure Egypt. It is not a question of taking trade away from Alexandria and
                        transferring it to the Red Sea ports. It is rather a question of creating a
                        new trade, which but for the railway could not exist. It cannot be doubted
                        that the construc- tion of the Red Sea-Nile railway is a distinct step in
                        making the Sudan self-supporting. The railway, in fact, should prove as
                        beneficient for the Sudan as the construction of the <placeName>Assouan
                            dam</placeName> has proved beneficent for Egypt.</p>

                        present in the square during the disturbance, without having any cognisance
                        of the circum- stances, we await with interest the sen- tences which the

                        have some further remarks to make.</p>
                    <p>Our readers (says "Al Moayad”) will notice that the 71 natives who were
                        accused of taking part in the disturbance in the Custom house quarter of
                        Alexandria have been much more severity punished than the 104 persons who
                        were implicated in the riot in <placeName>Mohamed Aly square</placeName>,
                        where the disturbances originated and the enormous mob assembled. The former
                        were far from the “scene of the disturbance, and 29 of them were acquitted
                        because they were arrested without any reason. However, nine- tenths of the
                        rest (42) have been unjustly sentenced.</p>

                    <p>Fatal Jealousy. Two wives of an Arab of Adlieh, Belb is Markaz, were on bad
                        terms with each other, and last week one of them, fired at her "durrat,”
                        causing her death in a room where she was taking a bath. The markaz
                        authorities have opened an enquiry into the circumstances of the crime. The
                        murderess says that the fatal shot was accidentally fired, but the enquiry
                        showed that the murder Was deliberately committed.</p>
                    <p>From the late "Notre Oncle." The eminent French critic
                            <persName>Sarcy</persName>, universally admired for his infallible good
                        sense, cuse gave the following valuable testimonial: "The best and safest
                        way of learning a living language is to speak it with some one who cannot or
                        dare not speak a word of the other's tongue." On this fixed basis
                            <persName>Mr. Berlitz</persName> drew up a whole programme of lessons
                        which rapidly leads the pupil to a knowledge of the idiom which he wishes to
                        learn." These principles are applied at <placeName>26, Rue de l’Eglise Copte
                            Alexandria</placeName>, and <placeName>1, Sharia Kamel,

                    <p>Maternity Home. There will be a grand ’Xmas Tree fête in aid of the funds of
                        the <placeName>Maternity Home in the Moharrem Bey quarter</placeName> on
                        Saturday afternoon. All supporters of this deserving charity ought to
                        attend. The Home is much in want of financial support at the present time,
                        as it is necessary to build an establishment of its own, and a vigorous
                        canvas is now being made by the ladies of the committee in aid of funds to
                        purchase a site and build a home. Between £300 and £400 has been collected
                        within the last few days for this excellent international institution.

                    <p>A. L. M. &amp; D. S. The parish-room, Bulkeley, was filled to overflowing

                        Gordon.” <persName>Bishop Wilkinson</persName>, who takes the oversight of
                        the Anglican congrega- tions in Northern and Central Europe for the Bishop
                        of London, has for some time past been endeavouring to raise funds to
                        provide an en- dowment for a bishopric at <placeName>Khartoum</placeName> in
                        memory of <persName>General Gordon</persName>, and with a view to the
                        extension of missionary operations in the <placeName>Valley of the
                            Nile</placeName>. <persName>Bishop Blyth</persName>, of
                            <placeName>Jerusalem</placeName>, in commending the scheme, wrote : "I
                        hope our scheme will give a chain of bishop- rics along the
                            <placeName>Nile</placeName> to the <placeName>Great Lakes</placeName>,
                        and so onward to where we shall meet the Central African and South African
                        diocesses. This would be the same scheme from a Church point of view which
                        the Government has Imperially -<placeName>Cairo</placeName> to
                            <placeName>Capetown</placeName>.” It may be as well to explain that the
                        last sentence has reference to the late, not the present, Government.
                            <persName>Bishop Wilkinson</persName> based his address on the words
                        from the Epistle of the day: “It is required of stewards that a man be found
                        faithful," and in the course of his remarks pointed out that
                            <placeName>Great Britain</placeName> had been placed by
                            <placeName>Providence</placeName> in charge of enormous territories in
                            <placeName>Africa</placeName>. It was a mighty steward- ship, and what
                        were we doing for the present and future welfare of those regions. He was
                        only going to speak of one section, the 2,500 miles of the <placeName>Valley
                            of the Nile</placeName>. The Church ought to have a chain of stations
                        from <placeName>Cairo</placeName> to the <placeName>Great Lakes</placeName>.
                        The natives were worth helping. <persName>Sir Samuel Baker</persName>, who
                        had spent so many years in exploring that region, spoke very highly of their
                        intelligence and faithful- ness. There were a few native Christians about
                        the sources of the Nile, and some of them had been subjected to severe
                        persecution and tor- ture. Baker said: “<placeName>Khartoum</placeName> is
                        hell itself; the atrocities of this region are beyond anything I can
                        describe.” Gordon himself said : “I would give my life for these poor people
                        of the Sudan.” Neither the Church nor the country had recognised its debts
                        to <persName>General Gordon</persName>. In his memory they ought to try and
                        make Khar- toum a holy city, a centre of usefulness and light, from which
                        civilisation and Christianity should go forth to the outermost parts of the
                            <placeName>Nile Valley</placeName>.</p>

                    <head>MACHINE GUNS FOR EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>A test of the Rexer automatic machine gun ordered for the Egyptian Government
                        took place on Tuesday week at the <placeName>Runymede range</placeName>. The
                        Egyptian Government is taking about 50 of these guns, and in the trials the
                        cartridges used were loaded with the Nitrokol explosive which is a
                        pyrocollodium powder similar to that adopted in Russia and now used in
                        England. With the general details of the gun service men are tolerably
                        familiar, and it is sufficient now to say that the power for work- ing the
                        mechanism is obtained from the recoir, which, when the gun is fired, drives
                        the barrel, together with the breech and the other moving part, some 2 in.
                        backwards, this compressing a recoil spring behind the breech. After the
                        force of the recoil is expended this spring expands and drives the barrel
                        forward into the firing position. The recoil and return of the breech
                        operate levers, which open the breech, eject the empty case, and insert a
                        new cartridge in the chamber. No water jacket is required for this gun,
                        which is cooled by air, and which weighs only 17 lb. The magazine holds 25
                        cartridges, and can be discharged, by con- tinuous automatic firing, in
                        three and a half seconds. Other tests at the trial showed that magazines
                        could be replaced with rapidity, and 175 rounds were discharged in 70
                        seconds. The "scatter" of the bullets is not great, for when three magazines
                        were fired at a target 5 ft. square, at 200 yards, it was found that 70
                        bullets out of the 75 were on the target. Previous experiments show that the
                        "scatter" of the bullets was in the same proportion at the longer ranges.
                        After firing it was found that although the steel barrel cover became much
                        heated it was always possible to hold the gun by the lock, where the metal
                        was quite cool.</p>

                    <head>THE KUTTABS AND RELIGIOUS EDUCATION.</head>
                    <p>The increase in the number of advanced pupils in the free and Wakf kuttabs is
                        a satis- factory proof of the increased desire for educa- tion and its
                        advantages, and statistics will shortly be published showing the exact
                        increase in their numbers for the last few years. That the new zeal for a
                        practical education in no way impedes religion teaching, is proved by recent
                        statistics given by Sheikh Sherif, which show that the number of pupils
                        learning the whole of the Koran now amounts to 4,609. 3,604 are at work on
                        three-quarters, 4,301 on the half, and 6,465 on a quarter of the sacred book
                        of Islam. The fear expressed by some Moslem Conservatives that the Koran
                        might be neglected, despite the constitution of the kuttabs, is obviously
                        unfounded.</p>

                    <p>(FROM OUR CORRESPONDENT.) Keneh, December 24. A meeting was held in the
                            <placeName>Keneh Markaz</placeName> of the omdehs, merchants, and
                        notables of the town, the sub-moudir, <persName>Mr. Haxell</persName>, of
                        the Ministry of the Interior, <persName>Mr. Smith</persName>, of the Finance
                        Ministry, and many other equally distinguished persons. The sur-moudir
                        opened the proceedings by a speech explaining the object of the gathering
                        and urging them to help the kuttabs and their masters, aa many benefits were
                        to be derived from them.</p>
                    <p>The Inspector of the kuttabs then deli- vered a speech on the uses of
                        education, its effect upon civilisation, the benefits of new discoveries,
                        and the necessity of spreading knowledge among Egyptians, and made an
                        instructive comparison between the percentage of those who know how to read
                        and write in Egypt and in Europe. He also recalled the Prophet's sayings
                        regarding cleanliness, edu- cation, and religion. He closed his speech by
                        insisting that the pedagogues should see to the cleanliness of their boys
                        and class-rooms, and to the order of the curriculum, and urged on them to
                        build up a new generation, imbued with ideas of order and organisation, fit
                        to take a place worthy of Egypt's position in the present century.</p>
                    <p>Afterwards the grants-in-aid were distribut- ed and the meeting dispersed,
                        all agreeing in thanking the Ministry of Public Instruction for the care
                        taken in giving these kuttabs such attention.</p>

                        will travel by the same boat and will attend the ceremony.</p>
                    <p>The importance of the ceremony has al- ready been insisted on in our columns.
                            <persName>Lord Cromer</persName> will preside over the opening of a line

                        rooms were quite full, and so was the table d'hôte room. There were also

                    <p>The Dean took his text from Isaiah ix.6, "The Prince of Peace." He explained
                        the difference between the peace of man, which is at best the peace of
                        compromise, and the Divine Peace of Pardon and Unity. The sermon ended with

                        were admirably sang. The anthem was by <persName>Barnby</persName>, “Chris-

                        out with palms and the altar was bright with poinsettias.</p>

                        the organ, and was responsible for the music as organist and choirmaster.
                        The collections for the poor relief fund amounted to P.T. 1,409.5. To the
                        Asile Rudolph P.T. 195, and to the Wraxall Fund (per <persName>Mrs. Law-

                        chaplain.</p>
                    <p>Among these who sent flowers for St. Marks were <persName>Miss

                            Carver</persName>.</p>
                    <p>The following were responsible for the deco- rating of the church : font,
                            <persName>Misses Morrison and Talbot</persName>; altar vases,
                            <persName>Mrs. Algernon Ward</persName> and <persName>Miss

                            <persName>Miss Dodd</persName> ; choir stalls, <persName>Mrs. E. J.
                            Roberts</persName>. Not withstanding the heavy rains and the storms of
                        the last few days, there were many flowers forthcoming, and the church pre-
                        sented a bright and festive appearance. The communicants for the day
                        numbered 114, which is an increase of 65 on the number who com- municated on
                        Christmas Day, 1902.</p>
                    <p>At All Saints’, Ramleh, the following sent foliage and flowers for the
                        decorating of the church : <persName>Mmes. Alderson</persName>,
                            <persName>Atkin</persName>, <persName>P. W. Carver</persName>,
                            <persName>S. H. Carver</persName>, <persName>Moss</persName>,
                            <persName>E. Moss</persName>, <persName>Parkinson</persName>,
                            <persName>G. A. Williams</persName>, and <persName>Miss Wills</persName>
                        and others. Those responsible for decorating the church were: font,
                            <persName>Misses Atkin</persName> and <persName>Moss</persName>; alter
                        vases, <persName>Miss Wills</persName>; pulpit, <persName>Mrs. W. R.
                            Williams</persName>; choir stalls, <persName>Misses V.
                            Alderson</persName> and <persName>Harden</persName>; E. and W. windows,
                            <persName>Misses Carver</persName>; N. and S. windows, <persName>Mmes.
                            E. Moss</persName> and <persName>M. Birch</persName>. The de- corations
                        looked extremely well.</p>
                    <p>On Christmas Eve and on Christmas Day the anthem carol, “Angels, from the
                        Realms of Glory" by <persName>A. R. Gaul</persName>, was sung ; also another
                        Carol on Christmas Eve, “Come ye lofty" (E. Button). The singing was good
                        and thoroughly hearty, and the choir was composed entirely of the regular
                        members. <persName>Miss Alderson</persName> presided at the organ and helped
                        greatly in making the musical part of the service so bright and
                        congregational.</p>
                    <p>The collections for the day amounted to P.T. 1,403.5. Of the P.T. 239.5
                        collected for the poor relief fund at the early celebrations, P.T. 97.5 was
                        given to the Asile Rudolph. The communicants for the day numbered 76,
                        showing an increase of 82 on the number who communicated on Christmas Day
                        1902 ; the collection also this year was P.T. 390 more than in 1902.</p>
                    <p>A comparison of numbers, etc, with those of three years ago is interesting as
                        probably showing an increase in the number of residents in
                            <placeName>Alexandria</placeName> and <placeName>Ramleh</placeName> who
                        are members of the English Church.</p>

                    <head>MANSOURAH AND TANTAH.</head>
                    <p>At <placeName>Mansoureh</placeName> the festival began quite correctly on
                        Christmas Eve and was well attended : some members of the Constantinia
                        Company being present, bringing plentiful offerings from Bessandileh of
                        roses and other flowers.</p>
                    <p><persName>Mrs. Carr</persName>, from <placeName>Chawa</placeName>, had sent
                        in many evergreens; unfortunately she was too unwell herself to attend.
                        There was holly from ladies in <placeName>England</placeName>, visitors of
                        last year. The chaplain's wife being laid up with bronchitic asthma,
                            <persName>Mrs Smith</persName> kindly prepared the church-room, cleaning
                        brasses, etc., with the help of her daughter, and <persName>Mrs.
                            Murdoch</persName> also decorated the room with great taste. These
                        ladles also had practised the musical part of the service, which went
                        heartily to the accompaniment on the organ by <persName>Miss
                            Henderson</persName>, who has recent- ly volunteered her services.</p>
                    <p>The 8 a.m. Holy Communion was well attended. It began with a carol, "On
                        Christmas Morn,” and concluded with the hymn, “Bright the Vision," before
                        the blessing.</p>
                    <p>At <placeName>Tentah</placeName>, at 11 o’clock the service of Holy Communion
                        commenced with a hymn. (No. 60). Two other ’Xmas hymns before and after the
                        address helped much to brighten the service. The churchwarden, <persName>Mr.
                            Wright</persName>, whose wife was unfortunately prevented by serious
                        illness from attendance, with the aid of her sister, <persName>Miss
                            Bailey</persName>, had made the churchroom festive with evergreens and
                        roses. <persName>Mr. Lionel Ellis</persName> kindly took <persName>Mrs.
                            Wright</persName>’s place at the organ for the occasion, and his
                        remarkable talent thereat was much appre- ciated. The other warden,
                            <persName>Mr. Wakeman Long</persName>, was in hospital, and some of the
                        regular congregation had accepted invitations for Christmas away. The late
                        illness of the chaplain seems also to account for the absence of others.</p>

                    <p>The revolutionary party is continuing the struggle with extraordinary
                        determination, though disappointed by the regular troops remaining
                        loyal.</p>
                    <p>Yesterday morning thousands of strikers and several hundred militia attacked
                        the <placeName>Kasan</placeName>, <placeName>Nikolai</placeName>, and
                            <placeName>Riazan</placeName> termini, and captured the last. Artillery
                        was, however, brought up and drove out the insurgents, but the station is
                        burnt.</p>
                    <p>The guns also bombarded many houses in various parts of the town from which
                        shots had been fired or bombs thrown.</p>
                    <p>At night the sky was aglow with the con- flagrations raging in various
                        quarters.</p>
                    <p>Later.</p>
                    <p>Fighting is mainly confined to narrow streets in the commercial quarter of
                        the town and suburbs, as the rebels are avoiding the main thoronughfares,
                        which can be easily cannonaded.</p>
                    <p>The Governor General has organised a loyal militia, composed mostly of
                        hooligans, which is operating under the direction of the police.</p>

                    <head>BY <persName>BARONESS DE MALORTIE</persName>.</head>
                    <p>It is Thy Festival, most holy Babe, And we would join in worship at the cave,
                        We who have waited for the coming night, Watching the stars on Bethlehem's
                        cool height Gazing into immensity of space, But no bright beings of
                        celestial race Parted the drifting clouds like coming dawn, To hail the
                        Saviour of the Virgin born.</p>
                    <p>We dream Thy Festival, and so would walk, Beside the Shepherds with their
                        artless talk Who tell us of the songs they heard above, And that new message
                        of eternal love. It is a song we cannot understand, Its speech is to us of
                        another land, Our eyes are holden, we but faintly see The Saviour Christ
                        upon the Virgin's knee.</p>
                    <p>It is Thy Festival, the breezes bear Some Eastern fragrance through the
                        midnight air Wafted from that strange group beside the well, Who could to
                        others their new mystery tell, Silent are they, until Old joyful sight, Once
                        more appears their star's effulgent light Spreading in noiseless motion,
                        wave on wave Of opal glory, round a rugged cave.</p>
                    <p>On that dark hill for Him, to whom no place Was offered by the tribe of
                        Judah's race, Yet this fair rock stood in Creation's plan The cradle for the
                        Son of God—as Man Ere David’s first progenitor was born, Or tendor Ruth had
                        gleaned her sheaves of corn, No hands had fashioned it—Save His alone, Who
                        made the hills, and set their walls of stone.</p>
                    <p>And here Angelic choirs in order came, Saluting her the Blessed One by name,
                        Holy in purity all maids above— Meek, tender, faithful, Mother of God's Love
                        Where He is Spirit came, as to His Home Because “the fulness of the hour had
                        come” ; The Kings their offerings laid beneath His Feet, And looked into His
                        Eyes, so calm and sweet.</p>
                    <p>What they divined—Who mystic signs could read We are not told, but there was
                        joy indeed, Where was the Crown, or Kingdom that they saw The flowing out of
                        life, for ever more. Time beyond time in everlasting days. Nations and
                        worlds but glittering in His praise- An ocean's depth of overflowing Grace
                        And its eternal Spring-the Saviour's Face?</p>
                    <p>O lovely Holiday, to us a Heaven, When meditation to the mind is given, It
                        is Thy Festival -ah, make it ours ! Be dearer to us than our mirthful hours,
                        Let us believe the God Incarnate came In form as Man to suffer for our
                        shame. So shall we hear the Anthem, of the Sky, Glory to God—Glory to God on
                        High !</p>

                    <head>FINANCIAL ADVISER’S REMARKS</head>
                    <p>An interesting chapter of the Note of the Financial Adviser is devoted to the
                        Egyptian Railway Administration. Sir Vincent Corbett remarks :—</p>
                    <p>The Railway expenditure in 1906 is estimat- ed at a sum of L.E. 1,803,061 as
                        against L.E. L.E. 1,416,000 in 1905, or an increase of L.E. 387,061 ; as,
                        however, the estimated receipts for the two years are L.E. 3,000,000 and
                        L.E. 2,500,000 respectively, there is an increase in the nett earnings of
                        L.E. 112,939.</p>
                    <p>An endeavour has been made hitherto, to limit the expenditure of the Railway
                        to a certain percentage of receipts (formerly to 45 % but latterly to some
                        52 % to 54 %); but, as it is obviously in the interest of the public that
                        the largest possible nett earnings should be realised and the largest
                        possible volume of traffic-carried, so long as no excessive capital
                        expenditure is necessitated, without reference to an arificial proportion
                        between earnings and expenditure, it will be our policy in future to spend
                        as much as may be necessary to obtain the best return; and, in order to
                        estimate more accurately the real profit from the Rail- ways, it is proposed
                        as soon as possible to establish a Capital Account.</p>
                    <p>At the present moment, the Railways of Egypt are in a transition state. For
                        more or less than twenty years past they have been treated sharply as a
                        money-making machine to satisfy tbe exigencies of the foreign bond- holders.
                        If latterly a somewhat more liberal policy was adopted, it was not possible
                        under the vexations restrictions of the Caisse de la Dette to attempt to
                        make up the ground that had been lost; it was as much as the adminis-
                        tration could do to keep things going.</p>
                    <p>When, therefore, the Railways were last year transferred to Egyptian
                        management, the Government found itself face to face with a problem of the
                        most serious kind. For twenty years the Railways had practically stood still
                        while traffic had increased by leaps and bounds, the permanent way was in a
                        state of indifferent repair, the number of passenger waggons and trucks
                        entirely inadequate, and the per- sonnel, taken as a whole, anything but up
                        to date. Under these circumstances, the first act of the Ministry of Finance
                        on obtaining its financial liberty was to set aside a sum of L.E. 3,000,000
                        for the improvement of the State Railways, and, the day that the last of the
                        Great Powers signified its assent to the Anglo- French Convention, to
                        authorise the President of the Railway Administration to draw on that sum to
                        any amount for the purchase of rolling stock.</p>
                    <p>A Commission of British experts, under the presidency of Lord Farrer, visited
                        Egypt in December 1904, and drew up a report which has formed the basis of
                        all subsequent measures of reform. In November 1905 the old Inter- national
                        Administration was abolished by Khe- divial General. The supreme control of
                        the Railways is in the hands of a Board consisting of the Prime Minister,
                        the Financial Adviser, and the Adviser to the Ministry of Public Works and
                        such other members as the Council of Ministers may on the advice of the
                        above think proper to appoint. On its advice the General Manager is
                        appointed or retired ; it must be consulted with reference to the appoint-
                        ment and dismissal of officials above a certain rank, in all matters of
                        railway extension, and in the granting of contracts beyond a given sum;
                        further it may call for reports or informa- tion on any subject it pleases,
                        and issue directions to the General Manager. But its powers, comprehensive
                        though they be, are not intended to be used in diminunion of the respon-
                        sibility of the General Manager. In matters of policy, the Board may, and
                        must, be the ulti- mate authority, but the techical work of whatever kind,
                        is in the hands of the former, as the effective and responsible Head of the
                        State Railway Administration.</p>
                    <p>To supplement the work of <persName>Lord Farrer</persName>'s Commission,
                            <persName>Sir Charles Scotter</persName>, the well- known Chairman of
                        the London and South Western Railway, has come to
                            <placeName>Egypt</placeName> to inspect the work already done, and give
                        the Govern- ment the benefit of his valuable experience.</p>
                    <p>During the last year, thanks to the unre- mitting energy of <persName>Major
                            Le Breton</persName>, who has been good enough to put his Indian
                        experience at the service of the Egyptian Government, the Accounts and Audit
                        departments of the State Railways have been brought into thorough order, and
                        can now, it is confidently believed, compare not unfavorably with similar
                        depart- ments elsewhere.</p>
                    <p>The Egyptian travelling and commercial public, the Egyptian press, and the
                        passing tourist are all ready to gibe at the short- comings of the State
                        Railways. It is probable that they will do so for some time longer. An
                        Administration which, through no fault of its own, bound as it was by
                        international shack- les, has remained practically stationary for 20 years,
                        while the wealth and commerce of the country advanced with phenomenal
                        rapidity, cannot make up for lost time by lavish ex- penditure in one or two
                        or five years. Rolling stock can indeed be purchased though not in unlimited
                        quantities and at a moment's notice; but lines cannot be doubled, nor sheds
                        and stations created where land has to be expro- priated without long delay
                        and often enor- mous expense. New quays are wanted at <placeName>Alex-
                            andria</placeName>; public accommodation is required here, there, and
                        everywhere; “necks of bottles" must be widened, but all this cannot be done
                        in a day. Practically unlimited credits have been opened for all these
                        objects, but those who are the guardians of the public purse have duties
                        towards the fellah taxpayer as well as towards the first class traveler or
                        alien menchant prince ; works must be put up to tender, expropriation must
                        be made at the cheapest rate, and even then, it takes time to create docks
                        and sidings and warehouses. They cannot be purchased ready made.</p>

                        shareholders in the Anglo-Egyptian Automatic Trading Company (Limited), and

                            J.G. Prentice</persName>. S. D. S. Ross was further charged with
                        obtaining by false pretences, on June 16, 1903, from <persName>Mr. John E.
                            Champneyala</persName> a cheque for £648 7s 6d.</p>

                        defended.</p>

                    <p>Detective-inspector <persName>Murphy</persName> said just before noon on the
                        previous day he saw <persName>Stewart Ross</persName> at his residence, and
                        asked him to accompany him to the police offices, Old Jewry. On the way
                        accused said, "If my brother George is wanted he will surrender.” When the
                        warrant was read to him at the Old Jewry he said, “I am quite innocent of
                        fraud of any description, or any misrepresentation. No two brothers have
                        worked harder or more honorably than we did in the interests of the
                        shareholders. We ourselves nave lost a lot of money.” About one o’clock
                            <persName>George Ross</persName> surrendered at the Old Jewry, and when
                        the warrant was read over to him, said “Thank you."</p>

                    <head>EGYPTIAN MINING DEPARTMENT</head>
                    <p>A mining station for the Department of Mines is now in process of
                        construction at Edfou. The Department’s expenditure for the coming year is
                        estimated at L.E. 8,692, of which L.E. 4,662 is for salaries, and the re-
                        mainder for well-sinking, communications, etc., etc. Special credits
                        amounting to L.E. 1,500 have been opened for the completion of the
                            <placeName>Edfou Station</placeName> and provision for motor trans-
                        port.</p>
                    <p>The Department has been formed for the purpose of issuing mining leases and
                        licenses, and generally controlling tha mineral industry within the country.
                        The extent of the regions in which ancient mining centres have been found is
                        such as to induce the expenditure of large sums of money within the next few
                        years for further exploration and development work, most of which money will
                        be derived from sources outside the country and spent in it. The department
                        has been placed under the charge of an Inspector-General, who will be
                        assisted in his duties by other inspectors and a special staff of desert
                        polioe operating locally from Edfou.</p>

                    <head>THE WANT OF REFORMS.</head>
                    <p>To the editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                    <p>Sir,—I read with interest your leading article headed “The Capitulations," in
                        your issue of 18th inst, in which you attribute the disaffection among the
                        Egyptian population to the difference in the treatment of European and
                        native criminals. Whether the transference of jurisdiction over European
                        residents in this country from the Consular to the Native Courts would be a
                        blessing is open to question, and is not a matter that I am going to
                        discuss.</p>
                    <p>Personally I am convinced that there is undoubtedly discontent among the
                        natives with the present state of things, and what is even worse, the
                        discontent is growing. If, therefore, the recent disturbances have done
                        nothing else but to draw the attention of the authorities to that
                        discontent, they may be said to be blessings in disguise.</p>
                    <p>The fact is that in spite of the much vaunted prosperity of the country so
                        lucidly talked about in <persName>Lord Cromer</persName>’s reports, the
                        natives of the poor class see that while the rich classes, both Europeans
                        and native, are undoubtedly, going ahead, their own condition is certainly
                        not improving. The Finance Mi- nistry is the only department that may be
                        said to study the interests of the poor, by systematically abolishing
                        onerous taxes when- ever practicable. The other Departments of the
                        Commonwealth, like Gallic of old, “care for none of these things.” It would,
                        however, do good to these officials to visit some of the houses of the poor
                        natives. He would find that numbers of them live in places that many of us
                        would not use for stabling horses. Many of the native dwellings are merely
                        wooden shanties, with no floors, and with the recent heavy rains the ground
                        becomes a quagmire. However on this, the man, wife and children are obliged
                        to lie down to sleep, with the rain all the while coming on them through the
                        roof. At one time, empty flour bags could be got cheaply enough and were
                        largely need by the natives as mats to lie on and rags to cover themselves
                        up with, but this year, these bags are high up in price and beyond the means
                        of the poor. Is it not the duty of a Government to provide for the homing of
                        the poor? The London County Council have admitted this responsibility,
                        thanks to the votes of the Pro- gressives. When will the Egyptian Govern-
                        ment imitate their example ? Cannot the Wakf Administration, who I
                        understand have funds lying idle, be induced to undertake this work, and so
                        secure a small return for their outlays, while at the same time fulfilling a
                        sacred Mohamedan duty?</p>
                    <p>The wages of the Egyptian labourer and fellah are very low, hardly enough to
                        en- able them to keep body, and soul together, and there is no possible
                        chance of them ever being able to save anything for old age. This can be
                        borne out by the returns of the Post Office Savings Banks. What provision
                        will the Go- vernment make for old age pensions to these unfortunate
                        creatures, most of whom have rendered several years military service on com-
                        pulsion? Surely the State should be for the individual and not the
                        individual for the State.</p>
                    <p>Again, by reason of far less favorable con- ditions of living, the native is
                        more subject to disease than the average European. The death rate also is
                        higher among the former than among the latter. One would think that these
                        telling facts would be known to the Govern- ment and that District Medical
                        Officers, both male and female, would be appointed by the State to minister
                        to the suffering poor, also that public dispensaries would be opened in poor
                        quarters, where the natives might obtain drugs free. Such a system would
                        operate educationally on the natives, who would soon learn the need of
                        cleanliness, so highly enjoin- ed by the Koranic law. I am told on good
                        authority that hundreds of natives die with- out medical attendance, and
                        that the Sanitary doctor is obliged in these cases to formulate a
                        certificate of death as best he can, at it is clearly out of the question to
                        perform a post- mortem examination in the dead man’s room, and to forcibly
                        take the body to the mortuary at the hospital for autopsy would certainly
                        produce a riot. It is obvious that under these circumstances it is
                        impossible for the Sanitary Department to issue reliable statistics of mor-
                        tality, and that it is very possible many crimes of poisoning remain
                        undiscovered.</p>
                    <p>There are many other serial questions that ought at once to be tackled, but
                        time forbids me to go into more details. The education question is too vast
                        a one for me to raise, though, undoubtedly some country schools should be
                        established for the fellsheen aod their children, both male and female. We
                        should not then have had to deplore the event in regard to the American
                        missionaries, who by the way, I must say to their credit, have done good
                        educational work in this country. The police and the coast guards, also the
                        children in the Government schools, should at once be instruct- ed in
                        rendering first aid to the injured.</p>
                    <p>It may be urged that it is difficult for a highly centralised Government like
                        that of Egypt to deal with these matters. That would be an argument for the
                        adoption of municipal, district, and provincial councils with powers to
                        attend to these matters. But in that case, I hope the Government would not
                        limit the voting as in <placeName>Alexandria</placeName> to merchants, im-
                        porters and exporters. What would be the present condition of
                            <placeName>London</placeName> and where would be the progressives of the
                        London County Council, if the electors were only members of the above-named
                        classes. To do solid work for the people, it is necessary to have a wide
                        suffrage.</p>
                    <p>If in lieu of seeking for more repressive powers over a hardworking,
                        industrious, in- telligent and generally well-behaved section of the
                        population, as the European or foreign element is, the authorities were to
                        divert their attention to the wants of the poor, we might never have had to
                        lament the recent disturbances, we should do away with all disaffection
                        among the natives, and the Government would have deserved well of the people
                        and of posterity—Yours truly J. Amigo. <placeName>Port Said</placeName>,

                    <p>About three weeks ago I was reminded by a little incident which I will
                        endeavour to relate in a few words, that native justice in
                            <placeName>Egypt</placeName> has still something to learn. I sent an
                        Arab servant to a native part of the town on an errand. While there he was
                        attacked by two of his co religionists, and so badly beaten that I sent him
                        to a doctor, who made a written report that the map required ten days'
                        medical treatment. The police acted very well in the matter and promptly
                        arrested the two offen- ders, who were with my servant examined by the
                        Parquet, and in due time, or at all events in about a fortnight, the matter
                        was brought before a summary judge, who very rightly condemned the principal
                        aggressor to prison for a fortnight and his assistant to a fine of L.E. 10.
                        Probably the master is still grinning at the idea of having done better than
                        the sub. ’Had the matter ended here, there would have been nothing to
                        complain about, bnt unfortunately the judge did not seem to think that he
                        had done enough, so he imposed on my man a fine of L.E. 1 or a fortnight’s
                        imprisonment; against the advice of his friends, my man rather rashly paid
                        the L.E. 1 instead of going to pri- son. Now he and all his family say they
                        are ruined, so that for mere pity I am obliged to pay him back the L.E. 1,
                        plus the chemist's and the doctor's bill, so that this little errand on
                        which I sent my innocent servant costs me nearly £4. I am told that there is
                        no appeal, but am also told that I may be comforted with the assurance that
                        the judgment was “motivé," because while he was being held by No. 1 he
                        struck No. 2, who was at that time doing his best to smash my man’s head, in
                        which attempt he appeared to me to have had a reasonable amount of success.
                        Does not the Native Code admit any sort of legitimate defence ? If my man
                        had submitted tamely, there is a great probability that he would have been
                        killed.</p>
                    <p>I understand that the emblem of justice is generally represented by a person
                        holding scales ; if that emblem still holds good in the Egyptian Native
                        Courts, I beg to ask, through the medium of your columns, that someone
                        should be appointed to give a few lessons on their use to those who are
                        entrusted to handle them.</p>
                    <p>Is this the sort of justice into whose hands we are supposed to fall, if, as
                        you suggest in your article, we give up the "Capitulations," because if so I

                        devant ce tribunal; quils demandent en meme temps la fixation du montant du
                        pejudice materiel et moral subi par suite du nanfrage;</p>
                    <p>Attendu que la Societe Florio Rubattino declare que par suite de l’abandon
                        elle n’a pas de conclusions a prendre du chef de la liquidation des sommes
                        reclamees a titre de dommages-interets et qu'elle adhere-a la nomi- nation
                        du liquidateur judiciaire dans les termes de la demande ; qu’il y a lieu de

                    <head>THE RECENT PROCLAMATION.</head>
                    <head>THE SUDAN GOVERNMENTS ACTION.</head>
                    <p>A few days ago we published a proclamation, issued by the Sudan Government,
                        directing that no vessel shall be allowed to pass
                        <placeName>Bor</placeName>, on the White Nile, without permit. It is stated
                        that the Congo Free State forces have for some time past occupied part of
                        the territory situat- ed between the Congo and Nile water-hed and the fifth
                        parallel of north latitude, the owner ship of which is disputed by the Sudan
                        and Congo Governments. Diplomacy having failed to secure the withdrawal of
                        the Congolese forces, the Sudan Government has decided to close the Nile
                        entirely to the Congo posts. Therefore, until the matter has been decided
                        Government steamers will not call at any of the Belgian posts with
                        passengers, mails, or goods. The question at issue is of considerable
                        importance and it will therefore be both of interest and of value briefly to
                        recall on what grounds <persName>King Leopold</persName> occupies spy
                        territory at all in the <placeName>Upper Nile Valley</placeName>, and what
                        are the claims put forward by him to which the British Government,
                        representing tbo interests of <placeName>Egypt</placeName> and the
                            <placeName>Sudan</placeName>, finds itself unable to assent.</p>

                    <head>STRUGGLE FOR THE BAHREL GAZAI</head>
                    <p>To arrive at a right understanding of the questions at issue, it is necessity
                        to cast one’s thoughts back for about a dozen years, to the time when
                            <placeName>Great Britain</placeName>, <placeName>France</placeName> and
                        the <placeName>Congo State</placeName> were all advancing claims to the
                            <placeName>Bahrel Ghazal</placeName>. King Leopold had already taken
                        steps to establish vested interests ih the country, while
                            <placeName>France</placeName> was gradually extending her influenoe
                        eastwards across the continent for her Congo Colony. The British Government
                        was rather awkwardly situated. From Egypt the road to the Upper Nile was
                        barred by the Khalifa, while access by the East Coast route was little more
                        feasible, no <placeName>Uganda</placeName> railway having then been
                        constructed. Such was the position of affairs when the Earl of Kimberley, as
                        British Minister for Foreign Affairs, conceived a subtle solution of the
                        problem. Let the <placeName>Congo State</placeName> recognise the
                            <placeName>Upper Nile Valley</placeName> as within the British sphere of
                        influences; then <persName>King Leopold</persName> might be granted a lease
                        of extensive territories, which in the occupation of the <placeName>Congo
                            State</placeName> would interpose an effective barrier between French
                        ambitions and the <placeName>Nile</placeName>. For a time all seemed to
                        promise well for the execution of these plans. On May 12, 1894, Sir Francis
                        Plunkett, the British Minister at <placeName>Brussels</placeName>, and
                            <persName>M. van Eetvelde</persName>, Secretary of State of the Interior
                        of the Independent State of the Congo, signed at the Belgian capital an
                        agreement in which the Congo-Nile watershed was laid down as the boundary of
                        the Congo State to the north- west of the Albert Nyanza. At the same time,
                        however, an extensive area lying between the Nile and the Congo-Nile
                        watershed was leased to <persName>King Leopold</persName> by
                            <placeName>Great Britain</placeName>. This area was limited on the north
                        by the 10th parallel of north latitude—so that Fa- shoda was just included
                        in the leased territory —and on the west by the 25th meridian east of
                            <persName>Greenwich</persName>. It was divided into two parts by the
                        30th meridian east of <placeName>Greenwich</placeName>. The lease of the
                        eastern of these two sections—that is, of course, the section fronting on
                        the <placeName>White Nile</placeName> was to lapse on the death of King
                        Leopold ; but in the western and larger section the lease was to continue so
                        long as the Congo territories, whether constituted as an independent State
                        or as a Belgian - Colony, remained under the sovereignty of <persName>King
                            Leopold</persName> and <persName>King Leopold</persName>’s
                        successors.</p>

                    <head>AN ABORTIVE AGREEMENT.</head>
                    <p>No British Government, it need scarcely be said, would to-day venture to
                        conclude an agree- ment of this nature with the Congo State; but in 1894 it
                        was still possible for the <persName>Earl of Kimberley</persName> to write
                        that the Government were satisfied that "this portion of the British sphere
                        will be administered in a spirit in full accord- ance with the requirements
                        of civilisation and ot the Acts of <placeName>Berlin</placeName> and
                            <placeName>Brussels</placeName>." Naturally the agreement contained no
                        reference to Lord Kimberley’s design, to let the forces of the
                            <placeName>Congo State</placeName> into the <placeName>Bakzel
                            Ghazal</placeName> in order to act as a check on French expansion. But
                        it is noteworthy that on the day the agreement was signed <persName>Sir
                            Francis Plunkett</persName> addressed to <persName>M. van
                            Eetvelde</persName> a despatch conveying an assurance that facilities
                        would be given for recruiting men in British West Africa, "to facilitate the
                        prompt and complete occupation by his <persName>Majesty King Leopold
                            II</persName>. of the terri- tories in the western basin of the
                            <placeName>Nile</placeName> com- prised in the lease." There was no
                        misconcep- tion, indeed, on the part of Frenchmen as to the effect of the
                        agreement. It is unnecessary to enter into details. The scheme proved to be
                        utterly abortive. <persName>King Leopold</persName> had concluded one
                        agreement with the British Government; he made no great bones about
                        concluding with the French Government another agreement which rendered the
                        first non-effective. Three- months had only just elapsed when on August 14,
                        1894, <persName>King Leopold</persName>'s duly accredited re- presentatives
                        formally renounced on his behalf, in exchange for the recognition by France
                        of certain frontier claims elsewhere, all rights of occupation in the Nile
                        Valley on side the southern half of the particular section of the territory
                        leased by <placeName>Great Britain</placeName>, of which the lease was to
                        lapse on <persName>King Leopold</persName>’s death. It is this comparatively
                        restricted area, extending north along the west bank of the
                            <placeName>Nile</placeName> from <placeName>Lake Albert</placeName> to 5
                        deg. 20 min. N. latitude which is known as the Lado enclave.</p>

                    <head>BRITISH FREEDOM FROM OBLIGATION</head>
                    <p>It may he admitted that if <placeName>France</placeName> had made up her mind
                        to try to gain control of the <placeName>Upper Nile</placeName>, King
                        Leopold would have been placed in rather an awkward position had he occupied
                        the whole of the leased area. On the other hand; if he decided that he had
                        no alternative but to yield to the representations of the French Government
                        and conclude the agreement of August, 1894, then the British Government must
                        be held to be at liberty to declare the privileges accorded to King Leopold
                        in the previous May to be cancelled. No <placeName>Congo State</placeName>
                        administration was established in the <placeName>Bahr el Ghazal</placeName>
                        to act as a buffer be- tween the French and the <placeName>Nile</placeName>;
                        and it is a matter of history that the advent of Major Marchand at Fashoda
                        brought the two Great Powers of Western Europe to the verge of war. Yet not
                        only has the <placeName>Congo State</placeName> continued to occupy the
                            <placeName>Lado enclave</placeName>, but King Leopold has even advanced
                        claims to lease hold rights over the territories which by agreement with
                            <placeName>France</placeName> he undertook not to occupy.</p>
                    <p>It is unfortunate that these claims should find some appearance of support in
                        a despatch addressed by the late <persName>Marquis of Salisbury</persName>
                        during the Fashoda crisis to <persName>Sir Edmund Monson</persName>, then
                        British Ambassador at Paris. In this dispatch Lord Salisbury wrote that the
                        arrangement concluded with the King of the Belgians remained in full force,
                        never having been repudiated or annulled by <placeName>Eng-
                        land</placeName>. It is obvious, however, from what follows in the despatch
                        and from the time at which it was written that <persName>Lord
                            Salisbury</persName>’s object was to emphasise the significance of the
                        agreement of May, 1894, "as an assertion of her rights by England." There is
                        no abandon- ment of the position that <placeName>Great Britain</placeName>
                        was entitled to grant the lease, but nothing in the despatch can weaken the
                        equitable conclusion that after what transpired following the signing of the
                        agreement, the British Government is at liberty to treat the lease as null
                        and void owing to the failure of <persName>King Leopold</persName> to give
                        the consideration for which it was granted.</p>

                    <head>CONGO STATES DEFIANT ATTITUDE.</head>
                    <p>While fixed and determined in this attitude, however, there is reason to
                        believe that the British Government would not refuse to make some allowance
                        to <persName>King Leopold</persName> on the latter's resignation of the
                        position he has established in the <placeName>Lado enclave</placeName>.
                        Negotiations for with- drawal of the Congo State forces have been in
                        progress for some years past, in the spring of 1903 a report was circulated
                        that the terms of the withdrawal were on the point of being settled. The
                        hopes thus held out have not, however, been realised. What exactly is the
                        present position of affairs, either diplomatic- ally or as regards the
                        situation on the spot, is involved in obscurity. It has been stated in
                        Cairo, as the reason for the action of the Sudan Government in forbidding
                        vessels to pass <placeName>Bor</placeName> without a permit, that the
                            <placeName>Congo State</placeName> forces have for some time past
                        occupied part of the territory situated between the Congo-Nile watershed and
                        the tenth parallel of North Latitude. A glance at the map will show that the
                        territory thus indicated includes part not only of the <placeName>Lado
                            enclave</placeName> bat also of the other portion of the area originally
                        leased to <persName>King Leopold</persName>. Presumably, to judge from the
                        wording of the statement made in <placeName>Cairo</placeName>,
                            <persName>King Leopold</persName>, so far from acquiesing in the demand
                        for his withdrawal from the <placeName>Lado enclave</placeName>, has
                        overstepped the limits of that territory, claiming the right to occupy not
                        only the enclave but the whole of the leased area, and acting in defiance of
                        the British Government in pursuit of that claim.</p>

                    <p>In this connection it is impossible to overlook certain reports which may
                        very well have influen- ced the Sudanese authorities in deciding on the step
                        they have now taken. There is a suffi- ciency of evidence that great
                        activity has been displayed in fortifying the land frontiers of the Congo
                        State, whether on the south, on the east, or on the north. In the autumn of
                        last year it was repeatedly stated, in spite of official denials, that a
                        number of new forts—twenty was mentioned as the actual number—were on course
                        of erection along the frontiers ; these, it was reported, were being
                        constructed in accordance with the latest scientific principles, and were
                        being mounted with modern artillery. Some surprise was excited by this
                        informs- tion, seeing that in 1885 the <placeName>Congo State</placeName>
                        had declared its perpetual neutrality and had claimed the advantages
                        guaranteed by the Berlin Act, at the same time assuming the duties which
                        neutrality carries with it. By Chapter III of the Berlin Act, to which the
                        declaration of neutrality referred, the sig- natory Powers bound themselves
                        to respect the neutrality of the conventional basin of the Congo so long as
                        the Powers exercising the rights of sovereignty or protectorate therein,
                        "using their option of proclaiming themselves neutral, shall fulfill the
                        duties which neutral- ity requires.” It was further laid down that in the
                        event of a serious disagreement between any of the signatory Powers
                        originating on the subject of, or in the limits of, the con- ventional basin
                        of the Congo, “these Powers bind themselves before appealing to arms to have
                        recourse to the mediation of one or more of the friendly Powers. In a
                        similar case, the same Powers reserve to themselves the option of having
                        recourse to arbitration.”</p>

                    <p>The <placeName>Nile Valley</placeName>, however, is outside the scope of the
                        provisions of the Berlin Act, and the <placeName>Congo State</placeName>’s
                        declaration of neutrality does not extend to the <placeName>Lado
                            enclave</placeName>. Accord- ing to one estimate that was put forward
                        last year the forces then in the enclave numbered six thousand seasoned
                        troops. This report was discredited by the Congo State Administration at
                        Brussels, butt evidence at first hand of the military activity of the State
                        authorities was furnished three or four years ago by <persName>M.
                            Didier</persName>, a member of the expedition under the Vicomte du Bourg
                        de Bozas which crossed Africa from east to west. <persName>M.
                            Didier</persName> gave particulars of the strength of various Belgian
                        posts on the Nile, and stated that at <placeName>Yei</placeName>, a place on
                        the Yei tributary of the Nile, he found a garrison of seven hundred and
                        fifty men, officered by Europeans, occupying a hexagonal-shaped fort in
                        which was mounted a battery of Norden- faldt guns and Maxims. It is evident
                        that here are the elements of a serious situation, especially when it is
                        remembered that the international position in Europe offers an exceptional
                        opportunity to the Sovereign of the Congo State for the employment of those
                        subterranean methods of diplomacy of which he is recognised as a past master
                        by every Chancellery in Europe.</p>

                    <p>London, December 16.</p>
                    <p>Captain C. C. Maude, D.S.O., 2nd Battalion Prince Albert's Somersetshire
                        Light Infantry, Devonport ; Lieutenant G. S. Symes, 1st Battalion Hampshire
                        Regiment, D.S.O, Ports- mouth, and Lieutenant G. S. Wilson, 2nd Battalion
                        West India Regiment, <placeName>Sierra Leone</placeName>.</p>
                    <p><persName>Captain Maude</persName>, who was latterly employed with the
                        Northern Nigeria Regiment, has been nearly ten years in the army, and his
                        decora- tion was earned in the recent operations in Northern Nigeria.</p>
                    <p><persName>Lieutenant Symes</persName> has been five and a half years in the
                        Hampshires, and was latterly with the 1st Battalion at
                            <placeName>Portsmouth</placeName>. He earned the D.S.O. in
                            <placeName>Somaliland</placeName>.</p>
                    <p><persName>Lieutenant Wilson</persName> received his first com- mission in
                        January, 1899, and has seen some service in <placeName>West

                    <p>The last of the much criticised scout cruisers — the Attentive - has just
                        finished her speed trials. This scout, which was built by the worid-famed
                        firm of <persName>Sir W. G. Armstrong</persName>, Whitworth and Co.,
                        Elswick, proved herself the speediest of her type, as she reeled off 26 1/2
                        knots per hour in the last hour of her trials, whilst her mean speed for the
                        eight hours was 25.88 knots. The Attentive measures 874 feet in length, with
                        a beam of 38 feet 3 inches and a displacement of 2,620 tons, at a draught of
                        12 1/2m feet. She carries an armament of ten 12 pounders, eight 8-pounders,
                        torpedo tubes, and a crew of 268 all told.</p>
                    <p>The fire destroyers of the River class, which were recently sent from the
                        Mediterranean Fleet to the China Station, have been ordered home. As was
                        pointed out at the time in these notes, this class of destroyer, whilst
                        possessing many good qualities, particularly seaworthiness in dirty weather,
                        are too slow, their best speed being 25 knots, and too bulky for their risky
                        work in war time. A single shot would sink one of them, and the high
                        freeboard presents a good mark to a hostile gunner. They most likely will
                        find useful work as tenders in har- bour and for training purposes.</p>
                    <p>It will not be the fault of <persName>Lord Roberts</persName> if his
                        reiterated admonitions fail to arouse the population at large to a higher
                        sense of pa- triotic obligation than has existed latterly. Even at the risk
                        of being twitted with re peating himself, the ex-Commander-in-Chief took up
                        the same ground in his discourse at <placeName>Newcastle-on-Tyne</placeName>
                        last week. With much of what fell from him in connection with Army
                        re-organisation on a broad and comprehensive plan, we are in entire
                        ageement. We still hold that all schoolboys between certain ages should
                        receive elementary military training, to fit them for taking personal part
                        in the defence of the Empire in after life. The veteran Field Marshal's call
                        upon the nation to cultivate a higher spirit in connection with that
                        obligation also coincides with what has frequently appeared in your columns.
                        It is undeniable that "the flag” does, not com- mand the same degree of
                        popular homage that is accorded to it by other nations. While, too, our
                        great Colonies enthusiasti- cally celebrate Empire Day in one form or
                        another, the Motherland continues to regard the innovation with more
                        indifference than liking. So far, then, we are completely at one with Lord
                        Roberts, and wish him all pos- sible success in the campaign he has under-
                        taken. But if we may hint an apparently hostile criticism, it is that
                        although the fundamental principles of his programme are absolutely sound,
                        they need to have their practical application much more clearly defin- ed.
                        It is a popular conception, largely fed by Little Englander denunciations,
                        that Conscrip- tion lies at the back of his scheme, and he may be sure that
                        his present allocation will narrowly bs searched for fresh evidence. In any
                        great national emergency, whether insular or Impe- rial, the State would
                        have the right to apply compulsury enlistment; that is, of course, a truism.
                        But that is a wholly different matter to conscription in ordinary times as a
                        basis of military defence.</p>

                    <p>Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People have cured of a violent form of
                        indigestion the yonng lady whose portrait is given below.— <persName>Mlle.
                            Hélène Coulloux</persName>, of <placeName>22, Rne Gondimet, Limoges,
                            France</placeName>.</p>
                    <p>"For about eight- een months,” she states, "I suffered intensely from weak
                        digestion. I could not digest even the lightest forms of food, and I gradu-
                        ally lost strength. My weakness be- came so pronounced that after the least
                        exertion I gasped for breath. At last I could eat practi- cally nothing, I
                        lost <persName>Mlle Helene Coulloux</persName>, weight, was nervous, Cured
                        by Dr. Williams' and obtained little Pink Pill. sleep. After trying in vain
                        all sorts of remedies, and when in despair of being cured I was advised by a
                        friend to take Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills. I did, and after two boxes I was
                        completely cured. I regained a good colour, an excellent appetite, a perfect
                        diges- tion, and the strength that comes with new blood."</p>
                    <p>All women, all young girls, desire tbe good health that makes them
                        attractive. If they are not well they lose their charms, especially if they
                        suffer from bloodlessness or indigestion. The anaemic sickly woman carries
                        the traces of suffering in her face. Her complexion is sallow, her eyes
                        sunken with dark circles, while sick headaches and pain after any exer- tion
                        make her wrinkled and aged. The woman who derives no benefit from food
                        becomes thin and loses her figure. Indigestion is one of the principal
                        causes of insomnia ; conse- quently anaemic women who cannot digest food
                        lose strength daily, and at night obtain little or no rest.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Williams' Pink Pills cure ruined diges- tions. They impart an appetite,
                        fortify the system and restore lost strength. Dr. Williams' Pink Pills
                        achieve this result by their wonderful action on the blood, which they
                        enrich and renew. Under the influence of this pure, rich blood the vital
                        organs are strengthened. In this way, and by their tonic action on the
                        nerves, Dr. Williams' Pink Pills have cured repeatedly anaemia, indigestion,
                        consumption, eczema, rheumatism, sciatica, St Vitus' dance, paralysis,
