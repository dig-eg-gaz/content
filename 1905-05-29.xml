                    <head>MONDAY, MAY 29, 1905 THE NAVAL BATTLE</head>
                    <p>This morning’s telegrams are somewhat more satisfactory than the almost
                        complete silence of yesterday's telegrams. We now know at any rate that a
                        battle was fought on Saturday evening in the Korean Straits between a
                        portion of the Baltic Fleet and the Japanese Squadron. A telegram from the
                        American Consol at Nagasaki to his Government at Washington states that the
                        Japanese sank one Russian battle-ship, four other warships, and a
                        repair-ship in the straits. The battle of Saturday was evidently not
                        decisive and it is impossible to suppose that by even the most fortuitous
                        combination of circumstances Admiral Togo could in a single battle have put
                        the Russian Armada completely out of action. The greater part of the Russian
                        fleet clearly have survived the first fight, and, assuming that the Japanese
                        ships of the same class are left in a condition that may prevent them from
                        chasing their antagonists far, there can be little doubt that Vladivostok
                        will be the haven of refuge aimed at by the Russians. It has been the
                        practice in naval encounters in this war for the Russians to fight and run,
                        and it was regarded as certain than an endeavour would be made, either
                        before battle was actually joined or at the earliest possible moment
                        afterwards, to slip away northward. Prom the Japanese point of view,
                        however, it is eminently satisfactory to find that this was not the case.
                        The main anxiety with Japanese naval men is lest tips fight, of which
                        Saturday was only the beginning, should be only an indecisive one. The most
                        mysterious bit of news in this morning's telegrams is the announcement from
                        Tokio that four Russian warships passed the Kurile Straits going west on
                        Thursday. These straits are north of the fiftieth degree of latitude and
                        separate. Kamtchatka from Shumshu and Paramushir, the most northerly islands
                        of the Kuriles, if these be, as is surmised, four light cruisers of Admiral
                        Rodjestvensky, their position is inexplicable.</p>

                    <p>With regard to the total strength of the forces engaged : — Admiral
                        Rodjestvensky's squadron consists of seven battleships and eight cruisers ;
                        Admiral Nebogatoff's squadron consists of four battleships and one cruiser.
                        Total, eleven battleships, nine cruisers,together with probably thirteen
                        destroyers and some eleven armed auxiliaries. Here we must distinguish. Of
                        the battleships no more than four are of the same power and speed: these are
                        the "Kniaz Suvaroff,” "Alexander III.," “Borodino,” and "Orel” of Admiral
                        Rodjestvensky's squadron. Of the rest in that squadron the "Ossliabia” is
                        smaller, slower, and less power-ful,and the "Sissoi Veniky” and the
                        "Navarin” are slower and less powerful than the "Ossliabia.” Of the four
                        battleships in Admiral Nebogatoff's squadron the "Nicolai I." may be grouped
                        with the ‘Sissoi Veliky" and the "Navarin,” though each differs from the
                        other in speed and gun-power;and the three remaining ships—the“Ad miral
                        Oushakoff,” “Admiral Seniavin,” and the "Admiral Apraxine" -are ranked as
                        coast-defence ships, being only one-third the site of the four vessels of
                        the "Kniaz Suvaroff'' class Of the cruisers three only—the “Dimitri
                        Donskoi," the "Vladimir Monomakh,” and the "Admiral Nakhimoff"—are armoured
                        ; that is, they have a belt of armour in addition to the steel protective
                        deck. The Russian Fleet, therefore, divides naturally into two squadrons of
                        battleships, one consisting of four homogeneous ships and the other a
                        miscellaneous force of seven. To these may be added the three armoured
                        cruisers as being partly fit to lie in the line of battle ; and for scouting
                        purposes there remain six cruisers of varying speeds and fighting power, the
                        thirteen destroyers, and the eleven armed auxiliaries. From this
                        distribution, as we shall presently see, arise certain tactical
                        considerations.</p>

                    <p>The total strength of the forces of the Japanese Fleet is four first-class
                        battleships, two inferior battleships, twenty-four cruisers, some twenty
                        destroyers, and sixty-seven torpedo-boats, and an unknown number of armed
                        auxiliaries—say forty, and, as it now appears, thirteen submarines. The four
                        battleships— “Asabi”, "Shikishima", "Mikasa”,and"Fuji'’— make a practically
                        homogeneous squadron. Of the twenty-four cruisers, eight are armoured; these
                        also may be handled as a homogeneous squadron. The remaining sixteen
                        cruisers vary in speed from 16 knots to 22 knots.</p>
                    <p>It is at once obvious that the four homogeneous battleships of the Russian
                        Admiral are matched by the battle squadron of the Japanese. That leaves
                        seven Russian battle ships of very various degree and three Russian armoured
                        cruisers—ten heterogeneous ships--to face the fine combined squadron of
                        eight armoured cruisers, and the two inferior battleships of the Japanese :
                        while the remain ing six Russian cruisers are to be weighed against the
                        sixteen Japanese. Such a comparison can give no more than a general notion
                        of the balance of forces, since it is extremely unlikely that the whole
                        forces of one side will be opposed to the whole forces of the other at one
                        time. Nor does it take into consideration the difference in gun-power
                        existing between the two fleets, because any such calculation must be
                        largely neutralised by the skill of individuals and the circumstances under
                        which the action takes place- But since the Russians are opposing
                        battleships to cruisers, they have a certain advantage in weight of metal
                        and in armour protection.</p>

                            that their services were not required. The fire was caused by a

                            the destruction of the mattress was done. This is the 115th time the

                            yesterday. On the former day an exhibition of limelight views and

                            being placed in the centre of the building in which the entertainment

                            were greeted showed that the various groups contained the figures of
                            many who were recognized by the audience. These were followed by some

                            Christ, from the entry into Jerusalem to the Crucifixion and entombment,
                            the series closing with the "Apotheosis of Jesus." Scenes of general
                            interest followed; incidents of a house on fire, arrival of the

                    <p>The Associated Cottonginners of Egypt</p>

                    <p>A great combine of the cotton ginners of Egypt has lately been formed. We
                        give below particulars of the company, which is entitled the Associated
                        Cotton Ginners of Egypt, Limited. All the great ginners in Egypt have joined
                        the combine, and it promises to be one of the most powerful industrial
                        organizations in the country.</p>
                    <p>The whole concern was valued at double the capital as given below.
                        Subsequently it was decided to reduce the estimate on which this was based
                        by one half, each factory being paid by an equivalent in shares. The
                        Egyptian Investment and Agency, Limited, intend offering 75,000 one-pound
                        shares at a premium of one-pound to their shareholders and friends.</p>
                    <p>There are other ginning factories taken over besides those mentioned below,
                        which are only the chief concerns. Nearly all the banks are interested in
                        the company, which is destined to occupy as high a position in ginning as
                        the Societe de Pressage et des Depets does in pressing. There will probably
                        be a limited public subscription in about ten days' time.</p>
                    <p>This combine will be of great advantage in regard to the financial
                        equilibrium of industrial Egypt. Often the position of up-country ginners
                        with little capital has caused a good deal of nervousness to the banks, but
                        all this anxiety will be obviated by the combine, which will develop so as
                        the course of time to gin in all the centres, and will have a virtual
                        monopoly of this business throughout Egypt.</p>

                    <p>We deeply regret to announce the death of Mrs. Eileen Balbi, the wife of
                        Major H.A. Balbi, R.M.A., who died at Malta on Saturday week (20th May)
                        after a brief illness. The funeral, which was strictly private, took place
                        yesterday week. Mrs. Balbi was the daughter of Fleet Surgeon McDermott, R.N.
                        She had only left Alexandria with the Royal Malta Artillery, which her
                        husband commanded, a few weeks ago, and during her residence in Egypt had
                        made a large number of friends, to whom the sad news of her untimely end
                        will come as a great shock, as the deceased left Egypt in apparently the
                        best of health. The following sympathetic notice is extracted from the

                    <p>"The death of Mrs. Balbi has brought a heavy weight of grief, not only upon
                        Mrs. Balbi, but upon a large number of the inhabitants of Malta, to whom the
                        deceased lady was well-known and by whom she was greatly respected.</p>
                    <p>"In Egypt too many will learn with astonishment and sorrow that Mrs. Balbi,
                        who had helped to make the long days in a foreign land pass with less

                        willingly to the forwarding of good works of a permanent nature, is no

                        along with the contingent of the R.M.A. which had done duty there. There was
                        nothing to cause the fear that her days would so quickly end. Still there is
                        gloom now where her presence brought brightness!</p>

                        friends and acquaintances, and to awake a deep sympathy with those who now

                    <p>The possibilities of the development of Nile navigation are immense, and
                        there appears to be a good opening for the new Bus-Bost Company (Compagnie
                        des Bateaux-Omnibus) which has just been founded. The objects of the new
                        company are the transport of persons, goods, cattle, etc., by waterway in
                        Egypt and all other enterprises subsidiary thereto. The company declares
                        that it recognizes retrospectively the concession granted to Messrs. Ad.
                        Cattaui and Co. by the Egyptian Government for the construction of pontoons
                        on the two banks of the Nile between Old Cairo and Rod el-Farag, and of the
                        conventions made by the same firm with Messrs. Thos. Cook and Son (Egypt),
                        Limited, and the Anglo-American Nile Steamers and Hotel Company, Limited.
                        The capital is L.E. 10,000 in 2,500 shares of L.E. 4 each. It has already
                        been subscribed and the following persons have taken up the undermentioned
                        amount of shares.</p>

                        Hotels Company will be held at Cairo, when a very satisfactory statement of
                        this company�s progress will be placed before the shareholders. We
                        understand that 35,000 pound six per cent debentures are to be redeemed, and
                        besides a dividend of eight per cent will be given, making a total of nine
                        per cent. The company has been so successful this year that all the
                        preliminary expenses, which amounted to nearly 3000 pounds, are to be
                        written of, and 10000 pounds will be placed to the reserve, bringing the
                        reserve fund up to about 12,000, and leaving about 2700 pounds to be carried

                    <p>At the meeting of the council of the Suez Canal Company held on the 22nd
                        inst., the dividend on the ordinary shares for the year 1904 was fixed at
                        141fr. (5 pounds 12s. 9d.) net, free of taxes, equivalent to a little more
                        than 28 per cent on the 500 fr. shares. Mr. T.W. Hughes, the managing
                        director of the Harrison Line, of Liverpool, was at the same time nominated
                        as a British administrator in the place of Mr. J.B. Westray, who has
                        resigned. It is believed that the transit dues will be reduced from 8fr.50c.
                        To 7fr.75c from January 1 next, in consequence of the increase in the
                        receipts. The dividends for 1904 to be distributed by the company include
                        the following:--O shares "de jouissance,"" fr. 117.447:, and on founder's
                        shares, fr. 66.57, both net.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Machell left Cairo last Thursday and proceeded to Maghagha, where the
                        larger flights of locusts have been observed, in order to personally inspect
                        this part of the country and to find out if any damage had been done, and to
                        what extent the locusts had laid eggs. He found, however, that although a
                        considerable number of locusts had slighted in these spots, they had almost
                        entirely disappeared, and that very few eggs had been laid. Owing to the
                        prevalence of N. to N.E. winds there is very little fear of a recurrence of
                        the plague from which the country suffered last year.</p>

                        but the capital informed Dr. Vay that the patient, who is an Indian, fell
                        ill four days after leaving Bombay and that for three days his temperature
                        was 40 to 40.5 Centigrade, after which he gradually improved, and his
                        condition is now satisfactory. After disinfection the vessel was allowed to
                        proceed through the canal in quarantine.</p>

                    <p>L'Importation des armes en Egypte </p>
                    <p>Monsieur le Directeur de "l'Egyptian Gazette." </p>
                    <p>L'importation des fusils a pris ces dernières années de très grandes
                        proportions. Le Gouvernement Egyptien, semblant s'alarmer, vient de
                        promulguer deux "arrêtes" l'un pour restreindre le port d'armes et l’autre
                        pour en entraver le commerce. Rien cependant ne justifiait ici de telles
                        mesures qui ne peuvent être appliquées que dans un pays ou l'on appréhende
                        des soulèvements ou dans des régions peuplées de sauvages. Les raisons qui
                        ont décidé, parait il, le Gouvernement a élaborer les deux nouvelles lois
                        sont principalement que les fusils parviennent au Soudan oh les naturels
                        pourraient s'en servir à Poccasion d'arme contre les blances, qu'en tous cas
                        ils servent à ceux qui s’adonnent a la chasse des animaux sauvages dont il
                        faut prévenir la destruction par tous les moyens et qu'en Egypte il
                        encourage le brigandage dans les provinces. </p>
                    <p>Il faut remarquer tout d'abord que la forte importation d'armes en ce pays ne
                        peut être considérée comme un danger public, vu que le 92% des armes sont de
                        mauvaise qualité: Les fusils sont généralement de provenance belge et sont
                        vendus à 25 francs environ. Ils ne peuvent servir a l'usage des balles, car
                        le canon se fendrait aux premiers coups. Le grand nombre de oes fusils
                        importés s'explique par le fait que ces armes ordinaires n'ont ayec
                        l’humidité du pays et l’incurie du fellah, qu’une durée maxima de 6 mois.
                        Ici on se paye le luxé de 2 fusils par an, tandis qu'un seul suffirait en
                        Europe pour deux générations. </p>
                    <p>Il est d'autre part difficile de citer des meurtres avec detelles armes qui
                        ne supportent d'ailleurs que la plomb et ne sont que d’une force de
                        pénétration très faible.</p>
                    <p>Le fait de fixer nomme prix minimum d'on revolver fr. 200, équivant purement
                        et simplement à la prohibition de la vente de cet article de première

                                des prix, est restée ce qu'elle était la semaine précédente,
                                c'est-à-dire irrégularité dans les prix, grand calme dans les
                                affaires et demande limitée de cotons bas et de provenances
                                Haute-Egypte. Du reste, toutes ces qualités ont subi une hausse de
                                1/4 à 3/8 de talari, tandis que les classements livrables contrats
                                ont été réduits de 1 1/4 talari, la base des cours étant désormais
                                la cote du juillet. </p>

                                moments très actif, ce qui, après quelques fluctuations, se résume
                                en un peu de hausse. Les nouvelles de l’Américain contribuent pour
                                beaucoup dans cette amélioration de la position du novembre. </p>
                            <p>Récolte actuelle.—Il y a eu de nombreuses fluctuations, mais de peu

                                vaut un peu de hausse sur le juillet. Quand à la tendance, elle
                                reste en faveur des scheteurs, les gros détenteurs, qui ont fait le
                                coup du mai, semblant toujours décidés à répéter la manœuvre sur le
                                juillet D'ailleurs avec les can. 250,000 en cours de réception toute
                                autre conduite serait incompréhensible.</p>

                    <p>SECOND SUMMER MEETING. SECOND DAY’S RACING.</p>
                    <p>More animation prevailed at Saturday’s racing than was the case on Thursday.
                        The enclosure was well filled with Alexandria racegoers, as well as a number
                        of well-known racing men from Cairo. As on the first day the weather left
                        nothing to be desired, and, given the excellent playing of the R. Berks.
                        band, under Bandmaster Dore, all the elements for spending a pleasant
                        afternoon were present. As to the racing, this was decidedly of a more
                        interesting character than Thursday’s. The events were well contested and
                        the handicapping was admirable. Moreover, the course was in the pink of
                        condition, which in itself moans a great deal. The first event, the May
                        Selling Race, was won fairly easily by Sir Visto from Firefly, who made a
                        plucky effort to win. The Omnium Stakes was a gift to Bandusia. In the
                        Montazah Plate, El Tahawi, on his previous form, was moat fancied, but in
                        the event Sweetie won a close race from Radium, who was also well patronised
                        by backers. The Owners’ Handicap provided the surprise of the day, being
                        quite an outsiders’ race. Latiff was generally conceded to win, while Roland
                        and Sadik were supposed to have a very good chance. As a matter of fact,
                        Khalil Pasha Khayat, to whom Latiff, Sadik, and Au Revoir belong, declared
                        to win with either of the two former, but the result was to upset all
                        calculations. The winner turned up in Au Revoir, with Amory and Abou Arkoub
                        second and third respectively. Backers of the winning mount were rewarded by
                        a 32 to 1 chance. The Khedivial Club Cup went to Hassan Pasha Mohsen, whose
                        Gogo, carrying 9 st, including 7 lb. penalties, won as he liked by five
                        lengths from Fahd. The Pony Stakes afforded a fine race, which Suleik won
                        comparatively easily. The most of the afternoon's luck went to Khalil Pasha
                        Khayat, who won three out of the six races. Following are the particulars of
                        each event:— MAY SELLING RACE of P.T. 2 000. For Arabs. Horses 10.7. Ponies

                    <p>The field were got off to a good start, with the exception of Oyama, who got
                        left at the post about 6 lengths behind. The field lay well together, Oyama
                        tailing off until entering the straight, when he came through his horses but
                        could not overtake Firefly and Sir Visto, who won by a couple of lengths,
                        the same distance separating second and third. Time, 1.57.</p>

                        post, when Khalil Pasha Khayat’s mare romped in an easy winner. Time,
                        1.48.</p>

                    <p>Totalisator paid P.T. 26 on winner. MONTAZAH PLATE of P.T. 5,000, viz . P.T.

                    <p>The start in this race was quite invisible owing to the unsightly hoardings
                        we have already referred to. When the field emerged from the cutting,
                        Sweetie was seen to bo in front with Klondyke and Tamerlan at his heels, and
                        the rest of the field close up. In the race for home, all were riding, and
                        it looked anybody’s race. This order was maintained until half up the
                        straight, when Radium came with a clatter and made a bold bid for victory,
                        but could never reach Sweetie, missing first place by half a length.
                        Tamerlan was the same distance behind, third, and there was a neck between
                        third and fourth. Time, 1.8. </p>

                    <p>Totalisator paid P.T. 117 on winner and P.T. 38, 73, and 32 for places.</p>

                        position was maintained until entering the cutting, when Au Revoir, Latiff,
                        and Sadik joined and took the lead into the straight Amory and Abou Arkoub
                        then came with a rush just behind Au Revoir, who could never be overtaken
                        and won cleverly by a couple of lengths. Half a length divided 2nd and 3rd,
                        the others were in a bunch behind. Time, 1.31. </p>

                        Gogo and Moofid led off, followed by Valentino. This order was maintained
                        until entering the cutting, when Fahd took second place to Gogo, with
                        Valentino and Moofid close up. Coming into the straight, Gogo stalled off
                        the challenge of Fahd and won easily by 2 lengths. One length separated 2nd
                        and 3rd; the rest were in a procession. Time, 2.30. </p>

                    <p>We regret to hear that, despite all the talk and all the effort of the last
                        few weeks, the new applications for shares of this association are
                        disappointingly small. Since attention was called to the lukewarmness of
                        Lancashire some two months ago, only about £15,000 extra has been
                        subscribed, and this despite the urgency of the numerous appeals made to the
                        liberality and patriotism of the great mercantile community in the North of
                        England . The "Times" assert that “when all is said and done, Lancashire has
                        so far failed to rise to what was expected of her. The most sanguine members
                        of the association fear it will be almost hopeless to anticipate success in
                        raising the half-million of capital necessary for the adequate encouragement
                        of British cotton growing." Is is a truly regrettable state of affairs.</p>

                    <p>AMERICAN WOMEN'S PREFERENCE FOR OUR COUNTRY.</p>

                    <p>Lady Henry Somerset relates, in the "New York American,” a conversation she
                        had at a club in Loudon for American women, with a prominent American, who
                        said that in all her experience of American women living in England, she had
                        only known one who was really homesick.</p>

                    <p>“How do you account for this ?" Lady Henry asked, "do you think that it is
                        the innate beauty of the English country, or the historic associations which
                        appeal to American women ?”</p>

                    <p>"Both,” she replied, going on to say that of course there were several things
                        that were missed on first coming to England, "but we soon become accustomed
                        to them, and, indeed, afterwards prefer the English ways. Then the climate
                        is so splendid, you can work here all the year round. It is never too hot or
                        too cold. A woman is not forced to leave her husband during the hot weather.
                        Families can remain together, and enjoy the town or the country, as the case
                        may be. The climate is less exciting, and better for the nerves.”</p>

                    <p>“But is it not your idea that American women miss the adulation which is
                        lavished upon them in their own country ?"</p>

                    <p>"I think at first they do,” she replied, "but by and by they begin to see
                        that they can occupy a plane of frank comradeship with men, and that on the
                        whole it is a far greater compliment than the mere admiration, which,
                        nevertheless, leaves them outside the work and interests of the men's world.
                        So, therefore, in the long run, I think they prefer the country which gives
                        them a greater equality with man, allows them to share his pursuits, his
                        interests, and his work, instead of placing them on a pedestal to be adored
                        in men’s leisure moments. There is more companionship here between the
                        sexes."</p>

                    <p>The Belgian Government has submitted to the Chamber proposals of the most
                        important nature for the construction of a new railway line connecting the
                        German frontier with Antwerp, with the double end in view of capturing the
                        whole of the traffic from England Germany, which was previously carried in
                        part through Holland, and of making Antwerp the port for all central
                        Germany. The railway is to be constructed on plans permitting of the use of
                        electrical transit, and the Belgian Government states that it intends to
                        provide for a speed of two hundred kilometres an hour. In order to realise
                        this great speed, the line is to be laid down without level crossings,
                        curves, bifurcations, or great inclines. It will run by Saint Trond,
                        Tongres, and Argenteau. The line has been planned in conformity with a
                        convention between Germany and Belgium, made in August, 1903, but the
                        realisation of which was deferred, owing to the opposition of Belgian
                        politicians, friendly to France, who thought they saw in it too great an
                        inclination to satisfy the needs of Germany, strategical as well as
                        commercial.</p>

                    <head>AN ITALIAN UNIVERSITY.</head>
                    <p>The question of founding an Italian University in Austria has once more been
                        discussed in the Reichstag. The Government brought in a Bill for
                        establishing a University in the Tyrol, but the scheme was energetically
                        opposed by the Italian deputies, who insist that Trieste must be the seat of
                        the institution. But the Minister of Public Instruction, while admitting the
                        necessity of higher education for the Italians of the Dual Monarchy,
                        declared that Trieste was impossible, because it is not purely Italian, but
                        is the centre of a large Czech population. He feared that the establishment
                        of a University at Trieste would bring about disturbances similar to those
                        which have occurred at Innspruck. But the real reason is that Trieste is the
                        centre of Italian aspirations in Austria, and the Government are afraid that
                        they will give an added impulse to Irredentism if they allow a University
                        there. Moreover, the Germans, who brought about the suppression of the
                        Italian professorate at Innspruck, are bitterly opposed to the scheme, as
                        they object to the spread of any other language but their own in the Empire.
                        The question is a very difficult one, for the other nationalities are also
                        claiming Universities, for example, the Slovenian at Laybach, the Ruthenian
                        at Lemberg, and the Czechs at Olmutz. These, however, are matters of home
                        politics, whereas the Italian claim touches the good relationship between
                        the Empire and the kingdom of Italy.</p>

                    <p>The latest proclamation of the Social Democratic Revolutionaries, issued at
                        Odessa in tens of thousands, is of a remarkable tenour. It warns the people
                        that there is, unhappily, an increasingly greater chance of victory, an
                        eventuality which would give, temporarily at least, a renewed lease of life
                        and oppressive power to the autocracy and bureaucracy. “Every liberal and
                        patriotic Russian," the proclamation proceeds, “must hope and pray for the
                        destruction of the Russian fleet; but if that grievously desiderated
                        consummation fail, then it will behove the people at once to raise the
                        standard of open and relentless revolution against an intolerable regime. A
                        signal victory for Rodjestvensky would rescind every temporising Imperial

                        <p>To the Editor op the EGYPTIAN Gazette.</p>
                        <p>Sir,—I notice in yesterday's ‘ Gazette" a leading article on the
                            Quarantine Board, wherein you display some scepticism as to the
                            possibility of the Powers agreeing to the conditions which the Egyptian
                            Government has laid down as precedent to its acceptance of the
                            conclusions of the Paris Sanitary Conference. The question of the
                            advisability of the virtual abolition of the Quarantine Board is very
                            similar to that of the Capitulations. The general opinion is that,
                            however annoying in some respects the Capitulations are, yet if they are
                            abolished in favor of the authority of the Ministry of Justice, the
                            remedy will be far worse than the disease. Of course, this opinion is
                            only privately stated in Cairo, for even here some of us have the
                            privilege of giving vent to our opinions in private, bnt I find it is
                            generally shared by those who dare discuss the question from an
                            independent and unofficial point of view. In like manner it may well be
                            considered a moot point to hand over the functions of the Quarantine
                            Board to the Sanitary Administration. That administration has recently
                            made itself a laughing-stock by the manner it bungled over the Pharmacy
                            Regulations, which had to be withdrawn owing to their extraordinary
                            ineptitude. Not so very long ago, too, it will be remembered how poor a
                            figure the same administration out vis-a-vis the Quarantine Board when
                            Mr. Graham tried to show on whose shoulders rested the responsibility of
                            the advent of the last cholera epidemic in Egypt. With such instances,
                            and others which I need not mention, are the Powers justified in handing
                            over the important duties of the Quarantine Board to this administration
                            ? Would not the remedy in this case also be worse than the disease t— I

                        <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                        <p>Sir,—In reading your account to-day of the racing held on the A.S.C,
                            grounds, I noticed you made mention of some hoardings which had been
                            erected in connection with the “proposed pigeon shooting contests.” Am 1
                            to infer therefore that our English Sporting Club is about to take up
                            this obnoxious form of "sport." If so, I for one protest in the name of
                            the poor birds which are to be made a target of by unfeeling
                            "sportsmen."</p>
                        <p>A notable instance of the growing disfavour with which pigeon-shooting is
                            now regarded is supplied by the Hurlingham Club. The club, which came
                            into existence for the purpose of encouraging pigeon-shooting, now
                            proposes to abolish the amusement from its grounds at Fulham, after the
                            end of the current year !</p>
                        <p>Though formed as a pigeon-shooting club, the polo element has become so
                            strong of recent years that the devotees of the trap and gun have
                            dwindled, to a small and not very influential coterie. There, however,
                            the pigeon ground remains, its black, unsightly barricade an eyesore in
                            the beautiful pleasure ground of the club. The very fact that the club
                            has countenanced the recreation has proved an incabas to the managing
                            committee. Queen Alexandra, for instance, has never yet consented to
                            visit the grounds. Her Majesty’s well-known antipathy to pigeon-shooting
                            supplies a reason for this tacit disapproval of a club which numbers
                            among its members many of the best-known and most genuine sportsmen in
                            England.</p>
                        <p>It is to be hoped that the lead thus given may be generally followed, and
                            that the A.S.C, may be induced to reconsider the question, and if
                            unfortunately a decision has already been arrived at to introduce this
                            objectionable practice, that such a retrograde stop may be reversed,
                            and, as in the case of the Hurlingham Club, some less objectionable and
                            more enlightened form of amusement be substituted.— I am, etc.,</p>
