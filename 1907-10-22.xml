                    <p>I hereby certify that I have taken samples of every vatting of <hi
                            rend="bold">Mackie's White Horse Celler</hi> Blend of Scotch Whisky used
                        in bottling during the month of September, and the results of my analyses
                        indicate that it conforms to the standard for Pot Still Scotch Whisky set up
                        in the London case. I am also of opinion that it is an old Whisky of
                        excellent quality and flavour, which has been well matured in wood.</p>

                            the Japanese, he points out that the attempt of white labour to stem the
                            yellow flood is a mere inevitable expression of the instinct of self.
                            preservation.</p>
                        <p>Japanese immigration must either be restrict ed or unrestricted, he says.
                            The former course means serious diplomatic difficulty at Tokio. The
                            latter coarse means an absolutely fatal feud with Australian and
                            Canadian democracy. If Japanese immigration is not restricted the
                            Japanese will be in great majority in British Columbia in leas than a
                            decade. British white labour would be simply submerged by the yellow
                            flood :—</p>
                        <p>The colony might remain for a time under the British flag, bat would
                            ultimately cease to be in any sense a British colony. In the long ran
                            there would be a racial war, and either British Columbia would become
                            part of the United States, or the Japanesewould maintain their footing
                            upon the Pacific slope under their own flag.</p>
                        <p>It is absolutely certain that with unrestrict ed immigration California
                            in twenty years would be a Japanese State, inhabited by « white minority
                            :-—</p>
                        <p>The unrestricted influx of yellow immigrants would create along the
                            Pacific strip of North America an Asiatic Chili. The conditions of the
                            whole American problem would be gradu- ally but funadmentally
                            transformed. The most destractive of all imaginable solvents would be
                            applied to the Monroe doctrine. Asiatics would hold both sides of the
                            Pacific, as Buropeans hold both sides of the Atlantic, and all
                            civilisation might be dominated or convalsed for centaries hy that state
                            of things, as the Middle Ages were moved and vitalised by the secalar
                            conflict between Christendom and Islam.</p>
                        <p>Summing up, he concludes that for all pur poses of this generation the
                            dangers of an norestricted Asiatic invasion are too great. It will not
                            be allowed. He fully admits the diffi culty of inducing the Japanese to
                            accept a position of inequality internationally equivilant to the
                            medieval status of the Jews : —</p>
                        <p>The Japanese have, perhaps, yet to realise, as their acquaintance with
                            the West becomes more familiar and their knowledge of it more subtle,
                            that all Earopean political arrange ments, except where the direct issue
                            is war, are based upon illogical but convenient com promise must be the
                            foundation of any tempor ary settlement.</p>
                        <p>Some middle course mast be found, for :—</p>
                        <p>Atsolate exclusion of the yellow race from all the enormous anfilled
                            territories claimed as white man's country would mean war. Bat the
                            unrestricted invasion would lead even more certainly to war in a worse
                            form. No one is justified in taking an optimistic view of this
                            question.</p>
                        <p>A truly unpleasant dilemma likely to tax the patience and wisdom of
                            statesmen for many a year to come.</p>

                        <p>One of the most interesting of recent disco- veries in Egypt is a huge
                            marble head of Juno, its face absolutely uninjared, which was found near
                            Hawara in the oasis of the Fayoum. It is almost certainly of the early
                            Roman period, as there are abundant traces of Greek influence. The head
                            was obviously made separately and fitted on to the colossal statue after
                            the latter was erected ; it is 17 in. from the base ot the neck to the
                            crown of the head, and 12 im. wide at tho brow. It is one of the most
                            beautiful Roman heads that has yet been discovered in Egypt</p>

                            several years this hotel bas held a foremost place among the hostelries
                            of Ramleh, and it well sustains the-popularity which it gained during
                            the earlier years of its existence. When taken over by the Runkewitz
                            Brothers every possible improvement was effected and the hotel now
                            boasts the finest garden in Alexandria, a cuisine which cannot be
                            excelled, and a general instal- ment equal to any hotel in Egypt. The
                            service of the hotel is all that could be desired, its bedrooms are not
                            only airy but also luxuriously farnished, and private suites can be

                            proprietors of Egypt, and from among the many British clients of note

                    <head>THE LAMBERT AFFAIR.</head>
                    <p>MR. DUNLOP AND HIS ACCUSERS.</p>
                    <p>FRENCH AND EGYPTIANS.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Dunlop, so the world, or rather M. Lambert and the three “Standards,”
                        would have as believe inflicted severe injuries on the dignity of the
                        ex-Director of the Khedivial Law School, compelling him as we pointed out to
                        join in a conspiracy against the Minister of Education and to commit a
                        variety of mean- neases—nasty tricks at which the Great Karamel blushes for
                        shame. Indeed, if we are to believe the excellent jurist, Mr. Dunlop merits
                        something more than dismissal ; indeed it would seem doubtful ir the
                        gallotine— pardon we meant the gallows—were not too good an end for his
                        misspent life. For all the treasures on earth, including those gathered from
                        the subscriptions of the faithful to the three “Standards,” we would not
                        stand in Mr. Dunlop's shoes.</p>
                    <p>The ex-Director of the Law School, knowing the strong national spirit of his
                        compatriots, gives it to be clearly understood that one of the chief reasons
                        of his resignation was the impossibility for a Frenchman to co-operate with
                        a scheming and treacherous British chief. Any other action on his part would
                        have com- promised the prestige of France. The children of perfidious
                        Albion’ must be left to their national vices of treachery and lying. M.
                        Lambert who combines the qualities of a diplomat and of a jurist, has in his
                        letter, doubtless destined to be historic, appealed to the Chauvinism of a
                        section of his countrymen. Paris was indignant when she heard of the
                        disgraceful conduct of Mr. Dunlop and certain journals seemed about to call
                        upon the Govern ment to denounce the “‘entente cordiale,” which benefited
                        England and England only. Perbaps the most uncomfortably situated Frenchmen
                        were the aediles of Paris. It is averred, by M. Lambert's friends, that they
                        all but refused to go to London to empty numerous magnums and enlivened by
                        the communicative warmth of the banquet to shed tears on the Lord Mayor's
                        shirt tront.</p>
                    <p>Why did the ex-Director of the Law School, whose amour-propre was almost
                        excessive, consent for months to be the Adviser's tool ! His case is a
                        matter, not for the alienists as some declare, but for the onomatologists to
                        quote in support of theirtheories. Who are the onomatologists | Persons who
                        assert, with the confidence of the devotees of palmistry, that they can read
                        a man's character, virtues, vices and all, in his Christian name or in one
                        of his Christian names, ‘Paul,’ for example, any Paul you please, will be
                        like the Apostle, energetic, quick tempered, a trifle hasty, and given to
                        sudden changes of ideas, ‘conversions’ shall we say. Mr. Edonard Pan!
                        Lambert cer tainly inspires us with some confidence in the ingenious
                        hypothesis of M. de Rochetal. It certainly explains the ‘volte face,’ the
                        contri bation to the leading journal of that ‘anti European’ movement which
                        once caused Mr. Lambert such pain. As to the nature of Mr Lambeft's
                        action—well —we can only emend Mme. Roland's dying apostrophe to Liberty and
                        exclaim ‘Patriotism, what stupidities are committed in thy name.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile the Director General of the Reli gious and Patriotic Monopoly has
                        been swift to seize the chance offered by Mr. Lambert's misfortunes and
                        aparring on Rosinante, rides full tilt not at the windmills which felled his
                        illustrious predecessor but at Mr. Dunlop and perfidious Albion</p>
                    <p>Really the Pasha is rather an ungrateful young man—seeing that it is to the
                        British Occupation that he owes his magnificent and enviable situation of
                        exploiter of the Egyptian public which he fills with a rare competence. It
                        is thanks tothe British Ocenpation too that he may one day become Khedive of
                        Egypt or at least Resident of the Bahr el Ghazal</p>
                    <p>His press campaign violent as it is, is not enough, for a flourish of
                        trampets in the three Standards anohnees a “Great Speech” at Alex andria. We
                        are hippy to be able to give some of its most striking passages in advance.

                        throne...... Perfi dious Albion end again “Patriotism Parliament” etc. The
                        Great Karamel, musician in his inmost soul, has based his oratorical stile
                        on the perambulant organ. At all events we may be sure that the Zizinia
                        theatre will be full on Oct. 22, and that the imperial guard, recruited from
                        the Sharia el Dawaween will applaud the delivery of every phrase of a
                        carefully dictated and polished harangue, and will bear the hero in triamph
                        on their shoulders at its close. Had we any influence with the bowab of the
                        Palace of Don Quixote II, we should arge him to remind his master that the
                        claqne deserve something for their pains, for is not this Ramadan! Perhaps
                        they have received their reward. Do not the friends of “oor Director”
                        whisper that he in » moment of expansion told an intimate friend under the
                        seal of secrecy that the French are the friends of every oppressed race and
                        showed their generosity by a little present of 30,000 francs The friend
                        whispered and the public believed and marvelled—why | That is the question
                        but if the tale be true we are sorry for M. Cailloux who with the budget
                        nicely balanced sees his colleagne at the Quay d'Orsay handing over soms
                        that might have relieved some of the victims of the floods of the Midi. But
                        perhaps the Pasha’s friends are as imaginative as is his bodyguard of
                        gladiatorial journalists and vebe- ment law students. It is more probable
                        certainly</p>

                        given abundant proofs of honesty and courgae. His romantic descriptions of
                        Mr. Dunlop's conspi- racies are accepted without hestitation really, and if
                        the ex-Director of the Law School had des- cribed the assassination of
                        recalcitraunt students by Mr. Dunlop's orders in the groves of the Esbekieh
                        garden, we believe that our excellent confrére the “Egyptian Standard” would
                        have called upon the public to dig up the flower beds and look under the
                        band-stand. And the worst of it all is that these 'advocates of educa- tion’
                        are doing Egypt all the harm in the world by attackingMr. Dunlop's personal
                        character and by accepting M. Lambert's romances as if either had any
                        bearing on the real question that is before the public "How can education be
                        advanced in Egypt?" What Egypt requires is intelligence character. The
                        country is not likely to obtain these blessing if its most intelligent sons
                        spend their time in discussing the Advisor's mysterious villaninies, deride
                        critics who seek to infuse a little common sense into their enthusiasm and
                        devite themselves to personalities rather than constructive cri- ticism.
                        Many of us Europeans are of opinion that educational progress in Egypt has
                        not kept pace with the material develop: ment of the country but when we aré
                        told that Europeans can know nothing of the real needs of the people and
                        that Egyp- tians must beallowed te work out theirown salva- tion, we reply
                        ‘la parole est à vous Messieurs’ and wait expectantly for edncational
                        paténts from various newspaper offices, for practical suggestions and a
                        constructive programme. What is the result—instead of giving us hints as to
                        the improvement of the secondary school course “Al Lewa” with vast
                        complacency cites the names of several local geniuses who once upon a time
                        taught algebra or political economy through the medium of Arabic, instead of
                        telling us what the Khedivial Law School must do to be saved : so to speak,
                        the “Egyptian Standard” triumphantly informs us that Mr. Dunlop has a
                        dreadful past, was a missionary and played upon the organ. Happily our
                        contemporary for once in a way forgot the obvious and spared us the parallel
                        of Nero fiddling while Rome burned and a painful picture of Mr. Dunlop
                        pulling out a fresh stop as each Egyptian applicant was cast from the doors
                        by his unwilling accomplice, Otherwise there is nothing for which we need be
                        thankful ; personalities continue to descend like manna. Even the poets have
                        been infected by the prevailing mania. Hafiz Ibrahim must now be playing at
                        ‘boyaghi’, and after blacken- ing Lord Cromer's charcter and that of Mr.
                        Dunlop puts a dash of blacking on Sir Eldon Gorst’s boots.</p>
                    <p>M. Lambert might have at least given some clearer indications of what, in his
                        opinion, the Law School required.</p>
                    <p> But all he has to say on the subject amounts to this, that French is doomed
                        as a go- vernmental language in Egypt and that the French School of Law has
                        to be developed. Of the new situation created by the immense increase of the
                        English side at the expense of the French in the secondary schools be has
                        nothing to say worth onr attention. He has failed to point out the real
                        difficulty —that the budding lawyers, members of the Parquet arrive at the
                        Law School innocent of French with the result that they must learn a French
                        legal system through the medium of English, a language practically never
                        heard in the Mixed and useless in the Native Tribunals. We venture to
                        suggest that the only real escape from the impasse is to increase the Arabic
                        speaking staff, retaining such European professors as are masters of any
                        particular branch of law and can lec ture in English or French but giving
                        every pupil a chance of obtaining a good legal grounding in his
                        mother-tongue. Once this system is in force it matters little whether the
                        director of the Law School is English or French, or whether Mr. Dunlop was
                        really a missionary or not. As for the question of discipline etc, we agree
                        that it was too rigid, and we cannot help thinking that if Mr. Dunlop had
                        left the Law School a little more independent matters would have gone
                        better. Meanwhile the chief centre of higher education in Egypt seems
                        destined to become the focus of the anti-European ideas which Mr. Lambert
                        says that he deplores, and the public reads a new penny dreadful “Dunlop the
                        Destroyer — or the Conrageous Professor and His Tyrant Chief.”

                        will be glad to avail themselves of these sailings. The rates Messrs. Thos.

                    <p>On Saturday the 5th inst. at St. Paul's Church, Wimbledon Park, the marriage
                        took place of Captain Charles Massie Blomfield, elder son of Rear-Admiral
                        Sir Massie and Lady Blomfield of Alexandria, Egypt, and Miss Hirell
                        Clarence, elder daughter of Mrs. Clarence of Castle Towers, Wimbledon

                        Charles Brooke, godfather of the bridegroom.</p>
                    <p>The bride, who was given away be her uncle, Mr. Porter Rhodes, was a gown of
                        soft white satin, the corsage exquisitely embriodered in white and palest
                        shade of pink. Her tulle viel over a wreath of organge blossoms was
                        arranaged so taht it fell softly over the trained skirt. Her only ornament
                        was a necklace of pearls.</p>

                        pattern, finely embriodered with gold thread. In their dark green satin hats
                        hung a rich cavalier plume. The shoes were of dark Morocco, and the bouquets
                        of roses of a deep shade of yellow were tied with green ribbon. The
                        bridegroom's gifts to them were gold and white enamel bracelets with
                        amethysts. Mr. Hugh Blomfield, brother of the bridegroom, acted as best

                            granting the request. Promotio, by the way, is granted to the favoured

                    <head> Lady's Experience.</head>
                    <p>A lady passenger from the Orient Mail liner “Oroys’, desirous otseeng a
                        little of our town, came ashore while her ship was coaling. Im- mediately
                        she landed she was besieged by the usnal crowd of arabs, who act as official
                        guides. The lady, who was quite alone and an absolate stranger to the ways
                        of the arabs, thought it best to take one of the guides, in order to pacify
                        the remainder. It appears that the guide showed the lady something of the
                        town and afterwards took her to post-card shop. where she was shown some
                        indecent photographs and offered refreshments which proved to con tain a
                        sleeping draught, and while the poor woman was under its spell the arabs
                        indecently assulted her. The lady on recovering her senses, inmmeadiately
                        requested to be taken back to the ship, but when opposite the Savoy Hotel, a
                        police officer was met and the lady related her trouble to him. The guide
                        was immediately arrested and the lady escorted on board. The guide after
                        spending a few hours at the Ca racol was released and I understand that he
                        is still an official guide with a good character If these facts are true,
                        and I am assured they are, the police are rather inclinded to be slack, and
                        the case should be enquired into.</p>

                        steamer “Birma.” The Governor with several notables from Cairo went on board
                        to welcome the King. After the shore party had left the ship nobody was
                        alloved on board, and none of the royal suite came ashore. This morsing the

                    <head>DJELALLEDDIN PASHA’S LETTER.</head>
                    <p>The following is the paragraph in the “Times” referred to in our special
                        service telegram of the 15th inst :—</p>
                    <p>As was to be expected, the letter of Ahmed Djelaleddin, published in “The
                        Times” ten days ago, has caused a considerable fluttering’ of the dovecotes
                        at Yildiz. According to report, the Palace has sent a telegram to the
                        Khedive to the effect that his Majesty hes learned with surprise and
                        indignation of the extraordinary letter which Ahmed Djelaleddin has had the
                        “audacity” to address to “The Times,” and which that newspaper has had the
                        “impudence” to publish ; that Admed, after being educated at the Imperial
                        Palace and loaded with favours by the Sultan, who bad regarded him as one of
                        his most faithful servants, had had the shadow of Imperial protection
                        withont giving any reason, and had refused to return in spite of repeated
                        offers of forgiveness and reinstate ment to his former dignities ; and that
                        the Sultan, in consequence of the Pasha’s latest act of insubordination,
                        “orders” the Khedive to sammon Ahmed and impress upon him the enormity of
                        his conduct and to insist on his immediate return to Constantinople.</p>
                    <p>It is possible that the ex-favourite's letter produced more effect at the
                        Palace than it otherwise might have done on account of its publication
                        coinciding with the receipt of news from Erzerum which tends to confirm the
                        prediction of an approaching revolt against the Hamidian system. It may be
                        remembered that some 1X months ago the Musulman population of that city
                        refused to pay the newly-imposed tax on domesti¢ animals and expelled the
                        Vali who endeavoured to collect it. The Government on that occasion gave way
                        completely, sent another Vali, and eventually abolished the tax, which other
                        districts as well as Erzerum refused to pay. It now appears that the new
                        Vali recent ly received instructions to take action against the local Mufti,
                        who was suspected of being the leader of the movement, and who at any rate
                        had encouraged the resistance of the people by declaring the tax to be
                        contrary to the sacred law ; and that the population, hearing of these
                        instrnctions, gave the Vali notice to quit. How ever this may be, it was
                        officially announced a few days ago that he had resigned and would be
                        sncceeded by the Vali of Angora, whose place he wonld take. It is rumoured
                        that the Angora Vali refused to go to Erzerum unless he were given a free
                        hand to deal with the situation as he thought fit and were promised
                        protection against the inteference of Zekki Pasha, commander ot the
                        north-eastern army corps, who has made himselt practically dicta tor in that
                        part of the country. Whether for this or for some other reason, the
                        arrangement has fallen through. The Vali of Angora remains at his post, and,
                        according to an official an nouncement this morning, a former Vali of
                        Baghdad, a man of no great reputation, will go to Erzerum</p>
                    <p>In some it is stated that the Government is resolved to use force in erder to
                        suppress this spirit: of insubordination, which shows signs of spreading and
                        which might become exceedingly dangerous. As the troops at Erzernm have
                        refused to act against the people, with whose grievances they sympathize,
                        the Government is sending several battalions trom Trebizond and other places
                        in. order to cow the people. In view of the mutinous spirit which the troops
                        are now showing in every part of the Empire, it is ditheult to believe that
                        the Government will be so ill advised as to attempt to take any strong
                        action of this kind, which could so easily bring about grave
                        complications.</p>

                    <head>PHAROAH OR QUEEN?</head>
                    <p>ANATOMIST AND ARCHEOLOGIST</p>
                    <p>A masterly and exhaustive letter appears in the "Times" of the 15th inst.
                        from the pen of Dr. G. Elliot Smith in answer to Professor Sayce, who, in a
                        recent letter to the same paper, questioned the accuracy of the famous
                        anatomist's opinion as to the sex and age of the skeleton supposed to be the
                        remains of Queen Teie. Dr. Elliot Smith, it will be re- membered, after a
                        careful examination of the bones, expressed his opinion that it was the
                        skelton of a powerfully built man of about twenty-five years of age. Though
                        too lengthy to reproduce in extenso, we give the following extracts from Dr.
                        Elliot Smith's most intrest ing letter, which is well worthy of careful
                        persual :--</p>
                    <p>When the chamber was opened a coffin was found bearing an inscription, which
                        proved, according to Professor Sayce's letter, that it was Queen Teie's
                        mummy-case. Nevertheless, Mr. Davis called in two medical men, one of them
                        “a prominent American obstetrician,” to determine the sex of the skeleton in
                        the coffin and both “instantly agreed” that it was a woman’s—a result which
                        could hardly have been a surprise, if the on the mum- my-case so defintely
                        declared it to be a Queen's coffin. Not content with this instant
                        recognition of the sexual characters of the plevis, the “prominent American
                        obste trician” “made a most thorough examina- tion, and explained [to Mr.
                        Davis and his friends] why it was a woman's pelvis, and what the difference
                        is between the pelvis of a man and woman. He practically stated that the
                        greater breadth of the (pubic) arch gives one of the most easily appreciable
                        points of contrast between the male and female pelvis ; the [pubic] arch in
                        the female forms an angle of from 90deg. to: 100deg., while in the male it
                        averages from TOdeg. to T5deg.” This narrative cannot be considered com
                        until I add that the angle of the pubic arch in the pelvis under
                        consideration is actually 67deg.</p>
                    <p>These figures, which have been quoted as a test, are, however, by no means an
                        infallible criterion of sex, and they are certainly not the kind of evidence
                        on which an anatomist would place chief reliance in coming to a decision on
                        such a question. The bones are those of a man of about 25 years of age,
                        perhaps a year or two more or less ; but certainly of a man well under 30
                        years of age. But, at the very lowest esti mate, Queen Teie must have been
                        well over 40 years, and probably more than 50, at the time of her death.</p>
                    <p>The complete development of all the bones actually contamed in the arms and
                        legs shows this individual to be more than 20, and probably, more than 28
                        years of age. The fusion of all the epiphyses of the shoulder blades
                        indicates a probable age of at least 25 years. But the incomplete anion of
                        the epiphyses of the collar bone, the segments of the spine and the hip
                        bones indicates the improbability of the individual being much more than 25
                        years of age. The evidence afforded by the teeth confirms this estimate.</p>
                    <p>Professor Sayce says, ‘Your Correspondent has gone wrong in one important
                        particular ; the inscription on the mammy-case does not state that it
                        belonged to the King Akh-en-Aten, hut that it had been given by the King to
                        his mother Teie.” Mr. H.R. Hall, writing to one ot your contemporaries three
                        days before the appearance of Professor Sayce's letter, gives quite another
                        explanation of the reason for calling the coffin Teie’s. He says
                        “Khuenaten’s {Akh-en-Athen’s] name existed on the coffin, it is true, but
                        the coffin is definitely that of a woman.” There is no mention of Teie’s
                        name being on the coffin. No one should be able to give a more authoritative
                        account of the true state of affairs than Mr. AE. Weigall, who supervised
                        the opening of the tomb on behalf of the Egyptian Government Service des
                        Antiquités. When I told Mr. Weigall that the skeleton which he had sent me
                        from the tomb supposed to be Teie'’s had proved to be a young man’s, he
                        wrote:—“I am not surprised at what you say, for the coffin had apon it only
                        the name of Akhnaton [Akh-en-Aten], Queen Thiy's [Teie's) son, and not her
                        name.”</p>
                    <p>The fact that part of Teie’s funeral furniture was found in the tomb suggests
                        that some confasion may possibly have occurred when the Royal mummies were
                        being transferred from the tombs at El Amarna to Thebes. The only Royal
                        personages likely to have been buried at the former place are Quen Teie,
                        King Akb-en-Aten, the latter's second daughter (a mere child), and the King
                        Ra-smenkh-ka, the successor of Akh-en-Aten and the hasband of his eldest
                        daughter. If any confusion occured in transferring these mummies to Thebes
                        and some mummy other than that of Akk-en-Aten was placed by mistake in the
                        coffin, Ra- smenkh-ka seems to be the only man whose mummy could by any
                        reasonable chance have been substituted. This is a possibility suggested by
                        Mr. N. de G. Davies, whose intimate knowledge of the El Amarna records lends
                        special anthority to his opinion.</p>
                    <p>It may, perhaps, be asked—Why refuse to admit that the young man found in
                        Akh-en- Aten’s coffin is Akh-en-Aten himself? The objection has been raised
                        that it is impossibl to crowd the events of his life into 26 years. A
                        sealing on a wine-jar refers to the 17th year of his reign. If he were only
                        26 years of age at his death, this would mean that he came to the throne at
                        nine years of age. He is known to have been a mere boy when he succeeded
                        Amenhotep III., and during the first six years of his reign—as long, in
                        fact, as he called himself Amenhotep IV.—he was ted in pictares with a
                        boyish face, exhibiting none of those prominent features of</p>

                    <p>nose and chin which are so charcteristic of his portraits after he adopted
                        the Aten-worship. If we accept Professor Petrie’s hypothesis that he was
                        co-regent with his father for six-years, none of teh known events of his
                        history would clash with the supposition that he came to the throne at nine
                        years of age and succeeded his father at 15, except the fact that, according
                        to Mr. N. de G. Davies, his third daughter was born in the eighth year of
                        his reign. He is known to have been married at about the time of his
                        father's death (ie, on this hypothesis when he was about 15 years old), and
                        it is hardly likely, although not impossible, that he would have been the
                        father of three daughters less than three years afterwards. I do not put
                        this forward as a probability, but merely as a suggestion that the known
                        facts are not so absolutely irreconcilable as is generally sup- posed. A
                        very slight addition (even one or two years) tothe age attributed to the
                        skeleton would enable the events of Akhen-Aten’s life to be fitted into the
                        time limit ; and in this con néxion it mast be recalled, as I have explained
                        at length above, that the estimate of age is not an absolutely certain
                        determination to a year or tworin any one individnal case.</p>
                    <p>I have gone into this matter in some detail (and, I fear, have risked the
                        accusation of encroaching on the province of the archwologist) 80 as to make
                        perfectly-plain exactly how much weight can be attached t0the anatomical
                        evi- dence, which does not put an absolate veto on certain possibilities
                        that may be suggested by the historian.</p>
                    <p>Akh-en-Aten is known to have been distin- guished by number of very
                        pronounced anatomical peculiatities, which were repeatedly represented, no
                        doubt in an exaggerated form, by the artists of his reign. The elongated
                        head, the receding forehead, the coarse nose, oblique eyes, full lips, and
                        elongated chin, the slender neck and the effeminate figure are all pecaliar
                        ly, distinétive of his portenits. And for purposes of compatison we have a
                        series of his paternal ancestors and his maternal grandparents, the study of
                        whose mummies ought to throw some light on the identity of the mummy we are
                        at present concerned with.</p>
                    <p>Although I have not been able to detect in the skeleton in question any very
                        pronounced resemblance to the pictares of Akh-en-Aten, yet when clothed with
                        flesh it would have present ed some very exceptional features which, with
                        &amp; comparatively slight exaggeration, might easily be brought into
                        contormity with the Akh-en-Aten peculiarities.</p>
                    <p>My colleague, Professor Ferguson, agrees with me in regarding this man as
                        having been the subject of chronic hydrocephalus. The enlarged craniam has
                        become flattened and otherwise distorted, so that in profile it looks onduly
                        long and the forehead rather low The nose is more prominent than that of
                        Amenhotep III. and was somewhat deflect- ed to the right side. The jaws (and
                        probably the lips also) were rather promi- nent. There is a long and
                        somewhat pendant chin, although this peculiarity is not nearly so pronounced
                        as the long pointed form repre- sented in the contemporary pictures of
                        Akh-en Aten ; it presents a mach closer resemblance to the interesting
                        object foand by Professor Petrie and described by him as the death-mask of
                        this King.</p>
                    <p>The skeleton is mach more slenderly built and more effeminate than that of
                        Amenhotep I[L., which I unwrapped two years ago; and the pelvis is so roomy
                        as to have deceived Mr Davis's two experts in regard to the sex.</p>
                    <p>In addition to the great enlargement of the brain-case resulting from early
                        hydrocephalus there are irregular thickenings on the inner walls of the
                        cranium, such as all pathologists who have performed autopsies on cases of
                        epilepsy and other chronic brain diseases are perfectly familiar with. If
                        the skeleton should should prove to be Akh-en-Aten’s, this sugges tion of
                        his mental state will throw some light on many events in his brilliant and
                        reckless career, the indulgence of his literary and artistic genius at the
                        expense of the disintegra. tion of his Empire. But, whoever the mummy may
                        have been, the disciples of Lombroso can claim that his abnormally big,
                        perhaps epileptic, brain endowed him with one of the qualifica tions
                        regarded by them as essential in the founder of a new religion.</p>

                    <p>PAYMENT AGAINST DELIVERY</p>
                    <p>Our Landon Correspondent writes ; —With tegard to the question of relieving
                        the monetary: in Egypt during the months of Ogtober, November, and December,
                        when the cotton crop is marketed, there is a strong opinion amongst leading
                        financial people here that if only the cotton magnates in Alex andria would
                        ste their faces against paying cash for the delivery of the cotton in the
                        provinces and on the farms, and insisted upon the cotton being sent dows to
                        Alexandria against payment there, the money postition would be considerably
                        relieved, as this would at all events, to some extent prevent the gold being
                        retained and possibly boried, in the provinces, If the bulk of the cotton
                        payments were made against the delivery of the cotton in Alexandria, this
                        would result in much of the gold being returned to the banks in the ordinary
                        course of business, and it would thus consequently remain in circulation. I
                        give this expression of opinion in the hope that it may receive the
                        attention of the large cotton houses in Alexandria. It is possible that the
                        Government might object to this being done, inasmach as it might cause some
                        delay in the payment of taxes, which are so freely liquidat- ed at this time
                        of the year, but surely some arrangement could be made by which the
                        Government would be willing to work in co- operation with the large cotton
                        buyers.</p>
