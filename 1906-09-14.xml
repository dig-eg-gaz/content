                    <p>Icilma Fluor Cream is the only cream that contains no grease nor oil.
                        Deliciously scented it cleanses the pores of the skin as nothing else can
                        do, makes it pearly white, gives life to the tissues, elasticity to the
                        muscles, and a deliciously cool feeling to the skin.</p>
                    <p>Its unique properties are due to Icilma Natural Water so that it may well be
                        called <hi>Nature's Skin Food </hi> and the skin requires nothing else to
                        give it the necessary vitality, to preserve it from sunburn, heat, cold or
                        the effects of hard water, to prevent and cure the minor irritations due to
                        overheated blood, and to preserve the youthful fresh look to which hot
                        climates are so fatal.</p>

                        itself in one direction to recover for Germany (not intellectually only but
                        politically) the peoples of Teutonio stock who are not Germane (though they
                        speak the German tongue the Swiss and Austrians, and the Low German peoples,
                        the Dutch, Belgians (and even the Boers) while in another direction it
                        spreads to the Colonies of Germans on German soil, and even to the small
                        German settlements in towns and countries which are not German.
                        Pan-Germanism has an organisation not confined to one body bot ramifying
                        through hundreds of associations, political, economic, and even religions.
                        They are not called Pan-Germanic societies, nor are they openly affiliated
                        to the League which bears that name, bat-they are informed with the
                        Pan-German spirit, helped with Pan- German foods, and (with different
                        degrees of zeal) press for the seemed. Pan Germanism is not a political
                        party in Germany, but a cult or ideal which can be adopted by any party. In
                        Austria, however, the Pan-Germans actually go to the polls and sit in
                        Parliament as such. They are at present the only 'Pans' of any kind to do
                        so. Pan-Slavism, in its broadest sense, as implying a league or union of the
                        Slav peoples, is little more than an impious aspiration. The Czechs, who are
                        the most advanced of all the Slav races, would always want to lead, and this
                        privilege would never be accorded by any of the others. The elimination of
                        Russia (for the time being at all events) precludes the idea of a Pan Slav
                        union in the Near East under her august patronage and protection. Such as it
                        is, however, Pan Slavism altogether overshadows the little Pan-Hellenic
                        propaganda which is Greece's latest contribution to the happiness of the
                        world. Pan-Buddhism has a powerful propaganda to day in China, which aims at
                        rousing the national and racial pride of the Orientals and inducing them to
                        develop on their own lines and not on Western ones. The singular feature of
                        Pan-Islam is that, as a name, an idea, a 'motif to be interpreted by each
                        man after his kind, it is at present uniting a very considerable proportion
                        of the world's population, and, unlikely other 'Pan,' it has no limitation,
                        ethnographic, geographic, or national." </p>

                    <head>MUSTAPHA PASHA KAMEL<lb/>THE PROPOSED BANQUET.</head>
                    <p>The native press, having exhausted itself in discussing the many and various
                        problems connected with the trestment of Helbawi Bey by Prince Mohamed Aly
                        Pash, and the alleged secret interview of Abon Shadi Bey/ with Mr. Findlay,
                        has now found a fresh source of inspiration in the approaching banquet,
                        which is to be given in honour of Mustapha Pasha Kamel's return to his
                        native land. We, however, deeply regret to notice that many of the leading
                        journalistic laminaries of the nationalist newspaper world appear to be
                        disposed to skalk in their tents in view of the splendid ovation that is to
                        be given to the great protagonist of Egyptian nationalism. The lesser lights
                        of the vernacular Anglophobe press naturally feel rather out of it, for "Al
                        Minbar" and its brethren will suffer an eclipse when the editor of "Al Lewa"
                        returns in all his glory.</p>
                    <p>"Mier" is of opinion that the banquet is premature. and that it should be
                        postponed until the English have withdrawn from Egypt and the country has
                        obtained complete independence!</p>
                    <p>A journalist writes to "Al Watan" to protest against the proposed banquet. He
                        states that the Pasha does not deserve such an honour, as he has not
                        rendered any services to the country, but is merely working for his own
                        ends.The writer goes on to state that he has only distinguished himself by
                        arousing bitterness between Moslem and Christian. and that it sach aban-
                        quet be given, it will lead to a very bad impression in England.</p>
                    <p>The same paper publishes a telegram from Tantah to the effect that a large
                        number of native notables there have decided to oppose the proposed scheme
                        for honouring the Pasha.</p>
                    <p>An amusing example of nationalist fervour is seen in the proposal of one of
                        the supporters of the Pasha that the "pièce de resistance" at the
                        forthcoming banquet should be an Egyptian camel in honour of that
                        serviceable creature's namesake. Whether one or more of these quadrupeds is
                        to be cooked for the occasion we do not know, bat surely one would not be
                        enough to go round among the many supporters of Kamel, who will flock to the
                        banquet. The symbolic signification involved in such a dish will probably
                        only be divulged to the initiates, bat, on the other hand, the idea may have
                        been merely suggested by the simple coincidence of the names. No doubt this
                        problem will be disoussed ad naustam in the columns of our con: temporaries,
                        for the bill of fare is already leading to oriticism.</p>
                    <p>The idea of a "national" repast pure and simple has not met with universal
                        approval, for it is recognised that if the banquet is solely confided to
                        Egyptian dishes and drinks, the mena will hardly be to the taste of the hero
                        of the evening, who has been accustomed in London to the gastronomic
                        delicacies of the Carlton Hotel. The idea of an essentially "nationalistic"
                        bill of fare is a good one, but it is somewhat difficult to realise.
                        Possibly a compromise may be effected by varying the monotony with a few
                        Tarkish dishes. We might venture to suggest a via media in the shape of a
                        Pan-Islamic faast, which could thus embrace a variety of dishes, Moorish,
                        Algerian, Tunisian, etc. Surely this would be the most. simple way out of
                        the difficulty.</p>

                    <p>It has been implied that a transit of 291 days between London and Hong Kong
                        by the Canadian route would, if maintained, establish a permanent
                        acceleration of seven days as compared with the transit via the Suez Canal.
                        So far back as 1898 the scheduled transit for the English mail to Hong Kong
                        from London, via Suez, was 18 days-one day less than the promised westerly
                        transit-while delivery by the Suez route has in practice invariably been
                        made in advance of schedule time. Moreover, while the present scheduled
                        transit for the Suez route is 27 days, the actual carriage of the mail
                        between London and Hong-Kong is made in less than 26 days-three to four days
                        better, it is claimed, than the new "record" claimed for the Canadian
                        route.</p>
                    <p>It will be remembered that the promoters of the Baghdad Railway have never
                        ceased their efforts to interest French finance in that enterprise, and that
                        financial influences in France have occasionally resisted the opposi tion
                        made to the scheme on political grounds. These facts, the "Times" Paris
                        correspondent says, give special interest to the attention attracted in
                        financial circles in Paris by the discussion of the question by the Press of
                        Calcutta and Bombay, which contends that the Baghdad Railway will never be a
                        very brilliant affair from a business standpoint and can never seriously

                    <p>A Bombay Government resolution, reviewing the results of the cultivation of
                        Egyptian cotton in Sind during 1905, remarks that they were not so promising
                        as originally anticipated, owing partly to the unfavourable character of the
                        season, but perhaps more largely to the very partial adoption only by the
                        Sindhi zamindars of the Egyptian methods of cultivation, which are far more
                        expensive and laborious than the indigenous methods to which they are
                        accustomed. Owing to the pecaliar circumstances of the province it is feared
                        that considerable time will elapse before the imperfect indigenous methods
                        are supplanted by the Egyptian. Patience and persuasion are therefore
                        commended to the authorities.</p>
                    <p>There was apparently some difficulty in disposing of last year's Indian
                        "Egyptian" crop in India, only one firm purchasing it in any large quantity
                        at fair prices; and these were lower than the prices obtained for the sample
                        bales sent home by the authorities to Liverpool. The Government trust that,
                        with the assurance obtained from Liverpool of the high quality of the cotton
                        and the larger quantity to be grown this year, better prices will be secured
                        and more bayers will come forward.</p>

                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE." Dear Sir,- In your issue of the
                            27th August, you were good enough to publish my letter to you on the
                            subject of the Egyptian Land and General Trust. In that letter I told
                            the shareholders that there was no time to lose. I had not, however, an
                            idea that I was cffering this caution with so much reason as now
                            appears. By the time this reaches you any shareholders now in Egypt will
                            be in possession of a notice dated London, 4th September, to the effect
                            that a general meeting will be held here on the 14th idem. From the
                            circumstances of the case this will probably resolve itself into another
                            unimportant London gathering to deal with important issues. At this
                            meeting we are to be told how "the Board are now dealing with offers
                            which appear to be favourable for extendng the operations of the
                            company"; of the arrangements under which "Mr. Mack is to take charge of
                            the business of the company in Egypt," and presumably of the
                            disappearance of Mr. Lonsdorfer from the list of directors. Many of us
                            will, I am sure, be anxious to hear: (a) How money, is to be found tor
                            extending operations? (b) What opportunities now exist comparable with
                            those which have been the making of the "Estates," "Delta Lands," and
                            others? (c) Why we are once more deprived of valuable local
                            experience?</p>

                        <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE". Dear Sir,-In reply to the
                            interesting letter of one of your correspondents in connection with the
                            picture which appeared in "The Sphere" of June 16th last, of British
                            soldiers surrounding the Sphinx, I beg to inform you that while it is
                            true that this interesting picture was published in "The Sphere," our
                            journal carefully guarded itself from the statement that the men
                            actually on the Sphinx belonged to the Lancashire Fasiliers. We merely
                            committed ourselves to the generalisation that British soldiers on
                            reaching Egypt were naturally interested in the Sphinx, and that the
                            Lancashires were specially so in view of their services in the campaign
                            of 1801.</p>
                        <p>Not for worlds would one hurt the feelings of such a gallant regiment as
                            the Royal Inniskilling Fasiliers, whose heroic deeds have found their
                            most eloquent champion in Lord Macaulay, and whose services in Egypt in
                            1801 are also immortalised in their colours.- I am, dear Sir, Yours
                            truly,</p>

                    <head>NILE FLOOD.</head>
                    <p>According to the "Sadan Time," the high Nile of this year has been
                        unprecedented ia the modern history of the Sudan. Before Mabdism, however,
                        higher Niles have been known. Sometimes, we are told, the waters of the Blue
                        Nile threatened to overflow Khartoom, that the draining of rain water by
                        natural methods was impracticable. An artificial stratagem had to be
                        resorted to. All rain water was drained into a large "birka" near the river
                        over a dyke by a steam lifting machine.</p>
                    <p>A native notable of experience informs us that a further rise of one metre
                        over the present levels is necessary before the "bogr" lands can be
                        naturally irrigated. He is confident of a farther heavy rainfall in this
                        month which will result in the realization of this occurrence.</p>
                    <p>A heavy rainfall occurred on Monday, the 3d instant accompanied by a severe
                        thunderstorm. The rain was typically tropical in its volume. The lightning
                        and thunder continued far into the night, the storm subsiding early on
                        Tuesday morning.</p>
                    <p>The rainfall amounted to 16 millimetres. On the 29th of August the Nile level
                        at Rosaires was 19.20. A rise of one metre and ninety centimetres occurred
                        on the 1st inst. when the level readings were 21.10. This sudden rise gives
                        reason for anxiety and we understand that the Government is taking the
                        necessary steps to protect Khartonm from its effect.</p>

                        compatriotes soient avec l'Allemagne contre la Russie si une latte s'en-
                        gsgesit entre ces deux pays?</p>
                    <p>Et si nous avons pris parti pour la France dans le conflit de Fachoda,
                        pourquoi s'étonner de nous voir avec la Turquie dans la question de Tabah?
                        Nous avons acutenu la cause tarque parce que nous vous jugé que le droit
                        était de son côté. Et puis il aurait fallu nous prendre pour des naïfs et
                        des ignorants pour nous faire croire que la politique anglaise, qui nous a
                        ravi le Soudan et les ports de la mer Rouge, défendait les droits de
                        l'Egypte à Tabah!</p>
                    <p>Dire que nous voulons voir les Tarca maitres de l'Egypte est ane absurdité.
                        Ce que nous voulons, c'est voir la question d'Egypte posée définitivement
                        devant l'Europe. Toutes les paissances ont des intérêts considérables en
                        Egypte. Son sort ne peut donc dépendre de nous seals, et après l'évacuation
                        de notre territoire par les troupes anglaises, la question n'aura qu'une
                        seule solution: le rétablissement des droits conférés à l'Egypte par le
                        traité de Londres de 1840 et par les firmans impériaux, en dotant le pays
                        d'ane Constitution libérale.</p>
                    <p>Depuis l'accord abglo-français, quelques journalistes français ont ora de
                        lear devoir de mener en Egypte une campagne favorable l'occupation anglaise.
                        D'autres, voulant sans doute servir leurs propres intérêts, ont accentué la
                        note et ont osé nier l'existence d'une patrie égyptienne. Cette attitude ne
                        nous a ni étonnés ni désolés, ayant déjà vu des hommes politiques, occupant
                        de hautes situations, faire de même. Plus nous avançons, plus nous comptons
                        sur nos propres forces.</p>
                    <p>Mais les attaques de cs journalistes ont fait le plus grand mal à la France
                        parmi la classe éclairée ainsi que parmi le peuple. S'ils voulaient
                        réellement servir leur pays, ces journalistes auraient dû comprendre que
                        l'élite de la nation égyptienne a été instruite en France ou par des
                        Français, qu'elle forme le premier factear da progrès et le seal intermé-
                        diaire possible entre les Européens et le people égyptien et que la France a
                        le droit d'être fière d'avoir ainsi contribué à réveiller l'Egypte et à lui
                        donner une conscience nationale.</p>
                    <p>Tout homme impartial reconnalt que ce n'est pas nous qui avons changé de
                        politique, mais bien ceux qui d'adversaires implacables de la diplomatie
                        anglaise sont devenus ses meilleurs amis et auxiliaires. Ce n'est pas nous
                        qui avons sacrifié notre amitié envers la France pour chercher d'autres
                        amis. C'est la France qui nous a abandonnés.</p>
                    <p>Il est donc bien compréhensible que nous nous sentions lésés par une
                        politique qui nous a fait tant de mal. Mais c'est une erreur de croire que
                        nous avons oublié le passé, l'histoire et tout ce que la France a fait en
                        Egypte. Nous savons distinguer entre la France poli tique et la France
                        scientifique et littéraire.</p>
                    <p>On nous dit que nous attaquons la France dans nos écrits. Or, il faut nous
                        lire pour nous comprendre. Nous critiquons tout ce qui nous paralt
                        critiquable. Entre la critique et l'attaque il y a une bien grande
                        différence. Nous essayors d'éclairer les puissances européennes sur les
                        vraies souffrances de leurs sujets, et nous sommes convaincus de faire une
                        ceuvre atile et humanitaire.</p>
                    <p>Voulant attirer l'attention de la France sur leur état, des Tunisiens et des
                        Algériens adressent parfois des lettres aux journaux masulmans d'Egypte.
                        Est-ce un crime?</p>
                    <p>Je ne crois pas qu'il y ait en France an seul homme d'Etat qui soit partisan
                        de la politique d'étouffement et d'arbitraire. Que la France écoute ses
                        sujets musulmans, qu'elle fasse ce qu'elle peut pour lear relèvement-at elle
                        peat tont-et tous les musulmans da globe lui seront reconnaissants! Il est,
                        en somme, humain de demander, d'exiger même qu'ayant aboli l'esclavage des
                        hommes, l'Europe, et la France avant tout autre pays, travaillent à abolir
                        l'esclavage des nations.</p>
                    <p>Cenx qui nous reprochent de critiquer qualquefois la politique française
                        oublient tout le bien que nous avons dit, à maintes reprises, des hommes et
                        des wavres qui honorent la France. M. Jonnart, le gouverneur de l'Algérie,
                        n'a-t-il pas été loué par la presse musulmane d'Egypte, et par le Lewa le
                        premier, quand on nous asssuré qu'il était juste et bien intentionné envers
                        les musulmans Et puis peut-on sérieasement nous reprocher d'aser de notre
                        droit de critique et peat on considérer comme un péché notre désir de voir
                        les musulmans et tous ceux qui souffrent plus beareax ou moins malheureux
                        ?</p>
