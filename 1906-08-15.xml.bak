                    <head>THE SWORD OF OTHMAN</head>
                    <p>The irony of fate has made the weal or
                    woe of an Empire dependent on the knife of
                    a surgeon. Upon the success of Dr, Bergmann
                    has hung, like the Sword of Damocles, the
                    future of Turkey. </p>
                    
                    <p>The present is a critical time not only for
                    that land of two continents, but for Europe as
                    well, and this owing to the complex and shifting 
                    base of international relations in the Near
                    East. With Russia in a foment of insurrection,
                    the Balkan States squabbling over Macedonia
                    the revival of the Cretan agitation; in Asia,
                    the troubles in Persia, wars and rumours of
                    wars throughout Arabia, to say nothing of the
                    apparent deadlock in the Sinai boundary negotiations,
                    and finally, the Tripoli Question—these
                    and many other phases of Eastern politics, ugly
                    enough as as they are, would have become even
                    more so in the eyes of interested spectators
                    had that surgical operation terminated
                    fatally. In the interests of all that tends to
                    peace, it is earnestly to be prayed that the
                    Sultan may long be spared to preside over
                    the affairs of Eastern Europe.</p>
                    
                    <p>"Padishahimir tchok yaeha ' ("Long Life To
                    our Sultan”) is an exclamation in which not
                    only loyal Turks but European statesmen may
                    very well join. For all the ill-feeling and
                    opposition with which his policy encounters,
                    there is no gainsaying the fact that the unique
                    statecraft and masterly intelligence of His
                    Imperial Majesty would in the event of his
                    untimely demise-which Allah forbade—create
                    a void that it would be hard to fill. Whatever
                    may be said to the contrary by pro Armenians
                    and renegade Young Turks, for whose fatuous
                    vapourings abroad the Turkish vocabulary has
                    provided an excellent epithet, that of bosh
                    boghazlar (’empty mouths'),despite the disciples
                    of the (Gladstonian superstition, it is an axiom
                    of European politics which is undeniable that
                    the bolstering up of Turkey,and the firm establishment 
                    of the Sultan at Constantinople, is a
                    vital necessity, as essential to the European
                    status quo, as is the Sun Canal to our world-
                    position. The recent prospect, happily we hope
                    dissipated, of a succession to the Throne of
                    the Caliphate, has been one therefore of European
                    concern, not because of the fear of a
                    national upheaval -for Turkey has seen strange
                    things without the mass of her conservative
                    population being in any way disturbed-but
                    for the peace of Europe. During the recent
                    crisis, it was natural that the question of who
                    should succeed Abdul Hamid should arise.
                    According to the old law of succession established
                    by Othman. The eldest brother of the
                    reigning family succeeds. Salim I., the third
                    son of Bayasid II., who usurped the Throne
                    and Caliphate in 1520, or 926 of the Hedjira,
                    parted with this tradition, by naming his
                    eldest son as his successor , and this
                    order of direct lineal descent was sanctioned
                    and sealed by the innocent blood of lawful 
                    heirs whose existence was dangerous to
                    this principle, and whose earthly remains
                    repots in a shrine which steads within the
                    shadow of St. Sophia in Stamboul. This went
                    until the death in 1617 of Ahmed I. when
                    possibly to spare the live, of four brothers
                    the Council of Ministers and the Ulema
                    proclaimed Mustapha 1, his brother, who
                    owed his life and throne to an affected
                    actual imbecility. Mustapha I. died within the
                    year of his accession, and Osman II , the eldest
                    son of Ahmed I., was girded with the Sword
                    of Ottman in 1618, since when the institution 
                    of Selim I. has prevailed Custom became
                    law, hat it mast also he remembered that
                    the bam of the Caliphate permit 
                        the exercise of a prerogative whereby the
                        Padishah may choose a successor out of his
                        own family, subject however to the approval
                        of the nation, -a condition which has never
                        been observed. According to this order of
                        succession, then, it it Knhad Bflondi, the
                        Sultan's invalid brother, who should succeed;
                        but in view of his physical incapacity, the
                        Throne would go to Youssouf Izzodin, son of
                        Abdul Asia.</p>
                        
                        <p>This was an arrangement suggested last
                        year with a view of appeasing European curiosity 
                        Symptoms point to Prince Burhaneddin.
                        the Sultan's favourite son, as his successor
                        designate, and it was not so long ago that
                        Hikmet Pasha, one of the Palace functionaries,
                        was sent to gather the opinion of the Courts
                        of Europe regarding such an arrangement.</p>

           <p> Building Lands of Egypt.
            It is rumoured that there is to be some opposition
            to the tension of the Egyptian Trust
            and Investment by the Building Lands of
            Egypt owing to certain alleged irregularities
            in the voting. An explanation will be found in
            to-day's ‘Bourse Bulletin.’</p>

            Saturday next by the Ulema Board of Alexandria
            under the presidency of Sheikh Mohamed
            Shakir, who will distribute prizes and 
            monetary rewards to the successful ‘Talaba.’</p>
            
            <p>Drowning Accident.
            The body of a native was found floating in
            the Nile opposite Keneh a few days ago, and
            taken out by some sailors, who took the body
            to the hospital. On examination it was found
            that the dead man had 8 in his purse and
            a gold watch. His seal indicated that his name
            was Ahmed And Alle. The post-mortem showed
            that he had been drowned accidentally.</p>
            
            <p>Egyptian Shorthand.
            A middle-aged man with long hair and
            spectacles, says the “New York Press,” of the
            ind alto. went round and round the Obelisk
            in Central Park, bankbook in hand, making
            notes with a pencil. When he sat down to rest
            one who had been watching him asked the
            purpose of his memoranda. “Oh, just a fancy
            of mine,” he replied. “I believe that most of
            the hieroglyphics of Egypt are a sort of advanced
            shorthand, and am making a study of 
            the principle.” Is that man sane or insane?</p>
            
            <p>Wanted-Mosquitos
            The Mississippi Board of Health reports
            that the new mosquito, instead of being a drug on
            the market, as it is ordinarily at this season of
            the year, is almost in demand because of its
            scarcity. Science is hot after the mosquitos.
            Huntsmen and civilization have driven the
            bear and the panther farther into the wilds,
            the buffalo is almost extinct. can it be that
            science is following thus relentlessly the mosquitos!
            Will we one day look upon the specimen
            as a curiosity?- “Commercial Appeal,”

                        has presented a really remarkable report on the

                        Sir, The campaign against sexual impu-
                        rity in the a streets, which Miralai Hopkinson
                        Bey has undertaken in the best interests of
                        Alexandria, deserves the approbation of all
                        good men. About twenty six years ago I began
                        a similar work la connection with the Church
                        of Scotland and was in receipt of enough funds
                        to send the women back to their own coun-
                        tries. But the scheme fell through finally
                        through lack of means. An Irish lady. Mrs.
                        R H P Doran, subsequently resumed the
                        work of purity log Alexandria, and also tried
                        to take steps to save the women not only from
                        an immoral life but from physical destrue-
                        tion. This lady still sends me funds for
                        that purpose. Other philanthropic ladies in
                        Germany, Austria, and England have, on pass
                        ing through Alexandria in the tourist season,
                        asked me what measures are being taken
                        in this work, but the only lady who has
                        rendered devoted service to the cause,
                        is Mr. Sheldon Amos. She acompanied me
                        to the haunts of vice in our city and by her
                        exhortations and sympathy did her utmost
                        to interest other people is the purification
                        of Alexandria. Mr Claude Moutefiora two
                        years ago also took an interest in the work
                        and consulted me on the subject through the
                        introduction of Baron Jarques de Menaace.
                        Since then an International Association was
                        formed, but as the members had no expe-
                        erience of this work the whole duty fell on
                        Miralai Hopkinson Bey and myself, who were
                        the only persons who had any practical ex-
                        perience of how to save girls from a vicious
                        life. The work of the association was not
                        carried on properly and so i resigned and
                        since then I was obliged to write to Lord
                        Cromer to tell him how matters had been
                        mismanaged. Now the work is under police
                        management and there is really no need for
                        the existance of the International Associa- 
                        tion. Miralai Hopkinson Bey has been most 
                        successful in his campaign against fast women
                        and his endurance to raise the moral tone
                        of Alexandria should be succeeded by all the
                        members of the population.

                    <head>THE CAPITLATIONs.</head>
                    <head>REPLY TO "XENOS"</head>
                    <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE."</p>
                   <p>Sir,-In a recent issue of your valuable
                   paper, there appeared a letter by "Xenoa" on
                   a subject to which he is very much a stranger.
                   At first, on reading the triple head-line, I was
                   led to believe that a serious obstacle had been
                   found to the realisation of the scema propound-
                   ed by Lord Cromer for ridding Egypt of the
                   bane of the Capitulations.  I had not proceed-
                   ed very far however before I realised that the
                   writer was hopelessly astray.  Indeed, the arti-
                   cle is such a tissue of palpable inacouracies
                   that it were not worth while refuting them did
                   not the importance of the subject warrant the
                   removal of any misapprehensions which may
                   exist in the minds of those who have not stu-
                   died Lord Cromer's project.</p>
                <p>In the first place, I fail to see why any
                opposition whatever--still less opposition "of
                the most determined kind"- to the abolition 
                of the Capitulations should come from the
                Greek Orthodox community "subject to the
                essential authority of the Greek Patriarch
                of Alexandria, as distinguished from the Hel-
                lenc colony under the rule of the Hellenic
                Diplomatic Agency and Consulate General."
                "Xenos" obviously refers to the "Rayahs," or
                Greek local subjects.  Now the most cursory
                examination of Lord Cromer's project will show
                that its fundamental feature is the abolition
                of the Mixed Tribunals and the Consular
                jurisdictions, and that it will only affect sub-
                jects of a European Power so far as regards
                civil and criminal affairs, matters of personal
                states not coming within the scope of the
                project.</p>
                <p>All religious courts--that is, courts which 
                deal with matters of personal status such as
                the Mchkeweh Sharieh, the Fatriaruhates,
                Bishoprice and Rebbinal courts, will ocntines
                to exercise the same powers as he enforce, and
                therefore I cannot understand in what way the
                Greek Patriarchate, any more than any other
                Patriarchate, should "ove by the transaction 
                both in authority and immorial prestige"
                (sic.) "Xenos" tells us that as a consequence
                of the change "the mass of these Rsyshs
                subject to its canons will either, as Ottoman(1)
                subjects, find themselves subject regaurding
                their evil affairs to Egyptian control" (What
                amazing ignorance!  As Rayahs they are and
                always will be subject to Egyptian control in
                evil matters)--"or they will possibly petition 
                the power to secede to the authority of the
                Hellenic Conpulate General." Now isn't that
                real nice of them!  How, if all consular
                jerietition is to be abolished, and not
                Patriarchial, could they, or should they,
                succede to the Consultant General. This letter
                alternative, "Xenos" naively informs us, is
                most likely as "already it is adopted by the
                majority of Greek Ottomess subjects arriving
                in Egypt." The patriarchate has no civil
                jurisdiction, argo that is impossible. I find
                however in the following paragraph of his letter
                that "Xenos" is hopefully at ese as to what
                constitutes civil matters for he proceeds to
                give a curious definition, i.e. divorce, predate
                of will and all other matters whereis the
                patriarchial seal is neccessary. Was there ever
                such as elastic phrase! "Xenos" (who should 
                know better after consulting "a high dignitary
                of the church") of course reform to matters
                of personal states, and so I have before said,
                these will set he affected in any way by
                the abilities of the Capitulations. There will
                be on need for the Orthodox Greek community
                to fly to the protection of the King of Halles,
                a step which is, whenever , mmodered absolutley
                impossible by the scheme under consideration.
                </p>
                <p>Evidently the Patriarch himself does not
                take such an alternative view of the situation,
                for us the authority of "Xenos" himself we
                learn that his atitude demonstrates a pleasure 
                trip to Tripol and Tunis if only he can
                process the Imperical sanction to his during an.

                        <p>The Opposition Prees have seized on Mr.
                        Robertson's attack on Mr. Findlay with avidity
                        and worked themselves into a fi e frenzy of

                    <head>What the "Times" thinks.</head>
                    <p>The "Times" says:-- Typical of much which
                        has taken place since the Session opened was
                        the maligrant outburst of hysterical invective
                        against the officials of the Egyptian Govern-
                        ment, or which Mr. J. M. Robertson made
                        himself guilty. His mischievous and irrespon-
                        aible fanatioion seems to have been roused to
                        special fury by a telegram from one of Lord
                        Cromer's aubordinates, Mr Findlay, in which
                        the letter pointed out the probable effects of
                        Parliamentary discussion upon public opinion 
                        in Egypt -- a telagram which Mr Robertson
                        described as a "presumptuous censure" on the
                        House of Commons by an "incompetent bureau-
                        crat." After reading Mr.Robertson's speech
                        we can only share Mr Findlay's anxiety. A
                        member of Parliment wno can waive aside the
                        brutal murder of one British officer. and the
                        ill-treatment of others, as "a display of want
                        of due raepent." provoked by what the villagers
                        might well have considered an aat of trespass,
                        and on the other hand denounces the punish-
                        ment of the murderers by a Court composed of 
                        the highest legal authoritites in Egypt as
                        “wholesale slaughter" and as a resort to
                        "methods of barbarism," is, indeed, a danger
                        to the public. Such language, especially when
                        reported in the Egyptian Press, amounts to
                        nothing less than a deliberate justification of
                        murder and a wanton ineitament to fresh
                        outbreaks. Mr. Edward Grey in his reply ad-
                        ministered a dignified and crushing rebuke to
                        the author of this mischevious tirade. He
                        pointed out that the general adoption of such
                        a tone by the House af Commons would make
                        it quite impossible to conduct the business of
                        the British Empire. He defended Mr Findlay's
                        telegram, as sent purely for information and
                        in no way intended as a censure on the House
                        of Commons. He brushed aside Mr. Robertson's
                        ridiculous denunciation of the "man on the
                        spot" as always wrong, but pointed out how is
                        the case of Egypt the question of the respon-
                        sibility of the "man on the spot" is complicated
                        by the peculiar character of the metheds
                        whereby we direct the policy and influenmce

                    <p>The "Globe" remarks:--It must be extreme-
                    ly painful to Sir Edward Gret to reflect that
                    the Administration of which he is such a distin-
                    guished ornament, depends for its existence
                    upon the support of people holding the views
                    of Mr. J. M. Robertson, Mr. Arnold Luoton,
                    and Mr. Byles. The display which the first
                    named offered to an amused House of 
                    Commons on Saturday drew from the For-
                    eign Secretary a dignified protest against
                    the assumptions which is made by people of
                    this sortthat British officials are always and
                    everywhere in the wrong; but it is not likely
                    that the rebuke will havethe slightest
                    effect Mr. Robertson found it impossible to
                    refer to the Denishwai executions without
                    talking about "cowardly, panic-stricken,
                    officials" and "incompetent bureauocrats,"
                    and condemining a necessary act of justice as
                    though it were a personal revenge for some
                    trivial insult. For native treacherously to
                    kill an English officer who had done them no
                    measure of harm is, according to Mr. Robert-
                    son, not murder at all, but only a form of
                    homiside which, we gather, is hardly cap-
                    able. For English soldiers to defend them-
                    selves with the arms supplied to them
                    against changing Zulus is not fair fighting.
                    accordig to the egregious Byles, and is,
                    therefore, we suppose, something very like
                    murder. If the public will put those two
                    conceptions together, and will appreciate the
                    fact that these Byles and Robertsons all 
                    act together to belittle the power of Eng-
                    land, and to blemish the fair fame of her
                    trusted servants, the true state of affairs
                    we be, perhaps, more clearly evident than
                    it has been. We notice they are terribly
                    tender about the flogging of ruffiance who
                    most justly deserve a penalty much more
                    severe. We only wish they had the courage 
                    to share in every particular the fortunes of
                    their friends. A short turn on the triangles
                    would, no doubt, be painful, but it would be
                    extremly wholesome, and it might result in 
                    the abruption through the skin of a little
                    patriotism and commerce.</p>

                    <p>The "Fall Mall Gazette" says:-- It is a good
                    thing that Mr. J. M. Robertson should have
                    made his speech on Egyptian affairs on a day
                    when there was nothing else to occupy the
                    attention of the House of Commons, lecaure
                    it gives everyone a chance of realising the true
                    Radical conception of Imperial questions. Mr.
                    Robertson makes no secret of his view that the
                    typical British official is either a fool or a 
                    knave, that the "man on the spot" is disquali-
                    fied by his situation from forming a sound 
                    judgement, and that countries like Egypt can
                    only be safelt ruled from Tooley-street and in
                    accordance with the doctrines which the Tooley-
                    street environment engenders. For the present
                    we have a Foreign Secretary who defies
                    Tooley-street and its opinions, and Sir Edward
                    Grey replied to Mr.Robertson's speech in lan-
                    guage that might have been used by Lord
                    Lausdowne or any Unionist Minister. But it is
                    doubtful how long Sir Edward Grey will be 
                    able to maintain the independece which has
                    been surrendered by the other "Liberal Impa"
                    in the Cabinet, and when he has been subdued
                    or got rid of we shall have a working exhibition

                <head>ELIPTICAL TO FRENCH BISHOPS</head>
                <p>
                            Paris August 14
                  The Pope's Enoyolical to the French Bishops
                  orders the clergy to disregaurd the law of seps
                  ration as much as possile, also to ignore
                  parochial associations, authorized under the
                  Act to take over the charge of Church affairs.</p>
                <p>The Enoyolical indicates that the Pope
                would prefer separation pure and simple to
                the present law. He recommends firmness and
                deprecates violence in the French Catholics
                struggle for the Church. He disclaims an anti
                repunlicn animus and throw the responsibi-
                lity for the present situation on the secularists.
                    The Bishops have replied acuiescing. (R.)</p>
                <p>The Pope's Enoyolical to the Church in
                France declares that the parochial associations
                are inacceptable, and calls upon Catholics to
                fight energetically for the defence of the reli-
                gion, but without viloence or sedition. (Fames)</p>
