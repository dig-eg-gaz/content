                    <head>The Situation</head>
                    <p>The telegrams both from St. Petersburg and Tokio show that the battle has by
                        no means ended, and that the theatre of the great fight has merely been
                        moved from Mukden to the north of Tieling, where another furios struggle is
                        proceeding. Kuropatkin proved his genius for retreat both at Liao-yang and
                        at the Sha-ho, but he has not shown that he can make use of the greatest
                        opportunity for the display of that genius that the war has yet</p>
                    <cols n="6"/>
                    <cb n="6"/>
                    <p>given him. For eighteen days this stupendous battle has been raging and
                        roaring in Man-churia. For eighteen days the Japanese armies have been
                        patiently and relentlessly pushing forward to the consummation of a careful
                        plan, for eighteen days the Russian forces have been obstinately contesting
                        every inch of hard won ground with the dogged and obstinate cou-rage of men
                        who do not recognise defeat. If Kuropatkin suceeds once more in ex-tricating
                        any considerable part of his army and impedimenta from the battle now raging
                        north of Tieling, the end will not have been attained, and the terrible
                        sacrifice will not have secured the object for which so a high a price has
                        been paid. That even-tuality seems more and more improbable. To all seeming
                        this must be of the campaign whether Kuropatkin capitulates, or breaks
                        through with a handful, a remnant, of his once great and powerful army. But
                        if he succeeds in pushing direct northwards from Tieling, as he pushed on
                        last week aganist terrific odds from Mukden to Tieling he will have
                        accomplished a feat surpassing in skill any yet achieved by a beaton
                        general.</p>
                    <p>A telegram, despatched from Tokio yester-day, announces that the Japanese
                        occupied Sing-king on the 13th inst. Sing-king, like Fu-shun, is a small
                        town with a wall a third of a mile long surrounding it. Sing-king's height
                        above the sea is fourteen hundred feet, and this will afford an idea of the
                        fall of the country towards Mukden. To reach Sing-king from the Yalu, as he
                        new Ja-panese Army has done, the Chang-chung-ling, or Serpent Pass, eighteen
                        miles to the south-west, has to be traversed, where the height is 2,300ft
                        above sea level, it being the highest point on the road from Sing-king to
                        Liao-yang. On the north side of this pass rises the Shu-tsu (which joins the
                        Hun-ho at Ying-pan), and on the south side the Tai-tse-sho. The difficulties
                        attending the passage of an army through very hilly country are not few even
                        under normal conditions, and it will be easy to com-prehend that the hopes
                        which the Russians entertain of being able to conduct the strate-gies
                        retirement of their left successfully through such a region, with the
                        Japanese close on heels and on both flanks as well, must be sl indeed. The
                        Japanese army which has occ Sing-king consists of more than six sions of
                        territorial troops under. General Kawamura, and this magnificent force,
                        which by this time may have reached Ying Pan will afford a further line of
                        resistance to any attempt of the remnants of Linievitch's army to retire on
                        the East, assuming that army is still existing as a military entity, which
                        is doubtful.</p>
                    <p>Our telegrams contain the important news that a Japanese fleet left Singapore
                        for an unknown destination, but it is believed that it is ready to cross the
                        Indian Ocean. This fleet consists of 22 men-of-war. Meanwhile,
                        Rodjestvensky's Baltic Fleet has gone to Djibouti to meet the third
                        Squadron, which is due to pass through the Suez Canal next week. It must be
                        remembered that, in spite of her wonderful achievements, Japan still depends
                        for her success upon her retention of the command of the sea. That command,
                        once it passes to Russia, will ultimatley render almost fruitless the whole
                        of the japanese victories on land. Her island kingdom will no longer form as
                        at present an impregnable base from which to supply her armies in Manchuria,
                        nor with her still relatively small fleet has she the reserves upon which to
                        fall back in the event of an exhaustive or indecisive naval battle with the
                        Baltic Fleet. In short, a "stale-mate" would in present circumstances go far
                        to neutralise the successes she has hiterto won. The departure therefore of
                        the fleet from Singapore shows that the Japanese hold that no settles peace
                        is in sight until the Russian Navy as well as the Army, is distinctly and
                        undoubtedly worsted in the fight</p>

                    <p>Yesterday afternoon, a meeting of the voters of St. Mark's Church, Alexandria
                        was held at II.B.M.'s C n-iiJa^B in order to discuss the quadfiOu-of The
                        building of a Church House. At the first meeting of the voters, held in the
                        middle of last month, it was thought that the St. Mark's Building
                        Association, Limited, was making too good a bargain in reference to the
                        extension of the association's lease. A com­mittee was therefore appointed,
                        consisting oi Mr. E. B. Gould, I.S.O., Consul-General, the -church officers,
                        and Mr. R.G. Crafton, in ordei to obtain better terms, if possible.</p>
                    <p>At yesterday's meeting this committee re­ported tlgU'+beyhad secured a
                        reduction in the , terms'of tins lease of the association to the J extent of
                        four years,and therefore the lease will i now extend to 1936 instead of
                        1940. The com­mittee also reported that they had succeeded in increasing the
                        sum payable from £2,750 to £3,000, subject to the approval of the share-
                        holders of St. Mark's Building Association, Limited, at an
                        extraujdinary'general meeting to be held at some future date.</p>
                    <p>These conditions are considered to be quite favorable to the church, as they
                        arc equiva­lent to an advance at the rate of 5 per cent, per annum,
                        calculating the revenue of St. , Mark's Building Association at the average
                        of the last five years.</p>
                    <p>The following resolution was submitted and passed unanimously :—</p>

                        ground held by the said Association from i the Trustees of St. Mark's Church
                        to the 31st day ol Hecember, 1936, the said Association should cede to St.
                        Mark's Church from the 1st day of January, 1906, the use of the premises at
                        present occupied by the Swiss Club, and further furnish the sum of £3,000
                        for the purposes of building above the rooms, at pre­sent occupied by the
                        Swiss Club aforesaid, such additions as are, in the opinion of the Trustees
                        of the St. Mark's Church Property, necessary to make a good Church House, or
                        any less sum than the said £3,000 that may be necessary for this purpose.
                        Should the said building cost less than £3,00%, then the ba­lance should be
                        paid over to the Trustees of the Property ol St. Mark's Church to be

                    <head>At Home on the "Republic"</head>
                    <p>One of the most pleasant gatherings which has been held this season at
                        Alexandria took place on Wednesday last, when Mrs. John Russ entertained a
                        large number (considera­bly over 200) of her friends on board the White Star
                        liner "Republic." The visits of the ships of this line to Alexandria have
                        been a feature of this year's tourist season, and it was a happy thought
                        which led to an eutertainment being given on board the "Republic," so as to
                        afford Alexandrians an opportunity of viewing one of these fine vessels. It
                        was a welcome novelty in the way of "at homes," and there were few who were
                        lucky .enough to receive an invitation that did not avail themselves of it.
                        Invitations had been issued for 3 o'clock, and shortly after that hour the
                        deck of the magnificent vessel was crowded with guests, who evinced the
                        greatest interest in the ship. Morb> than one was heard to express a regret
                        that the passenger traffic be­tween Alexandria aud Europe did not permit of
                        the regular sailings of these vessels all the year round—a regret which we
                        ourselves share, for anything finer in the way of accommodation it wotild be
                        impossible to find. It was fortunate, too, that the S.S. "Arabic" of the
                        same line, which is a larger vessel, was)> moored in the harbour at the same
                        time. Advantage was takao/of this to run steam launches between the two
                        vessels, to allow of the guesEs visiting both. All whoMid were perfectly
                        en­chanted with what they saw. The guests were received on board the
                        "Republic" by Mrs. Ross aud Captain Macaulay, both of whom were
                        indefatigable in their attentions to their guests. I A sumptuous tea was
                        served in one of the splendid saloons of the vessel, and afterwards the
                        guests were eutertaiued by Mr. Scott- Leslie, assisted by Mr. Bavtd W.
                        Norton on ■ the piano. One of the most pleasant features of the afternoon
                        was the playing of the Rqyal Berks, band, which, by kind permission of the
                        culouel and officers, discoursed a choice selection of music that was
                        greatly appreciated. Altogether the function was a pronounced suc­cess, anti
                        a nt >st delightful afternoon was spent by all.</p>

                    <p>Delavigne's Louis XI. is undoubtedly one of Novelli's greatest impersonations
                        : the se­veral moods of the sensual, tyrauuical, and cunning uTonarcli are
                        presented with life-like fidelity. "By Delavigne, Louis is represented iu
                        his waning years, when his mind, as well as his power, is fast ebbing away.
                        By Novelli the representation of the difficult character of the now
                        terrorised old king is absolutely perfect — an achievement possibles only in
                        the hands of a great artist. Last night his per­formance was greeted with4

                    <p>The Stock Markets still maintain a firm tone here, and investment stocks
                        remain the principal feature. The reduction of the Bank rate yesterday to 2^
                        per cent, came as a decided surprise, and gave a fresh start to prices,
                        Consols closing firm at 91 §. American Rails were also buoyant at Qie finish
                        ; the decision of the Harriman call lias given a fresh spurt to the market.
                        In Egyptians there has been, as we anticipated, a set back in National

                        fallen back to 27, and closed to-day sellers at the price. Agricultural
                        Banks have also eased off to 11 A- Other shares are fairly steady. Salt and
                        Sodas are unchanged at 2^y, Daira Sanieh are steady at 5$, and Egyptian
                        markets are inclined to be harder at lj. New flotations, located in Egypt,
                        still follow one another on the market—perhaps a trifle too fast. This week
                        we have Egyptian Estates, Ltd., with a capital of £500,000, half of which is
                        now offered to the public. The names of those associated with the scheme are
                        the principal attraction the prospectus offers, and it is mainly public
                        confidence in the board that is responsible for the J per cent, premium at
                        which the shares are quoted, for the actual assets seem decidedly vague. In
                        the mining section there is a rather better tendency noticeable. Nile
                        Valleys are harder at 2§, and Egyptian and Sudan Syndicate, to which we drew
                        attention recently, aro also higher at 2J bid. There has been some rise in
                        Egyptian Mines to 18s., but there should, be room for a further improvement
                        in these. There might easily besoike rally in the mining market this month,
                        as a good many options will mature at the end of it, and there has been more
                        active -enquiry for Egyptian shares to-day than for some time past.</p>

                        inst., Mr. F. Legge read a paper, illustrated by lantern- slides, on 'Some
                        Egyptiau Magic Ivories.' The objects treated of were the boomerang-shaped
                        wands to be found in most Egyptian museums, of which nearly a score were
                        thrown on the screen. The author held that these were in effect
                        phylacteries, intended to protect the wearer against different ills, and
                        especially against the bites of poisonous serpents and scorpions. He further
                        said that all those hitherto discovered seemed to be of the time of the
                        twelfth dynasty, and those whose pro­venance could be traced came from the
                        neighbourhood of Thebes. He also said that the fantastic animals carved on
                        these ivories were not purely imaginary.but were either symboli­cal, as with
                        the two-headed sphinx and the two-headed bull, which represented regions
                        through which the sun had to pass in the underworld, or were distorted
                        representations of extinot animals, such as the snake-headed panther, which
                        represented the traditional recollection of the giraffe.</p>

                    <head>The Land Bank of Egypt</head>
                    <p>Nous recevons à ce sujet la lettre suivante:</p>
                    <p>Oncroyaiton avoir fiui avec la Land Bank. I! n'en etait rien. Les promoteurs
                        de cette affaire se croient tout per'mis. Non contents de chauf fer le
                        marché et de gaguer certains courtiers, ils n'ont pas reculd hier devant la
                        mesure la plus ddsespdrde, celle d'empdeher de traiter dof affaires dans la
                        corbeille, si Ton ne cotait psj leur valeur.</p>
                    <p>Avec de l'aplomb le president et les mem bres du Comity qui lui dtaient
                        restds fidfiles avaient crupouvoir faire avaler la pilule. Quelle
                        prdaomption I Mais aussi quel fiasco ! Malgrd sa premiere defaite, le comity
                        avait passe1 outre mais cette fois la demission lui etait imposde. Un cri
                        presque unauime agrdmeutd de sitilets a couru pendant des heures dans la
                        corbeille "Demission! Demission !"</p>
                    <p>Et malgrd sa resistance et tout son aplomb, le comite, bien malgre lui, a dit
                        enfin ddmis- sionner sans avoir rempli sa mission.</p>
                    <p>Ce qu'il y a de plus curieux en la circons- tance, e'est que le comite et
                        quelques autres courtiers gagnes à sa cause pretendent avoir le droit pour
                        eux, ils affichent de grands airs indignes. C'est un scandale, un chantage:
                        disent-ils. Ils vont jusqu'k se prevaloir du vote de la dernidre assemblde
                        generale. C'est vrai- mentaller trop loin et me voilk oblige, bien k
                        contre-cceur, de reveuir sur des questions qtli ont ete exposees dejk k
                        satiete.</p>
                    <p>Non, ces messieurs du comite, le president à lenr tete, n'ont pas le droit
                        pour eux; ils sont au contraire dans la plus complete iliegalite et le
                        scandale consists prdcisdment en ce qu'ils veulent pour des raisons qui leur
                        sont person- nelles passer par dessus les regies et les con­venances. La
                        majorite ne les imite point dans leurs pretentions et se base pour leur
                        resister sur les faits et les reglements:</p>
                    <p>1" Le vote de la dernidre assembiee generale est nul et non avenu, parce
                        qu'il n'y avait point de majorite à cette assembiee, ou plutut si, il y en
                        avait une et meme ecrasante, mais contre l'admission de la Land Bank. Comme
                        le president voulait arbitrairement imposer le vote à main levee, une
                        cinquantaine de mem- bres se retirereut sur SO qui etaieut presents ;
                        e'etait done la majorite qui se retirait en signe de protestation. Il ne
                        restait plus qu'k lever la seance; mais il se passa alors une chose inouie:
                        les partisans de i admission crurent legal de voter tout de meme. Sur leur
                        petit nombre il y en eut encore pour protester et pour s'abstenir. Et o'est
                        ce vote etrauge d'une vingtaine de partisans contre soixante mem bres
                        presents à l'assembiee que ces messieurs du comite appellent legal! C'est
                        leur majorite !</p>
                    <p>2° En admettant meme que le vote en ques tion soit legal au point de vue de
                        la rdgn larite du vote, il se trouve annulle par les statute et reglements
                        de 1'Association des courtiers en valeurs. Ou lit en effet à Particle 24 des
                        statuts:</p>
                    <p>" Pour introduire ou admettre une valeur à la cote cfficielle, les iutdressds
                        auront à en faire la demande, par dcrit, au Comite, en ac-> compagnant cette
                        demande, du fatesimild d'nn titre de la valeur à coter, d'un exemplaire des
                        statuts, avec toutes les modifications qui au- raient pu y dtre apportees et
                        de toute autre pikee dont le Comite jugerait la production ndoessaire.</p>
                    <p>" Ce dossier ensemble avec le rapport du Comite, sera sounds à 1'Assembiee
                        generate appelde à statuer qui s'inspirera de la plus gTande prudence daits
                        l'admission des valeurs nouvelles. "</p>
                    <p>Or le Comite, non seulement n'a pas found à l'assembiee d'exemplaire des
                        statuts, mais il n'a pas mdme presente de rapport à l'assembiee, sans doute
                        pour ne pas se oompromettre en ens d jnsucces de l'affaire.</p>
                    <p>3° Le lendemain de cette seance extraordi­naire, une lettre de protestation
                        se couvrait de signatures et etait adressde au comite pour reclamer une
                        assembiee generale.</p>
                    <p>4° Le public a eleve de son cdtd d'unanimes protestations contre les
                        agissements des pro- inoteurs de'la Land Bank.</p>
                    <p>5° Trois membres du comite sur sept ont energiquement protestes contre de
                        tels pre­cedes. Deux ont mfime donnd leur demission.</p>
                    <p>Contre. tout et contre tous les promoteurs de la Laud ont cru pouvoir passer
                        outre. Ils ontjoud hier leur dernidre carte. Lesddbris du comitd ont du se
                        retirer aprds avoir fait de vains efforts pour berner le public et la
                        majoritd des courtiers. Voilk ce qu'ils appellent un scandale et ils ont
                        raison. Mais ils en sont les seuls auteurs. On espdre que ce sera leur
                        der­nier exploit.</p>
                    <p>Mais laissons de cote ce fait monstrueux d'un president qui veuten imposer k
                        un comitd et d'un comitd (dont 3 membres sur 7 sont .de l'opposition !) qui
                        veut en ^imposer à la majo­rite, et examinons l'affaire en elle-mdme.</p>
                    <p>Il ne s'agit pas ici, comme ou le sait, d'une mine d'or Di d'une invention,
                        mais simplement de banque de prfits sur hypothdques, à l'instar 4'une foule
                        d'autres banques locales. En suppo- sant mdme que la gestion en soit confide
                        à des personnes dminemment honndtes et capables et que les garanties soient
                        des plus Bdrieuses, il nous semble impossible qu'avant mdme de verser les
                        capitaux qui sont ou ne sont pas dans leur poche, les promoteurs aient pu
                        doubler la /aleur de leurs titres et accomplir ce prodige que 1 fasse 2.</p>
                    <p>Encore une fois la valeur ne vaut certaine- ment pas plns'qne les autres
                        analogues qui ont ddjk fait leurs preuves. Et si elle ne vaut pas moius, les
                        promoteurs de l'aflaire ont eu grand tort de mener tout ce bruit pour
                        exercer une presaion sur le publio ; car la confianoe ne se commands pas ;
                        c'est un oiseau sauvage qui veut des rndnagements.</p>

                        addressed by ja Sir Benjamin Baker to Sir William Garstiu. Il '* is dated
                        Assouan, February 25</p>
                    <p>Wbeu iuvited to express an opinion " as to a design for raisiug the Assouan
                        dam by building masonry on the top to a sufficient height to hold up six
                        metres extra of water, I " replied that I could only do so subject to
                        personal inspection of the dam, after its two 8 1 ydiirs' working, and a
                        conference with your engineers on the spot. Having now spent more u than a!
                        fortnight on the works and considered 1 the subject in all its bearing^, I
                        have arrived at the definite conclusion that still further experience of the
                        working of the dam is re- ,h vquired before any responsible engineer, know-
                        sel inj^the recent advances in scieuce with regard l,a distresses on dams,
                        the determination of which involve accurate data and very difficult
                        mathematical investigations, would venture to state with confidence how much
                        the water i,a might be raised in the reservoir, without un- ml duly reducing
                        the necessarily large factor of safety required in so important a work.</p>
                    <p>In ftny event I could not have recom- 0</p>
                    <p>mended any raising of the dam until the aj/ protective works to the river bed
                        below the dam, to be curried out this year and next, and the modification ot
                        some of the sluices to . facilitate their working, had been completed m and
                        in successful operation. With this further ar experience in the working of
                        the dam, and with tu the application of the most recent methods of w&lt;
                        mathematical research to the problem of the dam, it will be possible in my
                        opinion to advise ^ you with confidence how much, if any, the d.-up iraysbe
                        prudently raised, but for the next ™ ■ two years 1 recommend that the
                        question be ra suspended.</p>
                    <p>—To give the whole of my reasons for 00 this unhesitating recommendation
                        would encum mi ber the present brief report with highly technical and
                        difficult mathematical details, w&lt; which may be better* reserved for a
                        future to communication. In the present report I pro- ®h pose to set forth
                        very briefly, and in untechnical •language, the general conclusions arrived
                        at</p>
                    <p>by me as the result of a close study of the ^ work every day during the past
                        fortnight</p>
                    <p>—The first and most important conclusion</p>
                    <p>- is that, although at times owing to the p scouring away ot unknown masses
                        ot rock in the L river bed below the dam, there was naturally some anxiety
                        on the part of thpse responsible ^ for the maintenance of the Work, at no
                        time was the structure in any danger whatever. 1 This happy result was due
                        to the large factor of safety insisted upon by the International Commission
                        to provide against contingencies which no engineer can pretend to foresee.
                        All that an engineer can do is to ensure that the v rock upon which he
                        founds a dam is solid. He cannot, of course, say what fissures may exist in
                        rock below that level and out of sight. At Assouan, two years' working has
                        scoured out ^ rock in the river bed below the dam, and given muefi
                        additional and valuable information, and ou the basis of this new
                        information, I am of opinion that a substantial apron must be made and
                        maintained throughout the whole length of the sluice portion of the dam, and
                        demon- g strated to be a success before any further rp stresses should be
                        put upon the rock founda tion of the dam by raising the level of water in ,p
                        the reservoir.</p>
                    <p>—I have discussed the details of these protective works with your engineers,
                        and as , we are in accord on all points, it is unnecessary ^ to deal with
                        them here. The only work apart from the apron suggested by the scouring
                        action of the past two years is a strengthening</p>
                    <p>of the river slope at the upper lock wall, where a hole has been dug out in
                        the river bed rock by the action of the high level sluices, and the
                        necessary masonry and rubble filling for this oan be readily executed after
                        the reservoir is empty and during high Nile if desired.</p>
                    <p>—At the present time, pending the com­pletion of the protective works, the
                        rush of _ water is necessarily concentrated, and although</p>
                    <p>.0 newly-constructed aprons have so far stood i action, it would be
                        unreasonable to expect .t they would do so for all time. With the rks now
                        arranged for, and in progress, the rush of water would be distributed over a
                        great length of apron, and in my opinion the«e will be no difficulty
                        whatever in maintenance ^ with the water in the reservoir at its present
                        level, or everr somewhat higher.</p>
                    <p>—Another conclusion I have come to as a result of my inspection is that the
                        ques­tion of raisings the dam depends, so far as calculations are concerned,
                        upon the appli­cation of what may be termed new methods of mathematical in
                        vestigation. It would appear that the stresses on the masonry of a dam are
                        more largely affected by the nature of \ the rock foundation than was
                        formerly sup­posed to be the case, and having regard to the character of the
                        latter at Assouan, as 1 newly indicated by the scour which bas occurred
                        below the dam, I am inclined to think that a rigid application of the new
                        methods may possibly preclude the railing</p>
                    <p>of the same to any appreciable extent This point, of course, must be
                        reserved, as I have not yet sufficient data to deal with the problem. It is
                        only necessary for me to say that the calculations submitted to j me by the
                        Government engineers, with the plans for the raising of the dam, were found
                        by me to be correct in all respects, and g according to past practice the
                        water might be held up safely to the height proposed with the ordinary
                        factor of safety.</p>
                    <p>—The question, however, is whether an ordinary factor of safety will suffice
                        at Assouan, having regard to the important interests at stake. It will be
                        remembered that the founda­tions of the dam were carried at considerable I
                        cost to a much greater depth than was provid- </p>

                    <p>ad in the contract drawings, and having regard to this fact, and to the very
                        careful way in which the work was executed, I at one time was inclined to
                        accept a less factor of safety fur contingencies than was originally
                        provided mil to consider favorably a raising of the dam. On the whole,
                        however, for the reas'us lii: ily indicated in this report, I cannot at
                        present recommend any reduction in the factor if safety,and must defer my
                        final opinion until ihw works now in progress have been tested.</p>
                    <p>—As some rumours have been circulated about vibrations in the masonry of the
                        dam, due to the rush of the water through the sluices, it may be well for me
                        to place on record the fact that these vibrations are abso­lutely
                        nogligeable. During the past 30 years, 1 have conducted hundreds of
                        instrumental observations of vibrations in structures of all kinds, and can
                        state that the water rushing hrough the sluices does not produce moi;e
                        ■ensible, or serious, vibration than would the oassage of a four-wheeled cab
                        over the dam ■oadway.</p>
                    <p>- It has been of great advantage to me » have lived, as it were, on the dam
                        for the oast fortnight, for, on a first visit, any one night not
                        unreasonably expect that the action of the water would he severe on the
                        masonry. Detailed examination of the wh ile structure aaa, however,
                        satisfied me that, although the action in the pest has been far more severe
                        than it ever can be in the future, no damage whatever has occurred to a
                        single stone during the past two years. Ileave the work, therefore, in
                        perfect confidence that you need have no anxiety about its permanent
                        stability for cen­turies to come, without any difficult or costly works of
                        maintenance.</p>
                    <p>—The protective works of mssonry aprons below the dam might have been
                        constructed iriginally as_a part of the contract work, but this would have
                        delayed the utilisation of the reservoir for a year, and they can be
                        construct- }d as readily now as then, and at rather less lost. They cannot,
                        therefore, be regarded as maintenance works, or as unexpected works, for it
                        was always anticipated that protection would be required below the dam,
                        though not to so considerable an extent as experience has shown to be
                        necessary..</p>
                    <p>On the other hand, when the work is thoroughly done once and for all, I
                        anticipate the cost of future maintenance will be small.</p>

                    <head>The Savoy Ball</head>
                    <p>Among the costumes at the Savoy fancy- dress ball which we have not yet
                        mentioned, Bimbashi Lewin's white Indian uniform with turban and aigrette
                        was very conspicuous. A Spanish-American rapprochement was illustrat­ed by
                        Mr. and Mrs. Magill, the former being arrayed in the stars and stripes while
                        Mrs. Magill was a most remarkably good Carmen. Mr. Wild wore the dress of a
                        Venetian fisher­men with the bands around the legs which were accepted in
                        Mr. Winkle's days as neces­sary components of any Italian costume. Capt.
                        Biggs was a dervish, and Messrs. Heller and Nesbitt were imposing rajahs.
                        Mrs. Mil- ward, who wore a very pretty costume, was a soothing contrast to
                        her redoubtable pirate husband, whose array of daggers and pistols was
                        capable of inspiring terror in the hearts of the stoniest merchantmen. Mr.
                        Clogstoun appeared as an A.B., while Mr. Russell came dressed as a
                        photographic negative,, white replacing black and vice-versft. Miss de Wahl
                        was very prettily dressed as a Greek girl and Miss Rees made a charming
                        paysanne, while her brother appeared in all the glory of a peacock dervish.
                        Mr. Boys, as a pierrot, Mr. Forestier-Walker, as a Japanese, and Mr.
                        Francis, as a decadent golfer, were all goodj and there was a remarkably
                        black Topsy, who proved to be Miss Hume. Mr. S. de Bilinski and Mr. Langley
                        wore hunting pink. Mrs. Keatinge's was also a very pretty costume,and Miss
                        Coles wore a very pretty green dress and hat, her sister looking very well
                        in white and poudrle. Mrs. Ray and Mme de Gorastazu, powdered and in XVIIIth
                        century toilettes, were very conspicuous, and we must not forget Miss Price,
                        who looked very striking in black spangled with silver, and Mrs. Lovell, who
                        wore a fine LouiB XVI. dress.</p>
                    <p>Many dinner and supper parties were given at the Savoy on the night of the
                        ball. Sir Ernest Cassel gave a dinner party of 6 covers and a supper party
                        of 12, and the Austrian Agent and Consul-General had 10 at dinner. Other
                        dinner parties were given by Mr. Cookson (8), Dr. Armstrong (8), Baron von
                        Bassns (9), Lady Warner (4), Mine, de Werth (8), Mrs. Leverich (8), and many
                        others. The manage­ment and catering were as admirable as ever, and the
                        evening must be pronounced a great success from every point of view.</p>

                    <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.This
                        depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in January
                        may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so warm as Sicily,
                        but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm than many
                        other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in the year,
                        for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest place to
                        go to on leaving Egypt are Sicily and Southern Spain. Venice and the
                        district (although they have many attractions) are not uniformly warm until
                        much later. Florence is very beautiful and full of interest, but sometimes
                        there are cold winds in the early spring.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                        sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on each of
                        the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>
                    <p>They are as follows:-</p>
                    <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southhampton,
                        London or Liverpool—occupy about 14 days. The short ones are as
                        follows:—</p>

                    <p>The steamers, of the North German Lloyd, P &amp; O., Orient and Messageries
                        Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines are
                        also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by travellers to
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 1/2 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made without
                        change in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg. The most expensive
                        but quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp;O. Brindisi express
                        from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna express from
                        Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis" to Brindisi. One of these leaves port
                        Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian mails from
                        the great liner arrived from Bombay. These small but comfortable ships have
                        enormously powerful engines, and attain a very high rate of speed. They are
                        called the "Ferry Boats" having been specially built to carry the British
                        mail from Port Said to Brindisi. If you are going straight through to
                        England you will find the train waiting at Brindisi which will take you to
                        Calais without changing. It has complete arrangements for sleeping and
                        eating on board, and you should arrive in London on the fifth day from
                        leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <p>The express goes north via Ancona, on the East coast, so that if you elect to
                        go to Naples and Rome you may possibly have to wait at Brindisi some time
                        for your train. At Brindisi there is nothing to see except the place which
                        is supposed to have been the termination of the Appian way from Rome. </p>
                    <p>From Brindisi to Naples is a journey of 11 hours, but it can be broken at
                        Taranto, two hours run from Brindisi.</p>
                    <p>Tarentum, founded in the 8th century B.C. by Spartans, was the first city of
                        Great Greece. It has had a varied and exciting history, and remains of fine
                        buildings - theatre, temple, circus and aqueduct - tell of its importance.
                        Its situation is the most picturesque. The bay is the only secure port on
                        the gulf, the entrance being so narrow that is it spanned by a bridge of a
                        seven arches.</p>
                    <p>Salerno lies on the coast and is one of the most beautiful places in Southern
                        Italy. On a height 905 feet above the sea stand the ruins of its Norman
                        castle, giving a most imposing appearance to the place. The cathedral
                        contains some very fine marble, and an 11th century Byzantine bronze door.
                        Salerno was at one time a seat of learning, its medical school being famous
                        ; the university was closed in 1817. You must visit Pastum's wonderful Greek
                        temples, which are second only to those at Athens. The travertine walls, the
                        gates, the Temples of Neptune and Ceres, and the Basilica are of surpassing
                        interest and the place is a happy hunting ground for the sketcher.</p>
                    <p>Naples is reached in an hour and a half. Thence you must proceed to Rome,
                        whence you may go by Florence and Bologna to Milan and the Italian Lakes;
                        then by the St. Gothard line to Lucerne, Basle and Calais. Or ou may go by
                        the coast, by Civita Vecchia and Pisu to Genoa and home by Turing and the
                        Mont Cenis route.</p>

                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio Rubattino Co.'s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA. </p>
                    <p>From Messina the railway runs along the north coast of Sicily to Palermo and
                        down the east coast to Syracuse via Taormina and Catania. TAORMINA is one of
                        the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is the station
                        at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful,
                        occupying about one hour. The road goes winding up the hill in zig-zag
                        fashion, and charming views - more beautiful the higher one gets - are
                        unfolded to view. In and around the town is much to interest and visitor.
                        The theatre is of Greek origin, but restores under the Roamns. Catania is
                        the starting place for the ascent of Etna, beyond that there is little of
                        interest to the visitor. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are
                        found all over the island, are an endless source of pleasure. The finest are
                        at Syracuse and Girgenti on the south-west coast, and both places are well
                        worth visiting. SYRACUSE has an interesting history, having been a Greek
                        city, which was besieged by Demosthenes in B.C. 413, and taken by the Romans
                        in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain - his tomb is to be seen. The
                        cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. There is a fine theatre, alaso
                        an amphitheatre and a temple to Diana, and the ruins of the great temple
                        dedicated to the Olympian Jove. Girgenti stands on a hill 900 feet high and
                        commands a magnificent view. The ancient ruins of Agrigentum are most
                        interesting - of the timeple to juno there are still many columns stnading.
                        There are also the remains of temples to Castor and Pollux, Theron, and the
                        enormous pillars of the temple to Jupiter Olympus. PALERMO, with about
                        300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a delightful
                        climate Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The Palazzo Reale
                        of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S. Giovannia degli Eremiti
                        with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral, Museum, Botanic Gardens,
                        Villa Guilia and and Royal Park are also worth a visit. Excursions from
                        Palermo should be made to Monreale to see the beautiful Cloisters, and to
                        Solunto, Cefalu, not forgetting also the Temples of Segesta and Selinunte.
                        With its lovely scenery and delightful climate, its antiquities and
                        beautiful vegetation, Sicily is certainly the most sttractive island in the
                        Mediterranean.</p>

                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio Rubattino Co.'s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its bay
                        — Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento
                        [or you can drive] will take you on to Capri. This rocky little island is
                        full of beautiful sea caves and grottoes, the exploring of which on a fine
                        day, in a small boat, is a most fascinating occupation. The colour of the
                        water is a perpetual joy, and the caves seem to be a veritable trap for
                        sunshine. Of flowers and ferns there are plenty. Ischia and Procida can be
                        visited in another little three or four days' trip from Naples. The steamers
                        start from Immacolatella. The views of the coast, of Posilipo, Pozzuoli and
                        Capo Miseno, are very fine. The little volcanic island of Procida is chiefly
                        inhabited by sailors. The island of Ischia comes next, a charming resort,
                        with mineral waters. The little harbour of Ischia, protected by its castle
                        on a promontorv, is a volcanic crater. Casamieciola is the place at which
                        you will stay, and from which you will make the ascent of Mount Epomeus for
                        a glorious view.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                        City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence itself the churches
                        and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local promenades and
                        excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and
                        fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea
                        level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero,
                        thence by cog-wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks
                        takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>

                        of place : - St. Peter's, the Vatican, Capitol and National Museums, Gallery
                        of Modern Art, Villa Borghese, Doria, Colonna, and Lateran Palaces, Castle
                        of St. Angelo, and the Pagan Antiquities, consisting of the Colosseum, Roman

                        view.</p>
                    <p>The run down to Pisa from Florence can be made two ways; either by Pistoja
                        and Lucca or by Empoli. Lucea is one of the old fortified towns of Italy,
                        with an imposing wall built round it, and massive gates leading into the
                        town. Here is also the fine old Cathedral of St. Martino. In Pisa there is a
                        fine Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made, in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at sunset.
                        From Pisa there are good trains to Leghorn, where you can take boat to Genoa
                        and thence to the Riviera or Milan and The Lakes.</p>

                        and shipping point of the Littoral, besides being the junction for the
                        arrival and departure for all the principal cities of Europe, the Orient,
                        and the United States, the Hamburg American, and North-German-Lloyd steamers
                        from New York, and the Continent of Europe en route to China and Japan, stop
                        at Genoa. The trains-de-luxe, and regular express trains from Paris and
                        other large Continental cities make connections at Genoa en route to the
                        Italian and French Rivieras, so that travellers to Rome, Naples, Alassio,
                        San Remo, Nice. Mentone, Monte Carlo, etc., can arrange to spend a few davs
                        in Genoa at one of its fine modern hotels. Genoa is built on steep hills
                        rising abruptly from the Mediterranean, and the gorgeous panoramic views
                        afforded from almost any terrace, street or building, must be seen to be
                        appreciated Electric trams traverse every part, and tend to add the
                        combination of the modern with all that is most ancient and in-teresting to
                        the American tourist, who is doubly interested in seeing the birthplace of
                        Christopher Columbus, the discoverer of America.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before: making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of of the Bible. The public gardens and the
                        monumental cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hour journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most,
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is un-like that of any other seaport.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>From Venice you can go to Bologna via Padua; and then to Ravenna, one of the
                        most ancient towns in Italy. Between Bologna and Milan and only an
                        hour-and-a-half from Milan is SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on
                        account of its thermal springs, change trains at Borgo San-Donino, and in
                        half-an-hour you are at Salsomaggiore.</p>
                    <p>TYROL, INNSBRUCK, one of the finest and prettiest towns in the German
                        Austrian Mountains, is 600 metres above sea level, and has many interesting
                        features, both ancient and modern. It is admirably suited for spring and
                        summer residence, and is a good centre for excursions in the summer months.
                        There are three good railway services, via. Germany, Switzerland and Italy.
                        Electric tramcars run constantly to many places of local interest. The
                        Hotels are good, as also several Pensions, all being equipped with modern
                        requirements. Full particulars and information can be obtained from any of
                        Cook's offices.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                        lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza; also by tramway in two-and-a-half hours. The
                        cathedral, entirely of marble, is one of the finest in N. Italy—1426-1526
                        a.d.</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo, Caddenubbia,
                        and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellagio opposite. These
                        four latter towns are in about the centre of the lake, and very close
                        together, and the walk from. Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to
                        Menaggio is most enjoyable. A steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on
                        Lake Lugano in three-quarters of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in
                        two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>
                    <p>Lake Maggiore is 37 miles long and varies in width from one-and-a-half miles
                        to three miles, and though the banks are not generally so mountainous as
                        those of the Lake of Como, the scenery is pretty and there are many
                        in-teresting spots-at which to stay.</p>
                    <p>Pallanza, opposite the Borromean Isles, is well situated for a fine view over
                        the Lake and the Alps. It is an interesting town and a good centre for
                        making a tour round the Lake. Steamers are very frequent to all other towns
                        up or down the Lake. Taking the steamer from Pallanza for Stresa, you call
                        at Baveno, a pretty little spot where Queen Victoria stayed in 1879. Then
                        you come to the most charming feature of this part of the Lake, the
                        Borromean Islands. Isola Superiore is only a fishing hamlet, but Isola Bella
                        is a picture. The castle was built in the 17th century and is worth visiting
                        as well as the grounds. Stresa, the next stopping place by the steamer, is
                        cooler and has a better air than places on the opposite side of the Lake, so
                        that for the summer months it is a more preferable spot at which to
                        stay.</p>

                    <head>Route III. Switzerland</head>
                    <p>Switzerland, the heart of Europe, has been described as "A cluster of
                        delights and granduers." The country has an area of only 15,720 square
                        miles, and borders on France, Germany, Austria and Italy. It also has the
                        proud distinction of being the source of three of Europe's biggest waterways
                        - the rivers Rhine, Danube and Rhone. Mountains and lakes occupy almost the
                        whole of Switzerland, there being practically no flat land or plains. The
                        mountains or Alps are divided into three groups, the Pennine Alps, Helvetic
                        Alps, and the Rhoetic Alps. The principal lakes are Constance, Geneva,
                        Zurich, Lucerne and Neuchatel, then the lakes of Bienne, Thun, Brienz and
                        Zug. The glaciers of Switzerland occupy about one-eighteenth of the space,
                        and are about 400 in number, the principal of which is the Aletsch Glacier.
                        There are also waterfalls of importance, such as the Rhine at Schaffhausen,
                        the Aar at Handeck, Staubbach and Pletschbach at Lauterbrunnen, etc.,
                        etc.</p>
                    <p>Certain points are renowned for the view and may be selected as follows: -
                        Col de la Faucille, near M. Reculets and M. Dole, above St. Cergue near
                        Geneva, Chaumont above Neuchatel, Macolin above Bienne, the Hauen-steing
                        above Olten, Albis between Zurich and Zug, Rigi between Zug and Lucerne,
                        etc.</p>
                    <p>It depends very much on the point at which Switzerland is first entered which
                        is to be the first stopping place; also whether the tour is on bicycle or
                        foot, as naturally the cyclist wishes to be ever going from place to place
                        and never turning back along the same road. But as centres for seeing the
                        beauties and charms of each certain district the following may be helpful to
                        visitors:- LAUSANNE as centre for Montreux, Vevey, Neuchatel, St. Maurice,
                        Martigny, Aigle, Bex. etc. INTERLAKEN for the Bernese Oberland, Grindelwald,
                        Murren, Lake Brienz, Thun, etc. CHUR for the Engadine, St. Mortiz, Davos
                        Platz, Pontresina, Klosters, Ragatz, etc. ZURICH, Dolder, Schaffhausen.</p>
                    <p>LUGANO is some 20 miles from Como and reached by train in one-and-a-half
                        hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated on
                        the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San
                        Salvatore, M, de Caprino and M. Generoso.</p>
                    <p>The Piazza Giardino, with its promenade and fountains, is close to the
                        landing stage. A broad quay, the favorite promenade, extends the whole
                        length of the town along the shores of the lake. In the Santa Maria degli
                        Angiolo is a fresco of the Passion, the finest work of Bernardino Luini
                        (1529). There are many interesting excursions to be made into the
                        surrounding neighbourhood. MONTE GENEROSO, about 5,600 feet, is reached by
                        taking steamer or train from Lugano to Capolago, then the mountain railway,
                        which runs to the summit. The view is magnificent, being one of the finest
                        in the Lombard Alps. Monte Salvatore is ascended by railway from Lugano
                        Paradiso.</p>
                    <p>LOCARNO may be reached by rail from Bel-inzona in forty minutes. This pretty
                        town situated at the top of Lake Maggiore, has a mild climate, and is an
                        excellent winter resort. The church Madonna de Sasso, situated above the
                        town is worth a visit, as it contains interst-ing paintings, "Entombment,"
                        by Ciseri, and "The Flight into Egypt," by Bramantion.</p>
                    <p>LUCERNE. - A striking picture on the Lake of Lucerne is surrounded by walls
                        with nine watch towers facing the Rigi and Pilatus and the snow-clad Alps.
                        Seven bridges cross the Reuss, but the two old ones, the Kapell Brucke and
                        Muhlen Brucke are of interest. Both have roofs, the former painted with
                        scenes from the letter with a Dance of Death. The old water tower near the
                        Kapell Brucke used to be a lighthouse or "Lucerna," giving its name to the
                        town. In and around the town the walks are charming, and the excursions to
                        be made from Lucerne by boat, rail, etc., are very numerous. Places of
                        interest in the town are the Hof Kirche, dating from the 16th Century, the
                        Lion of Lucerne Monument, near which is also an interesting garden,
                        containing signs of glacier-worn rocks of a remote ice period. In the
                        Bathaus is a Museum (War and Peace Museum) should also be visited.</p>
                    <p>The Lake of Lucerne abounds in delightful excursions, those to the Rigi,
                        Pilatus, Burgent stock and Sonnenberg, needing a special visit each. Other
                        excursions on the lake can be made by steamer, and the ever-changing scenery
                        on the trip from Lucerne to Fluelen is a source of delight to the lover of
                        nature.</p>
                    <p>The Rigi is a famous ridge between the Lakes Lucerne and Zug. The view is
                        unsur-passed for extent and magnificence, including the view of 13 lakes,
                        the Oberland, and many of the distant Alps. The sunset view is much finer
                        than sunrise, and is best seen from the Roth-stock. Sunrise from Kulum.</p>
                    <p>BRUNNEN, charmingly situated on the most beautiful part of the Lake of
                        Lucerne, commands magnificent views of the lake and mountain scenery. Along
                        the Lake of Uri from Brunnen to Fluelen runs the famous Axenstrasse.</p>
                    <p>SEELISBERG is on the opposite shore to Brunnen, and with the Sanitorium of
                        Sonnen-berg forms one of the famous health resorts of the Lake of
                        Lucerne</p>
                    <p>THE BURGENSTOCK may be reached in two ways; either by steamer from Lucerne to
                        Kehrsiten, then the cable railway to the crest of Burgenstock; or the other
                        way is to go to Stannstad by boat, and then drive up the fine new road. From
                        Stannstad it is about 1 hour 40 minutes by electric railway to ENGLEBERG.
                        The ascent of Titlis is made from here, and the panoramic view of the Alps
                        is grand, extending from Monte Rosa to the Black Forest, and from the Santis
                        to the Matterhorn.</p>
                    <p>ZURICH, capital of Canton Zurich, is beautifully situated in a mountain
                        valley 1,300 ft above the sea. As a commercial tewn t is perhaps the most
                        important in Switzer-land, having extensive manufactures in silk, cotton,
                        and machinery. The old town is still picturesque, but is gradually being
                        replaced by modern private dwellings and public buildings, amongst which is
                        the Federal Polytechnic School and University. An interesting excur-sion is
                        that to the Zurichberg 2,000 ft. above the sea, from which a fine sunset
                        view can be obtained. Another favourite place is the Uttli-berg, about 6
                        miles south-west of Zurich.</p>

                        its strong saline waters and grape cures). Near Bex is Les Plans for
                        climatic cure, 3,600 ft., and a centre for mountain excursions.</p>
                    <p>Martigny is the starting place for the Tete Noir and Col-de-Balme routes to
                        Chamonix, one of the most popular Alpine resorts, on account of being within
                        easy reach of the famous Mer-de-Glace Clacier des Bossons. The ascent of

                        made. The view of the snow-covered Alps and glaciers obtained from the
                        railway to Gornergrat is really magnificent.</p>
                    <p>Eggshorn is a high mountain resort on the Brigue-Rhone Glacier road, whence
                        the ascent of the Jungfrau is made quite easily. There are also numerous

                    <head>Route IV. Greece and the Ionian Isles. Constantinople</head>
                    <p>Many people visit Greece after wintering in Egypt, as it is so easily reached
                        from Alex-andria; the climate in April is charming. Steamers run frequently
                        both to Putras, and the Piraeus - which is the port for Athens. The
                        advantage of disembarking at the latter place is that it is but five miles
                        from Athens, which may be reached in twenty minutes by train; while the
                        railway journey from Patras takes about 7 1/2 hours. The best steamers are
                        those of the Khedival Mail Co. Greece is also very easily reached from
                        either Smyrna or Constan-tinople; and there are frequent sailings by
                        excellent steamers.</p>
                    <p>The first and most important sit to visit in ATHENS is, of course, the
                        Acropolis - a rocky platform upon which were built some of the most famous
                        buildings of classic times. Ascend-ing the great staircase, 70 ft. wide, and
                        passing throuhg the Gateway built of marble from Pentelicus the Parthenon is
                        reached - dedicated to Pa'las Athene by Pericles cir. 444 B.C., and adorned
                        with priceless sculptures, many of which are now in the British Museum.
                        There is the Erechtheion with its celebrated Caryatides; the Theseion and
                        the beautiful little Temple of the Wingless Vistory. Close to the Acropolis
                        lies Mars Hill, celebrated as the site where St. Paul preached to the
                        Athenians, and where the Athenians held their public cCourt. On the Pnyx
                        immediatley behind they assembled their meetings. On the south and
                        south-east sides of the Acropolis are the beautiful columns of the Temple of
                        Jupiter Olympus and the triumphal arch of Hadrian, the Temple of Aesculapius
                        and the two ancient theatres - the Odeum, and the Theatre of Dionysus which
                        is well preserved. These are but a few of the interesting buildings of
                        ancient Athens.</p>
                    <p>If possible tourists should arrange to be in Athens for the Orthodox Easter
                        in order to witness the Good Friday and Easter Eve ceremonies, and to be
                        present at the dancing on the Easter Tuesday festival held at Megara, for
                        which a special train is run from Athens.</p>
                    <p>A charming trip can be made to Corinth by train (3 hours) through lovely
                        scenery, and on to Mycenae, where can be seen the celebrated Tomb of Atreus
                        and the Gate of Lions at the entrnce to Agamemmnons's Palace. From here it
                        is quite possible to drive via Argos to Nauplia in the day. This is an
                        interesting town, and the surrounding scenery is lovely. A pleasant
                        afternoon's drive can be made to Tiryns with its Cyclopoean masonry, and to
                        Argos with fine amphitheatre cut in the natural rock, and Acropolis 1,000
                        ft. above sea level. Epidaurus with its Temple of Aesculapius and very
                        perfect amphitheatre is well worth the day's driving excursion. From Nauplia
                        you can get to Olympia by rail via Pyrgos - the scenery is most picturesque.
                        It is here that the celebrated Olympic games were help from B.C. 776 to A.D.
                        394 - the stadium is very perfect. The ruins of the Temple of Jupiter are
                        quite splendid. The famous statue of Hermes is here. Patras is reached from
                        Pyrgos by rail in ofur hours, from which port steamers to all parts of
                        Europe run frequently. A charming trip can be made among the Ionian islands,
                        Zanta, Cephalonia, etc. It is worth while to spend a few days in CORFU on
                        account of the beauty of the scenery. There is also good snipe and quail
                        shooting to be had.</p>
                    <p>You will get at Alexandria vessels belonging to different lines that will
                        take you by various routes to Constantinople. The Khedivial stea-mers go by
                        Piraeus for visiting Athens.</p>
                    <p>It is a great advantage to see Constantinople for the first time from the
                        sea, the view of the city fom the Golden Horn being magnificent</p>
                    <p>The chief things to see in Constantinople are the Mosque of San Sophia, the
                        Golden Horn and the Valley of Sweet Waters.</p>
                    <p>Smyrna is a thriving commercial port, at which many steamers call. Many
                        charming excursions can be made from it; to the Cyclo-poean Cities of
                        Nymphaeum and Sipylus and the rock-cut City of Niobe near Magnesia; the
                        Baths of Diana and Agamemnon; and the Meles Valley, where may be seen the
                        Chair and Cave of Homer and a fire double-arched acqueduct.</p>
                    <p>there is a railway to Ephesus where there is a good Hotel and Restaurant kept
                        by an Englishman. The ruins of the Great Temple of Diana are about
                        three-quarters of a mile distant. Of the "Seven churches of Asia." five are
                        ac-cessible by tain from Smyrna. Laodicea can be reached from Alascheir
                        which is 50 miles distant by rail and is the site of Philadelphus.</p>
                    <p>This is a beautiful old City at the foot of Mt. Tmolus; it was built in B.C.
                        160 by Attalus Philadelphus, last King of Pergamos.</p>

                    <head>Palestine and Syria</head>
                    <p>The nearest port from Egypt in Jaffa, the ancient Joppa. You can take steamer
                        from Alexandria or Port Said to Jaffa or any of the Syrian ports. Probably
                        the largest steamers on route are those of the Messageries Maritimes. There
                        are Austrian Lloyd, and Khedivial steamers, and also occasional Moss, and
                        Price line steamers. You must on no account forget to obtain a special
                        passport for Palestine before leaving Egypt, or you will find much
                        difficulty at the ports.</p>
                    <p>The landing at Jaffa is most exciting. As there is no harbour, the steamer
                        drops anchor as near as she safely can to the shore, and large row boats
                        come out to take off the passengers. A great reef through which there is
                        only one small opening protects the coast, and the interesting moment is the
                        passing through this opening in the row boat. There is not much to detain
                        you at Jaffa, though there are two excellent hotels outside the town. There
                        is a railway to Jerusalem, also an excellent carriage road, the drive
                        occupying about eight hours.</p>
                    <p>The trip from Jerusalem to Jericho can be made by carriage or by riding. The
                        drive is very fine, the views of the steep ravine of the Wady Kelt (the Book
                        Cherith) with the monastery clinging to its side, and of the Dead Sea and
                        Jordan Valley being very fine.</p>
                    <p>Fom Jerusalem to Damascus by land, is a camping tour of about a fortnight.
                        The route is by Nablous - the ancient Samaritan Shechem - Jenin, Haifa,
                        (Mount Carmel), Nazareth, Tiberias, Tell Hum (Capernaum), Safed and Banias
                        (Caesarea Philippi). There are other camping expeditions possible from
                        Jerusalem, as, from Jerusalem via Nazareth and Haifa, Tyre and Sidon to
                        Beyrout, whence there is a rail to Damascus.</p>
