                    <head>THE ASSOUAN CATARCT.</head>
                    <p>There is no doubt that Egypt is to many people an attractive country. We have
                        all. heard of the proverbial wish of those who have once drunk the water of
                        the Nile, to return again. That was, we think, intended only to refer to the
                        stranger who had left the country, but at the present moment it is receiving
                        a new application, as interpreted by the inhabitants of Cairo, who in a most
                        unmistakable way are expressing their wish to be again allowed to drink of
                        the water of their beloved river; they do not seem to be convinced even
                        where this is made an international question, and representatives of the
                        most <cb n="6"/> civilised nations in the world tell them that underground
                        water is good enough for them.</p>
                    <p>We have been told on high authority that Egypt is the gift of the Nile" and
                        there is no doubt that the river is the primary object of interest in the
                        country, and that part of it which centres round the Assouan Cataract is the
                        most interesting part of the river. The latest publication of the survey
                        Department is entitled A Description of the first or Assouan Cataract of the
                        Nile, by Mr. Job Ball P.D., B. Sc., P.G.S. (Price P.T. 20) and it should
                        find many readers, for there are few subjects better worth treating of in
                        Egypt than this</p>
                    <p>The author mentions by Dame sixty writers, from the prophet Ezekiel down to
                        this 20th century, who have contributed to the literature of the First
                        Cataract, but we venture to say that none of them have described it 80
                        accurately or with such a wealth of detail in plans and sections as we find
                        in the subject of this notice. To those who have already visited Assouan it
                        will probably give much information they did not possess before nad, to
                        those about to visit it, we strongly recommend the book.</p>
                    <p>The author devotes a good part of the first two pages of his book to proving
                        that the name "Cataract" as applied to Assouan, and consequently the title
                        of his book, are misnomers, and where he tells us that the total fall of
                        water surface is only about five metres, and that that is spread over a
                        length of 9 kilometres, we think he has fairly well proved that it should
                        not have been called a cataract, but a rapid or rapids. We think that many a
                        traveller well versed in the lore of Herodotus, Strabo, Plinyete , visiting
                        Assouan for the first time, must have found that it did not quite come up to
                        his expectations. Many an ancient historian, in addition to being a keen
                        observer had also a vivid imagination. On the other hand the author justly
                        remarks that in ancient times the fall at Assouan was considerably greater
                        than at present, and from what we have seen of the erosive effect of the
                        water on the rocks forming the apron below the new dam, we think he is quite
                        right on this point.</p>
                    <p>Within the area to which the book refers, which is well illustrated by the
                        excellent maps and sections attached to it, the two objects of principal
                        interest are the temples of Philæ and the new dam. Many of our readers will
                        still remember the impassioned discussion with reference to Phile some 12 or
                        14 years ago, where the construction of the new dam was decided on, and what
                        vials of Egyptological wrath were poured out on the high officials of the
                        Egyptian Government, who madfully though reluctantly did their duty by
                        placing the dam where it now is.</p>
                    <p>The author has exceptional opportunity of telling us something interesting
                        about this, as be was in charge of the very considerable work required for
                        strengthening or under-pinning the foundations of the temples of Philawhich
                        we believe be did in a very substantial way, and the Egyptian Government
                        must have spent a very large amount of money in effect ing this useful
                        purpose. The author says "the temples are now secure against subsidence, and
                        the only effect of the annual flooding is to render them inaccessible except
                        by boat for a few months of the year." We imagine that this passage was
                        written before it was decided to increase the height of the dam, and that,
                        however, much the temples may be secure against subsidence, their
                        superstructures will now be much more liable to be damaged by immersion,
                        when the dam is raised to its full height.</p>
                    <p>For the last few years the question of the probability of a high or a low
                        Nile bas ceased to be of that absorbing and vital interest in this country
                        which it formerly was, bet to those who can remember the disastrous effects
                        of the Nile floods of 1874 and 1878, and who witnessed the brink of
                        starvation to which hundreds of thousands of the people were brought by the
                        low Nile of 1877, will never forget the boon conferred on this country, by
                        the improved regulation of the Nile, of which the Assouan dam is one of the
                        most prominent features</p>

                        about 230 B.C. in his famous attempt to determine the size of the earth, by
                        experiments made simultaneously at Assouan and Alexandria Although bis
                        experiments were based on data which would in modern times be only
                        considered as a very rough approximation, it is extraordinary that the
                        result obtained was surprisingly near the truth, and the determination was
                        justly regarded great achievement for the times in which it was made.</p>
                    <p>It is interesting to us, citizens of Alexandria to know that our town was in
                        this us in many other ways intimately connected with the dawn of scientific
                        experiment, and we hope reflection on such things may stimulate those among
                        us who have the power to beautify our city and to make it in every way

                            a large number of American tourists for Egypt. The "Cedric" will
                            continue to be engaged in the New York Mediterranean service during the
                            early months of 1908. It is not her first entry into the waters of the
                            great inland sea, as last winter this favourite steamer won such support
                            from the best class of American travellers that the White Star Line
                            decided to employ her again in the service. It is of interest to note
                            that the "Cedric" which is of 21,000 tons, is the largest craft ever
                            seen in the Mediterranean.</p>

                            the London "Tribune" says :- Encouraged by the Socialist party, 30,000
                            families, residing in the slum districts have refused to pay their fents
                            according to the present scale. It is contended that the exigencies of
                            the industrial conditions necessitate a 20 to 30 per cent. reduction in
                            rentals. The trouble has arisen out of the custom of property owners to
                            sublet the tenements to men who compel the tenants to pay exorbitant
                            rents.</p>

                        off most successfully, one of the items on the entertainment list being a

                        the former eventually succeeding in drawing their adversaries over the line.
                        The rest of the afternoon was devoted to athletic sports for the children,
                        who entered into various competitions with much enthusism, the prizes being
                        afterwards distributed by Mrs. Trevethick. Tea was served at 5.30 after

                        departed, everyone having enjoyed themselves thoroughly. Sergt. Maj. Jones

                        <p>Some interesting cases have come before the Cairo courts this week. On
                            Tuesdaythe case of certain land at Luxor was dealt with by the
                            MixedCourt, M Vasquez presiding. Me Ayrout on behalf of the Plaintiffs
                            claimed ownership of the 30 feddans in question as having been
                            transferred to his client by the Daïra Sanieh Company. This claim Me
                            Cardemenas strenerously resisted and in a vigorous speech declared his
                            learned friend's olient and those in possession of the village and
                            houses to be merely tenants, instancing contracts in which their names
                            appeared in that capacity. Correspondence extending from the years 1897
                            and 8 shewed that the inhabitants had frequently asked for fresh leases
                            to be granted to them. The Daira he maintained has had these letters
                            numbered and catalogued; they cannot be false. Certificates shewing
                            payment of land-tax were produced in support-documents sanc tioned both
                            by the Mudirieb and the Daira. Up to 1904 these taxes had been paid by
                            the latter, and since then the claimants had borne them. El Sayed, a
                            villager, was one of those who had already claimed ownership, and the
                            Court had disallowed the claim. "You", said counsel, "must prove your
                            claim to all the land, or it is useless." Me. Loutfi Ayrout replied,
                            prefacing his remarks with a complaint that all the documents had not
                            been communicated to him by his opponents. The Daira, and its successors
                            he continued, had held the land some 15 years and could claim by a
                            prescriptive right. His friend's clients have never had possession. As
                            to the expelled tenants who claimed to be owners; could not the judicial
                            authority and the Luxor policy be invoked against his own client with
                            equal facility! He supported his argaments by appeals to a certificate
                            of 1904, and to an official extract made by the Mudirieh showing that
                            some 800,000 feddans including those in dispute were untaxed. A sale of
                            land worth P.T. 50 to one of his friend's clients for P.T. 5 seemed to
                            shew complicity between the Daira and the purchaser, if indeed it were a
                            genuine sale. In conclusion, Me. Ayrout asked the Tribunal for an
                            inquiry by an expert on the spot, mentioning that another case dealing
                            with the same matter was being pleaded before Ahmed Bey Loutfi, and
                            judgment had been deferred pending the decision of the Mixed Tribunal.
                            The Court adjourned the further hearing till January 9. Another land
                            dispute, Ahmed Hussein (Me. Sapriel) against D. Curiel (Me. Nahmias) was
                            alse adjourned.</p>

                        <head>WAKF CASES.<lb/>GARABEDIAN. ZENAB HANEM WIFE OF MOHAMED RAMSI.</head>
                        <p>Me Pezzi, who opened for the Plaintiff in this matter, said that his
                            client, tenant of some property comprised in the Wakf of Gohar had had
                            his building thereon demolished by the Wakf authorities, but owing to a
                            mistake by the valuer his holding was incorrectly measur ed and he had
                            consequently lost about half the land due to him in the subsequent
                            apportionment. The expert, it seemed, had relied on a plan made in a
                            former case where the same parcels were included and had shewn the
                            Plaintiff's land as having an area of 13 feddans; on measurement however
                            it turned out to be 24 feddans. Plaintiff now claimed to be granted
                            costs of the former action dealing with this land, and asked that a new
                            survey should be made. Counsel added that his client's title had already
                            been recognised, in one instance, by the Defendant.</p>
                        <p>Me Sednaoui opposed the application on behalf of Mme Zenab. His friend's
                            client had no title to the land. In 1900, Garabedian had levelled the
                            boundary wall of his property and had built another, taking in more
                            land. The expert appointed to survey and value the, Wakf land succeeded
                            in tracing the old wall and Plaintiff was accordingly directed to cede
                            the land encroached upon and put the Defendant in possession. The sale
                            to the Plaintiff of this so-called terre vagné should never have been
                            permitted; let him show a grant from Ahmed Gohar the formed Nazir of the
                            Wakf Counsel concluded by assenting to the appointment of a surveyor and
                            the case was directed to stand over till January.</p>
                        <p>Me Lakah appeared for the Plaitiffs in a new action.</p>

                        <head>G. ZERVUDACHI &amp; SON V. THE WAKF ADMINISTRATION.</head>
                        <p>This was a dispute relating to the Wakf of Said Pasha, of which the
                            Administration Général des Wakfs" was Nazir. In 1904, said counsel, the
                            present Defendant, sold M. M. Zervudachi some 112 feddans near the Pont
                            des Anglais, the purchased price being paid partly in land and partly in
                            cash. On, a deficiency being discovered by the Plantiffs, in the land
                            given them in exchange, they applied to the Wakfs to rectify the mistake
                            and were met by a refusal. On writing a second time they received no
                            reply: and hence this action was brought to obtain a me asurement of the
                            land.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Manci, replying for Administration Général, objected to the Plantiffs
                            having delayed action; moreover the exchange had been made en blook and
                            therefore by Moslem law no objection could now be raised. The Wakf
                            Council had attached certain conditions to the transaction, which
                            included a stipulation that no valuation should be given or required,
                            and these conditions had been accepted by the purchasers. The Codes were
                            relied on as shewing that in such a case as the present one no demand
                            for cancellation of the contract or for making up the deficiency was
                            admissible. To the latter argument Mr. Lakah urged that the Egyptian
                            code while forbidding a demand for cancellation in such cases was silent
                            with respect to the making up of defici <cb n="4"/> encies, Time did not
                            run against the Plaintiff, said counsel, for the Wakf Administration's
                            letter of 30 May 1905 had done away with one prescriptive period and
                            begun another case adjourned to January 21.</p>
                        <p>The case of Caloyanni v. Mazloum was directed to be struck out of the
                            list. This case had been pending sioce 1904. The action brought by Abdel
                            Malek Abdel Noor against Hermann Singer was adjourned for an expert
                            valner to be appointed.</p>
                        <p>The action De Martino v. Coronel and others, relating to the sale of the
                            Maison Coronel at Cairo to one Tarbet was brought (explained Mr. Pezzi)
                            to determine the position of a tenant of part of the building. It was
                            claimed on behalf of other interested members of the Coronel family that
                            the Tribunal had no jurisdiction, the amount in dispute be ing over
                            £100, and Articles 26 et segg of the Code of Procedure being relied
                            upon. The lease had been granted for 8 years from June 1, 1905; the
                            tenant M. Jombroff objected to the new conditions demanded by the
                            purchaser as the price of its renewal in 1906; and the Tribunal had
                            upheld the objection.</p>
                        <p>On the case of Simon and Benjamin Arbib v. the Egyptian Government, being
                            called, the Plaintiffs' Counsel, Mr. Chalom, mentioned that the
                            first-named had died since the beginning of the action, and the case was
                            adjourned till February 25 by the President, (M Vasquez), to allow the
                            heirs to be made parties.</p>

                    <head>AL HAYAT</head>
                    <p>By the middle of January it is hoped that the great new wing to Al Hayat will
                        be finished and furnished, and the hotel will be the larger by some hundred
                        rooms. The foundations were scarcely begun last April, and the new block of
                        buildings has risen rapidly since then and now entirely dominates the
                        original pile, from the rocky spur on which it stands. Like the remainder of
                        the building, this new portion has been planned so that the rooms shall reap
                        the benefit to the utmost of the health giving sun; and throughly nearly
                        every window its course can be traced from East to West. This shaped wing
                        lies on the eastern side of the original house and leads from off the end of
                        the wide terrace which has become so popular a corner. Halls and reception
                        rooms are at its entrance; with a fine billiard room and a finer concert)
                        hall, which latter will be requisitioned also for dancing purposes; for the
                        management has every intention of providing full entertainment for its
                        coming guests. There is to be also a bar in the same neighbourhood; a bar
                        elegantly panelled, roofed and decorated with green wood almost too
                        beautiful for its purpose. From these reception rooms one faces through long
                        wide verandahs, from which access is gained to many fine suites of rooms
                        complete in themselves and furnished with every accessory to comfort. These
                        contain fine sitting rooms with two or more bedrooms of different size and
                        bathroom etc. Every room. bath room and passage is furnished with heating
                        apparatus; double doors exclude light and noise, and the most perfected form
                        of wooden blinds shut out the sun when neces sary. All these suites, like
                        the single rooms, will be furnished with everything that can add to the
                        convenience of the guests roomy wardrobes and chests of drawers, long easy
                        chairs whereon to laze the hours away, and comfortable beds and carpets, and
                        nothing anywhere to catch the dust. From the many verandahs most gorgeous
                        views can be obtained of the desert which stretches from the garden walls
                        tar away into the distance; and over towards and beyond the Nile to the long
                        chain of pyramids which break the view from Gizeh to far Dashoor.</p>
                    <p>When the new building is complete the garden will be extended beneath it; and
                        the little valley where once stood the sun baths will be transformed into a
                        flowering oasis. Fresh sun baths will doubtless then be situated on the roof
                        which will make a magnificent position for them.</p>
                    <p>On the further side of the road to the North of the Hotel another garden will
                        shortly be planted out surrounding the German Protestant Church which is now
                        in process of erection. The land on which it stands is the gift of the hotel
                        management and the cost of its erection has been detrayed to a great extent
                        by the contributions of the visitors. Within the walls of the same garden is
                        a small mecanotherapic institute under the charge of Dr. Preminger of
                        Marienbad. Here electric lights baths will be administered with all the
                        latest forms of massage and gymnastics which will be open to the use of the
                        public as well as the visitors to the Hotel.</p>
                    <p>Al Hayat was practically full all last season; at the present moment it has
                        its fair complement of visitors. Every day is adding to its popularity; and
                        when the new building is open to the public, it will certainly take its
                        place among the most complete and comfortable hotels in the country.</p>

                    <p>The début of the Alexandria and Ramleh Amateur Musical and Dramatic Society
                        has been brilliant. The inaugural concert, which was held last night in the
                        large and handsomely decorated dining room of the Savoy Palace Hotel, was an
                        enormous success. H.E. Mustapha Pasha Ibadi, Governor of Alexandria,
                        honoured the Society with his presence, as did also H.B.M.'s Consul General
                        Gould, 1.8.0., who was there with Mrs. Gould, and Mr. H. Barker, Norwegian
                        Consul. The luxurious winter-garden of the hotel made a splendid background
                        to the concert room and, in congratulating the management and staff of the "
                        Savoy Palace upon the perfection of the ap pearance and comfort of the room,
                        we must not overlook the fact that it was only after dinner had been served
                        to the guests of the hotel that their arrangements could be carried out. In
                        the winter-garden, too, Mr. George Brey, the manager, had made excellent
                        arrangements for service from a liberally-stocked buffet, and many of the
                        overflowing audience remained after the concert to discuss the evening's
                        entertainment over the good fare offered them. In preface, suffice it to say
                        that the attendance outnumbered 200 residents of Alexandria and Ramleh, that
                        no element of the Society of Alexandria and its suburb was: lacking, and,
                        what is after all the main point, the praise bestowed was both universal and
                        thoroughly deserved. We feel assured that the Society will maintain the
                        standard of success which it reached last night, and will fulfil its "raison
                        d'être a most worthy object, the promotion of amateur musical and dramatic
                        talent in the interests of charity and in the hope of drawing closer
                        together the many social elements which must exist in the most cosmopolitan
                        country of the world.</p>
                    <p>To turn to the programme itself. It was a programme quite deserving of the
                        name the Society has adopted-it was artistically musical and equalled any
                        amateur concert we have been privileged to attend. Its compilation offered a
                        talent which any society might be proud of, whatever its age, and as yet the
                        Alexandria and Ramleh Amateur Musical and Dramatic Society has only known
                        the light of day since December 9, 1907.</p>
                    <p>The programme commenced informally with an overture by Mr. Haydn Righton, who
                        was, at once recognised by the audience as a great acquisition to the
                        musical world of Alexandria. Mr. Righton was, moreover, indefatigable in the
                        execution of the arduous duties he had assumed at the piano, and most
                        successful. In his accompaniments he was always in sympathy with the
                        vocalist, and as a soloist he showed. great merit. In part I he played
                        Chopin's "Nocturne" in G. major with great feeling and, in the second part
                        he gave us a very well compiled variation, of which he was himself the
                        composer, of Round's fine old song "Home Sweet Home."</p>
                    <p>The official programme, as we might style it, was opened by Mr. G. Ferguson,
                        baritone with mellow voice, who sang in splendid style Stephen Adams'
                        "Nirvana," and in the second part he gave us the old favourite "Beduoin Love
                        Song. "Miss B. Murphy's song "Berceuse de Jocelyn" with violin obligato by
                        Miss K. Murphy was very warmly applauded, and in the second part Miss K.
                        Murphy played as a violin solo Raff's "Cavatina," giving a most sympathetic
                        rendering Miss B. Murphy's song was followed by a trombone rendering of
                        "Home Sweet Home" by Band Sergeant Hopkins (2nd R. Innis. Fus.) The trombone
                        is generally considered as the most difficult of all wind instruments to
                        play, but Band Sergeant Hopkins is a thorough master of it and his ex cution
                        pleased all. Mr. Watson Ramsey's wellknown band also provided us with
                        another item-Daddy" sung by Boy Radcliffe. His voice is clear and pure, his
                        enunciation excellent, every word being brought out in its entirety, and
                        young as he is, he does not he sitate to express the meaning of the words He
                        sings from his heart and we were glad to see that as the lad left the hall,
                        there were those who stopped him to shake his hand in Congratulation.</p>
                    <p>Mr W. F. Sarjeant's rendering of her sister in-law's, (Mrs. M. E. Dandridge)
                        song" The Last was loudly encored and in response to the en thusiastic
                        demand she gave us "If no one ever marries me", a song of lighter character,
                        but full of charm. In the second part Mrs. Sarjeant sang "May-Day" and gave
                        us a delightful rendering of Goddard's beautiful composition. The first part
                        of the programme was concluded by two short songs sung by Mrs. E. G. C.
                        Moss, who has a charming voice and interpreted her songs with great
                        sympathy; the first was "Rose in the Bud" by Dorothy Forster and the second
                        "I Hid my Love" by Guy d'Harde lot and these evoked a great demand for an
                        encore. In the second half Mrs. Moss gave us "Mignon" and in response to the
                        shower of applause which greeted its conclusion she sang "Le Chanson de
                        Florian".</p>
                    <p>An item which met with very hearty appre ciation was the artistic rendering
                        of the romance "Sei vendicata" from Meyerbeer's opera "Dianora," by Mr. D.
                        Lambridis. He possesses a fine voice of good timbre, which shou ld prove a
                        great acquisition to the Society At the conclusion of the concert Mr. E. B.
                        Gould in a short speech expressed the pleasure with which the audience had
                        attended the inaugural concert of the Society and congra tulated the
                        performers and the committee on the brilliant success which they had
                        attained. The evening was then conoluded with the Khedivial Anthem and "God
                        Save the King. Many thanksare due to Mrs. Otway Smithers, Mrs. Wats n
                        Ramsey, Mr. Papasian and Mr. Gerald Thompson for the most able way in which
                        they accompanied those who took part. An excellent Steinway grand piano was
                        provided by Messrs. Hugo Hackh and many remarks were passed on the purity of
                        its tone,</p>

                        the Ambassadorship at Saint-Petersburg, first came to the front as an able
                        diplomatist when he held the port of Diplomatic Agent and Consul General on
                        three occasions in 1878 and 1879 during the excit ing period of Ismail's
                        abdication In that crisis he convinced his official súperiors of his fitness
                        for higher and more independent spheres of action. Accordingly he was sent
                        to Bulgaria in November, 1879, and displayed in that difficult position so
                        much ability and discretion that in 886 he was made a K. C. M G., and on
                        Jan.1, 887, was appointed to the vacant post of Envoy Extraordinary and
                        Minister Plenipotentiary at Bucharest. From thence in July, 1891, he was
                        transferred to the Court of Teheran, succeding Sir Henry Drummond Wolf there
                        as Minister Plenipotentiary. His activity and vigilance in Persia caused him
                        to be so much appreciated by the Foreign Office that they appointed him to
                        one of the most important posts in the Diplomatie Service. He was made
                        Ambassador to St. Petersburg at the close of 1893, in succession to the late
                        Sir Robert Morier..</p>

                    <p>The morning was cold and the sky threatening, but the afternoon turned out
                        fine and still The gate was not quite as large as on New Year's day but
                        nevertheless there was a considerable gathering of spectators. In the first
                        race Abou Nadara won easily with Digby up. The second race was rather tame,
                        Mr. Goodchild firstly mistaking the course and then his horse Petrone came
                        down at the jump. Hector who was rather over-weighted would not try, and
                        Chater won as he liked The Jubilee Stakes, the big event of the day, was
                        third on the programme. Much excitement prevailed as it was a very open
                        question which horse would win. Patsy (late Dnsk) was made favourite at the
                        lotteries and was bought in by his owner. The stable was very confident that
                        he would win. Cameleon also sold well at the lotteries and was fancied for a
                        win by many. Rainbow, Radium, Mystere, and Nadeem also had their
                        backers.</p>
                    <p>Cameleon has had his own way in his races this year, and had not until to-day
                        been really ridden out, but his last gallop on Sunday was rather
                        dissappointing, whereas Patsy was reported to have done an excellent gallop.
                        Patsy ran last year as Dusk and it will be remembered he ran well, but more
                        than once failed just in the last few strides. He made no such mis- take
                        to-day. He was rather a delicate pony and difficult to train, but seems to
                        have outgrown this and was evidently trained to the minute to-day. We
                        congratulate his owner Omar Bey Sultan, also his trainer and jockey.</p>
                    <p>Lambro got all he could out of Cameleon and was unlucky to be beaten for
                        second place. Radium ran well, we shall probably see some good races between
                        him a Cameleon his season. Night-watchman has been an unlucky horse since
                        his arrival in Egypt, and was left at the post to-day in the fourth race.
                        Jap won comfortably, and is evidently a good horse. The fifth race, was very
                        exciting. London was evidently ridden with judgment. He has naturally a long
                        easy stride and he came right away from his field at first, was caught by
                        them, and then making his effort at the right time took the lead and won by
                        &amp; length and <cb n="3"/> a half. Only a head divided second and third We
                        were glad to see Sadik win the sixth race, and with Jenkins up he had every
                        chance of doing so, but it was by a narrow margin of a neck. Roofaiya was
                        much tancied for the race, but proved a dissappointment.</p>
                    <p>(FROM OUR LADY CORRESPONDENT.) Friday was not such a perfect day as Wed-
                        nesday; but the racing was most exciting and many people were present in the
                        enclosure, and numerous were the pretty toilettes and smart tailor made
                        suits noticed daring the afternoon. Lady Gorst was once more present, this
                        time wearing a beautifully braided mole coloured cloth frock with long light

                        and Mrs. de Cosson made a cheery party at the railings, both sisters in dark
                        blue and wearing white boas. Not far from them was Mrs. Duffus, clad in a
                        frock and hat of a lovely dull shade of purple with a beautiful sable stole
                        round her shoulders; and Mr. and Mrs. Archer was noticed at the same place,

                        showing vest and sleeves of white embroidery. Mrs. Morgan was in pale blue,
                        so was Mrs. Scott Dalgleish and Mrs. Darell, the dress of the latter nearly
                        hidden by the long white cloth coat, and heavily embroidered and inset with
                        lace. Mrs. C. James was in a very pretty suit of palest putty coloured
                        cloth, and pink begonias trithming her wide purple hat, Mr. and Mrs. Wilfred

                    <dateline>Alexandrie, le 3 Janvier.</dateline>
                    <p>Comme la semaine précédente, la semaine qui vient de s'écouler n'a eu que
                        trois séances, mais contrairement à l'attente générale la fin de l'année
                        1907 et le commencement de l'année 1908 ont offert un intérêt inattendu.
                        Celui qui aurait prévu une reprise pour l'époque des fêtes et des
                        inventaires aurait été traité d'insensé par les haussiers eux-mêmes, et
                        cependant c'est ce qui est arrivé. Il faut dire que les événements y sont
                        pour beaucoup et surtout la baisse du taux privé d'escompte de 6 1/8 à 5% et
                        du taux officiel de la Banque d'Angleterre de 7 à 6%, alors qu'il y a peu de
                        se maines on redoutait un nouveau renchérisse ment.</p>
                    <p>Notre place qui soupirait depuis longtemps après un instant de répit a saisi
                        avec empressement cette occasion de relever un peu les prix tombés à des
                        niveaux extraordinairement bas. La nuée de vendeurs qui pas plus loin que la
                        semaine dernière harcelait notre marché ayant disparu aux premières
                        nouvelles un peu meilleures de l'étranger, il n'a pas été difficile à nos
                        agents et spéculateurs, sans beaucoup de frais, de forcer un peu la note à
                        la clôture des séances, de manière à avoir pour le début de l'exercice 1908
                        une cote en reprise presque générale.</p>
                    <p>Reste à savoir, après un triomphe aussi facile, si l'on n'est pas allé trop
                        vite en besogne et si l'avance gagnée se maintiendra. C'est possible et même
                        probable si les places diri geantes continuent à nous câbler des informa-
                        tions favorables relativement à la réduction graduelle du taux d'escompte et
                        à la tenue de valeurs égyptiennes Il est certain, en effet, que la cherté de
                        l'argent a été pour l'Egypte, après les abus de la spéculation, le principal
                        mobile de la crise au milieu de laquelle nous nous débattons encore. C'est
                        elle qui a dé- placé les capitaux employés aux valeurs et qui a obligé les
                        banques d'augmenter peu à peu leurs taux d'intérêts jusqu'à couper tout cré-
                        dit au fur et à mesure que la cote fléchissant les marges disparaissaient.
                        Avec le retour de la confiance un moment ébrantée et la baisse du taux
                        d'escompte à un niveau suffisamment réduit, les capitaux afflueront de
                        nouveau ici pour trouver un meilleur placement sur les bonnes valents qui,
                        en somme, si elles ont été poussées à des prix exagérés au mo ment de la
                        fièvre spéculative, n'ont pour cela rien perdu de leur valeur intrinsèque et
                        se trouvent pour la plupart à un prix maintenant fort raisonnable et dans
                        beaucoup de cas avantageux. Toute la question 'est donc de savoir si la
                        tension monétaire a définitivement disparu. Les nouvelles de Londres
                        tendraient à le faire croire, mais on aurait tort de s'emballer ici pour
                        diverses raisons, d'abord parce qu'il est prudent d'attendre la confirmation
                        de ces nouvelles et ensuite parce que même dans la meilleure des hypothèses
                        nos banques locales no reduiront guère leurs taux d'intérêts avant un ou
                        deux mois, après que la récolte cotonnière aura été négociée et
                        qu'elles-mêmes ayant obtenu des avances d'Europe avec les nouveaux prix
                        reduits pourront faire à leurs clients des réductions proportionnelles.</p>
                    <p>Or, à cette époque nons serons bien prêts de la saison d'été qui commence ici
                        de fort bonne heure; de plus, l'épargne ayant été échaudée au cours de la
                        orise, la spéculation ne pourra guère compter sur cet élérent. C'est dire
                        qu'à notre avis la spéculation ferait fausse route en tentant des coups
                        comme ceux qui lui ont si bien réussi les années précédentes mais qui é-
                        choueraient sans aucun doute après la dure le- çon qu'à reçu le pays. Déjà
                        en 1907 la spéculation s'est trouvée prise à son propre piège et ne dispose
                        plus l'heure actuelle que de faibles moyens. Dans ces conditions, et il faut
                        s'en féliciter pour l'avenir, il n'y a pas à escompter d'emballement pour
                        l'année en cours mais une reprise rationnelle et un classement des bonnes
                        valeurs dans les portefeuilles.</p>
                    <p>Pour en revenir à la semaine écoulée, elle a marqué essentiellement une
                        période d'indécision dans les deux premières séances de lundi et mardi, puis
                        dans celle d'aujourd'hui un revirament complet en faveur de la hausse, qui
                        peut être considérée comme générale, puisque sur 25 titres en hausse il n'y
                        en a que 9 en baisse Les autres demeurent stationnaires aux cours de
                        vendredi dernier. Il est juste d'ajouter pour donner une idée exacte de la
                        situation que les affaires n'ont pas été. nombreuses, ni brillantes et que
                        la reprise n'est en général basée que sur des deman des sans contre-partie.
                        En d'autres termes, le marché est excessivement restreint. Si dans de telles
                        circonstances nous avons pu voir une suite ininterrompue de baisse faute
                        d'acheteurs, il ne serait pas surprenant de constater un mouvement en sens
                        inverse faute de vendeurs.</p>
                    <p>Au Stock Exchange nos valeurs, qui étaient délaissées depuis quelque temps,
                        ont joni d'un retour de vogue C'est ainsi que la Daïra et l'Agricole ont
                        regagné 1/8, l'Unifiée 1/4 et la National Bank 3/8. Le Consolidé est remonté
                        de 83 84 1/8. Nous avons déjà dit que le taux officiel de la Banque
                        d'Angleterre avait été réduit de 7 à 6%, mais sa réserve a diminué de 40 à
                        35 5 8%.</p>
                    <p>A Paris l'action Crédit Foncier Egyptien a repris de 17 france à 701. La
                        Rente a bénéficié d'une avance de 45 points à 95.75.</p>
                    <p>Ici les fluctuations les plus remarquables sont les suivantes : la National

                    <p>Pour ces derniers, la hausse a été déterminée par l'arrangement récemment

                    <p>Un correspondant nous demande si un simple actionnaire peut obliger une

                        Companies' Acts, à lui fournir une copie du bilan et du rapport des
                        censeurs. Nous pouvons répondre à ce sujet que dans les débats sur le
                        nouveau Companies' Bill" on a introduit et adopté un article d'après lequel
                        un actionnaire peut exiger une copie du bilan et du rapport des censeurs à
                        un prix ne dé passant pas six pence par millier de mots Quant au prétexte
                        invoqué par certaines socié tés d'éviter la concurrence commerciale, le
                        Ministère estime que toute société anonyme établie sur des bases solides n'a
                        rien à craindre d'une telle publicité et ne doit pas hésiter à fournir les
                        renseignements en question à un actionnaire qui lui a confié tout son

                        écoulé, les renseignements suivants : La balance des comptes pour le présent
                        exercice au 30 Juin 1907 qui comprenait une pé- riode de 18 mois, montre
                        pour cette durée une perte de £5,535.10.7 contre Lstg. 10,000 durant la
                        période précédente qui s'étendait depuis le début des opérations de la
                        compagnie au 31 Décembre 1905. Grâce aux mesures prises par le Conseil
                        d'Administration, les pertes ont diminué de mois en mois et récemment ont
                        été remplacées par de légers bénéfices que le Conseil espère maintenir et
                        augmenter considérablement dans la suite. Les affaires du Caire et de
                        Port-Said sont solidement établies et les administrateurs envisagent la
                        possibilité d'étendre les opérations de la société à Alexandrie A la suite
                        de la démission en Mai dernier, de Sir John Rogers de ses fonctions de
                        président du Conseil d'administration, Mr. Dr. Herbert Milton a été élu
                        président du Conseil. Mr. Astley P. Friend, ayant démissionné de directeur
                        de la société a été nommé ingénieur-conseil. M. A. J. Tweedie, a été
                        confirmé comme administrateur et M. Herbert Milton réélu en la même qualite.

                    <p>Coton</p>
                    <p>Le mouvement de baisse s'est encore accentué pendant la huitaine qui vient de
                        s'écouler. La nouvelle de la déconfiture d'une de nos im-- portantes maisons
                        de courtage, qui a cessé ses paiements cet après-midi, et l'exécution d'un
                        gros manipulateur à la hausse ont achevé de désemparer notre marché qui a
                        clôturé en pleine débandade. Le Mars, qui avait coté 181 9/16, en.clôture ce
                        matin, est tombé ce soir à 18 1/16 pour finir à 18 3 16, an son de cloche.
                        La perte est de 13/16 sur Vendredi dernier. La semaine est, en autres
                        termes, une des plus lamentables que nous ayons enregistrées jusqu'ici.</p>
                    <p>Nons constatous ce fait aved regret, non pas que nous voulions prendre parti
                        pour une clique quelconque de joueurs, mais parce que, nous avons à cœur le
                        bien du pays, si éprouvé par la dernière crise. Nous considérons, à juste
                        titre, qu'une baisse, semblable à celle que nous enregistrons cette
                        huitaine, serait tout simple ment désastreuse pour, le pays si elle devait
                        se répéter pendant une ou deux semaines encore. L'effondrement des cours du
                        coton avec la récolte actuelle qui est médiocre, jetterait une grave
                        perturbation dans la vie économique de 'Egypte, en ce sens qu'elle rendrait
                        la balance commerciale défavorable à ce pays, qui, à la longue, pourrait se
                        trouver dans l'impossibilité de rémunérer les considérables capitaux
                        européens placés ici, et même, peut- être, d'assurer un jour, le service
                        d'une dette publique écrasante. En effet, si nous vendons notre coton à 18
                        tallaris, avec une récolte de 6 5/8 millions de cantars en moyenne, nous
                        arrivons à peine, avec les autres articles d'exportation, à payer nos
                        importations qui s'élé vent cette année à LE. 26.200.000.</p>
                    <p>Comment faire, face aux lourdes charges financières, qui grèvent le pays au
                        profit de l'Etranger, si les prix du coton ne nous laissent pas un excédent
                        qui permette de les acquitter ? La spéculation à la hausse, qui constituait
                        une espèce de rempart contre la baisse, a été anéantie. Il n'existe plus
                        rien pour contreba <cb n="3"/>lancer l'action nefaste des baissiers. Ceux-ci
                        cesseront nécessairement faute de combattants, mais ils ne s'arrêteront
                        qu'après avoir complé tement pressure lents victimes. Il est à espérer que
                        dans l'entre-temps la filature, dont les provisions sont limitées, voudra
                        bien profiter des bas prix sotuels en opérant des achats qui viendront
                        arrêter la déguingolade.</p>
                    <p>Il n'y a rien d'intéressant à signaler comme fluctuations journalières de
                        cette semaine. Le marché a été faible et en recul marqué, bien qu'il fut
                        quelque peu soutenu mardi et jeudi derniers.</p>
                    <p>Les écarts de prix entre les diverses éché ances augmentent et les reports

                    <p>La baisse des contrata s'est reflétée sur le marché de Minet of Bassal qui a
                        été pea actit Les cours sont quand même mieux soutenus qu'à la Bourse
                        Khédiviale et la qualité traitée pour les contrats est cotée un demi-tallari
                        plus cher.</p>
                    <p>Le commerce &amp; montre platot de l'indiffé- rence à contracter des
                        engagements nouveaux à la veille des fêtes.</p>
                    <p>Si les perspectives d'avenir ne sont pas très encourageantes au point de vue
                        spéculatif, il n'en est pas de même au point de vue com. mercial;
                        l'exportation a pour elle quelques chances d'opérer dans des conditions qui
                        lui permettront de contenter la filature, qui a encore des besoins à
                        couvrir.</p>
                    <p>La cote officielle du disponible accuse sur la semaine dernière une baisse de
                        5/8 sur toutes les qualités y compris Haute-Egypte: Abbasi et le Nubari
                        réactionnent également de 1/2 tallari, tandis que l'extra Joannovich ne perd
                        que 1/4</p>
                    <p>Les exportations de la semaine ont diminué. Elles n'atteignent que 21.627
                        balles contre 33 585 l'année dernière. Les arrivages sont cependant de 24
                        600 kantars inférieurs a ceux de l'année passée pour la même semaine. Le
                        stock à Minet-el-Bassal atteint ainsi 1.900.604 cantars contre 1.864.774 à
                        pareille date en 1907. Les renseignements que nous avons obtenus nous font
                        prévoir de fortes expéditions pour la deuxième quinzaine du mois
                        courant.</p>
                    <p>Les américains ont haussé. Nous trouvons le Janvier Février à 5.78, soit en
                        hausse de 18 points sur samedi dernier."</p>
                    <p>Liverpool est satisfaisant par rapport aux prix. Le spot cloture à 9 40/64 et
                        les futurs Janvier gagnent une légère fraction à 9 37/64. Ce marché n'a
                        cependant guère été actif pour les égyptiens disponibles dont la vente
                        journalière est de 100 balles en moyenne. Le Haute Egypte est négligé depuis
                        quelque temps et il est à supposer qu'il ne sera guère demandé aux prix
                        précédemment cotés.</p>
                    <p>On se demande souvent si la situation de l'article a changé pour justifier la
                        baisse actuelle. S'il est vrai, d'après certaines prévisions dignes de foi,
                        que les besoins de la consommation doivent nécessairement dé- passer la
                        production du coton, qui n'est que moyenne cette année, il n'en est pas
                        moins certain que la misère, qui règne dans plusieurs pays, produira un
                        certain ralentissement. dans la demande des filés et tissus. Le déficit
                        prévu pourrait être ainsi considérablement atténué.</p>
                    <p>Un atout en faveur de nos cotons est-incontestablement la mauvaise récolte
                        brésilienne dont les cours luttent avantageusement avec certaines variétés
                        égyptiennes.</p>
                    <p>L'Alexandria Produce Association a fixé les différences de prix pour
                        livraison sur contrats de coton janvier à P.T. 17 1/2 pour le Brown et P.T.
                        20 et 25 pour le Haute-Egypte en plus de la pénalité de P.T. 7 1/2.</p>
                    <p>Un agronome du Caire vient d'obtenir, par suite d'une longue sélection, une
                        nouvelle variété de coton, qui est décidément remarquable. Nous nous
                        bornerons énumérer brièvement les qualités et avantages qui distinguent
                        cette nouvelle espèce.</p>
                    <p>1° Rendement de 20 à 30 pour cent supé rieur; 2° Maturité plus rapide; la
                        cueillette en peut être faite 15 à 20 jours plus tôt que celle des autres
                        espèces; 3° le coton ne se détache pas et ne touche pas à terre lorsque les
                        noix, fendent, comme il arrive pour les autres varié- tés; 4° les noix sont
                        plus grosses que celles du coton Mit-Afifi; 5° elles contiennent environ 10
                        pour cent de coton en plus que les autres espèces; 6° la quantité à
                        l'égrenage varie entre 100 et 106; 7° l'arbuste atteint une hauteur de i
                        mètre 20 dans les bonnes terres et un mètre dans celles de qualité médiocre;
                        8 enfin, la qualité du coton est supérieure, ainsi qu'en fait foi l'examen
                        qui a été fait par la Liverpool Cotton Association laquelle l'a classé au
                        même rang que les cotons Joanovich et Georgia Sea Island (américain extra
                        fin) examen dont les résultats ont été consignés dans un certificat officiel
                        qui vient d'être enregistré aux Tribunaux Mixtes.</p>
                    <p>Graines de Coton</p>
                    <p>Les arrivages de la semaine ont encore été supérieurs à ceux de l'année
                        passée, tandis que le cas est tout le contraire en ce qui regarde les
                        exportations. Le prix du spot a par consé quent fléchi légèrement à P.T. 65
                        contre 66 la semaine dernière. Les graines Haute-Egypte sont cotées à P.T.
                        64.</p>
                    <p>Les affaires en contrats sont peu importan-</p>
                    <p>tes, la spéculation étant occupée avec les cotons. Les cours se maintiennent
                        cependant et la elôture s eu lieu à P.T. 68 10/40 le Janvier, P.T. 72 10/40
                        le Février Mars et P.T. 73 35/40 l'Avril.</p>
                    <p>La consommation de l'huile de coton &amp; pris de grandes porportions. Les
                        indigènes la subetituent au beurre qui est d'un prix inaborda ble. En outre,
                        les savonneries locales emploient presque exclusivement cette huile dans
                        leur industrie. La demande de tousteaux pour l'inté rieur devient
                        importante. L'exportation a ete <cb n="4"/>cette semaine de 720 tonnes
                        contre 370 l'année dernière.</p>

                    <p>A BROKEN-DOWN SYSTEM.</p>
                    <p>This is a condition (or disease) to which doctors give many names, but which
                        few of them really understand. It it simply weakness—a break-down, as it
                        were, of the vital forces that sustain the system. No matter what may be its
                        causes (for they are almost numberless), its symptoms are much the same; the
                        more prominent being sleeplessness, sense of prostration or weariness,
                        depression of spirits and want of energy for all the ordinary affairs of
                        life. Now, what alone is absolutely essential in all such cases is increased
                        vitality—vigour--</p>
                    <p>VITAL STRENGTH &amp; ENERGY</p>
                    <p>to throw off these morbid feelings, and experience proves that as night
                        succeeds the day this may be more certainly secured by a course of the
                        celebrated life-reviving tonic</p>
                    <p>THERAPION No.3</p>
                    <p>than by any other known combination. So surely as it is taken in accordance
                        with the printed directions accompanying it, will the shattered health be
                        restored,</p>

                    <p>and a new existence imparted in place of what had so lately seemed worn-out,
                        "used up,” and valueless. This wonderful medicament is purely vegetable and
                        innocuous, is agreeable to the taste —suitable for all constitutions and
                        conditions, in either sex; and it is difficult to imagine a case of disease
                        or derangement, whose main features are those of debility, that will not be
                        speedily and permanently benefited by this never-failing recuperative
                        essence, which is destined to cast into oblivion everything that had
                        preceded it for this wide-spread and numerous class of human ailments.</p>
