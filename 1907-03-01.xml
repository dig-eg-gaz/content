                        deliciously cool feeling to the skin.</p>
                    <p>Its unique properties are due to Icilma Natural Water so that it may well be

                        it the necessary vitality, to preserve it from sunburn, heat, cold or the
                        effects of hard water, to prevent and cure the minor irritations due to
                        overheated blood, and to preserve the youthful fresh look to which hot climates

                    <p>  With respect to the numerous mining enterprises which have been inaugurated
                        in Egypt, says the “Financier," the outcome, upon the whole, though not
                        brilliant, is not discourag. ing; but the mineralised part of the country is
                        of a character which demands thorough examination and stady. It appears in
                        the highest degree probable that numerous localities will justify the
                        employment of capital when sufficiently careful and systematic prog. pecting
                        has been done. In this connection the establishment by the Government of a
                        separate Department of Mines is of great importance, and it is to be hoped
                        that a geological survey of the whole country will be proceeded with, with
                        as much dispatch as the finances will permit. </p>
                    <p> The vast amounts of gold and other precious minerals which were found in
                        Egypt in ancient times seem to have been all won from workinga the maximum
                        depth of which was about 250 ft, and the great majority far less It is not
                        to be supposed that under those conditions anything like an exhaustion of
                        the ore-body was accomplished. Without any reasonable doubt, it may be
                        assumed that vast quantities of valuable ores are still awaiting discovery,
                        and at a moderate depth--in view of the ex ploits of modern mining - there
                        will be plenty of payable ore brought into view before very long Up to now,
                        however, the practical draw. back to Egyptian mining for the yellow metal
                        has been the variable and uncertain yield of the ore. A vein has been struck
                        which assayed exceedingly well, but which, on further examination, was
                        proved to be of such a mixed character that the richness of any one cubic
                        yard was little criterion of what might be in the </p>

                    <p> next. This description of deposit, though likely to yield many surprises,
                        and a sufficient amount of excitement, is not the best for serious invest
                        ment. It would, however, be rash to assume that, because this characteristic
                        of Egyptian gold ore has been manifest, therefore the whole of the deposits
                        of an auriferous description in all Egypt present similar features. Not a
                        tithe of the country has been prospected in recent times, and if the Sudan
                        be included, the vast ness of the area open to and inviting examination can
                        scarcely be realised. That which may be true of one part of such a region is
                        no guide to what may be found in another. Yet the prospector in the valley
                        of the Nile bas at least one guide of considerable value. The country is in
                        many parts honeycombed with the remains of ancient workings, most of which
                        may be regarded as so many finger posts pointing down to possible riches
                        below. </p>
                    <p> If ever the mineral deposits of Egypt become relatively anything approaching
                        to the importance they achieved in the times of the Ptolemies, the country
                        will once again be one of the very richest portions of the surface of the
                        globe. Without anticipating any such outcome, it is quite permissible to
                        surmise that the results of persistent examination may lead to the
                        establishment of a mining industry of considerable proportions, which will
                        become an important factor in the moulding of the country's destiny. </p>
                    <p> Given prosperous agriculture, an expanding mining industry and a rational
                        and honest Government, it is obvious that Egypt will afford a multitude of
                        legitimate openings for the employment of capital, and that for a very long
                        period. How far this capital will be British is a question to answer which
                        will be easier a quarter of a century bence, Meantime, French, Belgian,
                        German and Italian interests in the country are being vigorously pushed It
                        is not to be supposed for a moment that British capitalists and British
                        corporations in Egypt are going to get the cream of the business going
                        without let or hindrance. On the contrary, the country seems likely to
                        remain, as it has been certainly ever since the time of Napoleon, something
                        in the way of a battleground -not necessarily physical - for the
                        nationalities of Europe, England has at the present time the advantage of to
                        a great extent controlling the administration of the country, but this
                        exceptional position is keenly resented, even yet, by other foreigners in
                        the country, and no opportunities are lost of taking such action as is
                        calculated to neutralise what is regarded as the undue authority of Great
                        Britain. The only way in which British business interests in Egypt can be
                        successfully maintained in the face of foreign enterprise is by the exercise
                        of equal keenness and equal adaptability to the circumstances of the time
                        and local environment. </p>

                    <head>ARAB STOICISM</head>
                    <p> Arab fatalism, which is at the root of his stoic impassiveness, though much
                        talked of, is but little understood in its almost superhuman invincibility.
                        This is brought into strong relief by the history attaching to a recent
                        addition to the treasures of the Louvre Museum. It is a human skeleton &amp;
                        skeleton with a history. It is the disembodied framework of a man, an Arab
                        and an assassin. In the flesh he was Suleiman el Aleby, and his hand it was
                        that murdered Kleber, the commander of the French Revolutionary Army in
                        Egypt. For this crime he was condemned by a French court-martial to have his
                        right hand burned off, to be impaled and exposed to birds of prey, and to
                        bave his body reduced to a skeleton. The burning off of his hand Suleiman
                        bore without a groan or even a wince, but towards the end of the dire ordeal
                        the executioner happened to touch another part of his arm with the red hot
                        iron. </p>
                    <p> This punishment," he shouted with anger, is not in the sentence." Then he
                        underwent the rest of the execution without giving any expression or even
                        sign of feeling. </p>

                            Segretary what was the ospital of the Snez Canal Company and the number
                            of -hares; how many of these sbares and bow much of this money was

                            each of these 15,498 shares had been redeemed up to 1st January 19 7;

                        <p> A Cairo correspondent writes : </p>
                        <p> Official ignorance is generally professed as to even the existence of a
                            frontier question between Bzypt and Tripoli in Barbary. A certain sobool
                            of jootnalism is blamed for ex*ggerating a simple feud between the
                            frontier Bedouins into what appeared, at the time the Pomour was noi ed
                            about, to be a serious disagreement between the Porte and the Anglo
                            Byptian Government necessitating the services of another boundary
                            ommission. The Assurance is given emphatically that no ground whatroever
                            exists for alarm, effiial or other wise. The so-orl ed "oom mission"
                            which it was supposed bad left to delimitate with the Tarkish
                            authorities the frontier betwixt Ban gbazi Swejk and the Bebers, never
                            quitted these bores ; moreover, wherever ligne de demarcation, to note
                            the offioral terminology, separates--bowever vagnely-the arid wastes
                            between the Oasis of Jarabob, was long ago marked out by Imperial Iradé.
                            At least, so I was informed. The frontier line printed on certain maps
                            Garman especially, is oaloolated to give one a falne impression, for høy
                            allow Torke, eastward of Jarabub, a wider margin than what she is
                            entitled to-and this is done </p>
                        <p> probably to please the Sultan. </p>
                        <p> As a matter of fact, the frontier rons from Solom southwards, direotly,
                            passing close by the Ossis of Jarabub - wbich is Takish territory. The
                            country is fertile only on the coastthe hinterland being, except for the
                            oasis, al waterless xine, in which strategio movements on an extended
                            soale are impossible ; benoe the rumoured massing of Ottoman troops is
                            absurd. Indeed her sad experiences at Akaba </p>
                        <p> sbould make Torkey obary from any aggressive adventure such as she was
                            lately supposed to meditate. The military importance, too, of Solam bas
                            also been overrated. It might have bon stronghold in former days but at
                            presect its strength is secondary and its garrison musters to more than

                        interest in the Show,of which be spoke in most complimentary terms, and we
                        gather that the impression left on the minds of the other distinguished
                        visitors wasmost favoor able. Daring the afternoon bandreds of persons of
                        all nationalities and ages arrived, the tourist element being largely
                        represented, and the shops where silk weaving, inlaid work, and other
                        Byptian iodastries were carried on were benieged by dorious and interested

                    <p> A few remarks anent the exhibition of native industries may be added to oor
                        sommary of yesterday. Messrs. H.toun's kiosque contain of some magaifioeot
                        examples of inlaid work, one table, going for « trif, of LR 190, sbowing an
                        amazingly beantifal combination of geometrical designs in tortoise-sboll and

                        manufacture of the artioles exposed for sale. </p>
                    <p> The Meha'la el Kubra silks and gheaper stoffa I were greatly admired, and we
                        noticed some I good Assiout ware, black and red, in close proximity to the
                        spot where the manufacturers of antiquities plied their trade. To do justice
                        to the latter it must be said that the bead Decklaces which are sold for 38.

                        noticeable. The horses and cattle are qaite ap to the mark, though the
                        visitor accustom i to British and Continental abows would note with grief
                        that the average native exhibitor has little or no idea of how to I prepare

                        the arobiteot, inspires confidence. Bluontionally sperking, this school will
                        supply a long felt want of growing community. Already there is nucleas of

                    <p> The Rev. J. T. Barne read the following | address : </p>
                    <p> "B-fore the service begias I must say a few words about the object of our
                        meeting here. You have been invited to witoess the stonelaying of the Deau's
                        Baildiog. I bave sent potioos to members of the Chorob Committee and the
                        members of the Rsilway Institute Committee and to those who bavo in the past
                        shown an interest in our efforts to establish | 8o Boglieb School in Cairo.
                        For more than year we have been trying to acquire land for this purpose, tbe
                        broat of this labour falling on tbe Dess and Mrs. Batober; owing to being
                        without « soboo! bouse for Ostober, extra efforts were made, and this parool
                        of land was discovered by Mr. Brreaux. The land was bought for £1,000 by Mr.
                        John Wal. ker, who is most kindly giving us his services. Mr. Layek, the
                        arohiteot, bas takon groat pains to exaotly supply what is required, and
                        after receiving several tenders We fioally accepted that of the Bryptian
                        Constructions Company. The total cost of the achemo is estimated at £4,000,
                        which is being borrowed at 4 % The building will consist of school premises,
                        a large room for services and Banday sobools convertible into two sobool
                        rooms for woek days, « flat whiob must at </p>
                    <p> present be let, but whiob, it is hoped, will, when fonds sllow, be used ma
                        small orphanAge, flat for the head-mistress, and a ftit for the assistant
                        obaplain of All Saints': thus the annual obarge of interest and other
                        expenses will be met by rents and two additional grants, and it is hoped
                        gradually to pay off the ospital a obarge and so establish it on a more
                        permanent, M ba-is. Our most grateful thanks are due to the p Barl and
                        Counters of Cromer and Mrs. Poote A for their dever failing interest and
                        bo'p in our work, and to Lord Blward Ceoil sod Lt. Col. b Macaulay for the
                        kind assistanon they have a rendered as. Lastly, when onr late beloved Dead

                    <p> Sr. PETERSBURG, February 28 While it is premature to indicate the definite
                        lines of the Anglo-Russian agreement the negotiations are making
                        satisfactory progress, one tangible result of which was the joint offer of a
                        loan to Persia. The non-acceptance by the latter does not aff at the new
                        attitude of the two Governments to one another. The progress of the
                        negotiations naturally creates an atmosphere of conciliation extending to
                        Rosso Japanese negotiations. </p>

                    <p> BERLIN, February 27. The Liberal and Conservative papers praise the
                        cleverness of Prince von Balow's speeob, which was directed against the
                        Centre and the Socialists. Herr Bebel's speech, which lasted three hours,
                        made no impression. Even the Opposition newspapers acknowledge that Prince
                        von Bulow repelled the attacks of Herr Bebel with the same BUODB88 as the
                        attacks of the Centre. . </p>
                    <p> The newspapers, in giving details of the sitting of the Reichstag, lay
                        stress on the bitterDess of tone with which the Chancellor charaoterised the
                        Vorwaerts" statement that Ger many had the intention of threatening the
                        British possessions of South-West Africa as a base calumpy and said that
                        such stupidity accounted for the opinion spread abroad that the electoral
                        victory of the Government would be a danger to peace. </p>

                        which is allpowerful, can remove at least the onuses of temptation, and we

                            notioe calling the meeting, the minutes of last general meeting and
                            auditors' report. </p>
                        <p> The Chairman : If you plesse, we will take the report and statement of
                            accounts as read. I think you have all had a copy of it fut some days.
                            (Hear, hear. Woll, gentlemen, I am glad to have the privilege of
                            addressing you to-day and submitting our fifty first report, because it
                            is a very gratifying one. Io looking back at the balance sheets, taking
                            them from the commencement, as I have done, up to the present time, you
                            fiad a gradual improvement all the way through, and, although this last
                            year has not shows a vast improvement on the previous year, still,
                            whatever changes have taken plase are all to the good, and therefore I
                            may sately say that it is the very best balance sheet that has ever been
                            pat before thesbareholders of the Bank of Egypt. Of course, I do not for
                            a mi Dute wish to say that there bave not been causes of anxiety daring
                            the past year. We cannot always be free from them, and when you consider
                            the great expansion of business that there has been in Egypt and the new
                            companies that have been started, which bave caused a good deal of
                            speculation in shares; and, again, the great increase in the value of
                            lands in Bgypt, which bas produoed large profite made very rapidly, it
                            natarally entails considerable anxiety apon those who lend mo ney to
                            their clients, as you may well imsgine. There is another cause of
                            anxiety wbich I think has been folt everywhere, and that is the high
                            Bank rate, wbiob, in Ostober, was raised to 6 percent. This, of coure,
                            was caused chiefly by the amount of gold that was sent out by this
                            country to Egypt and to other countries. Take Egypt alone, where as a
                            role we send out five millions a year, this year we send as much as nine
                            millions or more-that is foor millions inexoss. This was not caused
                            entirely, as was supposed, by speoulation in land or in shares, but by
                            the great inorenne in the value of cotton and the abundance of the orop.
                            This year's orop is about a million oantars of cotton more than in the
                            previous year. Tae custom in Egypt, which perhaps you are not aware of,
                            is that the producerselis his cotton always for cash, and not against
                            drafts. The cotton bas to be paid for in ballion, and therefore wben tbe
                            produoer this year took advantage of the bigb price of cotton and sold
                            in Ooto ber, instrad of holding on, as he generally dous, until later in
                            the year for better prices, everyone was at his wits' end to find tbe
                            ballion which had to be sent down to the provinces to pay for it. That
                            is the real reason of the great demand for ballion towards the end of
                            the year so far as Ezypt was ooncerned. There is no doubt but that the
                            amount of cotton sold in Egypt has been consider ably greater than in
                            any previous year, and also that prices bave been exceedingly good,
                            averaging about yd. per lb. more. I should like you now to turn to the
                            balance-abeet. I do not koow that there is much in it on whíob I need
                            comment, except that on the</p>
                        <p> liability side the bills payable amount to £1,676,000, which is a
                            decline of £ 4,000, wbiob, of course, is satisfactory. The or rent
                            accounts are £1,176,000, wbich is a bighly satisfactory Dorease of £268,
                            289, and the net profits come to £'36,760 which is practically the same
                            as last year. If yoq will turn to the other side of the account, you
                            will see that the cash balance i £118 091, which is £47 671 more than at
                            this time last year, and the bills receivable sbow a decrease of
                            £186,697. This is owing to the fact that when our counts were made op it
                            was the middle of the cotton season, and every penny was required for
                            the use of the orop, and remittano s were only made to cover what was
                            absolutely required. No doubt you wil like to know that wa bad at
                            Alexandria on December 31st £400,000 worth of cotton, and In the
                            provinces we had £450,000 worth of cotton, so that we had nearly a
                            million in produce lying in our depós on December 31st. With reference
                            to our investmente, which are put down at £146,000, the greater part
                            (£265,000) are actually British Government securities, and the balance
                            is in Egyptian Government Guaranteed bonde, wbioh are considered
                            equivalent to British Government securities. The valuation of these
                            soonrities on December 31st shows a large margin to the gard, which is
                            also satisfactory festare. With reference to the bank pre mines, you
                            will ree that they have been increased to £59,00), which is an increase
                            of £21,000 over laut year. This is accounted for by the fact that we
                            have built the bank a Port Said, which cost us £9,756. Lord Ratbmore,
                            who bas jnst come home, will be able to tell you what sort of a building
                            we have put op, but it is in every way a credit to the bank. We bave
                            also spent £11,000 on the porobase of land and agency bailding at
                            Mansourab. From the above amount we have written off £6,048 9s. 8d.,
                            leaving £53 0 O carried for ward as representing our bank premises.
                            These are a very valuable asset, representing pro perty in Alexandria,
                            Cairo, Port Said, Benisourf. Khartoum, Mansoorah, Damar hoor and Fayoum.
                            As you are doubtless aware, the extraordinary increase in the value of
                            land and property in Egypt in the last two years is such that I need
                            hardly tell you that our properties represent a very considerable cum
                            beyond that figare. You may take it that it is a very valuable asset to
                            this company, </p>
                        <cb n="4"/>
                        <p> asked by an old woman what age be sopposed her to and be replied
                            promptly that be declared to Heaven be did not know what age she way,
                            but whatever age she was she didn't look it. (Lyoghter.) That is very
                            much the case with our Pasba; he is in very good health, and be looks a
                            great deal batter than he did five years ago, and I heartily hope that
                            we may bave his services for some time to come. (Hear, bear.) I am sore
                            he will goide us through any difficulty that may arise of a temporary
                            kind in Bgypt with great skill and prudence. Then, a thu obairman bas
                            said, be is very ab'y supported by our other offisers at Csim, at Port
                            Said, at Khartoum and elsewhere. I was not able to go to Kbartoum
                            myselt, but I had the advantage of an interview with our manager there,
                            Mr. Lnard, a very sapsble young gentleman, who bappered to be passing
                            throngh Cairo. and from what I have beard from him and from others well
                            acqusinted with the present state of Upper Egypt, I am satisfied that
                            wit bin Acme little time it may take some years for its complete
                            fulfilment there will be a great advancement and wonderful opportunities
                            for business in Kbartoom and its neighbouring regions wben the effects
                            of the improvements in irrigation which are now going on in fertilis.
                            ing lands have been more fally completed, and when the gaps in the
                            population which enfor tanately were left by the barbarous role of the
                            Mahdi have been filled up, and when there will be a larger number of
                            people to produce agricultoral results. No one can doubt that there will
                            great field, and a very favourable field, for the operations of a bank
                            like oors, and at Khartoum, as in other places, I am glad to think oor
                            bank stands very well and is very popular with the people fof the cour
                            try of all kinds. Then as to Port Said. A our obairman has said, Port
                            Said hwobanged in a most marvellous way. The last time I was there there
                            were shabby Bryptian villages bat now there are splendid buildings of
                            ovey kind and every sigo and tokeo of a great spread of prosperi y and
                            wealth. I am very glad to ser, in view of that, that the bank which we
                            have lately built ther, at a onet of £9,700, is really one of the finest
                            in Port Said, and splendidly arranged for banking perposes. And
                            remember, gentlemen, bailding and bank premises, as the obirman bas nid,
                            are a constantly improving investment for us Por instance, our provost
                            book buildings in Cairo </p>
                        <p> The Chairman : It is a delioate question, but I may say that he has been
                            in our service for 45 years. He came to us as quite a young man, bat be
                            is still toll of extraordinary energy, and his knowledge of the people
                            is of very great importance and value to the bank. I am also glad to say
                            he is well supported by the staff. We have, unfortunately, lost daring
                            the year the services of Mr. Greville, who had | boop our manager at
                            Cairo, bat who has obtained a better post elsewhere. We are sorry to
                            lose one who filled that position so long. His place has been filled by
                            Mr. Davidson, who did good work at Khartoum for us, and Mr. Laard, who
                            was working for us at the agency at Soakin, has been transfarred to
                            Khartoum. I hardly like to speak of our staff here in their presence,
                            but they all deserve the same oredit that we give to those abroad.
                            Perhaps Mr. Nichols will pardon my reading « letter I received from a
                            shareholder, who is unable to be present here to day. He writes strongly
                            supporting as in every way, and he adds: "I should like also, if I may
                            do so, to express my 80080 of the antailing courtesy of your Secretary,
                            Mr. Niobols, bis readiness to afford *y information that it is in his
                            power to give, and the genial reception that shireholders always meet
                            with at his hands must render in </p>
                        <p> great pleasure to have any communication with him." I think that speaks
                            volame. He says: "I would not have written this if I had been able to
                            come myself to the meeting." Your shares are very well distributed over
                            a very large number of shareholders. A very short time ago we had only
                            600 : Dow we have 1,86%. That, of course, inorenses the work of the
                            effije very considerably. Then I should mention that. Lord Grenfell and
                            Mr. GH. Palmer, who is in Egypt, retire by rotation and you will be
                            asked very sbortly to re-eleot them. You will be also asked to appoint
                            Lord Milner as an additional director. I think that will meet with the
                            approval of you all. Lord Milder, you know, is a very great financial
                            expert. He was secretary to the late Lord Gosoben when Chancellor of the
                            Exobeqaer ; be then became the Chairman of the Inland Revenge in this
                            country; he then went out As Financial Seoretary to His Highness the
                            Khedise in Egypt ; and therefore be is wellkuowa in that country, and
                            very much respaoted by everyone with whom he has come in contact. We
                            think that we are most fortunate in obtaining his consent to join the
                            board. I will not detaia you any longer, but will move : "That the
                            report and statement of accounts to December 31st, 1906, now presented

                        <p> Lord Rathmore : I beg, at the invitation of our obairmao, who has given
                            you such a clear and satisfactory mooount of the working of the bapkw it
                            appears in the report wo bavo sab </p>
                        <cb n="5"/>
                        <p> mitted to you, to cond thio resolation, and it gives me great pleasure
                            to AL you, as the resalt left apon my mind by the visit wbiob I lately
                            paid to Baypt-where I spent the month of JADINY-that the presente
                            position and immediate prospects of our bank are very encouraging. I was
                            much strook by the extra ordinary inores e in the prosperity of Bgypt
                            whiob has taken place since I was lost there about eight years ago. To
                            anyone who has not seon that advance it would really seem almost
                            inoledible, but I could, however, easily prove it if I were to go into
                            official figores on the sabject. Bat I should like to say, in reference
                            to rumours, whiob, no doubt, you bave seen in some newspapers at home,
                            of possibilities of danger and impending commercial orash there, that,
                            having had the opportunity of speaking to a great many men well ospable
                            of forming an opinion on soob matters in Egypt, I think that these
                            rumours and warnings are somewbst exaggerated. There is no doubt, as our
                            obairman asid, a certain amount of rather wild speoulation -saob
                            speculation as I believe usually accom panies a rapid development of
                            sound business </p>
                        <p> there is a certain amount of gambling going 00, especially in the
                            wonderfully rapid increase in the value of land, and I suppose there is
                            no doubt that if there were suddenly to ome a financial diffi yalty of
                            any kind a good many of th 999 Wild speculators and gamblers might go to
                            the wall. Bat there is no doubt that, besides that speculation, great
                            preponderance of the busines now being done in Egypt is of a sound
                            obaracter, and would pro bably proceed on its coarse very little
                            affected by the misfortunes which might happen to individuals. There
                            might be for a time very anpleasant ones, bat I think, on the whole, the
                            steady progress of the country would pro ceed. The omm groial
                            developments of every 1 kind are extraordinary, bat especially in the
                            value of land. Bveryone foresees that the prosperity which has already
                            come opon Egypt within recent years is but an earnest of what is still
                            to come, only they say that this land, valoable as it is now, will soon
                            be more vala able, and so they go on baying and selling, and, of course,
                            there must arrive &amp; moment when they cannot get bayer at a higher
                            price and then will come a squeeza for the people who have been rather
                            reckless over their transActions; but, as I have said, I do not think
                            that can be regarded as likely to inter tere to any great extent with
                            the general progress of the country, and I am quite sure we sball be
                            most osrefully and 080tiously guided by Mr. Lazzato bog his pardon, I
                            ought to have said His Excel lenoy Lazzato Pasha--but I remember him
                            more as an old friend than a new dignitary. (H98r, bear). As the
                            chairman has said, be is not only, as you all know, . very able mso, who
                            has contributed so much to the prosperity of our back, bat be has also
                            an extraordinarily intimate koowledge of the country, and he thoroughly
                            understands the situation. Besides that, be has an enormous number of
                            friends all through Egypt, from whom he is always receiving information
                            at first band. He knows very well who of our clients are going too fast
                            ahead, and he knows those whom be dan safely trust. In that way, I quite
                            apart from his great ability, he bas speoial advantages in directing our
                            business. He bas a great pride in the bank, to the success of wbiob be
                            hus oontribated so largely, and I am glad to say be is in ospital
                            beslih. Some gen tlems asked what his age was. Well, really, I do not
                            know, but I am inclined to answer, as a countryman of mine did, an
                            Irisbman who was </p>
                        <cb n="6"/>
                        <p> -the house itself is not very well bailt, bat the site is . ospital 030.
                            I bad the plouare, with the assistance of my noble friend, Lord
                            Greufell, of ohooolog that site some eight years ago. I think we could
                            sell it now for many times what we paid for it. I was talking of Port
                            Said and I may my that the Suez Canal Company, of which I happen also to
                            be a director, are making great improve monte in that port. The sobeme
                            is to make new barbour near the mouth of the canal, in which the
                            colliers, wbiob now to a considerable extent orowd to estrano, will be
                            set on One side, and thus the fairway entering the ongal will be greatly
                            improved. There will be a great development of looal enterprise at Port
                            Said, on account of the over-inoreasing pomber of ships passing through
                            making market for the merchants and tradesmen of Port Said. Besides
                            that, it is the opinion of some well goalified to form an opinion that
                            large part of the development of Lower Beypt will come to Port Said, -
                            the exit from Alex. andria Harbour is not, I believe, so good for ships
                            going out into the Mediterranean. Therefore, I am very glad that we have
                            lost no time in placiog ourselves firmly in a very suitable and fine
                            building at Port Said. Not only are our general manager, Lozzetto Pasha,
                            and all our offisers working with the greatest zoal, but they are very
                            popular with the people with whom they have to dosl. lo faot, witb. ont
                            putting the thing too rosily, our present position and immediate
                            prospects are deoidadly favourable. Or course, I have said, there may be
                            some moments of anxiety, bot only for this bank, but for other people in
                            Egypt, bat, on the whole, the progress of the country is more like a
                            fairy tale than anything else, and I believe is of very sore kind.
                            Therefore, unless some great misfortune, at present quite apforesoon,
                            arises, we may look forward with a fair amount of confidence to the
                            results of the current year being good. I have much pleasure ia
                            seconding the rosolation. (Applause) </p>
                        <p> The Chairman : Has any gentleman ady question to ask? </p>
                        <p> A Shareholder: Have you any idos ofiagrossing the capital ! You
                            mentioned that at the last meeting. </p>
                        <p> The Chsirman : Well, we have been loth to do it, but there is no doubt
                            it must come sooner or later. We do not propose to make any change jast
                            at present. </p>
                        <p> De Drysdale : I was very much plensed to hear the remarks of your
                            colleagues about the rise in the price of land. Unfortunately, some
                            years ago I was a shareholder in some of the Australian banks, and I
                            have felt bow important it is to take the greatest care in times when
                            the price of land is rising, beoanno buko are apt to lend out money too
                            freely. I am also delighted to bear that Lord Milner is to be on your
                            board. He is a director on the joint-stook bank with which I have to do.
                            I hold a great many bank ebares, and I regard banks as the most
                            civilising agency in the civilised world. </p>
                        <p> The resolation was then pat, and carried unanimously.</p>
                        <p> Lord Grenfell and Mr. Palmer were onanimously re-elected directors of
                            the company. </p>
                        <p> Lord Grenfell: The very pleasant daty bas been given to me to propone
                            that the Right Hon. Lord Milner should join the board, and I am glad to
                            propose it, because in old day not such prosperous dayon at present1 bad
                            the pleasure of working in Egypt with Lord Milner. I was then commanding
                            the Egyptian Army ander certain diffi oulties and he was second in
                            command to Lord Cromer in stroggling with the finance. I think our
                            sbares then stood at from £19 to £16, and things in Egypt did not look
                            very bright. We must aokoowledge that the great prosperity of our bank
                            and the great prosperity in Bzypt is largely due to the exertioos made
                            in those bad times by Lord Cromer, greatly assisted by the prerent Lord
                            Milner, in reorganising the finances of Egypt and placing the whole
                            financial system on the good basis on which it now rests. When Lord
                            Milner's name was mentioned I think we saw how acceptable it would be to
                            the sharebolders, and I have the greatest pl nasare in proposing bis
                            election. </p>
                        <p> The Hoo. H.8. Carr Glyo: I have very great pleasure in secoading the
                            resolation. I feel it is quite un Bossary for me to dwell in any way on
                            the varied and illustrious career of Lord Milner after what bas fallen
                            from Lord Gronfell, hesause I am sure he is well knowa to everyone in
                            the room, aod I am sure his grest experience, fioanoial and general, and
                            the great interest be takes in Baypt must be of great assistance to this
                            board and must promote the prosperity of the company. </p>
                        <p> The resolation was carried unanimously. </p>
                        <p> The auditors (Messrs. Price, Waterhouse and Co.) were re-elected. </p>
                        <p> Captain Glyn: It gives me very mooh plesante to move that the thanks of
                            the meeting be given to the chairman, directors, managers, and staff
                            generally for their valuable services during the past year. </p>
                        <p> Mr. Payne: I have very much plessore in econding that resolation, and I
                            should like also to include our thauks for the very inte resting and
                            valuable information wbich has been given to us this afternoon. </p>
                        <p> The resolation was carried unanimously, </p>
                        <p> The Chairman: I am sure we are very much indebted to you for your
                            kindness, and we sball try to produce as good balance-sboet next year,
                            it not a better one. </p>
                        <p> The proceedings then terminated. </p>

                    <p> Bedreshein's chief olaim to notioe lies in the fact of its proximity to the
                        remains of Mempbis; and in this respect it forms by far the easiert base for
                        those who intend visiting the site of this once celebrated and enormous
                        oity. The fall etation lies but an boor's run from the E. S. R. station
                        Cairo, on the main line to Loxor, the train taking the wide detour throngh
                        Boalao across the river, past Bmbabeh, and on to Ghizeb, leaving the Pyramid
                        of Cheone Kephron, eto, on the right, and the distant Citadel, the Mokattam
                        bille, with their row of towers, eto, on the left. A procession of boats
                        with their vast sails stretebed to catch the breeze drift silently up and
                        down the river ; various other pyramids on the Libyan plain mark the site of
                        that hoge necropolis which onoe stretched all the way from Ghireh to
                        Bakkarab, Abougir, Dashoor, and even for her still. A continuous grove of
                        palm trees beside the railway line between Ghizeh and Bedresbein station
                        bides muob of the distant view, but the blue sky, the palms, and the
                        son-bine glinting on the rich crops below; the floks of goate, beer, gamoore
                        and their sbepherds, are welcome sights to those whose eyes are wesried with
                        the towa life of Cairo. </p>
                    <p> Bedre-hein station is but a few minutes walk from the village; and though
                        the gnidebook deolares there is not much of interest in the place, it well
                        repay, « leign relyssnnter through its streets. Though boilt of ann dried
                        bricks, roofed with the antidy bundles of sugar osne straw and stack of the
                        common foal of the country, eraoted at hap.bazard and minus every rudiment
                        of comfort, these dative abops sod houses never cease to be picturesque
                        AQcessories to the soene and fitting complements to the surrounding
                        land-oape. Ssonter through there oneven mod streets and I dety anyone to
                        find the process boring. There are shops of divers sorte, there are groups
                        of dignified people, and no more delightfol groups of ondigified cbildren
                        awaiting attention at every turn. Tarn your mental camers upon the narrow
                        court ways as yon pass, register the impression of the aunlight streaming
                        down into a corner rieb with onpre. meditated piotare q eness and Andreamt
                        of dirt, glance into the dark interiora where obild and animal life lie hu

                        presence of a stranger and the possibility of backab terb, and you will
                        never complain of dolness again. </p>
                    <p> Footpaths are unknown in Bedresbein as in most other native villages : the
                        pedestrian must take bis obanoe along with the rest of the world, and the
                        unwary one may, like as not, fiod bis way disputed by a string of snarling,
                        iodependent camels whose claim to! the road is as good and much more
                        foroible than his own. Real tourists in un belmets and blue veils riding
                        astride on woe-begone donkeys are apt to obtrude themselves on Boones where
                        their presence is an apaobroniem, and rudely distarbing to the harmony of
                        the composition. </p>
                    <p> Through the village the road runs along a winding embankment to the mounds
                        near Mitrabening, mounds which, if looal bearsay is oorreot, mark part of
                        the very site of Memphis. Indeed many of the important quarters and
                        buildings of the city appear to bave stood in the very fields and village of
                        Bedresbein itself, so that it is quite possible that our tourist feet may be
                        tramping onder neath the soil which once was covered ages ago by tbe

                        Memphis, is it not written large in every guide book on Egypt, and the

                        one of our contemporaries makes it diffi salt to mention the subject without
                        committing the deadly sin of plagiarism. In tsot nothing remains to be said
                        about Memphis and its temples, its gods and its rolers, ita monuments and

                    <head>THE OASIS OF SIWA</head>
                    <head>A KHEDIVIAL VISIT</head>
                    <p>(Continued from yesterday.) The Hama le, i.e., stony desert, was passed and
                        with the new day appeared green land with rubble and with many Ghartas (sand
                        danes). It was delightful to walk over this westber-beated ground. Tho
                        osmels tramped at a rate of six kilometres per hour in the cool, early
                        morning, &amp; speed we seldom attained later on. My diary, which reports
                        every 1/4 bour on the swiftness of my oamel, records an average of 87 steps
                        per minute, bat on this morning from 96.160 Afrer Kapais the tra veller
                        follows one of those darrow paths of wbich occasionally as many as twenty
                        five ron along at sbort distances from each other. If, hitherto, there was
                        seldom any trace of a road visible, it gave you now tbe impression that it
                        must be quite simple thing to oross the fearinspiring desert along these
                        paths, though, be It onderstood, this is only the base in those months when
                        the caravans trading in dates lesve such traces behind and aplarge the
                        stone-pyramide bearing way.marks. A wellequipped Boropean would ron very
                        little danger, as he would alwys meet with four wel's after having passed
                        Kanais, namely, Bir L bager, Bir Hkfet egge'a Bir Helo, and Br Istable. The
                        first named would be a great attraction to the arobaeologist, because you
                        can recognizin it the fortifications already mentioned. Unfortunately,
                        though, only abort balt is possible at such expored spots. However, the
                        construction of the Kbedivial motor track to Siwa will, in the rear fatore,
                        off the specialist opportunity to explore hid-1 Hen tressdres, as this
                        motor-track will touch all the ancient placos.</p>
                    <p> What appears most imposing to the Bedouing Jis Bir Hakfet ezgetas, a large,
                        rich waterbasin with plenty of strooo and black-lead, and in its
                        neighbourhood there are traces of habitations wbich speak of a time when the
                        I place was more thickly populated. The cover of the well, supported by a
                        massive pillar, is, bare also, partly fallen in, and the wide, watery
                        surface looks most inviting to the thirsty traveller. About two boors to the

                        the latter were parts of a far-stretohing lako which diminished in
                        circumference in the beight of the summer. This lake stretches from West to
                        East and a second one lies close to it farther South Before entering apon
                        this region we notioed large cavities in the ground in the form of basins,

                    <p>KEARSLEY AND CUNNINGHAM'S WEEKLY REPORT</p>
                    <p>Liverpool, February 91. There has been a fairly active market this week for
                        Spot Egyptians, and prices are very steady, the quotations of both Brown and
                        Uppers being raised to to , per lb.</p>
                    <p>Paturos have been moderately active and the following are the latest
                        values.</p>
                    <p>Feb. 11.6 May 10,57 Aug. 10.44 Mar. 11.8 June 10.52 Sept. 10.38 April 10.61

                    <p>Nov. 10.03 AMERICAN FUTUREs. The trading this week has been very lifeless and
                        quite confined to the professional element, whilst the long continued apathy
                        of the pablio exerts a subdoing it fence, and tires the outside speculator.
                        The "Balls" have shown rather more disposition to become "Besrish", on the
                        other hand Mr. Theodore Price cables: "Digestive Crop 18,000,000 bales
                        maximom, probably less." This would suggest a bullish view of the situation,
                        bat mesuwbile the figures look as if it would be more than that. Spianers
                        continue to buy fairly freely.</p>
                    <p>The closing quotations show one point decline for dese, and to 6 points

                    <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                        January may be a little warmer than the Riviera and possibly not so warm as
                        Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm
                        than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in
                        the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest
                        place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                        sea, and we therefore subjoin a list shewing the time occupied on each of
                        the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>
                    <p><cb n="3"/></p>
                    <p>They are as follows:—</p>
                    <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southhampton,
                        London or Liverpool—occupy about 14 days. The short ones are as
                        follows:—</p>

                    <p>The steamers of the P.&amp; O., the Egyptian Mail S.S,. Co., North German
                        Lloyd, Orient, and Messageries Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor,
                        British India, Bibby and Henderson Lines are also excellent, and their
                        steamers are largely patronised by travellers to Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 hours). That to Port Said can now be made without change
                        in 4 ½ hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p>The quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp; O. Brindisi express
                        from Port Said, by the Egyptian Mail S.S. Co., from Alexandria to Marseilles
                        and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna express from Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe. The Egyptian Mail S.S. Co., have
                        also made arrangements whereby luggage can be collected and sent to any
                        address.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail Steamers “Osiris" and “Isis” to Brindisi. One of these leaves Port
                        Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian <cb n="6"
                        />mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                    <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                        attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats" having
                        been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi.
                        If you are going straight through to England you will find the train waiting
                        at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete
                        arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in
                        London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <head>SICILY.</head>
                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.’s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMENA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. <hi rend="italic"
                            >Giardini</hi> is the station at which to alight, and the drive up to
                        Taormina is most delightful, occupying about one hour. In and around the
                        town is much to interest the visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but
                        restored under the Romans. CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of
                        Etna, and here also is a fine Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic
                        remains that are found all over the island, are an endless sources of
                        pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting history, having been a Greek city,
                        which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C. 413, and taken by the Romans in
                        B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb is to be seen. The cathedral
                        was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with about 300,000 inhabitants,
                        is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a delightful climate. Much of
                        interest is to be found in this fine city. <hi rend="italic">The Palazzo
                            Reale</hi> is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of <hi
                            rend="italic">S. Giovannia degli Eremiti</hi> with its picturesque
                        cloisters. The Cathedral, Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal
                        Park are also worth a visit.</p>

                    <head>CENTRAL ITALY.</head>
                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.’s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                            bay—<hi rend="italic">Castellamare</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                            >Sorrento</hi>. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento [you can
                        drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                            <hi rend="italic">City of Flowers</hi> and its surrounding country. In
                        Florence itself the churches and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst
                        the local promenades and excursions should not be omitted. <hi rend="italic"
                            >The Cascine</hi> is the most attractive and fashionable promenade in
                        Florence, whilst the <hi rend="italic">Viale dei Colli</hi>, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to <hi rend="italic">Vallombrosa</hi>, with its <hi
                            rend="italic">Monastery</hi> 3,300 feet above the sea level. This is
                        made first by ordinary train from Florence to <hi rend="italic">St.
                            Ellero</hi>, thence by cog-wheel railway to <hi rend="italic"
                            >Saltino</hi>. The ascent through groves of oaks takes an hour, and most
                        striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; here there is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                        and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                        house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                        and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                    <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                        the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and deliciously cool
                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy’s most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                        SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal springs,

                    <head>NORTHERN ITALY (Continued) and The ITALIAN LAKES.</head>
                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea port.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea. No hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from <hi rend="italic">Milan</hi> you make the tour of the
                        beautiful Italian lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza.</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come <hi rend="italic"
                            >Tremezzo</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Cadenabbia</hi>, and <hi rend="italic"
                            >Menaggio</hi> with the prettily-situated town of <hi rend="italic"
                            >Bellaggio</hi> opposite. The walk from <hi rend="italic">Tremezzo</hi>
                        along the shore of the lake to <hi rend="italic">Menaggio</hi> is most
                        enjoyable. A steam tram runs from <hi rend="italic">Menaggio</hi> to <hi
                            rend="italic">Porlezza</hi> on Lake Lugano in three-quarters of an hour,
                        then steamer to Lugano in two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                        hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated on
                        the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San
                        Salvatore, M. de Caprino.and M. Generoso.</p>
                    <p>LOCARNO may be reached by rail from Bellinzona in forty minutes. This pretty
                        town, situated at the top of Lake Maggiore, has a mild climate and is an
                        excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated above the
                        town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings, “Entombment,"
                        by Ciseri, and ‘Tho Flight into Egypt,” by Bramantion.</p>
