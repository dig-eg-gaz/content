                    <p>Made in 70 Colors</p>
                    <p>An artistic wall covering.</p>
                    <p>This celebrated water paint is made in two qualities for Inside and Outside
                        work</p>
                    <p>HALL’S SANITARY WASHABLE DISTEMPER is rapidly superseding wall papers in all
                        tastefully furnished homes. It is made in 70 artistic tints, and only
                        requires the addition of water to make it ready for use. It is quickly and
                        easily applied with a whitewash brush, with half the labour and at one third
                        the cost of paint. HALL’S DISTEMPER ensures cleanliness, and is pleasing to
                        the eye. It appeals alike to artistic and practical house decoration.</p>
                    <p>HALL’S DISTEMPER is of special value in hot climates. Owing to its cool,
                        pleasing colours, great weather-resisting and germ-destroying properties, it
                        lends itself to every kind of wall, wood, brick or stone coating, possessing
                        all the advantages of paint, colour- wash, and disinfectant at one third the
                        cost of oil paint. It never blisters in the hottest sun, and the fact that
                        it can be washed adds greatly to its sanitary advantages.</p>

                    <head>Mr. Machell's Campaign</head>
                    <p>Every cultivator of cotton mUst be gratified to note the considerable
                        decrease in the number of feddans of cotton-land attacked by the
                        cotton-worm, which has been evident for the past few weeks, as shown by the
                        weekly reports issued by the Ministry of the Interior. Egypt is above all a
                        cotton-growing country and it is essential,for the welfare of the country at
                        large, and of the fellah who looks to the yield of cotton from his small
                        plot of land for his daily bread, that every effort should be made to cope
                        with any insect pest, such as the cotton-worm, which may threaten to damage
                        the staple. The cotton-worms this year have appeared in enormous numbers,
                        and there was every indication that the crops would suffer materially from
                        their ravages. The Ministry of the Interior, however, realising the gravity
                        of the situation, took the matter in hand, and under the direction of Mr.
                        Machell organised a warfare against this pest which has met with a greater
                        success than was anticipated by the most sanguine. The method, which has
                        proved so successful, is the picking by hand of those leaves upon which the
                        ootton-worm has laid its eggs, and burning them. No doubt hand-picking is
                        laborious, and has also necessitated the temporary re-introduction of the
                        corvee, but its efficacy is an ample justification of its adoption,and,
                        since no other means with whioh the pest can be successfully combatted has
                        been found, the fact that the corvee has been put into force can meet with
                        no objection on the part of any person capable of forming a sound judgment.
                        The damage to the crops this year, thanks to the energy with which the
                        inspectors of the Ministry of the Interior have performed their part of the
                        task, promises to be very slight. The destruction whioh the worm caused last
                        year was very considerable, no less than half of the crop being ruined in
                        some districts.</p>
                    <p>Another and much simpler method has been suggested by Mr. Richmond of the
                        Aboukir Land Company, which consists in the applica-tion of two or three
                        gallons of petroleum per feddan with the first watering which is given to
                        the land after the sowing of the seeds—a method, by the way, which has been
                        folly described in our columns, —and experiments are being carried out in
                        this direction at the suggestion of the Ministry of the Interior, If this
                        plan proves successful,</p>
                    <p>it will be adopted next year, bnt it has not been fully demonstrated, as yet,
                        that it is certain to prove effective. A proof of the efficacy of the method
                        at present in use, and of the assiduity with which it is carried out is
                        found iu the fact that the Augiut, or third brood has up to the present been
                        very scarce.</p>
                    <p>In former years this brood bis always proved the most numerous, probably iu
                        consequence of the neglect of the two earlier broods of June and July, and
                        has therefore done the most damage, bnt in many places where the worms have
                        appeared in abundance early in the present year, all trace of them has
                        disappeared, and no eggs are to be found. August, too, is the season when
                        the Nedwet el Assal appears, and the Ministry of the Interior have turned
                        their attention to its destruction, and are urging upon cultivators the
                        necessity of spraying the leaves of all cotton-plants, in the vicinity of
                        any plant which has been attacked by the nedwet, with a mixture of soap,
                        kerosene or paraffin oil, and water. This prescription has met with perfect
                        success wherever it has been applied, but unfortunately a number of
                        cultivators fail to realise the necesity of taking these precautionary
                        measures, and have in consequence suffered from the visit of the fungus
                        which follows on the nedwet, and which is the real destructive agent. It is
                        asserted by some that the danger of the cotton-worm and its prevalence have
                        been exaggerated; bnt these critics forget that had no attention, or
                        insufficient attention, been paid to it, their oomplaints would have been
                        loud and bitter,and they would have heaped ’ recriminations upon the heads
                        of the unfortunate authorities whom they now accuse of making "much ado
                        about nothing.” Such reasoning is like that of the child who frets because
                        it is taken too much care of in an illness, the negligence of which might
                        prove disastrous, but is incapable of looking farther forward than the next
                        five minutes,</p>
                    <p>We are very glad to observe that our local contemporaries of every
                        nationality recognise the excellence of the work which has been done, and
                        the indefatigable energy with which Mr. Machell and his subordinates have
                        performed their task. Mr. Machell has indeed shown that he has the true
                        interests of the country at heart, that he is an able administrator, and
                        that no private interests will stand in the way of his public duties. He has
                        remained out here during the wont months of an exceptionally hot and trying
                        summer, he has himself directed and superintended the work, and has paid
                        innumerable visits of inspection to the clearing operations in the
                        widely-separated districts in which they have proved necessary. His efforts
                        have been most laudable, and have been crowned with the thorough success
                        which they deserved, and he has now been able to retire for a short space of
                        time to a cooler climate, where he can recuperate himself for the arduous
                        tasks of the coming year, assured that he has done his best, and has been of
                        great service to the country in which he takes such a deep interest Among
                        other papers which have spoken of Mr. Machell’s devotion is the "Bulletin de
                        l'Union Syndicale” which gives the following appreciation of his work: "The
                        work of stripping off the (affected) leaves has been continued with success.
                        It is fitting to congratulate the Government upon the measures taken, but
                        the gratitude of the cultivators is chiefly due to Mr. Machell, who has
                        directed the execution of the work with skill, and with an energy to which
                        all must render due homage. The decree concerning the leaf-stripping was
                        wise, but the application of it was difficult. In order that it should have
                        full effect, it was necessary to find a man of initiative, knowing the
                        country, knowing how to carry out his wishes, a man who had already given
                        proof of his ability, a man inspiring such confidence in the Government that
                        he might count upon organising an effective and thorough cooperation in the
                        campaign, and who might be granted full powers over the civil and military
                        staff of the mudiriehs, with the certainty that the measures of repression,
                        which he would eventually have to take, would be ratified. The man was found
                        in Mr. Machell. All those who have seen him at work, all those who are
                        witnesses of the result obtained, will agree in declaring that he has been,
                        as far as any one could wish, equal to his task.” Such praise is, in our
                        opinion, right well deserved. Let us add that those who have worked in the
                        provinces as inspectors, and in other capacities, have ably seconded Mr.
                        Machell's efforts, and are also well worthy of the thanks of the country for
                        having assisted in saving it from what would undoubtedly have been a serious
                        disaster, had not the measures prescribed been faithfully and energetically
                        carried out</p>

                        absolutely not to blame for the accident.</p>
                    <p>Wednesday’ Official Journal contains the report of the sitting of the
                        Legislative Council of Monday, August 29, 1901. Might it not prove possible
                        to publish these reports within at least six months of the sitting 7 It is
                        rather disconcerting to find that a supplement of the excellent official
                        medium is entirely de-voted to the story of a discussion, the interest and
                        remembrance of which has long ago vanished like Hans Breitmann's party— “in

                    <p>Attempted Murder. — At 7.30 p m. on Tuesday evening an itinerant musician
                        began to play at the door of the Brasserie Diamant, near the Verdi Theatre.
                        The habitués of the bar, though doubtless inured to fearful sounds, were
                        forced to protest against his discords, and the proprietor of the Brasserie
                        signalised his zeal for harmony by attacking the minstrel with a dagger. The
                        unfortunate man was removed to Kaar El Aini hospital with a severe wound in
                        the side. His assailant has been arrested, and will, we trust, receive a
                        punish ment that will deter him from such trenchant and forcible criticism
                        in the future. Saul, who interrupted David's solo on the harp with a
                        javelin, was the first musical critic of whom we have any record, but a

                    <p>The Compagnie Immobilered Egypte, which purchased in April last the residence
                        and grounds belonging to the heirs of the late Sabit Pasha, situated next to
                        the Savoy Hotel, in the very heart of the Ismsilieh quarter, has commenced
                        the demolition of the above mentioned extensive buildings with a view to
                        making room for a new street of 12 metres in width, which is to traverse the
                        property continuing the Sharia Kasr-el-Nil with the boulevard Soliman Pasha.
                        Another new street will likewise be made at nearly right angles, from the
                        Rue Shawarby Pasha to the Boulevard.</p>
                    <p>The price paid for the Sabit Pasha property as well as that of the Baron
                        Menasce, purchased later, was about £140,000. These two properties have been
                        divided into fifteen lots, and half of these have been already disposed of
                        at prices ranging from £14 to £18 per square metre, for the purpose of
                        erecting new and up-to-date residences, moat of the houses now existing on
                        the second property being also about to be pulled down, as well as the row
                        of shops fronting the Sharia Kasr-el-Nil. There have been rumours of late
                        that the new Cairo Bourse was to be erected on part of the grounds, but so
                        far nothing has been decided ; Negotiations for this purpose are, however,
                        still proceeding, and it is considered probable that they may result in an
                        arrangement being arrived at later on, when the parties concerned will have
                        returned from their holidays.</p>
                    <p>The portion of the Sabit property which adjoins the Savoy Hotel has, as
                        already announced in our columns, been purchased by the Nungovioh Hotels
                        Go., with the intention of erecting on a part of it several additions to the
                        hotel.</p>
                    <p>Mr. I. Khalil, the new manager of the oom-pany, has succeeded in obtaining
                        exceptionally handsome remits within the past two months by the sale of a
                        portion of the plots into which the two properties have been divided. He is
                        leaving Egypt next week by the Bibbs line steamer for Marseilles, to attend
                        the next general meeting of the Compagnie Immobilière which is to be held at

                        presidency of H. E. Fahkry Pasha decided to grant a supplementary credit of
                        L.B. 7,761 to cover the excess of the expenses of the Mahmal in the years
                        1905 and 1906. It was also decided to exempt the Deaconess Hospital of
                        Alexandria from the payment of the rights of transcription and copy on two
                        plots of land sold by the state at Hadra, Alexandria, upon one of which will

                    <p>The S.S. Neghileh, which left Aden on July 31, Hodeidah on the 4th. inst,
                        Massouh on the 5th, Suakim on the 9th, and Djeddaa on the 11th inst, arrived
                        at Baez last Tuesday with a suspected case of cholera on board. The vessel
                        carried 54 passengers and a doctor, and had a crew of 32. On medical
                        examination at Suez a Turkish woman about 50 yea» of age, attracted
                        particular attention. The woman was very thin and was suffering from an
                        attack of diarrhea ; her pulse was imperceptible, and her extremities were
                        cold. The doctor on board stated that the woman had embarked at Hodeideh
                        already very ill, and had suffered from chronic dysentery for eight months.
                        Microscopic preparations revealed, besides very numerous bacilli, vibrios
                        similar to those of coma bacilli. Whilst the microscopic examina tion was
                        being made the patient died. The case was considered as one of suspected
                        cholera and the Neghileh was sent baok to Moses' Well. An autopsy will be
                        held by Dr.Bouan,who will also perform the bacteriological examination,
                        whilst Dr. Taranow will examine the cases whioh disembarked yesterday from
                        the Arabia. The Neghileh will be disinfected, and submitted to observation
                        until the result of the bacteriological examination is made known.</p>
                    <p>A later telegram informs ns that the Neghileh has been released. This
                        indicates that the autopsy and bacteriological examination have removed all
                        suspicion of the case being one of cholera, as otherwise the Neghileh would
                        not have been allowed to proceed on her way.</p>

                    <head>THE SOLAR ECLIPSE</head>
                    <p>News FROM PROFESSOR TURNER.</p>
                    <p>We have received the following most interesting communication from Professor
                        H. H. Turner, Savilian Professor of Astronomy at Oxford and head of the
                        Eclipse Mission :—</p>
                    <p>I gladly respond to your invitation to say something of our preparations for
                        observing the total eclipse of the Sun on August 30, if only for the reason
                        that it gives me an opportunity of acknowledging most gratefully the kind
                        assistance we have received and are receiving, on every hand. Captain Lyons,
                        and the officers of the Survey Department, have taken over,from the moment
                        of arrival, countless details, which may indeed be small matters for them to
                        arrange, but which would nevertheless have given strangers, ignorant of
                        Arabic, very considerable trouble. Captain Lyons himself</p>
                    <p>came the long hot journey to Assouan with us merely in order to make sure
                        that we were comfortably placed, and he bas left here two of his assistants,
                        Mr. Keeting and Mr. Dicken to smooth our way from day to day. The Allway
                        administration have very generously allowed the expeditions free use of
                        their lines a concession which Is indeed welcome to a scientific expedition
                        trying to make a small grant go as, far as possible. We have been very
                        courteously treated by the Antiquities Depart aenfc, as will presently
                        appear. Finally the managers of the Savoy Hotel are being kind to us in
                        numerous ways, allowing us to convert empty rooms into dark rooms or store
                        rooms, and to take various liberties with their spacious grounds in the way
                        of building piers, and littering the place with tents and packing cases. We
                        are in fact very well off indeed : his is now my sixth eclipse expedition,
                        and I have never been better treated.</p>
                    <p>But these are perhaps not exactly the things you want to know, though they
                        naturally occupy a prominent position in our minds. You probably wish to
                        know who we are, and what we are going to do. Three ex-leditions have taken
                        up their quarters here : Russian, American, and British. Dr. Doubinski from
                        Pawlowsk will make magnetic observations, to see whether, when the sun's
                        light s cut off, any magnetic influence is also screened. The Antiquities
                        Department have kindly allowed him the use of a commodious tomb for the
                        purpose, and he is conveying his apparatus thither, where it will be free
                        from tremors and disturbing magnetic influences, The other two Russians, Mr.
                        Okoulitach and Mr. Baikoff, will take photographs of the eclipsed Sun, and
                        observe the times of contact.</p>
                    <p>The American expedition is working in concert with two other expeditions, all
                        subsidized by Mr. Crocker of San Francisco, one of which is in Labrador, and
                        the other in Spain. All three are provided with a port of battery of four
                        telescopes, which parcel out among them the field of view all round the
                        eclipsed Sun, and will photograph it in the hope of picking up a new planet
                        nearer the Sun than Mercury. Such planets have been looked for before
                        without success, but that is no reason why they should not be found this
                        time. Besides this battery, Mr. Hussey has brought with him a telescope 40
                        feet long, duplicated in Labrador. These telescopes will photograph the
                        corona with a view to detecting changes. The eclipse occurs in Labrador two
                        and a half hours before it reaches us in Assouan, and in this interval there
                        may have been changes in the corona, which will be detected on comparing the
                        Labrador with the Assouan pictures. But since we know from previous
                        experience that the changes if any, will be very slight and difficult to
                        detect, it is advisable to take the pictures with precisely similar
                        instruments in order that no spurious differences may be introduced by a
                        difference in the instrument. Professor Hussey and Professor West of Beyrout
                        are busily setting up this apparatus on the west shore, and are well
                        satisfied with the progress made.</p>
                    <p>As regards ourselves, Mr. Bellamy and I represent one of five expeditions
                        organised by a joint committee of the Royal Society and the Royal
                        Astronomical Society. The Committee is not merely gammoned for a particular
                        eclipse, but is a permanent one for the management of observations of all
                        eclipses. It was initiated in 1898 and sent ont two expeditions in that
                        year, three in 1896, four in 1898, and one in 1901. Under the auspices of
                        this committee different investigators have taken up particular pieces of
                        work, and carried them out at successive eclipses. My own particular work
                        has been to measure the brightness of the corona at different distances from
                        the Sun’s centre (it falls off in brightness very rapidly) and to measure
                        also how much of the light is reflected light, or in technical terms,
                        radially polarised light. The measurements are made on the photographs after
                        we get them home, but naturally the photographs must be taken in particular
                        ways, which means careful adjustment beforehand. Since 1896 the British
                        expeditions have constantly adopted the plan of reflecting the coronal light
                        into fixed telescopes by means of a mirror driven by dock-work, and called a
                        coelostat. The arrangement has been found very convenient and has been
                        adopted by others also. The telescopes being fixed, it is possible to
                        arrange the various apparatus to a nicety on fixed tables, and when it is
                        put in good adjustment, to screw it down firmly in readiness for the
                        critioal moment. Our coelostats are mounted ; we are about to set up the
                        cameras and telescopes ; and at present hope to be fully ready in very good
                        time.</p>
                    <p>A few days before the eclipse we expect an important addition to our party.
                        Mr. J. H. Reynolds of Birmingham is presenting to the Helouan Observatory a
                        large reflecting tele scope, which ought to do great things in this</p>
                    <p>beautiful climate. He has made a great part of the telescope himself, and is
                        bringing it out to set up at Helenas. But-he is also hoping first to observe
                        the eclipse either with the Helouan telescope or with a much bigger one, 120
                        feet in length. Mr. Reynolds is a busy man, and when I left England he could
                        not say whether his scanty leisure would allow him to get ready the 120 foot
                        telescope in time ; but we expect him on the Orient liner Oroya about a week
                        before the eclipse, and one reason for getting our own apparatus ready in
                        good time is that we may be able to give him all the help possible in
                        setting up one or other of his big instruments.</p>
                    <p>A total eclipse is one of the most impressive natural phenomena which it is
                        possible to witness, and I would urge all who can to take the opportunity of
                        seeing it on August 30, as opportunities are extremely rare. At the same
                        time perhaps I may, without risk of misunderstanding, make a request to any
                        visitors to Assouan ; which is that they will show their consideration by
                        leaving the astronomers as much alone as possible. We have anxious work to
                        do, and a mistake cannot be rectified afterwards. Visitors will reap no
                        advantage by being near any of us - the eclipse can be seen from any place
                        for miles round Assouan, which has a view of the western horizon and we
                        might just be distracted at the important time by the presence of strangers.
                        It will he real kindness to leave us alone, and we have found</p>
                    <p>so universal a desire in Egypt to help as much as</p>
                    <p>as possible that I feel sure nn I may make this request without offence.</p>

                    <p>Port Said, Wednesday. The affairs of the Congal, which now lies</p>
                    <p>behind the coal islands with watchmen on board, have, I understand, been
                        finally arranged. Her owners and underwriters have agreed to pay the Canal
                        Company a sum which reimburses them for their expenses during her raising.
                        It is not yet decided as to what is to become of the vessel ultimately, but
                        it is generally thought that she is to be broken up in one of the sooth

                        a.m. today. She was beautifully fitted up, and had a staff of female nurses,
                        together with several orthodox priests on board, though, like a very large
