           would not be difficult to find &amp; no justification for this standpoint. Caves
                    do occur where do dead advantages accrue to a proprietor who acquires an
                    adjoining property. In agri. cultural land there may be &amp; canal or drain in
                    joint asage which can be best utilised by one proprietor, or there may be a
                    troublesome servitude which disappears if a compact block of land is in the
                    hands of one mag. With building land a proprietor of a good house may real
                    jablay ask the right to acquire an adjoining plot, on which some objectionable
                    structura mizit bu ra: el to the depreciation of the existing property.</p>
                <p>The essence and origin of preemption was preservation. It can be traced back to
                    times when taxes were paid by the community and not by the individual, and
                    consequently it was an advantage to keep on people who right fail in
                    contributing their proper share of taxes. Also the season of the barem could
                    only be preserved if adjoining blocks were not built upon with houses
                    overlooking the existing premises. All this was perfectly reasonable and just,
                    and a proprietor is entitled to be protected from injury to his property when he
                    is quite willing to give us mach for an adjoining plot as any ontsider. Some
                    four or five years ago the law of pre-emption was mooh modified as regards
                    agricultural land, and it has been pat on a basis which is fairly reasonable.
                    There must now be some very tangible reason before the law of pre-emption can be
                    invoked over agricultural land. But in building land it isn't so, and cases are
                    constantly arising where a parohaser, having with expense, difficulty, and sound
                    knowledge of values, acquired a property, finds all his experience and trouble
                    go to barich someone else. That the owner of a house should preempt enough of
                    adjoining land to protect it from being overlooked is reasonable, but that the
                    owner bold preempts an aros ten times more than is needed for this purpose is
                    most adjusted. That a man interested as co-proprietor of such a bonse, or even
                    of a building plot without a house, shoald exercise the right of pre-emption and
                    hand-it over to someone else is iniquitous.</p>
                <p>Pre-emption is being used now not for protective purposes, but to secara
                    properties after other people have proved their value. There should be no lying
                    low till value is proved and profits shown, and then try to pre-empt profits. In
                    many cases the pre-emptor already refused the property, not trusting his own
                    Judgment, and afterwards took it when its value was ascertained by a sale.
                    Pre-emption claims are too often based on greed, spite, and unfair competition,
                    very fow on real jasti. fiable protection of property. People beaten in fair
                    competition for a property bava afterwards called in and paid an adjoining
                    proprietor to exercise his right in their favour. The Tribadala have wisely
                    refused to grant the right in certain casas, but the law as it stands at present
                    is too vagao, and allows too much latitude for bringing unfounded actions.</p>

                <p> The Orthodox New Year has been celebrated in Russia without any renewal of
                    revolutionary disorder, and if the next month can be passed quietly, the country
                    should be safe for some little while: there will, at any rate, be no immediate

                    <p>- - Prince Arther of Connaught and the members of the mission have left Port
                        Said for Tokyo with the insignia of oor highest order of chivalry, the
                        Garter, for presentation to oor august ally, the Baporor of Japan. If,
                        therefore, there be any troth in the romoar that the Mikado felt a sense of
                        affront when, a few years ago, this high bonjour was conferred on the Shab
                        instead of on himself, that wound to his pride should now be beared. In any
                        case, it is certain that the islanders of the Par Bast will warmly
                        appreciate the lofty distinction the islanders of the Park West bestow. on
                        the statesman and Sovereign who carried through the recent war against
                        Russia with such splendid success. But that brilliant performance does not
                        give the reason for his inclusion in the membership of the Most Noble Order
                        of the Garter." Japan has become, by the evolution of circumstances, joint
                        guarantor with Great Britain of Asiatic tranquillity, and the bestowal of
                        the Garter may be considered, therefore, to seal the compact. It is not
                        directed against any particular Power; on the contrary, all whose
                        aspirations are of non-aggressive obaracter should welcome the placing of
                        Asiatico peace on a much more Npower basis. As regards commerce, all alike
                        benefit by the arrangement jnat settled between Japan and China with respect
                        to Manchuria, where all nations will stand on the same footing as traders,
                        while China gaina greatly by being allowed time to reorganise her defensive
                        forces on a more efficient ground plan.</p>

                    <p>TIIE DEBENTURE ISSUE.</p>
                    <p>The rocont suicidal engine by the Egyptian Estate of its 1st D.banturos has
                        attracted considerable attention in the City. Wo extract the following from
                        the "Moraing Post" of Friday last :</p>
                    <p>Only ning or ter months bave olapre i. since the Ezyptian Estates (Limited)
                        was formed and only £303,000 out of its half-million sterling of share
                        capital--including the shilling Deferred Shares--hag yet been issued, but
                        the directors now invite the subscription of £150,000 of 5 perCent. Ist
                        Dabentaros, half the amount which they are entitled to borrow. They are of
                        the opinion that they will have no difficulty in using the proceeds with
                        advan. tage equal to that which has attended the utilisation of the share
                        capital already raisol. There are, of course, as yet no accounts to indicate
                        the measure of this advantage in coal figures, but the directors describe it
                        in general terms. They say that since the establishment of the company it
                        has entered into many important transactions. It has become po 39888ed of
                        various properties, comprising Agricultural land partially cultivated,
                        building land, house property, buildings, and 80 oa, in various parts of
                        Lower Egypt, and valas being building sites and o her pro. parties in Cairo,
                        Alexandria, and Mansourah. The operations of the company from the first have
                        been, they state, remarkably 890 essful the properties paribas+d having been
                        carefully selected. Those now from singing in the company's possession are
                        of a 8000d character, and have, in the opinion of the board, without
                        exception, materially increased in value, in goveralia. stances sales could
                        be nado at a considerable profit, whilst the sales already effected have
                        yielded handsome profits to the company. In addition to purchase of property
                        the directors have made considerable loans against adequate security at
                        remunerativa interest. Some of gach loan is repayable at short dates, so
                        that the money; employed shall be available, when opportunity afforded, for
                        profit table fixed invest. ment. The directors do not seem to share the
                        ideas that some are bold that there is a land boom in Egypt which must
                        collapse by 730 ; on the contrary, they remark that the value of real
                        property there is still improving. There is Qatarally no independent
                        certification in the prospectos of the value of the company's 83Bets upon
                        which the new debentara isece is secured, bat the document show:
                        approximately how the company's foods are invested - £128,000 in building
                        estates, towa properties, and agri. cultural stats; £50,000 in mortgages at
                        interest averaging 7 por coot. ; £2,000 cash in hand and at short notice;
                        and in addition the company has a first lion on properties sold by it
                        representing an ascertained profit of £57,000. The chairm up of th's company
                        is Mr. Groville H. Palmer, &amp; director of the Bank of Egypt, and the
                        dopaty-chairman is Mr. Gerald A. Sheppard, connected with the firm of
                        Messrs. Sheppard, Pelly, Price, and Pott, who are the brokers of the
                        company. The prospectus states that Meiers. Shoppards, Pollys, and Co. have
                        underwritten the whole of the present for a commission of 2} per cent and a
                        brokerage fee of a thousand guineas.</p>

                    <head>TOWARDS SALONICA.</head>
                    <p>There is something very doubtful about the quiet which is now brooding over
                        the Balkan pepingule, and it is impossible to avoid the suspicion that some
                        move or other is in con. temptation by the Powers interested in, which they
                        are unwilling that the rest of the world should know of. The Constantinople
                        correspondent of the "Vossische Zeitung" affirms that Austrian troops have
                        already occupied the district of Plov.js, in Torkish territory, and that
                        reinforcements are being secretly sent there. The story, of conroe, has been
                        denied officially, but the correspondent ro tarne to the charge by recalling
                        the fact that in October last, Austria proposed to the Porte the appointment
                        of a Mixed Commission to decide on the exact frontier between Bosnia and the
                        district of Plavlje, and that the Porte not only refused the proposal, but
                        complained of the percent of Austrians in Tarkish territory. Th3 town of
                        Pljevlja is the first place of any importance on the high road from Bosnia
                        to Novibazar, and on the Austrian maps it is marketed as being about
                        thirteen miles inside the frontier. If it is true that the Aastrians are
                        laying down a line of rails from Rodow, in Bosnia, to Plovlje, it is evident
                        that Austria has at last started on the road to Salonics, with the
                        connivance of Russia. Who shall soon know what are really Austria':
                        intentions towards Macedonia, and what price she has paid for the silence of
                        Germany and Rassis.</p>

                    <p>In his interesting discourse before the Biological Society, on woman's
                        intellectual position, Dr. Bernard Hollander mentioned that the late
                        Professor Bischoff, of Monich, was oco of the lea ling physiologists of
                        Europa to adopt the hypothesis of the mental inferiority of woman to inın,
                        chiefly on the ground that the average: weight of a man's brain was 47} oz.
                        į or 3 oz more than a woman's. After his death a post-mortem revealed the
                        curious fact that his own brain weighed only 433 oz., or rather ie3: then
                        the weight be assigned to the average woman's brain. As Dr. Hollander
                        contended, it was not so mnoy the size of the entire brain, as the size of
                        that portion in the frontal lobes which governs intellectual capacity.</p>

                            and were written for the sake of posterity, while the last give, as the

                        there seems to be no doubt that the depressing rumors that have been in

                        probably be the cockpit of any arined straggle. It is known about Metz and
                        Strasbourg that the officers instructing recruits have this y sar received

                        <p>The following article recently appeared in the "Times" :</p>
                        <p>The extraordinary prosperity of Egypt bas begin to attract the attention
                            of the British public, and the general ignorance which prev. ailed op to
                            a very few years ago with regard to this country is giving place to a
                            desire to know something of its possibilities. In course of time there
                            will probably be a fairly general move. ment to purchase Egyptian
                            securities, but at present the small investor usually regards financial
                            and industrial enterprises in foreign countries with much distrast,
                            partly owing to bitter experience in regard to gold-mining ventures. As
                            a field for the profitable in the vert ment of money, Egypt offers many
                            attractions which are quite known to the general public, both which are
                            becoming familiar to Mary visitors among the thousands who wictor on the
                            Nilo,more especially to those who associate with residents of the
                            country. It is interesting to recall Lord Cromer's remarks of six years
                            ago (Egypt No. 3, 1889) on the investment of capital in Egypt.</p>
                        <p>"Pour some years after the occupation of Egypt bat little British capital
                            came into the country. This was in some measure due to want of
                            confidence in the political future. In the meanwhile foreign capitalists
                            sought with some Eagerness for Egyptian investments, often with saccos.
                            A sudden and complete change has now taken placo. A very marked
                            disposition has recently been shown to direct the tide of British
                            capital towards Egypt. The tendency is to be welcomed; but inai machi 39
                            in most cases tb, compliance, and in some C1803 the assistance of the
                            Government is invoked, grave responsibility rests on the latter to avoid
                            encouraging any sound, ill-considered, or purely speculative project.
                            Whilst the influx of British capital into Egypt may do a great deal of
                            good if it is directed into healthy channels, it may on the other hand
                            do inach harm, both to the country, to Bgyptian credit, and to the bona
                            fide investors thetusel var, if the contrary is the case. Simultaneously
                            with the influx of British capital in!o Egypt to which I have alluded
                            above, &amp; somewhat remarkable change has taken place in dative
                            pablia, opinion. Heretofore, native capitalists bare, with some rare
                            exceptions, invested their money almost exclusively in land. Recently,
                            however, a strong disposition has been shown to seek for investments in
                            industrial sod commercial undertakings. The obange is on every ground to
                            be welcomed, and the tendency may be encouraged by the Government
                            stipulating, in respect to all such undertakings as are in any degree
                            under its control, that a certain proportion of the share capital board
                            in all future cr998 be reserved for the local market. I am given to
                            understand that this tendency exists notably in respect to all
                            commercial projects brought forward dodear British auspices."</p>

                            for many years been one of the law officers of the Bgyptian Government
                            :</p>
                        <p>"In the present state of the law the Bgyptian Government is in theory
                            armed with absolute discretionary power as regards the creation of
                            limited liability companies (sociétés anonymous). and, by reason of the
                            extent of its power, besi. tates to make use of it ; 88 a matter of
                            fact, no authorisation has ever been refused for fear of hindering the
                            industrial and commercial development of Egypt; after examination,
                            permission is always accorded. Bnt this examination is necessarily
                            superficial. Even on the assumption that it were more thoroughly
                            conducted, it may safely be affirmed that the Government is liable to be
                            imposed upon by the skill of Bone anscrap loos agent. Should this be the
                            case, the degree of authorisation gives in some degree official sanction
                            to the propo:al; the public thinks, or at all events is liable to thick,
                            that the undertaking, had been studied in all its details by Government
                            officials, and that it is to some extent patronised by the Government.
                            The result is that, in case of disaster, a certain amount of moral
                            responsibility rests on the State." Lord Cromer then went on to say: — ✓
                            "It cannot be too clearly understood by investors both in Egypt and in
                            Europe that the mere fact of a prospectos appearing with the phrase
                            'Authorized by Khedivial Decree' or similar words printed on it merely
                            signifies that certain formalities prescribed by the law of Egypt have
                            been fulfilled. The use of this expression does not necessarily imply
                            that the Khedivial Government, crits Brittsb adviser, A8ame any

                            stated in the prospectos, Still less does it imply that the proposal
                            laid before the public is one which will receive pecuniary support, or
                            even a couragement, from the Government. </p>

                        the investor's point of view. But I do not wish it to be inferred that all
                        such companies can claim the confidence of investors. There are good ones
                        and bad, and among the latter is more than one that fails the oven to
                        justify its existence. For example, the public in England was invited a few
                        months ago to subscribe towards the for. mation of the North Egypt Land
                        Company (Limited), whose object was to buy and develop a tract of land in
                        the Mariout district, the sole security for its success being the assumption
                        that the Government might be expected to extend a certain canal to within
                        reach of the property and thus provide the facility for irrigation without
                        which the property is prac. tically valueless. It is well known here that
                        Government has po prosent intention of prolonging the capa!, and that, even
                        in the event of boch a project being carried out, the supply of| water could
                        only be very precarious, and even then that the water would have to be
                        raised a considerable height to get it on the land. To those who are
                        familiar with the country this project appeared from the first to be a
                        hopeless ventare. There have been other land companies floated which,
                        instead of setting to work seriously on goond operations in connexion with
                        lard, building property, or trade, have Used their funds to promote or
                        boleter op gold and other mining corcoran. Generally, I would warn investors
                        (unless they have trustworthy first-hand information) to avoid companies
                        which associate themselves with the Egyptian mining industry.</p>

                    <head>QUIRINAL AND VATICAN.</head>
                    <p>Since the New Year began an event has occurred which has placed the relations
                        between the kingdom and the Papacy in Italy on &amp; mora common sense
                        footing, and which will no doubt lest to a better understanding between
                        Church and State in Italy. The prefoot Pope Pius X. has been gifted with the
                        faculty of seeing things as they are, which was denied to b's predecessors,
                        and he has accepted a payment of the kingdom towards the expenses of foreign
                        missions, namely Pius IX. and Leo XIII. thought fit to refuse. In 1873 tha
                        I:alina Parliament suppressed the religious orders and dis-endowed them,
                        but, at the same time, it allotted &amp; som of £16,000 for the maintenance
                        of the orders abroad. This sum the Pope released officially, as inconsistent
                        with his pose as a Prisoner in the Vatican. In 1876 the Vicariat begged to
                        be allowed to make use of the money, and 80 the kingdom bugso to make songal
                        payments, which at last amounted to £8,000 per annum. The money was paid,
                        but nothing was said about it in order that the feelings of the Vatican
                        might not be injured. The present Pope is a bater of sbams, and be decided
                        to put the payment on a proper footing. He, therefore, entered into
                        negotiations with the Italian Government on the subject, and though he might
                        have legally claimed all arrears since 1873, with interest, he wisely
                        preferred not to cast goch a slur on the memory of his predecessors, and has
                        accepted an appeal payment of £12,390 in discharge of all liabilities. The
                        difficulties with France have induced the Vatican to draw closer to Italy,
                        and the result bas been so to strengthen the hands of the Pope as to enable
                        him to abandon an optenable position.</p>

                        long ago, when it was the fashion brosd to represent that British

                        and more scientific methods of our competitor ; and to this cry our national
                        habit of self depreciation materially contributed. There can be no doubt
                        that a twin porary disposition to make * fuller trial of American and German

                        de celui de l'Unifiée qui porte 1/S de baisse.</p>

                        hausse à 80.5.</p>
                    <p>Ici, le marboré des valeurs a été, ce matin, ferme et quelque peu plus animé
                        que cos jours derniers.</p>
                    <p>La National Bank a avancé à 25 7/8 l'action ancienne et 25 la nouvelle.
                        L'Agricole s'est inscrite à 9 9/16 l'ancienne et 9 3/32 la nouvelle. La

                        1 1/8.</p>
                    <p>Suivant les dernières informations d'Alexandrie, la Société Égyptienne
                        d'entreprises urbaines et rurales aurait rompu les négociations avec la
                        Building Lande. Elle traiterait maintenant pour une fusion avec la Société
                        des Immeubles, qui possède une bonne partie des propriétés de la Chérif
                        Pacha. Rien ne serait encore décidé, la Société des Entreprises urbaines et
                        rurales 8 montrant, dit-on, très exigeante.</p>
                    <p>Ajoutons au sujet de cette société qu'en dehors des dividendes qu'elle
                        distribue sur les actions et les parts de fondateur, elle mettra £ 7 &amp;
                        8,000 à la réserve.</p>
                    <p>La même société vient de gagner en première instance le procès de préemption
                        qui lai avait été intenté sur les terrains de la Compagnie da Gas et ceux y
                        attenant.</p>
                    <p>Ces terrains avaient été acquis au prix de LE. 4 lo pio; or, on offre
                        actuellement à la Société LR 8 le pic Il y aurait lå op bénéfice de LE.
                        30,000 qni ne serait compte que dans le prochain exercice.</p>
                    <p>Oa nous écrit de Londres à la date du 12 janvier :</p>
                    <p>"La souscription aux £150,000 d'obligations 5 % au pair, émises par
                        l'Egyptian Estates Company, a été ouverte aujourd'hui et sera close lundi
                        prochain. L'émission est garantie par une commission de 2 et 1/2 pour cent.
                        On cote nominalement 1/2 A 1 1/2 de prime.</p>
                    <p>"Relativement à la Banque d'Abyssinie, la liquidation spéciale demandés pour
                        les 7.00) titres alloués à Londres, liquidation qai était sur le point
                        d'être fixée par le comité du Stock Exchange, a été remise. La cause de cet
                        ajournement est que l'inscription n'était pas tout à fait en règle ; les
                        changements, qui y ont été introduits devront être confirmés par la Banque
                        d'Abyssinie, et aussitôt cette confirmation recao, l'affaire reviendra
                        devant le Comité. On entendra alors ceux qui s'opposent à cette liquidation
                        spéciale à cause de leurs ventes pour compte de l'étranger. On est
                        généralement d'avis que los protestataires se trouveront forcés de racheter
                        et que le Comité scoordera la liquidation demandée.</p>
                    <p>Nous extrayons d'une autre lettre de Lon. dres, on date du 12 janvier, le
                        passage suivant relatif à la situation monétaire :</p>
                    <p>"L'effet des disponibilités apportées par les coupons de janvier se fait
                        sentir, mais dans d'assez faibles proportions, car il est en partie
                        Neutralisé par la faiblesse de la réserve de la Banque d'Angleterre, par la
                        crainte d'un exode important d'or, notamment vers l'Amérique du Sud, par la
                        situation toujours troublée de marché de New-York, enfia par l'intention
                        attribuée au gouvernement français d'augmenter la limite de la circulation
                        des billets de la Banque de France et, par conséquent, de favoriser les
                        importations d'or.</p>
                    <p>Aussi bien, en présence de ces conditionné du marché monétaire, les valeurs
                        no se mouvent qae dans des limites extrêmement étroites. Le Stock Exchange
                        est ferme, mais il ne s'en tient pas moins sur la réserve. Il n'a pas
                        encore, en tout cas, la physionomie qu'on espérait lui voir reprendre dans
                        la première quinzaine de janvier."</p>

                        <p>LE VOYAGE DE M, PERRICHON</p>
                        <p>Cette pièce est sans doute la meilleure et la plus amusante de
                            Labiche.</p>
                        <p>L'acteur nous peint à souhait le bonhomme Perrichon, on Carrossier
                            enrichi. La vulgarité de ses gestes et de ses attitudes, sa façon de
                            parler simple et drôle en font son caractère des mieux définis.</p>
                        <p>Les scènes de son voyage et de sa vie privée BOLt divertissantes et le
                            dialogue pétille d'esprit, sans toutefois tomber dans la vulgarité.</p>
                        <p>En somme la comédie de Labiche, bien que déjà vieille, a été bien
                            accueillie du public, gai d'etat fort am08 é.</p>
                        <p>L'interprétation a été excellente. M. Coquelin Cadet a d'é parfait dans
                            le rôle de Perrichon, qu'il a d'ailleurs interprété des centaines de
                            fois.</p>
                        <p>M. Coquelin Cadet, qui part aujourd'hui pour la France, a dit à la fin de
                            la représentation qu'il regrettait de quitter Alexandrie, mais qu'il
                            espérait y revenir et y trouver un Nouveau théâtre.</p>

                    <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                        January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so warm as
                        Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm
                        than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in
                        the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest
                        place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                        sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on each of
                        the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="3"/>
                    <p>They are as follows:-</p>
                    <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southhampton,
                        London or Liverpool—occupy about 4 days. The short ones are as follows:—</p>

                    <p>The steamers, of the P.&amp;O. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageriea
                        Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines are
                        also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by travellers to
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made without change
                        in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp;O.
                        Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna
                        express from Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis” to Brindisi. One of these leaves port
                        Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian <cb n="6"
                        />mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                    <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                        attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats" having
                        been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi.
                        If you are going straight through to England you will find the train waiting
                        at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete
                        arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in
                        London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <head>SICILY.</head>
                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMENA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. Giardini is the
                        station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina is most delightful,
                        occupying about one hour. In and around the town is much to interest the
                        visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but restored under the Romans.
                        CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of Etna and here also is a fine
                        Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all over
                        the island, are an endless sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting
                        history, having been a Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C.
                        413, and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb
                        is to be seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                        about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                        delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city. The
                        Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of S.
                        Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral,
                        Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also worth a
                        visit.</p>

                    <head>CENTRAL ITALY.</head>
                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                        bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento
                        [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                        City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence itself the churches
                        and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the local promenades and
                        excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is the most attractive and
                        fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the Viale dei Colli, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea
                        level. This is made first by ordinary train from Florence to St. Ellero,
                        thence by cog-wheel railway to Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks
                        takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; hero there is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                        and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                        house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                        and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                    <head>NORTHERN ITALY</head>
                    <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                        the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and deliciously cool
                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                        SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal springs,
                        change trains at Borgo San Donino and in half-an-hour you are at
                        Salsomaggiore.</p>

                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea port.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea, no hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                        lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza :</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo, Cadenabbia,
                        and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio opposite. The walk
                        from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio is most enjoyable. A
                        steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake Lugano in three-quarters
                        of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                        on the trip from Lucerne, to Fluelen is a source of delight to the lover of
