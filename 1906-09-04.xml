                        deliciously cool feeling to the skin.</p>
                    <p>Its unique properties are due to Icilma Natural Water so that it may well be

                        overheated blood, and to preserve the youthful fresh look to which hot climates

                    <head>THE TURKISH SUCCESSION.</head>
                    <p>For some weeks there have been mysterious
                    rumours of the possibility of an attempt to
                    change the succession to the Turkish Throne.
                    The most persistent is that it is the desire of 
                    Abdul Hamid to appoint his third son, Prince 
                    Burhaneddin, as his successor, and for this
                    purpose to obtain the consent of the Sheik-ul-
                    Islam and of the Ambassadors of the Great 
                    Powers. It is even added that Abdul Hamid 
                    is thinking of abdicating in favour of this
                    Prince.</p>
                    <p>The rumoured step would (the Constanti-
                    nople correspondent of the "Tribune" think) 
                    be an exceedingly grave one. It is probable 
                    that any attempt to make such a change 
                    without the consent of the ulema class, of
                    whom the Sheik-ul-Islam is the head, would 
                    fail, and might simply plunge the coyntry into 
                    revolution. It is further rumoured that the 
                    Sheik-ul-Islam has been sounded, and that he 
                    has declared that such a change could never 
                    be sanctioned.This, however,we do not believe.
                    <cb n="6"/>
                    Rumour farther says that the German Emperor 
                    has been asked for his counsel, and that the
                    sudden return here, a week ago, of the German 
                    Ambassador is in connexion with this question.</p>
                    <p>While fully admitting that we are dealing 
                    only with rumours, these are so persistent-and 
                    definite as to suggest that they have a basis of 
                    truth, and the questions raised by them become 
                    interesting and important.</p>
                    <p>The Moslem law of succession to a royal 
                    throne is bated upon long usage, and enacts 
                    that tae heir is the eldest male in the Royal 
                    or Imperial family. A simple illustration is 
                    furnished by the recent history of Egypt. 
                    When Mehmet Ali became by Imperial firman 
                    and the recognition of Europe, Vice-Roy of 
                    Egypt, the Sultan issued a firman in 1846 by 
                    which the successions was to be regulated in 
                    the Moslem fashion, that is, the heir was 
                    always to be the eldest male descended from 
                    Mehmet Ali. The rule was strictly followed 
                    till the time of Ismail. On the death of Ismail 
                    the legal heir to the Khedival throne should 
                    have been Prince Halim, the youngest son of 
                    Mehmet ALi. But Ismail, in 1866. by means 
                    of very heavy payments, had induced Abdul 
                    Aziz, the Sultan of Turkey (who was deposed 
                    and "suicided” in 1876), to grant a new firman, 
                    by which the succession was changed from the 
                    Moslem to the general European system of 
                    succession.</p>
                    <p>When the representatives of England and 
                    France decided in 1870 to get rid of Ismail, 
                    they secretly, but unmistakably, gave him the 
                    opportunity to leave Egypt quietly, in which 
                    case the firman which be had obtained would 
                    be recognized, and his son allowed to reign in 
                    his stead. If he refused, Hahim, the “de jure" 
                    heir by Moslem law, would be placed on 
                    the throne. He agreed to go quietly. It 
                    was generally believed in Stamboul that Abdul
                    Aziz, in granting the firman changing the
                    Egyptian succession, had the intention to
                    change the succession to the Turkish throne.
                    In such case Prince Yussouf Izzedin would
                    have been the heir-apparent. The revolution
                    of 1876 put an end to any such design, and
                    Murray, and then the present occupant, 
                    were girded with the sword of Osman in confor-
                    city with the well-established rule. At the
                    time, however, when the project of changing 
                    the Ottoman rule of succession was in the air,
                    it was well understood that the ulema class
                    were strongly opposed to it. They represent
                    the conservative element of Islam ; and unless
                    some very special circumstances should be
                    brought forward, they would oppose a stout
                    resistance to any change of the kind.</p>
                    <p>The present heir to the throne is Reshad
                    Effendi, the Sultan’s brother. Both he and
                    Izzedin and two elder brothers rank, on the
                    ground of age, before the third son of the 
                    present Sultan. The supposed favorite of
                    his Majesty for the succession in his third son, 
                    who is known to the Ambassadors as a bright
                    and intelligent young man of about twenty 
                    years old. The question is mainly, though
                    not exclusively, of course, one for the subjects
                    of his Majesty, and especially for his Moslem
                    subjects. If the change is attempted, it will 
                    probably give rise to considerable trouble.</p>
                    <p>The suggestions that Abdul Hamid would 
                    be willing to abdicate does not strike me as
                    probable. Those who are in favor of his doing
                    so speak disparagingly of Reshad Effendi ; but
                    there will be always a party strongly in his
                    favor as representing the reign of Moslem
                    law. There are precedents for passing over the
                    heir, but the change has always been regarded
                    as revolutionary.</p>
                    <p>Though, of course, the personality of the 
                    Sultan is for foreign States as a matter of great
                    importance, the representatives of such States
                    will probably best consult the interests of
                    their Governments, and certainly of Turkey,
                    by having nothing to do with any proposal to
                    change the succession. The fact that they or
                    any of them favoured one candidate more than
                    another would do much to make him unpopular
                    with the Moslem population. The matter is
                    primarily one for the Moslem people of Turkey, 
                    and for a foreign Government to pronounce an 
                    opinion one way or another would have the
                    appearance of mixing in a Palace intrigue.</p>
                    <p>If it be said that Turkey is more of less under
                    European tutelage, and that the unanimous
                    consent of Europe to a change of Moslem law
                    would give it a sanction which would secure
                    its general acceptance, our reply would be that
                    unanimity on this subject is impossible, and to
                    attempt to obtain it would occasion endless
                    intrigue. It may be admitted that if the general
                    consent of Europe could be obtained it might
                    establish an important precedent. But if such
                    consent has been applied for, and if, as is 
                    rumored, negotiations are going on, it is
                    because opposition is anticipated either by
                    Turkey or by some foreign State. Even an
                    attempt by the Concert of Europe would be
                    denounced by the Moslem population as an
                    interference by the gainers with their religious
                    rights.</p>
                    <p>There is much to be said for and much
                    against the alleged project. The generally-
                    expressed opinion is that certain Palace favou-
                    rites, for their own purposes, are in its favor,
                    and this would not recommend it to the 
                    Turkish population, and still less to Europeans. 
                    Indeed, in whatever way the expediency of a
                    change in the law of succession may be regar-
                    red, its practical application will be dangerous.
                    It will almost certainly lead to disturbances,
                    and it ought to be a question for Turkish
                    statesmen whether it is desirable to add to the
                    many difficulties with which they have to deal
                    a possible war of succession. For foreign States
                    the question is at once tempting and dange-
                    rous. In the solution of the many questions in
                    the Near East with which our country is con-
                    corned, it is difficult to see what advantage
                    could be gained by entering upon it. Sir Edward
                    Grey will probably conclude that his wisest 
                    course is to reserve speech or action, and take
                    up the position that Great Britain will stand
                    aloof, and neither approve nor disprove any
                    action of the kind which the Palace advisers
                    may choose to take.</p>

                    the breast, causing a severe wound. The man 
                    is now in Damanhour hospital in a precarious 
                    condition. Two of the ruffians have been 
                    arrested, and the police have left for that 
                    village which is ten kilometres from Daman 
                    hour in search for the third.</p>

                    cedented heat wave. The thermometer register-
                    ed over ninety degrees in the shade for several 
                    days. Football players and spectators have, in 
                    several cases, been carried off in a state of 
                    prostration. On Saturday the hospital at 
                    Northampton took fire : it is believed to have 
                    been caused by the rafters becoming ignited 
                    by the sun's rays. There were many cases of 
                    corn stacks, petroleum tanks, trees, etc., being 
                    set on fire.		(Reuter)</p>

                    <head>"BEWARE OF ARIF!"</head>
                    <p>The reason that led to the extraordinay 
                    arrest of Mahmoud Arif Bey, an Egyptian and 
                    a Wakil of the Wakfs Administration, as soon 
                    as he had landed in Stamboul, ire now revealed. 
                    Before he sailed by the Kahira for Constanti-
                    nople,the following telegram was sent by one of 
                    the Turkish cabal to Tewfik Pasha, the Ottoman 
                    Foreign Minister -"Mahmoud Arif has left 
                    for Stamboul. He is an emissary of the 
                    Young Turks. Beware!”</p>	
                    <p>Great was the excitement in the Bawab 
                    Aali on receipt of this startling news, and a 
                    number of the hafieh (or secret police) were 
                    posted at various points along Galata Quay on 
                    the moment of the arrival of the Khedivial 
                    Mail Liner “El Kahira.”</p>
                    <p>Aril Bey, all the time unconscious of what 
                    was awaiting him, had risen early to admire 
                    the beauties of the Bosphorus, the prospect of 
                    which with its delicious gold-spangled waters 
                    and fairy-like retreats made him long to be 
                    ashore. He was the first at the gangway, and 
                    was just stepping onto quay when the order 
                    tut! (seize) was given, and before Aril Bey 
                    knew where he was, be found himself in a 
                    closed araba with two policemen on either 
                    side, driving rapidly over Galata Bridge to the 
                    Grand Zaptieh, the grim dungeon which is 
                    reserved for Armenians and political offenders. 
                    Without a word of explanation, or apology, he 
                    was hustled unceremoniously into a dark and 
                    loathsome cell, and there confined. Unfortuna-
                    tely he had left his money behind, and without 
                    means, he lived on the coarse prison bread, and 
                    putrid water for some days during which he 
                    was allowed to see no one, although he begged 
                    the zaptieh in charge to convey a note to Bebek.</p>
                    <p>As chance would have it, the kavass of the 
                    Khedivial Palace, who had boarded the 
                    Kahira for the mails, had seen Mahmoud Bey 
                    Arif carried off to Stamboul, and he lost no 
                    time in taking the first Shirket steamer to 
                    Bebek, and informed the secretaries of the 
                    case.</p>
                    <p>All praise is due to Izzet Bey, the President 
                    of the Khedivial Court, who moved heaven 
                    and earth to get Arif Bey released ; had it not 
                    been for him Arif Bay might long have 
                    languished in his Turkish cell.</p>
                    <p>Arif Bey, who is in his prime, is no Young 
                    Turk: he is on the contrary an ardent 
                    Nationalist, and most popular. His arrest 
                    made quite a stir amongst the nation and
                    press.</p>
                    <p>We have already advocated the need for the 
                    proper recognition of the Egyptian nationality 
                    in Turkey, by means of a Kapu Kethudassi, or 
                    Diplomatic Agency, with powers similar to 
                    those of the Bulgarian Agent. Dependent on 
                    that also is the question of a Habeas Corpus 
                    for the Khedive's subjects.</p>

                    <p>"Al-Zaher’s” correspondent at Alexandria 
                    writes :</p>
                    <p>Formerly, in my comments upon the Denish-
                    wai affair I mentioned that the Intelligence 
                    Department, Cairo, inquired, during the past 
                    summer into the political aims of Mustapha 
                    Pasha Kamel, and the reasons of his depar-
                    ture for Berlin where he arranged to meet 
                    the German authorities ; and also as to the 
                    functionary who provided him with letters of 
                    introduction enabling him to have private 
                    meetings with high German officials. Readers 
                    also remember my remarks on Lord Cromer's 
                    statement published in the White Book to 
                    the effect that “there are in Egypt some 
                    parties who are planning plots against the 
                    present Government, with the assistance of 
                    one or two foreign Governments.” It was 
                    therefore not without reason that the “Temps" 
                    accused Mustapha Pasha Kamel of working 
                    together with Baron von Oppenheim in the 
                    interests of Turkey, Against the Egyptian 
                    Government. However, as a matter of fact, we 
                    ought to do the Pasha justice by removing 
                    the charge preferred against him, for, as the 
                    "Moayad" said, we believe that he serves his 
                    country rashly and that he does not repre-
                    sent any party in Egypt. On the other hand 
                    Mastapha Pasha Kamel is not the man to 
                    fulfil such an important position in this 
                    country, which is not yet full grown in civilisa-
                    tion, and even if the soul of Garibaldi himself 
                    were to be transmigrated into Mustapha 
                    Kamel he would fail to find around him 
                    three Egyptians ready to obey his orders. 
                    Moreover, the Pasha is a wily young man, 
                    enlightened, acquainted with law and does 
                    not ignore the strength and influence of the 
                    British Occupation in Egypt. He it too intel-
                    ligent to ignore also the consequences of 
                    agreeing with foreign governments or official 
                    in order to conspire against his own govern-

                    <p>This Company has decided not to take over 
                    the business of Mr. Edgar Kirby and Co., of 
                    Alexandria and Cairo.</p>
                    <p>The Company had originally five options : </p>
                    <p>The firm of R. Kuster &amp; Co., engineers,
                    ionfounders, contractors to the Government,
                    tie railways, and gas and water Companies.
                    The firm of Edgar Kirby &amp; Co., of Alaxan-
                    dria, Cairo, and Mansourah, Government con-
                    tactors, sanitary engineers, and general 
                    merchants.</p>

                    contraotors, engineers, boilermakers, mill-
                    wrights, &amp;c, with works within a few yards of 
                    the Nile, and adjascent to the railway, and 
                    conprising business premises, residential 
                    houses-—all freehold, and containing 5,197 
                    square metres.</p>
                    <p>The Mansourah Electric Light Concession, 
                    which was granted by the Municipality of 
                    Musourah in the year 1899.</p>
                    <p>A Freehold Building Site, situate on the
                    Island of Rodah, containing some 14,400
                    square metres of land (over three acres).
                    Of the above options the only one which it 
                    has been decided to exercise is that of R.
                    Kuster and Co. This firm’s position has been 
                    met carefully investigated by Messrs. Russell,
                    Ker and Wyatt.</p>
                    <p>There have been various rumours current as 
                    to a hitch having arisen in regard to the deve-
                    lopment of the Company, but we are author-
                    ised to state that there has been no "contre-
                    temps" of any sort or kind and the Company 
                    has every prospect of a successful future, as the 
                    form of Kuster and Co. is one of the soundest 
                    in Egypt. It is the intention of the Company to 
                    take over any other businesses, which it is 
                    thought will be profitable investments.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Louis Sinclair, the Managing Director 
                    of the Company,will arrive in Egypt in October.</p>

                    <p>The allied scheme of the Uzai garden-city 
                    continues to be the order of the day, and seems 
                    to have enlisted the interest of serious and 
                    important Anglo-Egyptian Companies. Habib 
                    Bey Ghanem and Salim Bey Shakir, who are 
                    said to have been delegated by the Enter-
                    prise and Development Company to treat 
                    with Ibrahim Tabet Bey, have obtained 
                    from the latter an option for the purchase 
                    of his vast domain in Uzai, which amounts 
                    to over three million square meters. The 
                    terms of this preliminary agreement, which 
                    are advantageous to both parties, are subject 
                    to the ratification of the Directors at Cairo, 
                    the extreme limit of the option being the 
                    middle of October next, when the important 
                    section of the Egyptian business world ret-
                    urns from their summer holiday. Knowing
                    the principal terms of the agreement, I may 
                    say that the Company may be congratulated 
                    on the good deal it has made through its

                    <head>MENZALEH CANAL COMPANY.</head>
                    <head>PROGRESS AND PROSPECTS.</head>
                    <p>A Port Said correspondent writes :—</p>
                    <p>The returns of the Lake Menzaleh, Canal 
                    Company average about £5 a day from pas-
                    senger and cargo traffic. This average of 
                    receipts is considerably less than the cost of 
                    running the steamboats. Until the canal is 
                    carried right to the Suez Canal there is little 
                    prospect of the carriage of cotton being made 
                    payable, as at present the steam boats have to 
                    be unloaded at Karputi and thence the cargo
                    has to be brought by train to Port Said. The 
                    tram service is not what it ought to be, being 
                    merely dependent on horse traction.</p>
                    <p>When the Menzaleh Canal opens right into 
                    the Suez Canal it may be greatly improved. 
                    But at present they have not commenced to 
                    make the connection. With regard to the 
                    development of passenger traffic from Port 
                    Said in the summer, to encourage people to 
                    take the trip to Matarieh, it will be necessary 
                    to build an hotel there, as at present there is 
                    no accommodation for travellers Unless the 
                    company completes the canal as originally 
                    intended and opens the service right out to 
                    Damietta and thence connects it with the 
                    Nile there is not much chance of a dividend 
                    being paid on the working. I interviewed a 
                    resident here, who made the trip on the first 
                    steamer which which went to Matarieh on the 
                    31st December last, and he told me that there 
                    was considerable dissatisfaction owing to the 
                    difficulties of navigating in the narrow channel. 
                    Moreover the steamers were found to draw 
                    too much draught in the shallow lake. He 
                    also informed me that they struck several 
                    times on a sand bank, and as a matter of fact 
                    could not return to Port Said by the steamer 
                    that night. However it is thought that after 
                    the Canal is completed and connection estab- 
                    lished with the Suez Canal the service will be 
                    much better patronized and the present work-
                    ing expenses reduced. Mr. Davison, the new 
                    engineer, is carrying out certain improvements 
                    such as deepening the channel, which will con-
                    siderably facilitate the passage, which ought 
                    to average only three hours from the Suez 
                    Canal to Matarieh.</p>
                    <p>Already the natives have begun to use the 
                    steam boats, but so far it has not been taken 
                    up much for the transit of merchandise in 
                    large quantities. The boats used are of the 
                    stern wheel type designed by Shilston and 
                    originally suggested for traffic on the Nile by 
                    Mr. Thubron. From what I have learned Mr. 
                    Shitston, who was originally in Cook's ser-
                    vice, but left that company to commence a 
                    new service which ultimately became the 
                    Anglo-American Nile Company, was the man 
                    who really bad technical knowledge of boat 
                    building and designed most of the present 
                    steamers on the Nile. He it now connected 
                    with the Nile Flotilla Company and Mr. Porter 
                    has taken his place in the Hamburg Anglo-
                    American Company. Sir John Rogers is deeply 
                    interested in the Menzaleh Canal Company 
                    and consequently it is probable that it will be 
                    pushed on with, and that in time it will become 
                    a payable concern. But that will not be for 
                    a few years yet, unless they develope the 
                    business much faster.</p>
                    <p>Consequently it will be advisable to suspend 
                    any judgment as to the reseats future prospects 
                    of the company.</p>
                    <p>The idea of the Merzaleh Canal was to 
                    deflect some of the cotton exports from Alex-
                    andria to Port Said. At present, however, there 
                    is no immediate prospect of any such idea 
                    being realised.</p>

                    <head>ENGLISHMEN DISSATISFIED.</head>
                    <p>Considerable dissatisfaction is expressed 
                    among the Englishmen employed at the State 
                    Railway works at Boulac on account of the 
                    treatment to which some of their colleagues 
                    have been subjected. We understand that one 
                    Englishman, who has been in the railways for 
                    four years, has been dismissed the service on 
                    account of having missed four working days 
                    out of July, for two of which he gives indisposi-
                    tion as his excuse and for the other two that 
                    there was no work for him to do. No notice 
                    that such strennuos-measures would be taken 
                    had, it is asserted, been given. Other English 
                    workmen have been fined for irregularity in 
                    keeping time.</p>
                    <p>A far graver charge is, however, brought 
                    against those who are responsible for this 
                    department It is stated that men are brought 
                    out to this country under the misapprehension 
                    that they will receive a fixed salary and that 
                    on the completion of a certain term of service 
                    will be made foremen, if their work is found to 
                    be satisfactory, whereas on their arrival they 
                    are put on piece-work, which means payment 
                    by time.</p>
                    <p>We understand that the dismissed English
                    man to whom we refer above has placed his 
                    case in the hands of one of the best known 
                    lawyers of Cairo, and intends to dispute the 
                    legality of his dismissal.</p>

                    Ces terres prises sur l'emplacement d'an

                    pressed by our correspondents, but we wish, in a spirit of

                    <p>To the Editor of the "Egyptian Gazette".</p>
                    <p>Sir, -In reference to “J.P.'s" letter I beg 
                    to state that we have already adopted the 
                    system he advocates, and we are continually 
                    lending back the young women. In tact two 
                    men are employed at Alexandria who board 
                    every boat arriving here for the very purpose. 
                    The system has been at work for the last 
                    two years, although your correspondent ap-
                    pears to be "quite ignorant of the fact.
                    As to the personal remarks on my humble 
                    self, which your Cairo Correspondent indulges 
                    in, I herewith submit the following sketch of 
                    my life and labours:—</p>
                    <p>About 26 years ago the Presbyterians out 
                    here who had already a missionary to the Jews 
                    here, who however did not do very much work, 
                    thought it worth their while to have a con-
                    verted Jew here instead. As knowing the ian-
                    guage well, the Hebrew religion, the ins and 
                    outs of the Jewish people, snob as their man-
                    ners and customs, and above all the failings of 
                    their religion compared to the Bible, was a 
                    good idea, as he could preach the gospel in 
                    spirit and in truth and convince the Jews of 
                    their mistake as owing to his hitherto being a 
                    Jew he could more readily and convincingly 
                    tell them. Consequently they authorised the 
                    Head Man of the Jewish Mission to find a 
                    converted Jew Missionary, but as he was 
                    unable to find one in Egypt or Palestine, the 
                    converted Jews and all the Missionaries in 
                    Palestine advised him to write to London and 
                    ask for Peter Rudolph. The Head Missionary 
                    therefore went in person and asked the London 
                    Society Mission for me. As I was always out-
                    side working he could not see me, so he saw 
                    Bishop Barclay, who was very loath to lose me 
                    as he wanted me under his care as a mission-
                    ary, and he did not want to let me go. How-
                    ever as I was far from strong, having suffered 
                    ill health with hard work and London fogs, the 
                    Bishop kindly allowed me three months leave, 
                    he himself informing the Head Missionary 
                    that he would only lend me to him during 
                    my sojourn in Jerusalem until I recover-
                    ed. Before I left London I found when 
                    travelling through my district that a cer-
                    tain party had been making enquiries 
                    about we, as to my leaving them and 
                    all my poor people cried out in alarm 
                    saying : Oh! don’t take Mr. Rudolph,” he is 
                    one of the best workers we have ever had. It 
                    turned out that it had been the Head Mis-
                    sionary to the Jews who had been making 
                    these enquiries indirectly, and on my coming  
                    across him in the street I did not know who 
                    he was until he told me. I asked him “Why 
                    do you select me of others?”—“Because I 
                    have been advised by other missionaries in 
                    Egypt and Palestine to do so and I myself 
                    have watched your endeavours amongst the 
                    poor here how you have tried although suffer-
                    ing in ill health yourself to help poor suffering 
                    humanity both physically and spiritually and 
                    it is the most heartfelt wish of the Mis-
                    sionaries after your rest to go to Alexandria 
                    and preach the word of God to the Jews. Now 
                    think of it and say, “Yes” I loved the people 
                    I had been working among and it was only 
                    after due consideration that I consented to 
                    undertake the duty. After my rest in 
                    Jerusalem I eventually arrived in Alex-
                    andria on the 1st April (All Fools Day) 
                    which happened to be on an Easter Sunday. 
                    On my arrival here upon terra incognita, 
                    I was greatly dissappointed, for there was 
                    no one there to meet me,I was alone, no friend 
                    to welcome me and in a foreign country.</p>
                    <p>A Shocking Discovery.</p>
                    <p>Eventually an Arab seeing me,took me ashore 
                    and brought me to an hotel. I washed myself 
                    and came down to breakfast, whereon I saw 
                    two lovely young women, the build and the 
                    completion of whom I guessed to be English. 
                    I was not mistaken, as during breakfast one 
                    said to the other "I think this gentleman is 
                    English and a Minister of the Gospel, it is not 
                    right by any means for Madame not to inform 
                    him what sort of a house this is.” This natur-
                    ally made me look askance and on my enquir-
                    ing their reasons they told me that all the 
                    girls in that house were “kept" women. I 
                    trembled. Could it be possible that these two 
                    young English girls had sold both their bodies 
                    and souls to the devil? I prayed inwardly and 
                    asked God to help me to rescue them.</p>
                    <p>Rescuing Girls.</p>
                    <p>During conversation with them, one-of-them 
                    said she was the daughter of an English 
                    clergyman and they could not possibly go 
                    home to their country, as the gentlemen (or 
                    beasts I should say) paid them their hotel bill 
                    and only allowed them £2 or £3 a month 
                    pocket money. I was so horrified that I paid 
                    their passage home and had a latter of rejoic-
                    ing and gladness from both the clergyman and 
                    daughter thanking me for what find done. 
                    This was the first instance of girls being rescu-
                    ed from the White Slave Traffic in Alexandria, 
                    and I thank God that I was the pioneer of the 
                    movement That was 28 years ago, since 
                    which time I have, by God’s help, saved dozens 
                    from a life of shame and immorality. For 
                    years I had no one to help me as it is only 
                    during the last two years a Society has been 
                    formed through my endeavours to pot a stop 
                    to this White Slave Traffic ; but more of this 
                    later.</p>
                    <p>Girls’ Hard Struggle.</p>
                    <p>Before I came to Alexindria governoresses
                    and other girls had a hard struggle, as they 
                    generally came on pot lock without any situa-
                    tion to go to. Thera was no public home to go 
                    to, to seek shelter, advice and guidance. When 
                    their money was finished, nothing was left but 
                    the streets ; such has been the case of many. I 
                    did my best for them but what is one amongst
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    so many. When I became known every one 
                    used to flock to me and I was continually 
                    asking my friends and even going from house 
                    to house endeavouring to find employment for 
                    these girls as I knew if I could not it was only in 
                    God’s hands how their future life would be spent</p> 
                    <p>A Terrible Story.</p>
                    <p>I remember one instance of many painful 
                    ones in my memory of a certain Scotch girl. I 
                    believe she came from Cyprus, and she was 
                    recommended to me by Mr. Whitfield who took 
                    great interest in her. I recommended her to an 
                    English drapery store in Cherif Pasha-st, who 
                    placed her in a highly respectable Greek 
                    family. This Scotch girl was so gifted that 
                    within three months she turned all the naughty 
                    children into angels, the Greek lady was so 
                    pleased with her that when Xmas came round 
                    she presented her with a lovely gold watch 
                    and new dresses to the value of £20, but un-
                    fortunately this girl was in the habit of taking 
                    a drop too much and one day she asked to be 
                    away to enable her to see her uncle, a well-
                    known English resident here. Instead of going 
                    to see him she went to a grocer’s where she got 
                    intoxicated and 5’or 6 days afterwards she was 
                    seen in a Bedouin s tent with only her shirt on. 
                    As there was no public Home for her to go to 
                    she was found in a chemist shop dressed in 
                    this attire, a wreck of one of the smartest and 
                    most intelligent girls one could come across. The 
                    chemist knowing that I looked after these poor 
                    suffering mortals left her in my hands.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Sheldon Amos.</p>
                    <p>Mrs. Sheldon Amos kept her in her home for 
                    a fortnight I saw the late Canon Davies of 
                    St. Mark's Church and Mrs. Sheldon Amos and 
                    I eventually got this poor unfortunate sent 
                    away, or else she would have become a white 
                    slave, not having a “home" where to seek 
                    advice or a “refuge." This set me thinking and 
                    I asked Mrs. Sheldon Amos, what could be 
                    done as a protection to these girls. I told her 
                    we most have a Home and the money would 
                    come. We went to Sir Charles Cookson, the 
                    British Consul,and on hearing what we wanted 
                    he held both hands up to heaven and said 
                    "God grant us such a Home, and a Home, 
                    Mr. Rudolph, we shall have."</p>
                    <p>Home for Girls.</p>
                    <p>After consultation, Mrs. Amos and I went 
                    to the late Canon Davies of St. Marks Church 
                    then to the Minister of the German Church, 
                    as well as the Deaconess Sister Barbara. They 
                    all agreed most enthusiastically to my project; 
                    the latter immediately promised 6 bedsteads 
                    for the Home. Mrs. Amos went to the Scotch 
                    Minister and asked his support but she could 
                    not get his approval. Shortly after this she 
                    was called to Germany to see her family and I 
                    was left alone to battle for the very such 
                    needed “home,” For nearly 6 weeks those 
                    interested in the undertaking used to meet in 
                    my house to talk matters over, even including 
                    a Member of the Scotch Church, and it was 
                    appointed that an English lady called Mac 
                    Dougall and a Swiss Lady Gobelli should 
                    superintend the "Home" when it was obtained.</p> 
                    <p>Scotch Intrigues.</p>
                    <p>A short time after this these two ladies 
                    came to my house in a great rage and said 
                    “After all your promises you have sold us it is
                    just as we thought ; Pot no trust in a Jew.’” 
                    "Why, why," I exclaimed. Those Scotch people, 
                    who pretended not to approve of the movement 
                    for a Home for governesses and who said it 
                    would not work but yet who came to your 
                    house like spies and found ont everything you 
                    were going to do have now gone and rented a 
                    house and asked Sister Barbara for the 6 beds 
                    she had promised you, saying you had given 
                    the matter up. Is it true?” This took the 
                    breath out of me. I have never given the pro-
                    ject up and never even thought of doing so 
                    but I will make enquiries. I did and what I 
                    had heard was only too true. They had taken 
                    the leading strings out of my hand. On my 
                    forcing them to show their hand why they claim-
                    ed to be the instigators of the Victoria House, 
                    their excuse was as ridiculous as it is as 
                    easy to drink water. One of their members has 
                    a relation in Europe, and she sent some cir-
                    culars out here about the Home where she is 
                    matron for girls "But,” I explained, “that house 
                    has nothing to do with the one here, its Direc-
                    tors are not the same, its rules and conditions 
                    are not the same; how in the world can you 
                    say that this Victoria House was established 
                    by you.” It pleased them to think so, so I let 
                    them think but as every one admitted, it was 
                    decidedly underhand, and probably it was 
                    through this that the Home did not last long. 
                    They never went about the thing in a proper, 
                    business like open handed manner, consequen-
                    tly the British Community rose and took it 
                    out of their hands, and since then it has done 
                    good work. This ends the report of the Victoria 
                    Home.</p>
                    <p>Victoria House.</p>
                    <p>The Home for fallen girls had never left my 
                    mind ; my mind was fixed upon having two 
                    Homes, one for governesses, &amp;c. to keep them 
                    from going to the bad, and to try and get them 
                    work. The Victoria House was the result. 
                    Now the other Home was for fallen girls, to 
                    try to keep them good daring the time I was 
                    getting the respective Consulates to send them 
                    home to their own country. Several visitors 
                    who held good positions in their countries 
                    always told me that they would use their 
                    influence when they got home to try and assist 
                    me in getting a Home going and suitable 
                    enough for the purpose, bat these promises 
                    never came to anything for I never heard any-
                    thing farther. Claude Montefiore Esq. came to 
                    Egypt to see if anything could be done to help 
                    these poor down-trodden women, so he went to 
                    Cairo and every one told him that the only one 
                    who could give any assistance and who already 
                    knew everything about these girls was Mr. 
                    Rudolph.</p>
                    <p>The Home Founded.</p>
                    <p>He came to my house in Alexandria and 
                    was presented to me by Baron Menasce. They 
                    asked me for advice, so I willingly told them
                    <cb n="3"/>
                    that what was the most important thing of all 
                    was to obtain a house, a long treasured idea 
                    of mine, as the work could not be properly 
                    carried out without one. Another thing I 
                    proposed was to invite all the Consulates as 
                    well as the Governor of Alexandria to have a 
                    meeting at Baron Menacoe’s House. This was 
                    done and the matter was thoroughly thrashed 
                    out, whereon Baron Menasce said: "We will 
                    get one or two hundred pounds together and 
                    follow Mr. Rudoloph’s advice and obtain a 
                    Home for these poor girls." The Meeting had 
                    the entire support of the Consols. I got 
                    Lord Cromer, and Colonel Hopkinson, of the 
                    City Police, to interest themselves in the 
                    work and they assisted me very much in my 
                    arduous work. For my own part I have 
                    every treason to be thankful and grateful for 
                    the success of the works of which I have been 
                    the originator and it was with the greatest 
                    pain and sorrow that I withdrew my name from 
                    this Society as it was utterly impossible for me 
                    to assist, help, aid, and give my wide experience 
                    of the work,—years longer than any on else on 
                    the Committee,—when it was so grossly mis-
                    managed.</p>

                    <p>In anticipation of the storms which often 
                    occur at Malta even early in October, the con-
                    struction of the Imperial breakwater is being 
                    prosecuted with great activity at the present 
                    moment. Day and night the work goes on apase. 
                    The shorter arm, 400ft. in length, is already 
                    completely finished, and the staging is all remo-
                    ved. The longer, or northern, arm, which will be 
                    three times as long as the other, and will have 
                    to withstand the full force of the sets hauled 
                    towards the port by the fierce "grigale” winds, 
                    is being pushed out sensibly month by month. 
                    The construction of the breakwater was to have 
                    taken six years. Three have elapsed since the 
                    inception of the works, and the contractors, 
                    Messrs. Pearson and Son, are relatively in 
                    advance of the stipulated time with their 
                    undertaking.</p>

                    <p>Ignatius Abd-il Massech has been elected 
                    patriarch of the Syrian Jacobite Church. The 
                    Sublime Porte has accepted the choice. There 
                    are fourteen Bishops within this Jacobite Pa-
                    triarchate. Three of them hold posts in India.</p>
                    <p>Ignatius Abd-il Massech was born on Octo-
                    ber 21st, 1836, in Syria. He assumed the vows 
                    of a monk in Jerusalem during 1856, from 
                    which life he was removed to Orfa, Mesopota-
                    mia He was ordained deacon in 1864, and 
                    priest in 1867. In 1873 he travelled with his 
                    Patriarch to London, were they were received 
                    by Queen Victoria. After visiting India, where 
                    he preached in 184 churches, be returned to
                    Emesa, and acted as the Patriarch's secretary. 
                    In 1884 he revisited England, where he spent
                    one year and nine months. He speaks English 
                    fluently. On his return to Emesa he brought 
                    with him printing and book-binding machines. 
                    He is beloved by his flock, who are delighted

                    <p>An old lady who has been in the habit of 
                    meeting Sir Henry Campbell Bannerman at 
                    Marienbad was, a morning paper states, parti-
                    cularly effusive in her compliments when she 
                    met him there for the first time this year. Her 
                    absolute frankness is one of her characteristics. 
                    “I had no idea last year," she said, "that you 
                    were likely to be Prime Minister. My friends 
                    told me you were simply a warming pan for 
                    Lord Rosebery." "Scotsmen never make good
                    warming pans," was the Premier's reply.</p>

                    <p>The way to prevent revolution is by giving 
                    reform, but the Czar has long ago let the time 
                    for prevention pass. All that can now be ex-
                    pected is to prevent the revolution from be-
                    coming ever more and more bloody and 
                    anarchical, by opening the safety valve and by 
                    winning over the moderate reformers from any 
                    sort of sympathy with the terrorists. We 
                    have heard much in manifestoes of the "inflexi-
                    ble will" of the Czar as a reformer. The one 
                    thing instantly needed is the realisation of that 
                    will in actjon.—“Chronicle”</p>

                    <head>DANGERS OF RAW FRUIT.</head>
                    <p>Professor Metchnikof, the famous bacterio-
                    logist, declares that raw fruit should never 
                    be eaten. He condemns it beyond remission, 
                    says the Paris correspondent of the “Tele-
                    graph," Asked whether grape pips may not 
                    give appendicitis, he though that they might, 
                    but considered that a detail. The essential 
                    point is that microbes swarm on all fruit of 
                    whatsoever kind. On the other hand, he 
                    recommends stewed fruit warmly, as it is p
                    alatable, wholesome, and sterilised by boiling.</p>

                    <head>ROYAL INNISKILL1NG FUSILIERS CORPORALS. RIGHT HALF BATTALION. LEFT HALF BATTALION.</head>
                    <p>The football season was ushered in on 
                    Wednesday evening last, when corporals 
                    representing the above met in a friendly en-
                    counter. It was of great interest to see that old 
                    veteran, Corporal Aiken, don the shirt again. 
                    At the appointed time for starting the Referee, 
                    Walsh, lined his men out in the order men-
                    tioned: Right, half Battalion, Goal, Aitken; 
                    Backs, Elliot and Casey; half books, Millen,Cole 
                    and Irvine; forwards, Presley, Locks, Colline, 
                    Parke, and Conaghin. Left half Battalion, Goal 
                    Heaney; Backsc Carey and Murphy; half backs 
                    McLoughlin, MoCristoll and Brag; forwards, 
                    Montgomery, Millar, Russel, McGoniagle.</p>
                    <p>About 500 spectators were present when the 
                    Referee’s whistle announced time for hostilities 
                    to commence, the left half at once got agoing, 
                    but Casey returned, and Collins got possession. 
                    He was, however, robbed when nearing the 
                    scoring point, shortly alter Cole gave Keaney 
                    a hot ‘un to hold, which he saved well. 
                    Still the right half pressed, and Keaney 
                    was beaten at close range amid cheers. On
                    resuming McGonigale and Russell were seen 
                    to advantage, but all to no purpose, as 
                    Aitken came in their road, time after-time. 
                    Presley now made a good ran, giving the 
                    sphere to Collins. The latter had a shot 
                    which missed by inches. Give and take was 
                    now the order for some time until Collins got 
                    away in good style and binding all opposition 
                    be scored number two. The left half now woke 
                    up and Russel getting the sphere made tracks 
                    for Aitken, but the latter was not to be caught 
                    napping, his splendid "saves” being a treat to 
                    watch. Play after this was of a even nature. 
                    A good break away by Locke was the means of 
                    bringing play down towards Murphy and com-
                    pany, where Collins when in a good position 
                    was given offside. About two minutes later the 
                    same player had a splendid chance of increas-
                    ing the score when he shot sky-high over the 
                    bar. The right half were now pressing for all 
                    they were worth and Keaney and company had 
                    their work cut out to prevent a farther score. 
                    Shortly after they succeeded in adding to their 
                    score. Urged on by their supporters, the left 
                    half went off at a rattling pace towards Aitken 
                    where they secured a corner off Elliot. This 
                    was well taken by McGonigale, but McCristo 
                    sent behind. On the kick-off Montgomery got 
                    away, a scrimmage ensued in which Russel 
                    getting the sphere close in had no trouble in 
                    recording the first goal for his side.</p>
                    <p>This was all the scoring in this half and, hal 
                    time found the score.</p>
                    <p>Right half Battalion 3 goals.</p>
                    <p>Left half Battalion 1 goal.</p>
                    <p>The second moiety was begun by Russel, 
                    and the first item, of any importance was 
                    a good sprint by Presley. Twice in sucess-
                    sion were the right half within a point of 
                    scoring, but skying the ball spoiled all efforts. 
                    A handbell against the left half put their 
                    opponents in a good position, but over eagerness 
                    spoiled all attempts. McGonigale was now 
                    seen to advantage and he shot when well placed, 
                    but he had the mortification of seeing the ball 
                    glance off the upright. The left half were now 
                    pressing well, and McGonigale, alter futile 
                    efforts, beat Aitken all ends up. Midfield play 
                    now followed, and the right half got away 
                    per Collins, and Cole with a well judged shot 
                    bought the total to 4 to 2. Some exciting play 
                    took place around Aitken, but the veteran was 
                    amply unbeatable. Still the right halt scored 
                    again per Collins. The left half now realised 
                    their position and they got close to Aitken 
                    who had to look out for his Ps and Q. Excite-
                    ment was now great as Russel missed by inches 
                    towards the end of this half. The left half se-
                    ared two more goals the last one being scored 
                    one minute from time. Full time score</p>

                    <p>Left half Battalion	    4 goals.</p>
