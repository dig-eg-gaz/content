                                pays an indemnity. (Reuter)</p>

                        influence with a view to establishing penny postage between Egypt and the
                        British Empire, has been signed by several hundred passengers on board the

                        Australia.</p>
                    <p>The petition says it is naturally regarded as an irritating and anomalous

                        the one hand and England on the other is one penny only, it should be still
                        2]d. between England and Port Said, Cairo, and Suez, and that there is
                        reason to believe that the Egyptian Government and people are entirely
                        favorable to the proposal for a penny postage.</p>

                        England would be, on the 1,200,000 letters to Egypt, £7,500-a mere

                    <head>WHERE IS THE FATHER ?</head>
                    <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                    <p>Sir,—In last night's "Egyptian Gazette"(Local and General) I read a short
                        article concerning a young woman named Lettshorn, who was sentenced to two
                        years' imprisonment by the Native Assize Court in Cairo, for having killed
                        her new born child. It is indeed a very sad case. Sadder still, that there
                        should be a law inflicting punishment on the poor, seduced, perhaps hungry,
                        girl-mother and not on the seducer. Why is his name not mentioned in the
                        paper? Why should the young woman bear all the shame alone, and not share it
                        with the man who shared her love? Justice was merciless to the heartless
                        mother and lenient to the cowardly lover. Such sad cases will occur as long
                        as society will allow partiality in law. It is time some laws were
                        reformed.</p>
                    <p>With thanks, I beg to remain, dear sir,—</p>

                    <p>M. Lambert's company opened well and had, if not a full, at least a good
                        house ever ready to respond to telling lines and good acting, and at times
                        unwilling to reserve its applause at the close of an act. That M. Lambert's
                        company would do well was expected. but no one, in our opinion, counted on
                        hearing the parts of Fabrics and Clorinde so brilliantly upheld. M. Albert
                        Lambert fils rendered the first role with real power; Mlle Delvair as
                        Clorinde was brilliant She possesses a fine presence, great powers of facial
                        expression, and one of those rich voices, so rarely heard, that make
                        movement and gesture almost needless when they express emotion or passion,
                        so perfect it the charm of their intonation. M. Albert Lambert pere as
                        Annibal was good, and M. Marqnet played his part with dignity—perhaps with
                        too much reserve—for the role of a distinguished old gentleman who is ready
                        to throw himself at the feet of a handsome girl with a pathetic certainty
                        that she reciprocates his flame, Is rather on the comic side.</p>

                    <p>The abolition-of the salt monopoly (states "Al Express") has given great
                        satisfaction throughout Egypt; and the Government, which has deserved the
                        best thanks of the people for this action, mast recognize the great harm
                        caused by monopolies. Therefore we seize this opportunity (adds our
                        contemporary) to draw the attention of the Government and of Lord Cromer,
                        the great reformer of Egypt, to the tombac trade, which has been for 30
                        years ,a monopoly in Egypt. Tombac is so much used here that it ought to be
                        considered one of the indispensable wants of the people. This monopoly has
                        so far caused great harm to the finauces of our country, and our wise
                        reformer and the high authorities could put an end to it, as they have done
                        to the salt monopoly.</p>

                        the building of a fine theatre, and a committee of their wives will
                        determine who shall be privileged to pay £20,000 apiece for the boxes. If
                        thirty public-spirited capitalist; patrons of the opera were to do likewise
                        at Alexandria, and the Municipality were to turnish a fine site, we should
                        have a theatre worthy of Egypt's commercial capital.</p>

                        against the mosquito, has aroused considerable interest, and one of oar
                        readers sends us the following extract from an article in the "Lancet" :—
                        "What other countries are doing to exterminate the mosquito, Egypt can
                        do.Thank God we have not yellow fever here. But as long as the mosquito is
                        ubiquitous in Egypt, so long is it a menace to the health and comfort of the
                        people. The inhabitants and old residents are no doubt immune to a great
                        extent to the discomfort and annoyance from the bites of these pests. But
                        tho stranger within our gates speedily falls a prey to the insect which at
                        night slumbers not nor sleeps, and seems imbued with the faculty of
                        tantalising and torturing its victims.</p>
                    <p>"The most pessimistic of Job comtorters cannot deny that to destroy some
                        millions of these pests on the lines now so well-known and practised would
                        be greatly to enhance the reputation of Egypt as a resort for the tourist
                        and invalid. At present even the temper of a Mark Tapley's not proof agains
                        the irritability caused by the injection of the poison from their
                        probosces.</p>
                    <p>"That no organised attempt has been made to combat the evil we must ascribe
                        to either a lack of initiative on the part of the European residents, or
                        else to the general feeling engendered by prolonged residence in Egypt,
                        which is so aptly expressed by the Arabic philosophical utterance 'Malish.'

                    <p>Une question de droit</p>
                    <p>Une très intéressante question de droit in- ternational privé est sous examen
                        devant la Chambre commerciale du Tribunal mixte du Caire présidée par M. le
                        président Tack.</p>
                    <p>"Les syndics de la faillite d'une maison de commerce déclarée à l'étranger
                        par le Tribunal du siège principal de ladite maison de com- merce
                        peuvent-ils attaquer par voie de la tierce opposition un autre jugement
                        postérieur qui a déclaré en Egypte la faillite de la même maison de commerce
                        au siège de sa succursale?</p>
                    <p>"Peuvent-ils en suite de la recevabilité de leur action demander l'annulation
                        du second jugement basée sur l'incompétence du Tribunal qui l'a renda?"</p>
                    <p>En l'espèce il s'agissait de la maison de com- merce H. et E. Sacazan qui,
                        déclarée en faillite par le Tribunal de Beyrouth au siège social le 5
                        janvier 1905, a été également déclarée en faillite par le Tribunal mixte du
                        Caire au siège de sa succursale le 11 février suivant.</p>
                    <p>Se ralliant aux conclusions de Me Martino, le ministère public, représenté
                        par Emine bey, a conclu samedi à ce que le Tribunal du Caire devait
                        rétracter la faillite. Le Tribunal se pro- noncera à huitaine.</p>

                    <p>On assure que 8.E. Bassili pacha Tadros a exprimé le désir de rester au
                        Conseil législatif plutôt que d'accepter la présidence honoraire de la Cour
                        d'appel mixte.</p>
                    <p>Le ministère de la justice a, en conséquence, différé de soumettre au conseil
                        des ministres la note relative à la nomination de Son Excel- lence en
                        remplacement de feu Saïd pacha Nasr, pour examiner s'il n'y aurait pas

                    <p>Samedi, dans l'après-midi, a été déposée au greffe l'ordonnance du juge des
                        référés M. Herzbruck, dans l'affaire du prince Halim. L'ordonnance fait
                        droit à la requête de Me Martino pour les bénéficiaires du Wakt Zenab Hanem
                        et nomme l'administration des Wakts séquestre du domaine de Chawa.</p>

                    <head>LE COLLECTEUR GENERAL</head>
                    <p>Monsieur le Directeur de l'"Egyptian Gazette" Dans votre partie anglaise du
                        14 courant, vous avez annoncé que les services municipaux venaient de
                        constater par des essais concluants que le collecteur général fonctionnait à
                        mer- veille. Cette constatation n'allait pas sans une certaine surprise,
                        mêlée d'admiration. Serait-ce que les services et les membres distingués du
                        ministère des Travaux Publics, recrutés parmi les fonctionnaires d'élite de
                        toutes les nations avaient des doutes sur l'heure se issue de
                        l'entreprise?</p>
                    <p>Eh oui, certes. On se rappelle la lutte acharnée que l' "Egyptian Gazette" et
                        deux on trois membres de la minorité durent soutenir en faveur du projet
                        Hobrecht, projet qui avait été condamné comme absurde et voué à un échec
                        certain par l'administration, le gouverne- ment et d'éminents ingénieurs
                        appelés l'un de Paris et l'autre des Indes pour prononcer sa suppression, en
                        faveur d'un autre projet dont l'accomplissement devait grever la ville d'une
                        nouvelle dette de 500,000 livres.</p>
                    <p>La Commission, retenue d'un côté par la campagne obstinée de votre journal et
                        de quel. ques-uns de ses membres, de l'autre par l'énor- mité du nouvel
                        emprunt qui lui était proposé, élat un comité spécial composé de MM. Zouro,
                        Escoffier, Rothacker, Yehia Bey, Abani Bey et Stagni pour étudier la
                        question.</p>
                    <p>Après bien des travaux et des efforts, ce comité parvint à convaincre la
                        majorité de ncs. édiles qu'en dépit des assertions contraires du ministère
                        des Travaux Publics, de l'Adminis tration et des plus illustres
                        spécialistes, le col- lecteur système Hobrecht était apte à fono- tionner.
                        Le projet fat donc voté par 14 voix contre 7.</p>
                    <p>Le Gouvernement qui se voyait ainsi forcer la main, refusa d'engager sa
                        responsabilité. Il déclara que l'échec devait retomber tout en- tier sur la
                        tête des conseillers municipaux. Une fois encore d'humbles journalistes et
                        d'illettrés négociants en ont remontré aux puits de science què sont les
                        spécialistes. Au li.n d'un échec c'est un nouveau triomphe qu'ils ont
                        remporté.</p>
                    <p>Je ne puis terminer cette lettre sans ma tionner le nom de M. Zouro, qui a
                        été l'âme do la résistance. "Il faut rendre à César ce qui est à César."</p>

                    <p>Les offres sont peu importantes mais la demande est nulle. Aussi
                        assistons-nous à uno baisse régulière et presque générale. La National Bank
                        tombe à 25, l'Agricole à 8 15/16, la Land Bank à 8 1/2, la Béhéra à 37 1/2,
                        l'Oasis à 1, la Daira à 17 5/16, l'Ia- vestment à 1 1/16, l'Urbaine à 4 3/4,
                        les Cotton Mills à 4/9, la Salt and Soda à 22/3, la Nangovich à 10 1/16,
                        l'Anglo American Nile à 5 7/16, la Dalta Light à 11 3/8 et la Ramleh Railway
                        à 6 1/2.</p>
                    <p>Quant à la tendance, elle est tout à fait indécise. Les affaires sont
                        clairsemées. Caire, 20 novembre. Les marchés étrangers ont enocre aɛɛez
                        malmené nos valeurs samedi.</p>
                    <p>Le Crédit Foncier, que l'on soutenait ici à 787, ootait à Paris 775 et la
                        Banque 25 1/8. Il faut dire que la persistance de la baisse est due, à ce
                        que l'on prétend, aux forts ordres de yente envoyés à Paris et à Londres
                        pour, <cb n="2"/> compte de gros spéculateurs égyptiens, obligés par les
                        Banques à restreindre leurs comptes. On parle d'un ordre de vente de 3,000
                        actions Crédit Foncier passé à Paris pour un seul client. Rien de surprenant
                        si, dans ces condi- tions, le marché s'effondre.</p>
                    <p>Nous tournons depuis des mois dans un cercle vicieux. Plus les Banques
                        pressent leurs clients de liquider en prévision d'une baisse, plus les cours
                        baissent, et plus les Banques demandent des liquidations de plus en plus
                        difficiles à effectuer. Et il n'y a pas de raison pour qu'on s'arrête.</p>
                    <p>Le marché a été, ce matin, très animé. Beau- coup de fluctuations en
                        Agricole, qui ouvre à 9 3/32, tombe à 8 15/16 et clôture à 9 livres
                        vendeurs. La Banque ouvre à 25 1/4 et clôture plus faible à 25 3/16. La
                        Banque d'Abyssinie est demandée à 6 1/2. L'action Crédit Fon- cier s'échange
                        à 785 francs sur quelques achats en clôture. Les Hôtels sont un peu plus
                        fermes et les petites valeurs bien tenues. On a, spécialement, fait beaucoup
                        d'affaires en Estates; plusieurs milliers de titres ont été ramassés dès
                        l'ouverture.</p>
                    <p>Comme on demandait, en Bourse, des ren- seignements sur la mise en
                        circulation des titres de la Banque d'Abyssinie, M. H. de Vries a en, ce
                        matin, une entrevue à ce sujet avec le Gouverneur de la Banque d'Abyssinie,
                        qui l'a informé que les titres étaient à la signature et seraient très
                        probablement mis à la disposition des souscripteurs vers la fin de la
                        semaine.</p>
                    <p>La Banque d'Athènes a ouvert aujourd'hui son Agence du Caire. Tout le monde a
                        observé la remarquable fermeté du titre de cette Société pendant la période
                        actuelle. C'est à peine si le cours a baissé de 2 francs.</p>
