                <dateline>Copenhagen, November 20.</dateline>
                <p>King Christian's reception of the deputation of the Storthing, sent to notify
                    Prince Charles of his election, and to ask the King's assent, was an impressive
                    and brilliant ceremony. The King, having assented, tamed deeply moved to the
                    Prince and Princess and exhorted the to serve their now country loyally, and to
                    win the love of the people. “Yon will," he concluded, "take with you the
                    blessing of your aged King and grandfather, for yourselves and your people.”</p>
                <p>Prince Charles, as King Hakon VII., subsequently received the greetings of the
                    Norwegians at his own Palace. He declared that he and his consort would devote
                    their lives for Norway’s good. His motto would be : "All for Norway.”

                <p>The “Daily Telegraph” learns from Tokio that the Anglo Chinese treaty with regard

                <p>A number of native notables of Alexandria held a meeting on Saturday evening at
                    the Custom-House Porters’ School. The object of the meeting was to found a
                    benevolent society under the name of “El Malagi El Abbassi” (Abbassieh
                    Alms-houses). The new society was regularly constituted, and Khalil Pasha
                    Hamada, who originated the scheme, has invited the public to support it. The
                    Pasha has been elected president; two secretaries and six members of the
                    committee were also elected.</p>
                <p>PENNY POSTAGE TO EGYPT.</p>
                <p>PETITION TO LORD STANLEY.</p>
                <p>A petition, which has been forwarded to Lord Stanley, asking him to exert his
                    influence with a view to establishing penny postage between Egypt and the
                    British Empire, has been signed by several hundred passengers on board the P.
                    and 0. steamer Macedonia, outward bound for India, China, and Australia.</p>
                <p>The petition says it is naturally regarded as an irritating and anomalous burden
                    that, while tho postage between Gibraltar, Malta, Aden, and India on the one
                    hand and England on the other is one penny only, it should be still 2]d. between
                    England and Port Said, Cairo, and Suez, and that there is reason to believe that
                    the Egyptian Government and people are entirely favorable to the proposal for a
                    penny postage.</p>
                <p>Mr. Henniker Heaton, M.P., a passenger in the Macedonia, writes that he has bad a
                    letter from his Excellency Saba Pasha, Postmaster-General of Egypt, cordially
                    approving of penny portage (universal). He adds that the cost to England would
                    be, on the 1,200,000 letters to Egypt, £7,500-a mere bagatelle.</p>
                <p>Among the signatories of the petition are Lord Che’msford, Governor of
                    Queensland, Supreme Court Judge Bigge, of India, and many distinguished
                    officers, Civil Service officials, merchants and other influential residents in

                <p>RIFLE BRIGADE’S DEPARTURE</p>

                <p>The following Special General Order by the General Officer Commanding the Force
                    in Egypt was issued yesterday: - </p>
                <p>The G. O.C. cannot allow the 2nd Bn. Rifle Brigade to leave his Command, without
                    expressing his regret at losing so smart a battalion. In military efficiency and
                    conduct, the battalion has kept up the traditions of the Brigade to which they
                    belong : and he wishes all ranks a hearty farewell, and health and success in
                    their new tour of service.</p>
                <p>THE SUCRERIES AFFAIR.</p>
                <p>The hearing of the action brought by M. Poutrel against the Hon. A. J. Davey, tor
                    wrongful dismissal, was resumed this morning, when Me. Carton de Wiart continued
                    his defence. His pleading, which was extremely eloquent, was supported by a
                    number of documents, which, he contended, proved that the Hon. A. J. Davey had
                    all along been kept in ignorance of the speculative transactions of the late M.
                    Cronier and his supporters.</p>
                <p>After the close of the speech Me. Guilhamou replied, following much the same
                    lines as on Tuesday last.</p>
                <p>Judgment will, it is expected, be given in a fortnight’s time.</p>

                <p>MINISTRY OF THE INTERIOR.</p>
                <p>New regulations as to the supervision of “Maisons de tolerance" have been issued
                    by the ministry of the Interior. They have the police large powers to interfere
                    in the interests of public order and decency, forbid the employment of minors as
                    servants in such houses,and forbid any person to occupy or be employed in such
                    houses whose career has been marked by crime as well as by immorality.</p>
                <p>WHERE IS THE FATHER ?</p>
                <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                <p>Sir,—In last night's “Egyptian Gazette"(Local and General) I read a short article
                    concerning a young woman named Lettshorn, who was sentenced to two years’
                    imprisonment by the Native Assize Court in Cairo, for having killed her new born
                    child. It is indeed a very sad case. Sadder still, that there should be a law
                    inflicting punishment on the poor, seduced, perhaps hungry, girl-mother and not
                    on the seducer. Why is his name not mentioned in the paper? Why should the young
                    woman bear all the shame alone, and not share it with the man who shared her
                    love? Justice was merciless to the heartless mother and lenient to the cowardly
                    lover. Such sad cases will occur as long as society will allow partiality in
                    law. It is time some laws were reformed.</p>
                <p>With thanks, I beg to remain, dear sir,—</p>
                <p>Yours faithfully</p>
                <p>(Mrs.) H. D. Tsykalas,</p>
                <p>Membra de l’Unicn Iuternationale des Amies de la Jeune Fille.</p>
                <p>November 17. </p>
                <p>M. LAMBERT IN CAIRO.</p>
                <p>L'A VBNT UR Hill E.</p>
                <p>M. Lambert’s company opened well and had, if not a full, at least a good house
                    ever ready to respond to telling lines and good acting, and at times unwilling
                    to reserve its applause at the close of an act. That M. Lambert's company would
                    do well was expected. but no one, in our opinion, counted on hearing the parts
                    of Fabrics and Clorinde so brilliantly upheld. M. Albert Lambert fils rendered
                    the first role with real power; Mlle Delvair as Clorinde was brilliant She
                    possesses a fine presence, great powers of facial expression, and one of those
                    rich voices, so rarely heard, that make movement and gesture almost needless
                    when they express emotion or passion, so perfect it the charm of their
                    intonation. M. Albert Lambert pere as Annibal was good, and M. Marqnet played
                    his part with dignity—perhaps with too much reserve—for the role of a
                    distinguished old gentleman who is ready to throw himself at the feet of a
                    handsome girl with a pathetic certainty that she reciprocates his flame, Is
                    rather on the comic side.</p>
                <p>AMERICAN COTTON MARKET.</p>
                <p>Messrs. Colliuge Brothers,of Liverpool, cable as follows :—Market has declined in
                    consequence of large selling orders from Alexandria Continent and old bulls
                    liquidating. We have no decided opinion either way.</p>
                <p>THE TOMBAC MONOPOLY.</p>
                <p>WHY NOT ABOLISH IT?</p>
                <p>The abolition-of the salt monopoly (states "A1 Express") has given great
                    satisfaction throughout Egypt; and the Government, which has deserved the best
                    thanks of the people for this action, mast recognize the great harm caused by
                    monopolies. Therefore we seize this opportunity (adds our contemporary) to draw
                    the attention of the Government and of Lord Cromer, the great reformer of Egypt,
                    to the tombac trade, which has been for 30 years ,a monopoly in Egypt. Tombac is
                    so much used here that it ought to be considered one of the indispensable wants
                    of the people. This monopoly has so far caused great harm to the finauces of our
                    country, and our wise reformer and the high authorities could put an end to it,
                    as they have done to the salt monopoly.</p>
                <p>NATIONAL HOTEliS AND RESIDENCES.</p>
                <p>The decree constituting the National Hotels and Residences Company appears in
                    yesterday's "Journal Official.” The capital of the  company amounts to L.E
                    209,000, divided into 50,000 shares of L.E. 4 each, which have been wholly
                    subscribed by the promoters as follows: — Antonn Bey Sabbagh, 30,000 ; Sidney
                    Davis, 10,000 ; Ibrahim Sabbagh, 5,000 ; Charles Anhoury, 3.000 ; Neguib Hani,
                    1,000 ; Valle B y, 500 ; Charles Bauer, 500. There are also 2,000 Founder’s
                    shares, value undetermined, which have been distributed among the above in
                    proportion to the, amount of their subscriptions.</p>
                <p>ALEXANDRIA'S NEW THEATRE.</p>
                <p>While there is so much discussion going on among the playgoing magnates of
                    Alexandria as to what is eventually to take the place of the Z'zinia Theatre, we
                    might point out a precedent for Alexandria in the great scheme we hear of from
                    New York. Thirty prominent men have subscribed £600,000 for the building of a
                    fine theatre, and a committee of their wives will determine who shall be
                    privileged to pay £20,000 apiece for the boxes. If thirty public-spirited
                    capitalist; patrons of the opera were to do likewise at Alexandria, and the
                    Municipality were to turnish a fine site, we should have a theatre worthy of
                    Egypt’s commercial capital.</p>
                <p>EGYPT'S MOSQUITOES.</p>
                <p>Our leading article in Thursday’s issue, on the necessity of waging war against
                    the mosquito, has aroused considerable interest, and one of oar readers sends us
                    the following extract from an article in the "Lancet” :— “What other countries
                    are doing to exterminate the mosquito, Egypt can do.Thank God we have not yellow
                    fever here. But as long as the mosquito is ubiquitous in Egypt, so long is it a
                    menace to the health and comfort of the people. The inhabitants and old
                    residents are no doubt immune to a great extent to the discomfort and annoyance
                    from the bites of these pests. But tho stranger within our gates speedily falls
                    a prey to the insect which at night slumbers not nor sleeps, and seems imbued
                    with the faculty of tantalising and torturing its victims.</p>
                <p>"The most pessimistic of Job comtorters cannot deny that to destroy some millions
                    of these pests on the lines now so well-known and practised would be greatly to
                    enhance the reputation of Egypt as a resort for the tourist and invalid. At
                    present even the temper of a Mark Tapley's not proof agains the irritability
                    caused by the injection of the poison from their probosces.</p>
                <p>"That no organised attempt has been made to combat the evil we must ascribe to
                    either a lack of initiative on the part of the European residents, or else to
                    the general feeling engendered by prolonged residence in Egypt, which is so
                    aptly expressed by the Arabic philosophical utterance ‘Malish.’ ”</p>

                <p>Suoh is to be the title of Sir Eldon Gorst’s contribution to “The Empire and the
                    Century," which Mr. Murray is publishing. It is not so much a, highly original
                    volume as a library of Imperial essays compressed into a single work. The first
                    part deals with the Imperial organism as a whole, its mechanism and principles ;
                    and the second with the many constituents of the Empire. The contributors make
                    up a brilliant and representative list, and Egypt and the Sadan occupy a good
                    place in the second portion, “Realms in Trust," of Part II., which deals with
                    ''Constituents of Empire." Sir William Garstin writes on "The Longest River in
                    tie World,” the Hon. Sidney Peel’s contribution deals with British rule in the
                    Sudan, and Mr. Grogan writes on “The Nile as I saw it.”</p>
