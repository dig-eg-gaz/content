                            notify Prince Charles of his election, and to ask the King's assent, was
                            an impressive and brilliant ceremony. The King, having assented, tamed
                            deeply moved to the Prince and Princess and exhorted the to serve their
                            now country loyally, and to win the love of the people. “Yon will," he
                            concluded, "take with you the blessing of your aged King and

                            would devote their lives for Norway’s good. His motto would be : "All
                            for Norway.” {Reuter)</p>

                            pays an indemnity. (Reuter)</p>

                        British Empire, has been signed by several hundred passengers on board the

                    <p>The petition says it is naturally regarded as an irritating and anomalous

                        the one hand and England on the other is one penny only, it should be still
                        2]d. between England and Port Said, Cairo, and Suez, and that there is
                        reason to believe that the Egyptian Government and people are entirely
                        favorable to the proposal for a penny postage.</p>

                        England would be, on the 1,200,000 letters to Egypt, £7,500-a mere

                        supported by a number of documents, which, he contended, proved that the

                    <head>WHERE IS THE FATHER ?</head>
                    <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                    <p>Sir,—In last night's “Egyptian Gazette"(Local and General) I read a short
                        article concerning a young woman named Lettshorn, who was sentenced to two
                        years’ imprisonment by the Native Assize Court in Cairo, for having killed
                        her new born child. It is indeed a very sad case. Sadder still, that there
                        should be a law inflicting punishment on the poor, seduced, perhaps hungry,
                        girl-mother and not on the seducer. Why is his name not mentioned in the
                        paper? Why should the young woman bear all the shame alone, and not share it
                        with the man who shared her love? Justice was merciless to the heartless
                        mother and lenient to the cowardly lover. Such sad cases will occur as long
                        as society will allow partiality in law. It is time some laws were
                        reformed.</p>
                    <p>With thanks, I beg to remain, dear sir,—</p>
                    <p>Yours faithfully</p>

                    <p>M. Lambert’s company opened well and had, if not a full, at least a good
                        house ever ready to respond to telling lines and good acting, and at times
                        unwilling to reserve its applause at the close of an act. That M. Lambert's
                        company would do well was expected. but no one, in our opinion, counted on
                        hearing the parts of Fabrics and Clorinde so brilliantly upheld. M. Albert
                        Lambert fils rendered the first role with real power; Mlle Delvair as
                        Clorinde was brilliant She possesses a fine presence, great powers of facial
                        expression, and one of those rich voices, so rarely heard, that make
                        movement and gesture almost needless when they express emotion or passion,
                        so perfect it the charm of their intonation. M. Albert Lambert pere as
                        Annibal was good, and M. Marqnet played his part with dignity—perhaps with
                        too much reserve—for the role of a distinguished old gentleman who is ready
                        to throw himself at the feet of a handsome girl with a pathetic certainty
                        that she reciprocates his flame, Is rather on the comic side.</p>

                        best thanks of the people for this action, mast recognize the great harm
                        caused by monopolies. Therefore we seize this opportunity (adds our
                        contemporary) to draw the attention of the Government and of Lord Cromer,
                        the great reformer of Egypt, to the tombac trade, which has been for 30
                        years ,a monopoly in Egypt. Tombac is so much used here that it ought to be
                        considered one of the indispensable wants of the people. This monopoly has
                        so far caused great harm to the finauces of our country, and our wise
                        reformer and the high authorities could put an end to it, as they have done

                        the building of a fine theatre, and a committee of their wives will
                        determine who shall be privileged to pay £20,000 apiece for the boxes. If
                        thirty public-spirited capitalist; patrons of the opera were to do likewise
                        at Alexandria, and the Municipality were to turnish a fine site, we should
                        have a theatre worthy of Egypt’s commercial capital.</p>

                        against the mosquito, has aroused considerable interest, and one of oar
                        readers sends us the following extract from an article in the "Lancet” :—
                        “What other countries are doing to exterminate the mosquito, Egypt can
                        do.Thank God we have not yellow fever here. But as long as the mosquito is
                        ubiquitous in Egypt, so long is it a menace to the health and comfort of the
                        people. The inhabitants and old residents are no doubt immune to a great
                        extent to the discomfort and annoyance from the bites of these pests. But
                        tho stranger within our gates speedily falls a prey to the insect which at
                        night slumbers not nor sleeps, and seems imbued with the faculty of
                        tantalising and torturing its victims.</p>
                    <p>"The most pessimistic of Job comtorters cannot deny that to destroy some
                        millions of these pests on the lines now so well-known and practised would
                        be greatly to enhance the reputation of Egypt as a resort for the tourist
                        and invalid. At present even the temper of a Mark Tapley's not proof agains
                        the irritability caused by the injection of the poison from their
                        probosces.</p>
                    <p>"That no organised attempt has been made to combat the evil we must ascribe
                        to either a lack of initiative on the part of the European residents, or
                        else to the general feeling engendered by prolonged residence in Egypt,
                        which is so aptly expressed by the Arabic philosophical utterance ‘Malish.’
