					<head>ALEXANDRIA’S NEW PARK. THE RESTORATION OF NOUZHA.</head>
					<p>Nouehs Gardens, situated on the bank of the Mahmoudieh Canal, near Ramleh,
						destined shortly to become one of the fashionable rendezvous of
						Alexandrians. For years past the grounds, at one time beautiful, have been
						allowed to go to wreck and ruin, being only used for an occasional picnic
						party. A charge has now come over the place, however. The Municipality, at
						the beginning ol the present year, very wisely decided to take the property
						in hand, and restore it to its pristine beauty ; and judging by what we saw
						during a recent visit, a most excellent beginning has been made. If the
						necessary funds are forthcoming Alexandria will in a very short time be
						endowed with a park and grounds worthy of a big city, attractive not only to
						residents—who are sore to make it their favorite drive—but also to visitors.
						The grounds now present a most charming and fascinating aspect. Avenues,
						alleys, and paths have been laid out, all the undergrowth has been removed,
						the grotto and pond have been completely relaid, hedges trimmed, and new
						beds and a lawn laid out. Great attention has been paid to the trees; of
						which some very rare specimens are to be found, and these have been brought
						Well into view. A special plot, shaded and cool, has been cleared out for
						the use of children, We particularly noticed a plot laid out with
						chrysanthemums. There are a thousand of these plants to be seen in full
						bloom, and they present a striking and most beautiful mass of colours, some
						blooms being particularly noticeable for their vivid colour and size. It is
						quite, a good show, and Augurs well for the future. We hope that now this
						excellent beginning has been made the work will be kept up, and that by next
						year, with a band day and the necessary accommodation provided for afternoon
						tea, etc., Nousha will become the rendezvous of our local "smart set.”</p>

					<head>THE CRONIER DEBACLE.</head>
					<p>In a letter to the London "Standard,” on speculation in sugar, <persName>Mr.
							Geo. Mathieson</persName>, managing director of Messrs.
							<persName>Clarke, Nickolls</persName>, and Coombs, Ltd., says :— The
						French expert at the Brussels Convention, the late <persName>M.
							Cronier</persName>, although in the end he overreached himself; quite
						correctly recognised in that international compact the finest Instrument for
						speculation that had been forged for many a day. Its restrictions in
						preventing the free circulation of sugar delivered consumers for a time into
						the cornerers’ hands. It was largely owing to the small surpluses of Russia,
						etc., that <persName>Mr. Martineau</persName> despises, finding their way
						round, and setting free for export sugar otherwise required in
						non-prohibited countries, that the corner was ultimately broken up. Although
						M. Cronier, by attempting to grasp to much, came to disaster, other more
						fortunate speculators succeeded in fleeting sugar consumers in this country
						alone to the tune of at least £6,000,000 during the last twelve months, as
						can be seen by the Board of Trade figures. It is no mean achievement, and
						while the convention is in operation, other speculators, when chance offers,
						will work it to the same end more effectively, and, perhaps, guided by the
						Cronier disaster, more wisely for themselves. But we are hopeful our lesson
						has been learnt, and that no British Government will be mad enough to renew
						the contention, or ever again enter into a similar compact, In an article on
						the financial situation and the position of the Basque de Ftaooe, the
						"Monitear des InWrtts Maferiels” remarks:-- " Il est certain que si les
						traites Cronier avaient été présentées à la Banque de France, elles auraient
						été presentées. Le tireur était depuis longtemps assez suspect an point de
						vue do-crédit dans le monde 'financier. Voici an moins deux ans, dit-én
						aojonrd’hni, qne le président des Raffinerie et Sucreries Say était
						au-dessous de ses affaires. On ne oonçoit pas qne dés banques et banqnieirs
						de premier ordre aient pu lai faire orédit, et rien qne le taux de 8 f/0,

					<head>THE MECCA PILGRIMAGE. GOVERNMENT CIRCULAR</head>
					<p>The Egyptian Government has issued a circular relative to those who wish
						accompany the Mahmal caravan to the Hadjas, in which it points out the
						advantages which are gained by making the pilgrimage under such conditions.
						This year, as in former years, the Government has decided to allow those who
						are desirous of so doing, and who undertake to submit to the prescribed
						conditions, to accompany the" Mahmal caravan. Those who take Advantage of
						this offer of the Government will he placed under the protection of the Emir

						receive immediate medial care and ebemists, who are at the disposal of the

						under special conditions as regards comfort safety, and prestige. The cost
						of the expedition will be lessened by joining the caravan, as pilgrims will
						profit by the advantageous arrangements which the Emir el Hag is able to
						make regarding camels. In So far as the expenses of the journey concerned,
						experience has shown that the sums deposited in former years have been
						insufficient, and for the present year it has been decided that those
						accompanying the Mahmal must make the following deposits, according to the
						degree of comfort they desire to travel in: L.E. 25.500mm. for each first
						class passenger; including charge for one camel (an extra charge of L.E.
						13.500 mm, is made for every additional camel); L.E 23 for the second class

					<head>A SUDAN HERO. THE LATE <persName>SIR CHARLES WILSON</persName></head>
					<p>The "Times" gives the following appreciation of he
							<placeName>Sudan</placeName> career of the late Sir Charles Wilson:---
						When troubles with Egypt were brewing in1882, Sir Charles Wilson volunteered
						for special service in that country, and after the [Next few lines of text
						are illegible] <persName>Lord Dufferin’s</persName> mission until the end of
						1883. For the Egyptian campaign he received a medal and the Khedive a Star
						and promotion by brevet to the rank of colonel in the Army. He also received
						the honorary degree of D.C.L. from Oxford in 1883. Up to that time honors
						had been gained in peaceful fields either by scientific ____________ or by
						___matic successes. As a natural consequence of _______________________ his
						military advancement had been relatively slow. The chance for him to earn
						distinction in the leadership of men did not come until he had lost the
						habit of thinking and acting as a soldier. All Sir Charles Wilson's Oriental
						experience and familiarity with Ara________ marked him as an _____________
						to direct the intelligence branch of a force operating against native tribes
						in the Sudan. For these duties therefore, he was appointed Deputy-Adjutant
						and Quartermaster-General on the Headquarters staff with <persName>Lord
							Wolseley</persName>'s expedition for ____ relief of <persName>General
							Gordon</persName> in September, 1884. One of his subordinates then was
							<persName>Captain Horatio Herbert Ki_____</persName>, who, holding
						temporary rank as a major in the Egyptian Army, had been sent up the Nile by
							<persName>Sir Evelyn Wood</persName> earlier that year to prepare the
						way for an advance by enlisting the services of Sheikhs who had no thrown in
						their lot with the Dervishes. Much of the organisation on which Sir Charles
						Wilson relied afterwards for news of the Mahdi's movements was thus rady at
						hand. Nevertheless he had to exercise great discretion and keen judgement in
						sifting the evidence of agents whose stories were more often than not
						untrustworthy. That he performed these duties to Lord Wolseley's entire
						satisfaction is proved by frequent mention in despatches, though events
						several thinks discounted the value of his conclusions. He did however,
						succeed in establishing communications with the beleagureed her in
						_______________________ were kept up to the last by ___________________
						fidelity to the cause they served _____________ in question simply because
						_____________ taken did not give them a _____________ any important secrets.
						When <persName>Sir Herbert Stewart</persName>'s little force set out from
							<placeName>Korti</placeName> on January 6, 1885, for a hazardous but
						glorious march across the <placeName>Bayuda</placeName> desert, Sir Charles
						Wilson accompanied it. To him Lord Wolseley had entrusted a letter for
						General Gordon, with orders that he should deliver it into the hands of the
						defender of Khartoum. There was no thought at that time of the possibility
						of his having to command the desert column if Sir Herbert Stewart should be
						killed or wounded seriously. Lord Wolseley had made arrangements, which were
						shattered when in <persName>Colonel Fred Burnaby</persName> fell fighting at
							<placeName>Abou Klea</placeName>. After Sir Herbert Stewart was wounded
						fatally in the second battle at <placeName>Gubat</placeName> the command
						devolved on Sir Charles Wilson in cirute of his seniority. Being thrust
						suddenly into the position of military leader for which previous training
						had not qualified him he did his best to cary out Sir Herberts Stewart's
						plans. Whether he delayed too long after Gordon's steamers had joined him or
						simply took the common-sense precaution which circumstances demanded, is a
						question about which differences of opinion will alas exist. There was
						certainly nothing to justify the bitter attack made upon him because of his
						failure to reach Khartoum before it fell. A scapegoat was wanted to draw off
						attention from the blunder of others in higher authority, and he suffered
						accordingly. The attack delivered by Sir. Charles Wilson at
							<placeName>Metemmeh</placeName> on January 21 did not though
						unsuccessful, involve waste of time, because the four steamers from Khartoum
						only reached him while his troops were being withdrawn from that attempt.
						The next day, a hostile force having been reported near
							<placeName>Shendy</placeName>, Sir Charles Wilson thought it necessary
						to make a reconnaissance down the river in that direction. Then it was
						discovered that the frail boat needed repairs to their machinery. These were
						not completed until late January 23. The following morning Sir Charles
						Wilson,having with him a few British soldiers in red coats and less than 200
						Sudanese, started Khartoum. When after encountering many difficulties and
						fighting their way past Derviah batteries, the steamer were not within sight
						of Khartoum, they were too late. The place had fallen two days earlier, and
						General Gordon was dead. The belief that this catastrophe might have been
						averted but for the delay at Metemmeh and in the connoitring towards Shendy
						rests on no trustworthy evidence. </p>
