							SEPTEMBER 85, 1905. THE PRESS AND FOREIGN ARMIES</head>
						<p>The recent outbreak in German Beat Africa has caused considerable
							annoyance to the German tax payer, already irritated by the failure of
							General von Trotha to suppress the Hereto revolt, and it is not
							surprising that voices have been raised among the Socialists and
							Radicals demanding that German South West Africa should be sold or ceded
							as soon as possible to any power that will be good enough to take a most
							unpleasant burden from the taxpayers’ back. At present, how- <cb/>ever,
							the South West African Colony is not a tempting acquisition. A poor
							country at the best of times, and composed mainly of the “very light
							soil” to which the late Lord Salisbury rather unkindly referred when
							dis- cussing French colonial expansion in North Africa, it has been
							swept bare by savage in surgents and punitive columns for close on two
							years, and its population decimated by war and disease A number of
							statements concerning German atrocities have recently appeared in the
							home Press, and we have been surprised to find that some of our
							responsible organs, in their horror at the severity of German methods,
							have quite forgot- ten that the Indian Mutiny, and at a much later date
							the rising in Maahonaland, were not quelled by any but the sternest
							measures. In a war with savages who take no prisoners, and lose no
							chance of gratifying their most barbarous instincts, severity becomes
							necessary, and in our opinion the laws of Euro- pean war, which are
							excellently adapted for combat between civilised powers, cannot be
							applied to campaigns in which one of the com- batant forces is composed
							of barbarians. We do not suggest the Infliction of cruel and savage
							punishments—cruelty degrades, how- ever great the provocation—but there
							is un- pleasant work that cannot be left undone in such a campaign.
							Wolves are picturesque animals but they have to be extirpated. Gene- ral
							von Trotha no doubt issued most blood- thirsty proclamations unworthy of
							a civilised man, but we have seen nothing in the Cape papers, which are
							far better informed about the program of the straggle than is our home
							Press, that can justify the accusations of wholesale massacre that have
							appeared in responsible British journals. This taste for
							sensation-mongering at the expense of foreign armies is one of the
							greatest weaknesses of our Press, which does not appear to realise that
							soldiers, whatever their nationality, object to being termed savages and
							butchers. During the unhappy Dreyfus affair the French army was
							described in terms that left no doubt in the mind of the British reader
							that the Re- publican forces were composed of frightened peasants
							command by ruffians and perjurers. A few years pass and John Ball
							reading his description of the French maneuvres beams over the endurance
							and good humour of the rank and file, and notes with approval that ths
							average French officer knows his work well and does his best tor the
							comfort of his men. At present the German army is the Press- man's butt
							and lieutenant Bilse, a junior officer devoid of taste and expression,
							is held to have written the last word on the Kaiser’s forces. Some
							epauletted Gamaliel, blessed perhaps with less than Bilse’s
							endowments,will no doubt furnish our leader-writers with material for a
							campaign against the army of the next nation with which we happen to be
							on bad terms. Bat if we mast have foreign opponents, it is not possible
							to follow the Japanese example and keep quiet Otherwise in the unhappy
							event of our taking pert in a European war, we shall have to thank our
							journalists for im- parting a horrible bitterness to the struggle.</p>

					<head>NOTES FROM PORT SAID.</head>
					<head>BLOWING UP OF THE CHATHAM.</head>
					<byline>(Fbom our own Correspondent).</byline>
					<dateline>Port Said, Satnrday.</dateline>
					<p>Confirming my wire of this morning I now send a few of tho more interesting
						details of this unfortunate affair.</p>
					<p>It will be remembered that on the 9th inst Lieutenant Cunningham R A. and Mr.
						Ringros of the citadel, Cairo, came down here specially to survey and advise
						the Canal Company on the best methods of dealing with the matter. Their
						advice, after lengthy discussion and after a consultation held at the scene
						of the wreck and at Port Said in the presence of Messrs. Reynaud,Smitt,and
						the chiefs of the engineers’ staff, was that it would be decidedly unsafe to
						handle the 91 tons of explosives in any way or to subject the vessel to any
						shocks ; this advice involved the prohibition of any salvage operations
						which entailed any system of pum- ping as highly dangerous ; the reason
						being that a large quantity of the dynamite (of which there were over 3,000
						cases on board) had by that time become saturated with water, (the holds
						being full) and had in consequence given out a considerable quantity of
						nitro-glycerin which, in its turn, had become part and parcel of the water
						which the holds contained. It was evident, then, that the shocks which
						pumping would give this mixture would in all probabi- lity cause an
						explosion and mean the loss of the lives of all in the vicinity. However, it
						would appear that no decision was at that time definitely taken though
						preparation was made for eventualities of all kinds. The fresh water canal
						was barred at several points, togs were held in readiness on the spot,
						special pilots were sent to assist the navigation, and the canal banks were
						as far as possible protec- ted. Navigation went on during daylight with few
						exceptions, captains of ships being com- pelled to sign a declaration which
						indicated the knowledge of the situation and the risk entailed by ships
						passing the spot. On Wednes day, Mr. Conllant (L’Agent Principals) Mr.
						Perrier (L’ingenienr en Chef) and one or two other gentlemen of the canal
						staff who were sent out specially, arrived here by the Isis from Brindisi,
						which vessel had on board Mr. H. Harris, the eminent metallurgical chemist
						of of Messrs. Nobel's factory, and two assistants, Messrs. Cunningham and
						Thompson.</p>
					<p>The vessel reached here early and by 9 a.m. the entire staff here, with those
						who had recently arrived, were on board the special launch which was to take
						them to the Chatham.</p>
					<p>Arriving on the scene the several members of the commission proceeded to the
						sunken vessel in boats. Mr. Harris had not been here many minutes, before he
						discovered bubbles of what appeared to be air rising from the holds, and he
						at once set about collecting the "air” in glass vessels. The glasses were
						carefully taken away from the vessel and experiments were made which proved
						beyond doubt that the "air” was nothing more nor less than hydrogen in an
						almost pure state. (Hydrogen, though as an element perfectly harmless,
						becomes highly explosive when mixed with oxygen in the pro- portion of 2 to
						1 by volume, owing to their great affinity. Ed. E.Q.) This apparently led
						the experts to the conclusion that acid was at work on the iron in the ship
						or her cargo, and the more the acid increases in quantity the more the
						danger of spontaneeous explosion, owing to the greater quantity of
						nitroglycerin being subjected to chemical action, for it would appear that
						this is a substance whose safety only lies in its absolute lack of acid,
						hence its vary frequent washings in preparation and manufacture.</p>
					<p>Deliberations were proceeded with on return t) Port Sald, and the advice of
						Mr. Harris was wired to Paris. Mr. Tillier arrived on Friday morning and the
						replies to the telegram would appear to have roached here the same morning,
						for after a further visit to the wreck, it was decided to prooeed with as
						little delay as possible to the explosion of the vesseL The day, Thursday
						next, was finally fixed last night, it being the day after the passage of
						the P. and 0. mail for India and Australia, and it has been since officially
						intimated that all traffic is to close on Wednesday evening in order to give
						the experts full time in which to test currents and lay charges as they
						require to be, most carefally. Troops have been asked for from Cairo who
						will form a cordon round the spot in a circle of some six miles diameter,
						this being apparently a safe distance from which the effect of this monster
						explosion may watched.</p>
					<p>In the opinion of tho expert committee unlikely the shock will be the of much
						damage in Port Said beyond perhaps a few broken windows for it must
						collected that there is over 25 feet of water above the explosives and that
						the canal banks will keep the lateral disturbance largely within bounds. It
						is not anticipated either that the railway will greatly suffer beyond
						displacement and loosening of rails, and should the fresh water canal be
						damaged, which is more than likely, it will, it is hoped, not greatly
						interfere with the water supply here, as the deviation of the channel to the
						extent of 220 yards is now completed, so that should the old canal be out
						up, which is pro- bable, the new channel is hardly likely to suffer
						appreciably. The ship canal’s east bank will undoubtedly be blown to atoms
						and the west bank too will probably be badly damaged, but the main trouble
						is considered by the experts here, who have the matter in hand, to be the
						effort of the tidal wave may attain practically any proportion, and will
						probably cause a great deal of da- <cb/>mage in this harbour unless craft
						are moored in the roadstead and well dear of each other.</p>
					<p>The difficulty in saying beforehand what will actually oocur on Thursday lies
						in the fact that no semblance even of a criterion exists in the history of
						explosives, and therefore, though it is probable that the experts have erred
						on the right side, their calculations are based on pure surmise. The meur-
						ers of the commission are Messrs. Tillier, Coullant, Schmitt, Reynaud and,
						Perrier, Doyer, Jusserand, Koenig, Harri', Cunningham, and Thompson.</p>
					<p>(From another Correspondent). Intense excitement has been evident in Port
						Said since the committee of experts finally decided to blow op the Chatham.
						There is, of course, much speculation as to what the effects of such an
						enormous explosion are likely to be, and some of the inhabitants anti-
						cipate the event with most ridiculous terror. The shock will, of of course,
						be felt in the town but there is very little danger of any serious damage
						being done as the sunken vessel is nineteen kilometres away. Meanwhile
						prepara- tions are being made for the blowing up of the vessel, and I learn
						on good authority that the batteries for the generation of the electric
						power have already been fixed at Kantars, which is some twenty-two
						kilometres from the position of the Chatham.</p>
					<p>The railway authorities anticipate the loos- ening of the rails, and have
						made arrange- ments for the work of relaying them to be started as soon as
						possible after the explosion, They have over a thousand bags of sand in
						readiness and as a large gang of workmen will work on the line without a
						pause traffic is not likely to be very seriously delayed.</p>
					<p>I do not know whether any steps are being taken for a temporary telegraph
						line to be laid sufficiently far from the scene of the explosion to be
						rendered safe from destruction, but as those which run along the railway are
						almost certain to be thrown down by the force of the explosion for a
						considerable distance it is to be hoped that provision is being made for the
						maintenance of telegraphs communication between here and the rest of Egypt,
						especially as the mails will be greatly delayed.</p>
					<p>It is difficult to ascertain exactly what weight of dynamite will be
						exploded. First reports gave the amount as 70 tons, which was said to be the
						amount which appeared in the manifest, and then came the story that there
						was at least 120 tons aboard. Probably 100 tons is an approximately accurate
						estimate,but after all the explosion will be so terrible that a few tons
						more or less will make but little difference.</p>

					<p>Samedi, eu ouvrant l’audience du Tribunal Mixe de Justice Sommaire de cette
						ville, M. le Président Carl Otto Montan a, devant on public nombreux, rendu
						un dernier et solennel hommage à la mémoire du regretté magistrat français
						M. Frédéric Ruhland, on termes émue, et empreints d'uno vive et sincère
						douleur.</p>
					<p>M. le Président s’est exprimé ainsi : Messieurs, Au moment où les vacances
						judiciaires ap- prochent de leur fin, et qu’on espérait revoir en pleine
						vigueur tous ceux qui étaient partis pour se reposer de leurs fatigues et se
						préparer aux travaux futurs, une dépéche nous annonce la mort subite d’un
						des membres de notre Tribu- nal, de celui qui pendant assez longtemps pré-
						sida a cette Chambre même, M. Frédéric Ruhland. </p>
					<p>Ce n'est qu'il y a quatre ans a peine que M. Ruhland quitta son siège a la
						Cour d'Appel de Paris pour devenir un des représentants de la France aux
						Tribunaux Mixtes.</p>
					<p>Rien ne faisait prévoir que la vie de ce magistrat digne et intègre touchât à
						sa fin. S'il était d’un âge un peu avancé il ne paraissait pas toutefois
						décliner vers la vieillesse. Et c'était en parfaite santé qu'il nous quitta
						il y a quelques mois.</p>
					<p>C'est ctte Chambre qui spécialement a été à méme d’apprécier tant son amour
						du travail et son empressement à l'accomplir, que sa haute capacité et son
						sentiment prononcé de la Justice.</p>
					<p>D autre part, par sa droiture et sa franchise, par son amabilité, sa bonté et
						sa simplicité, M. Ruhland avait acquis aussi en Egypte, l'estime et les
						sympathies de tous.</p>
					<p>Sa disparition laissera dans nos coeurs un grand .vide en même temps que la
						magistra- ture mixte en éprouve une perte des plus sen- sibles.</p>
					<p>Au nom de ses collegues j'ai voulu a cette occasion donner une expression de
						la profonde douleur que sa mort nous a causée et rendre un hommage bien
						mérité k sa mémoire.</p>
					<p>Au nom du parquet Général Mixte, M. le Substitut, Mohamed bey Abdel Latif El
						Kor- chyd, s’est associé aux paroles prononcées par M. le Président
						d'audience en disant la part très grande que lui et ses collègues prennent
						au deuil qui frappe la Magistrature Mixte.</p>
					<p>M. Frédéric W. Simond, Substitut du Bâ- tonnier de l'Ordre des Avocats, a
						ensuite de- mandé la parole et au nom du Barreau Mixte, il a prononcé le
						discoursque nous reproduisons ci-dessous.</p>
					<p>Monsieur le Président, Le Barreau a appris avec stupeur la mort subite de
						l'éminent magistrat qui, il y a quel- ques jours à peine, nous quittait pour
						aller dans son pays chercher le repos, après le dur labeur de l’hiver.</p>
					<p>Jeune encore, M. Ruhland semblait devoir parcourir une longue carrière et il
						paralt im- possible que la mort impitoyable l'ait enlevé de ce siège qu’il
						aimait tant, et où nous avons eu si souvent l’occasion d’admirer ses hautes
						qua- tés de magistrat et d'homme du monde.</p>
					<p>Vous avez dit, Monsieur le Président, ta, science juridique et la netteté de
						son esprit si fortement cultivé. </p>
					<p>Il m’appartient d’évoquer son souvenir pour remercier sa mémoire de
						l'affabilité exquise et de l'extrême courtoisie dont il a toujours fait
						preuve dans ses rapporte avec nous. Nul de nous n'oubliera jamais sa
						cordiale poignée de main ni son affectueux sourire. Aussi, o’eit le ocêur
						serré que je me joins aux paroles que vous avez prononcées et que j'unis le
						Barreau k la Magistrature pour déplorer ce nouveau deuil qui nous frappe
						tous et met un voile de tristesse sur cette audience de Justice Som- maire,
						oh plane encore son bon esprit et ta douce autorité.</p>
					<p>Je vous prie. Monsieur le Président, de prendre acte de la profonde sympathie
						du Barreau ainsi qne de ses regrets attristés.</p>
					<p>L'audience a été alors suspendue pendant quelques instants en signe de
						deuil.</p>

					<head>THE JAPANESE NAVY.</head>
					<p>A cheery chronicle of some incidents in the late war, and of the part taken
						by himself as a volunteer naval officer, is to be found in Mr. H. C.
						Seppings Wright’s ‘ Story of Seven Months’ Active Service" with the Japanese
						Fleet before Port Arthur. Mr. Wright seems to have held a brief to witch
						operations on behalf of the great Armstrong firm, from whose works at
						Elswick have come forth so much of the armament that aided Japan to gain her
						successes on the seas. The voyage out gave the artist-correspondent his
						first taste of war matters ; for among his fellow-travellers were some
						Japanese officers. One, Captain Sakai, was on his way home from St
						Petersburg, where he had been stationed.—</p>
					<p>"He was a quiet, somewhat reserved man, and seemed really sorry that the war
						had broken out. “I have so many friends in St. Petersburg,’ he said, and
						only recently I said "good bye" to Admiral Makarof, who,’ he added, with
						rather a sad smile, ‘hopes to meet me in the Far East’ ”</p>
					<p>Mr. Wright tells as that the disunities attending war-correspondents bound
						for the front on land were as nothing to those awaiting the audacious
						foreigner who sought to see something of the naval actions. But his own case
						was backed by the Armstrong interest, and he facilitated compliance by
						offering him- self for active service—a petition that was by and by
						considered favorably. Meanwhile, he was lucky enough to he invited to form
						one of a favored party going from Tokio to the neighbourhood of Port Arthur
						in a steamship. This excursion was to be "a sort of Govern- ment picnic on a
						large scale’’—planned, one shrewdly suspects, with the object of keeping
						restless correspondents amused and out of mischief. At Sasebo, the guests
						were allowed to inspect dockyards, arsenals, stores, and hospitals, and to
						make the acquaintance of the Commander-in chief, Admiral Samijima. Che-
						mulpo and Seoul were visited: and an audience was granted by His Majesty of
						Korea. Mr. Wright’s pages are full of lively description, and it is clear
						that the picnickers enjoyed a thoroughly pleasant trip. Most impressive did
						our author find his first sight of “A certain place’’—i.e., Togo’s secret
						base ; and of Togo himself be made the acquaintance on board his flagship,
						the ill-fated Mikasa, the destruction of which, by a sad coincidence, marks
						the day of Mr. Wright's publication.</p>
					<p>Back at Tokio, Mr. Wright found his luck held, and he was duly accepted as a
						volunteer in the service of the Emperor of Japan. Ap- pointed in an
						auxiliary cruiser, he saw some- thing of the daily round aboard a vessel of
						this class, and noted in what manner it differed from our own naval routine.
						The Jap sailors won his heart:—</p>
					<p>"They stand about knitting, if nothing else is to be done. They are never
						idle, and are always merry and good tempered. There is never any punishment,
						for none is ever merit- ed. Each man feels that his particular job is as
						necessary to Japan as Admiral Togo himself, <cb/>and they are all inspired
						by one sentiment— 'Bushido,' the literal meaning of which is ‘duty and
						patriotism.’ ”</p>
					<p>The English critio appears to hava found plenty to admire ; and be selects
						for men- tion a few of the points wherein ha consider- ed the Japanese naval
						organisation especially admirable. Por ins tan oe :—</p>
					<p>"All food undergoes the strictest inspection, not only before, but after it
						is cooked. Every day the quartermaster brings in a dish of the men’s
						food—taken haphazard from the coppers which the paymaster and the doctor
						taste and inspect, and the same system is applied to the food destined for
						the ward-room, so that all on board have only the most wholesome food set
						before them. This excellent system is also enforced is the army. . . .
						Walking round the ship I noticed that two very useful boats of the sampan
						type were carried. Needle- nosed and flat-bottomed, they are propelled by
						sculling at the side, and are perfect for land- ing troops. They are capable
						of holding a fair number of men, who squat on the bottom out of the way of
						the scullers ; and drawing very little water, they nan go dose to the shore,
						thus enabling the men to effect a dry landing. This is one of the secret* of
						the Japanese success in putting a large army on shore, as all the ships
						carry these boats."</p>
					<p>Mr. Wright was struck, also, by the custom of sending the purser and the
						doctor, as soon as a ship’s anchor was down, to the harbour- master’s ship
						"to report arrival and to receive instructions " :—</p>
					<p>" All ships on the way to the front report themselves at various
						signal-stations on the journey, and when they pass near a base they call in
						for further orders.’</p>
					<p>In this way they leave and receive the latest news, and are in constant touch
						with officials at headquarters.</p>
					<p>The extreme cleanliness of the Jap sailors is extended, we learn, to the
						outside of their vessels, which are never allowed to become foul. The
						thoroughness with which the men acour and paint the bottoms of their ships
						is sometimes not a little awkward for those on dock ; as Mr. Wright
						describes amusingly later on. While with the cruiser at Dalny he heard the
						news of Liaoyang, and the story of the sinking of the Novik at
						Saghalien.</p>
					<p>Transferred to an auxiliary cruiser at Dalny, and thence to torpedo-boat No.
						67,Mr. Wright found himself at last at work within Togo’s lines. His own
						duties were light, and he met with the greatest kindness from everyone—in-
						including Togo himself. The fleet was lying be- fore Port Arthur, waiting
						for the general assault to take place, on land, which “it was hoped would
						drive the Russians into Togo's arms." The torpedo-boat's daily "24 hours’
						brat" soon grew monotonous to Mr. Wright— diversified as it was by
						occasional experience* of a sterner sort; and he petitioned for leave to go
						ashore and pitch his tent within sight of the struggle. Permission was
						granted, and a spot chosen on a hill where a camp could be established just
						outside the fighting tone. There Mr. Wright posted himself with his guard
						and his attendants, and there he passed a month very comfortably (barring
						accidents) in painting and prospecting and viewing the distant fighting ;
						carefully watched over by his interested friends in the fleet—who, they
						assured him, were "responsible to Togo for his safety." Another period on
						board No. 67 was made even livelier than usnal by the fesivites— graphically
						described—of the Em- peror of Japan's birthday.</p>
					<p>The fall of Port Arthur being imminent Mr. Wright obtained leave to return to
						his old ship at Dalny ; and thence, when the surrender had actually taken
						place, he journeyed to the scene of the great struggle. On the way he was
						the guest of Ichinohe—"the gallant officer who, sword in hand, was wont to
						spring to the heed of his troops and personally lead them to the attack’’—
						and visited' the horrible desola- tion of Double Dragon Fort.</p>
					<p>Port Arthur at this juncture has been de- scribed by many pens ; not the
						latest is at least as capable as any. The admirable order immediately
						introduced by the Japanese occupiers (who seemed to have thought of and
						prepared for everything), and their fine courtesy to the defeated side, have
						become a familiar tale. Mr. Wright is more interesting when he takes us to
						visit the Russian battle- ships sank in the harbour, and 203 Metre HOI "of
						tragic memory." It is almost a pity that this is practically the end of our
						author's narrative ; for here, at least, he sapped fall of horrors, and the
						recital breaks dramatically the generally light-hearted style in which he
						has couched by far the greater part of his story. His return to Tokio
						concluded his ad ventures in the East. He has made of them a book that
						mingles most attractively informa- tion and entertainment; and while those
						familiar with our own Service will be gratified by his notes and news about
						the Japanese Navy from a professional point of view, less instructed readers
						will discover many pleasing pictures showing the purely human side of the
						gallant fellows who defend the shores of the land of the Rising Sun.</p>
					<p>Mr. Seppings Wright’s excellent drawings and photographs illustrate the
						volume, which is published in neat guise by Messrs. Hurst and Blackett.</p>

					<head>MONT PELLE BY NIGHT.</head>
					<p>We saw Mont Pelee at midnight and from the sea. The steamer had threaded its
						way through the tangle of islands to the north, each beautiful in form and
						colour beyond expression, and had come at last te Dominice, perhaps the most
						perfect of alL It is but a stone’s throw from Martinique, the focus of fire
						and destruction, but as we cleared the road- stead of Rousean at sundown it
						looked, in the warm light, like a pictures of peace becalmed. From the dip
						of the land into the sea to the high mornes that caught the clouds it was
						green with verdure and aflame with flower. The heat haze of the day simmered
						about it, airy iridescent, and the atmosphere was still with the intense
						stillness that follows the dying away of the sea wind. One is not long in
						the tropics before he realises that quietude is the prevailing note of
						Nature there ; it interpenetrates the gorgeous phenomena of the day, and it
						makes night incomparable in its cool repose. To it this region of the world
						owes much of its healing power, and not a little of its glamour and mystery.
						For day will follow day, and night succed night, in even proces- sion, for a
						decade, and then a paroxysm, as fierce as it is sodden, will seise it, and
						change the fair heaven of its appearance into a desola- tion as of hell.</p>
					<p>As the vessel steamed into the open sea the night came, serene and dear, and
						radiant with stars. At intervals silent lightning flared up from some
						quarter beyond the horison, mo- mentarily flooding the seascape with violet
						Later, over the port bow, in the far distance, appeared a confusion in the
						sky, where the moon was rising behind clouds, unseen, but aureoled in olive.
						Straight ahead there rose an uncertain mass, darker than the night, with the
						Southern Cross not yet end, shining above. When it took more palpable shape
						we saw, sweeping np from the sea, in vast, magni- ficent outline, the form
						of Mont Pelce. There was no huddling of summits and shoulders as in the
						other islands bat one broad base swell- ing into a single needle like peak.
						The impres- sion of solitude and grandeur which it impart ed was not
						modified as other peaks farther south, came into view. The base but
						broadened and the summit rose, dwarfing them all in the majesty and
						austerity of their profile. The cone was silhouetted against the sky with
						the sharpness of a photographic negative, like many tropical peaks at night
						when the air is free from the cloud which the heat and the wind of the day
						develop. There was nothing to indicate the activity of the forces that still
						exist and rage far below these upper heights.</p>
					<p>Along the coast, lights gleamed from the hamlets among the palm groves, but
						as we passed to leeward and entered the shadow of the land we approached the
						volcanic tone, and these kindly glimmerings became fewer, and then ceased.
						The sea was dead calm, with phosphorescence streaming below the surface.</p>
					<p>We steamed so silently that the engine power seemed muffled—we moved as
						things do in a dream. And always skywards stood out the lonely peak
						environed by the beauty and mystery of the night</p>
					<p>As we looked, there came a swift movement on the summit, and a column of
						steam, white and ghostlike, swirled op and rose high in the air. The effect
						was startling in its suddenness, in the contrast which the flying vapour
						made with the dark, immovable rook, and one gated with fascinated
						expectancy, not knowing what might follow. The cloud went sporting upwards,
						but towards the top, where the pressure lessen- ed, it also spread slowly
						out with a puffing, rolling motion. For a moment it caught a glow as from
						some strange fire beneath, and took on the likeness of a cross reddened with
						blood. Then it collapsed and became a mass of shapeless mist that covered
						the peak and hid it from view.</p>
					<p>The moon-clouds broke, and a beam of light, soft and end beautiful shot down
						and rested upon the mountain side, and by and by the whole land was
						illumined and revealed. We saw that the ground ascended to the peak in long
						hollow slopes. There was no appearance, as in the other islands, of rounded
						masses of vegetation or serrated ridge, hot only of clean, flint-like
						surface, adamantine and barren. One felt the cool wind that always blows on
						there islands at night, but here it came unscented with the fragrance of the
						woods. The light shone on the aretes as on smooth quartz, but left the
						canons black and impenetrable. One of these, the River Blanche, extended np
						to the peak, and one could imagine he saw, in the higher folds, the crater
						which opened that fair Ascen- sion morning and shot out the incandescent
						blast that annihilated St Pierre.</p>
					<p>St Pierre ! There it lies along a bend in the coast at the foot of the
						southern slopes, soundless because sheltered from the sari that rolls and
						beats upon the Atlantic side, dreamless because it is a city of the dead.
						The moonshine of the tropics can do won- derful things. It can transform a
						swamp into a garden and shabby buildings into palaces, but it cannot make St
						Pierre anything but what it is—the skeleton of an organism once vivid with
						life, a thing of rags and tatters, of wreck irretrievable, surcharged with
						horror and melancholy.</p>
					<p>It is too dim to discern details. One sees a jagged strip of ground with
						short up- rights that recall a cemetery, a hare bluff behind, the shape here
						and there of a blasted tree, and, higher, the ridges about Moire Rouge,
						where the area of life again begins. The last glimpse is of a young ba- nana
						leaf waving slowly in the ashen waste, suggesting the time when Nature, in
						its in- sistent irresistible way may fertilise the dust and disintegrate the
						basalt and cover the ruins with bloom.</p>
					<p>Midnight was past-the Gross had began to bend. Lights appeared again on the
						sea level and a cluster farther on, for which we made. One in front—a
						beacon—dazzled us with its brightness, and then the chains rattled, and we
						anchored off Fort de France.</p>
