                            <lb/>liberaly measure of autonomy to the islanders, <lb/>it was almost
                            universally expected that a few <lb/>years would see the union of the
                            island with <lb/>the kingdom of Greece. The islanders had <lb/>alwys
                            looked forward to such an end. They <lb/>had shed their blood not for
                            independence but <lb/>for union with Greece, and had endured the
                            <lb/>discomforts of a civil war with the Cretan <lb/>Moslems and a more
                            or less pacific blockade <lb/>by the squadrons of the great Powers, in
                            the <lb/>hope that the blue and white flag would <lb/>one day fly over
                            their towns. The Powers, <lb/>whose action resembled that of a mother
                            <lb/>who chastises a child for crying and then <lb/>consoles it with
                            sweets and promises, first <lb/>fired on the insurgents and then gave
                            <lb/>them their autonomy. Their appointment <lb/>of Prince George of
                            Greece to the High <lb/> Commissionership of the island encouraged the
                            <lb/>belief that they not only sympathised with, but <lb/>approved of
                            the aspirations of the Cretans. <lb/> The autonomous period was
                            naturally regarded <lb/>as a brief interregnum to be closed after a few
                            <lb/>years by the annexation to Greece of what was <lb/> geographically
                            a Greek island. The <lb/>Cretan Moslems were mostly converted
                            Greeks,<lb/> and those of them who disapproved of the new </p>

                            parts of the island might <lb/>otherwise have caused by emigrating en
                            masse <lb/>to Tripoli or Asia Minor. All seamed favorable <lb/>to the
                            early consummation of the islanders' <lb/>hopes, but the Powers always
                            prone to make a <lb/> fetish of the status quo, did nothing. The
                            <lb/>Cretans passed resolutions, and Prince George<lb/>put his pride in
                            his pocket and visited one <lb/> European capital after another, but all
                            to no <lb/>purpose, and on his return found sections of the
                            <lb/>population inclined to back their protests by <lb/> armed
                            revolution. It being impossible for a <lb/>Prince, appointed by the
                            great Powers to<lb/>govern the island, to countenance an attempt <lb/>to
                            force the hand of Europe by rioting and <lb/>bloodshed, whatever his
                            personal sympathies, <lb/>not a little of the annoyance which would
                            otherwise have found vent in resoltuions <lb/>and speaches, was kept
                            down by his ac-<lb/>tion and like confined steam, grew under
                            <lb/>pressure. Eventually the explosion came and<lb/> a minority led by
                            some able if turbulent poli-<lb/>ticians is now encamped on the
                            mountains and <lb/>engaged in skirmiches with the British and
                            <lb/>Russian troops of the International garrison<lb/>and the Cretan
                            police, varied by cattle lifting <lb/>and the composition of appeals to
                            the civilised<lb/>world in general and Greece in particular.</p>
                        <p>It is only natural that the Powers should on <lb/>principle, resfuse to
                            discuess the Cretian question<lb/> till order had been restored. But it
                            is surely <lb/> unthinkable that the prestige of Europe would
                            <lb/>suffer were the international forces to be with-<lb/>drawn, and
                            their place taken by Greeck troops <lb/> to whom the insurgents would
                            offer no resis-<lb/>tance. The suppression of the rebellion by the
                            <lb/>international troops would lead to much <lb/>bloodshed and
                            bitterness, would penalise the <lb/>whole Cretan people for the misdeeds
                            of a few. <lb/> and would solve nothing. The islanders would <lb/>remain
                            just as anxious for union with Greece, <lb/>the Powers would in a few
                            years have to face <lb/>a repition of this summer's disorders, and
                            <lb/>Greece would be more and more inclined to <lb/>thrown in her lot
                            with the Sultan in the hope of<lb/>gaining concessions in Macedonia.
                            Neither <lb/>credit nor honor are to be gained against the <lb/>Credtan
                            insurgents, and if Greece is not a <lb/> strong power that is hardly a
                            reason to <lb/>neglect her appeals to be allowed to take <lb/>measures
                            for the paciication of the is-<lb/>land which she alone could carry out.
                            Prin-<lb/>ciple might well give place to expediency <lb/>in Crete, and a
                            continuance of the present <lb/>policy of the Powers must lead, even if
                            the<lb/>present revolt and a score of other revolts<lb/>are crushed, to
                            bloodhsed and discontent. <lb/>The recent history of the island is a
                            curious <lb/>commentary on the results of European in-<lb/>tervention,
                            and it is to be hoped that Europe <lb/>will at last realise that union
                            with Greece is <lb/>the only solution that will ensure a perma-<lb/>nent

                        <p>A most welcome change in the weather has taken place in Cairo during the
                            last few days. The heat, which was so intense, and at times almost
                            unbearable, during July and August, has considerably diminished, and the
                            morn-ings and evenings now are delightful: Residents who have been
                            obliged to pass the summer in that city will have just cause to remember
                            it, for the summer-now coming to a dose has been one of the hottest and
                            most trying on record, the thermometer in several instances having been
                            up as high as 114° Fahrenheit in the shade between noon and 8 o'clock.
                            It has now fallen to 90° Fahrenheit at the hottest time of the day, but
                            at night the temperature is no more than 60° Fahrenheit. The great heat
                            of the past two months caused a perfect exodus from Cairo to San
                            Stefano, Port Said, and Ras El Bar; at the letter plase the number of
                            visitors this season has been double what it was last year. </p>

                        be transmitted | direct between the two cities and Tantah. Part of the work

                    <p>EXPORTS GREATLY INCREASED.</p>
                    <p>As most of our resident readers are aware the cigarette trade is one of the
                        most important and flourishing industries in this country, and it bar been
                        remarkably developed daring the last few years? The export portion of the
                        trade is the one that has been more steadily Increasing in volume and,
                        judging by the customs return* the^increase has lately been augment-ing by
                        leaps and bounds. Last year the total experts amounted approximately to 500
                        million cigarette weighing over 650 tons, whilst the previous year's total
                        of the cigarettes exported from Alexandria, Port Said, and Suez was about
                        400 million so that there was an increase of one year of no less 100
                        millions. As shown by these customs returns, during the past quinquennial
                        period the business of the five leading firms of manufacturers has increas-
                        considerably, and compared with, say fifteen or twenty yean ago, there Law
                        beer an enor- mous development in the which cigarette trade and a consequent
                        augmentation in the number of all manufacturers. Of the total-exports one
                        Cairo firm alone exported 134 million cigarettes, the whole of which went to
                        Germany and was of the cheaper description. Another well-known Cairo firm
                        comes next with art ex- port of 110 millions, a large portion of which went
                        to the United Kingdom and was composed mostly of the dearer and better class
                        of cigarettes. Almost the whole manufacturing trade is done in Cairo on
                        account of the dryness of the dimate and its consequent suitability. From
                        the returns that have been furnished by the customs of that city the exports
                        during the past four years have been as follows in round figures; </p>

                    <p> Of the total expert from Egypt of £20,476 kilos, valued at slightly over
                        £500,000, Germany took about one half, whilst the United Kingdom comes next
                        with close on 100,000 kilos, valued at £80,000. In these last figures we do
                        not include the quantities exported to British possessions or colonies,
                        which latter took 75,500 kilos, worth £59,700. As we mentioned in an article
                        published a few days ago the exports to the United States of America,
                        compared with that of other countries, are very small on account of the
                        vexations restrictions imposed by the American Customs. </p>
                    <p> Out of the total export trade from Egypt of 620 metric tons, Port Said
                        stands as the head of the ports of embarkation. It exported some 307 tons,
                        valued at L.E. 246,000; Alexandria exported some 224 tons, of a value of
                        L.E. 180,000 and Suez about 88 tons valued at L.E. 69,000. Of the 307 tons
                        from Port Said, 42 tons went to the United Kingdom, 194 tons to Germany and
                        11 to the Far East. The average wholesale export price of Egyptian
                        cigarettes appears to be about 7s. 6d. or 9.50 francs per lb. </p>
                    <p> The manufacturers complain that their trade suffers at present under a great
                        disadvantage, in that they have to pay an import duty of P.T. 20 on every
                        killogramme imported, and recieve a drawback on exports of half the amount,
                        which they consider unjust, as under the customs tariff now in force they
                        have to pay the same amount o duty on cigarettes, whether they are consumer
                        in the country of out of it. They therefore contend that the ciggarete
                        manufacturered expressly for exportation should be except of duty
                        altogether, and offered some time ago to erect bonded ware houses for the
                        manufacture of the goods intendd for export in bond. So far the Customs
                        authorities have not entertained, or rather given their consent to this
                        arrangement, but should they at any future time saction it, there is no
                        doubt that the adoption of such a system would give a further great stimulus
                        to the cigarette industry of Egypt, and Cairo in particular. </p>
                    <p> We may remark, on passant, that the designation of the cigarettes made in
                        this country as Agyptian is a misnomer, as the tobacco comes almost entirely
                        from Turkey, as most people are aware, and the paper used in rolling the
                        cigarettes is importaed from Austria principally. </p>
                    <p> A small quantity of the tobacco comes from the district of Xanth, in the
                        province of Thrace; and the export is almost entirely from Cavally, where
                        the leading manufacturers of Cairo and Alexandra possess large depots,
                        containing, at times, many thousands the cigarettes being now exported to
                        ever civlized part of the globe - from Noway to Capy Colony, from to the
                        West Coast of Africa, and to every country on the continent of America, as
                        well. Besides a huge local export trade, some of the leading firms supply as
                        well athe tobacco regies of France, Italy, and Austria. </p>

                    <p>Whereas it is expedient to make special pro- vision for the settlement of

                        next section, and also all lands which, owing to their height above the
                        river, the infrequency of rains, and other circum- stancee, have been
                        cultivated at irregular intervals only. 3. —(i.) Whenever it shall appear
                        expedient to the Governor General to effect a settlement of claims in or

                        he shall publish a notice in the "Sudan Qszatte," (а) specifying as nearly

                        any right is admitted the Settlement Officer shall record the local limits
                        within which such right may be ed the extent to which the benefit thereof
                        may be leased sold or bartered and such other particulars as may be
                        necessary to define the nature incidents and extent of the right. 7. —In
                        adjudicating upon claims to land the following roles shall be followed : —
                        (i.) The rules laid down for land commissions by the Title of Lands
                        Ordinances shall be followed by the Settlement Officer, so far as they are
                        not inconsistent with this Ordinance ; provided that a claimant shall not be
                        barred under section 10 of the Title ofLand Ordinary 1899 on account of his
                        not having presented a claim under that Ordinance, if he has during the five
                        years preceding the presentation of his claim to the Settlement Officer
                        exercised u of right any beneficial right in or over the land in question.
                        (ii.) AU waste forest and unoccupied land shall be deemed to be the property
                        of the Government until the contrary be proved. (iii.) In the oase of land
                        which under the custemary methods in use with regard to the same is
                        cultivable at irregular intervals, the fact that a person has cultivated the
                        same for whatever period shall not by itself give him the absolute ownership
                        of the land. (iv.)The exercise by any person of rights in or over one or
                        more portions or panels of tad shall not be taken as a presumption In his </p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>favor as against the Government of ownership of any rights in or over any
                        greater extent of land than that in or over which such rights were
                        exercised. 8. —All rights admitted by the Settlement Officer and recorded in
                        his order shall be presumed to be in gross and inheritable unless it is
                        otherwise stated in the order. 9. —No right in or over any land which might
                        have been made tho subject of a claim under this Ordinance other than a
                        right of way or to a watercourse or the use of water shall be enforceable
                        otherwise than in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance. 10 In an
                        enquiry under this Ordinance the Settlement Officer shall have the same
                        powers as to summoning witnesses, and compelling their attendance, and
                        administering oaths,and as to all matters of procedure as a Court under the
                        Civil Justice Ordinance, and the procedure directed to be observed by Civil
                        Courts shall be followed so far as applicable. EXPROPRIATION OF RIGHTS. 11.
                        —Whenever a scheme or a provisional scheme has been approved for the
                        artificial irrigation of any land which has been or may be declared to be
                        Government tad under this Ordinance or such land is needed for building or
                        for a public purpose the Governor General may compulsorily expropriate all
                        private rights, if any, existing in or over such land. 12. —Whenever the
                        Governor General has determined to make use if the powers conferred by the
                        last section in respect of any particular land, a notice signed by him,
                        containing a declaration to that effect, shall be published in the "Sudan
                        Gazette." Such notice may ba added to the notice published under section 3
                        or may be a separate notice. It shall bo conclusive evidence that the land
                        is needed for a purpose authorised by this Ordinance. 13. —The Settlement
                        Officer shall thereupon proceed to expropriate all rights existing in or
                        over such land in manner provided by the Land Acquisition Ordinance 1903 as
                        hereinafter varied. 14. —For the purpose of such expropria- >n (i.) The
                        Settlement Officer shall be deemed to be a Governor proceeding under the
                        Land Acquisition Ordinance 1903. (ii.) The claimant shall be deemed to be
                        person interested and appearing before him pursuance of a notice given under
                        section 7 of that Aot, and the provisions of the preceding sections shall be
                        deemed to have been complied with. (iii.) In the event of the Settlement
                        Officer failing to come to a friendly agreement with the persons interested
                        under section 9 the matter shall be settled by him as sole arbitrator and
                        for that purpose he shall have the powers of and be subject to the like
                        provisions as a Commission of Arbitration appointed under Section 12 of the
                        Land Acquisition Ordinance 1903. (iv.) The Settlement Officer may award
                        compensation in land or partly in land and partly in money. (v.) If the
                        compensation consists of tad and the Government shall not be ready to give
                        delivery of the some to the persons interested simultaneously with the
                        taking over by the Government of rights expropriated from them the
                        Settlement Officer shall award compensation by way of rent from the date
                        when the Government enters into possession of such rights to the date when
                        the Government delivers the tad or notifies its willing- ness to do so.
                        (vi.) In determining the amount of compensation for rights which have no
                        market value or of which the market value does not represent the full value
                        to the person interested the arbitrator shall take into con-sideration in
                        addition to the other matters mentioned in section 17 of the Land Acqui-
                        tion Ordinance the profit derivable by the persons interested from the
                        exercise of such rights. If the arbitrator shall award compen-sation in land
                        the land shall be of such area and so selected that it shall be as
                        profitable to the person interested as the right expropriated from him.
                        (vit) If upon the expropriation of rights over "karn" or "bugr" tads
                        artificially irrigated tad is awarded by way of compensation the tad so
                        awarded shall not he less in area than one tenth of the "karn" or "bngr"
                        tads over which such expropriated rights extend. Provided that upon the
                        recommendation of the Settlement Officer the Governor General may dispense
                        with this rule in particular t where such compensation would he in the
                        opinion of the Settlement Officer undoubtedly APPEALS. 15.—(t) An appeal
                        shall lie from any order made by a Settlement Officer under section 6 or 14
                        of this Ordinance to such civil judge or magistrate of the first class as
                        the Governor General may appoint to hear appeals from such orders. (it)
                        Bvery appeal under the last foregoing section must be presented within six
                        months of the order. It shall be made by petition fa writing and may be
                        delivered to the Settlement Officer who shall forward it without delay to
                        the Officer competent to hear the same. (iii.) Every such appeal shall be
                        heard in the manner prescribed for the hearing of appeals by the Court ot
                        the Mudir order the Civil Justice Ordinance and the same fees shall be
                        payable in respect thereof as on an appeal to the Court of the Mudir under
                        that Ordinance and the order passed on such appeal shall be final RESTRAINT
                        ON ALIENATION. 16.—Any rights over land declared to be Government land under
                        this Ordinance and any tad granted by way of compensation under this
                        Ordinance shall not ha A, mortgaged or charged except with the consent of

                        shall not however be required to a lease of such rights or tad for a period
                        n t exceeding three years or to their demise by will. RIGHTS up WAT AND
                        WATERCOURSE. '.—A Settlement Offioer may from time to time with the previous
                        oonsent of the Gover- of the Provinoe stop any public or private way nr
                        watercourse. Provided that for the way or watercourse so stopped another way
                        or watercourse which in the opinion of the Governor is equally convenient
                        already exists or has been provided or constructed by the Settlement
                        Officer. </p>

                    <head>ISLAND OF CYPRUS. <lb/>LIMASOL AND PAPHOS.</head>
                    <p>(FROM A CORRISPOMDINT.) <lb/>We now turn to the southern part of the island
                        of Cyprus which is that nearest of access to Egypt, and the part which was
                        is contact with civilisation from earliest times. The whole of the southern
                        coast, as would be expected, is relaxing, more so even than Beyront and the
                        plain of Sharon as far as 1 could judge, and the British military and
                        civilians stationed at Limasol and Larnaca are not, I think, to be envied.lt
                        is also a doubtful question as to what will be the effect upon these two
                        ports of call of the new railway and the opening of the harbour of
                        Famagusta. The Larnaca and Limasol ►eamship company is, I hear, making
                        preparations to look after their interests. But it is diffioult to see how
                        larnaca will survive, save as the telegraph station for the oapital, if its
                        trade is largely diverted. The plaoe however can boast of great antiquity,
                        as under the ancient name of Cftion it was probably one of the oldest
                        Phoeniota settlements in the Medi-terranean, and is thought to he the
                        Chittim of Numbers XXIV v. 24 and elsewhere. The roads from Nicosia to
                        larnaca and to Limasol are of no particular interest, as they simply cross
                        some bare foothills, the soil being of a chalky nature all over the low
                        range to the southeast of the island. Bat some prettier scenery is met with
                        about halfway between Nioosia and Limasol, where a oonple of midday rest
                        houses are to be found, dose to two successive mountain torrents. And the
                        road is lined the rest of the way with groves of carob trees until the very
                        sight of thrm hcomee monotony itself. There are plenty of vines higher on
                        the hills, but save for some groves of very ancient fig and oiive trees near
                        the sites of ancient towns and settlements, long since abandoned, the drive
                        of 54 miles is disappointing. Moreover in summer the roads in Cypres
                        everywhere full of white dost, save on the Troodos, so that a landau is the
                        only suitable oon- ia-oe. terestiog excursions. With the ancient Phoenician
                        Amattins on the seashore seven miles to the East and the Argive city of
                        Carium two miles to the west, there would be plenty for the antiquarian to

                        to crosadirg times the Englishman will like the hole, now converted into a
                        native fa which Riohard I. married Queen Berongaxia. This site is in Limasol
                        itself, while about seven miles off the road to Paphos, north of the salt
                        lake and promontory beyond, lies the remains of the tower of Colossi, where
                        the King and Queen spent their honeymoon. The castle tower lies in a
                        jsplendid situation with a magnificent view from the roof. The place is kept
                        by an Englishman, who, with his wife, is very hospitable to stangera. The
                        arms containing the British lions, the Jerusalem cross, and the flour de lys
                        are still visible on the eastern wall. Paphos is about 48 miles distent from
                        Limisol by a hilly road with many zigzags up and down the pees, as yon arose
                        ths numerous valleys with their mountain torrents that oome down from
                        Troodos. No Bible student and admirer of Paul and Barnabas would wish to
                        miss those secluded spots which have such a history to tell There is a
                        Palaoe-Paphos and a Neo Paphos, and they are distant ten miles the one from
                        the other. The former was the great centre of Aphrodite worship, and the
                        surf of the coast below still breaks into foam in fan- tastio shapes. The
                        ancient temple lies perched upon a cliff now about two-thirds of a mile from
                        the shore. And hither came that fastful throng year by year from many tads
                        to do node worship to the goddess. Doubtless this is what cansed Neo-Paphos
                        with its tiny harbom to become the site of apro-oonsnlate fa apostolio
                        times. But now, save for the commissioner's yacht and a few small fishing
                        craft with the remains of a mediicval castle as a breakwater to the bay,
                        nothing except masses of stores and here and there a Corinthian pillar
                        remains to mark the scene where Sergius Paulus was converted to the
                        Christian faith. They show the visitor two pillars place to a Byzantine
                        church where they say St Paul was i beaten. But it is possible from
                        tradition to - complete the story. For we are told that the statue of the
                        goddess was overthrown by the prayers of Barnabas. And there seems no ' room
                        for doubting that it was the work of this apostle that led to the overthrow
                        of this hideous form of worship. Now, perhaps, we see ' why he was so
                        anxious to return to bis native He felt he had a work of patriotism to do,
                        to rid his country of this truly international curse, and he succeeded.
                        Seriously enough, I spent the Eastern and Western day of St. Barnabes at
                        Famagusta, close to traditional site of his tomb, and the day I returned
                        from Saphos was a public holiday, I was informed, called Aphrodites day.</p>

                    <head>THE COMING COTTON SEASON</head>
                    <p>Forecasts of the new season an seldom more difficult than when the crops are
                        specially subject to the influence of the weather far some time to come.
                        Nevertheless it is possible to sketch the broad features and probabilities
                        of the new season on what is already known of the old. Moreover, fa one
                        respect at least, the new ' i less uncertain than any ofitsim- predetoaeon.
                        Spinners are already supplied with orders for months forward, and they are
                        covered by contents for cotton. A period of good business—longer or
                        shorter—is thus assured. Nor is any reason yet apparent which should prevent
                        the giving of farther orders sa the old contracts expire. Harvests generally
                        have been goofl fa most parts of the worrid, the chances of Improvement fa
                        basinets now that peace is declared good, and from none of the large foreign
                        markets need less than an average or fall demand be looked for. Thereis
                        likely to be more rather than less activity in the home trade, and
                        Lancashire is pnttiog up Dew mills to meet the demand from all quarters.
                        When all of them are fully at work the actual consumption may rise to 60,000
                        Amerioan bales a week instead of of 65,000 to 56,000 estimated for the past
                        twelve months. If these views may be partly modified by the knowledge that
                        large stocks of goods are now held fa some of the Eastern may nevertheless
                        prove broadly prioes this year—namely, a good business, the holding back of
                        ootton by planters, sod speculative activity. Only the development of tbe
                        season's business and the fortunes of the crop can decide thecorrect Unless
                        cotton be too dear and prices in Manchester consequently too high, a fall
                        business with the world is likely to be done, end in this sense — namely, fa
                        a reasonable security for a good season's demand the entry into the new
                        season shows lees uncertainty then naual. On the question of the price of
                        cotton, the position at the present moment is less easy to define. The crop
                        has to face the risk of heat (although the period of great heat is now be
                        nearly over) and frost Information about the orop has been so much affected
                        by the propaganda of speculators and by the Bureau irregularities that its
                        actual position is more obscure than usual. Broadly, it may be said that if
                        the Barcau be trusted the crop mast be small, and that if the general
                        reports received ■imaesol, however, is a centre of many in- ky merchants
                        .ffpm their correspondents be question, but on the whob the probabilities
                        wonld seem to point to a bwer range of prioes for 1905-6. It is also not
                        improbable that the oomfag season may show rather large fluctuations. The
                        new orop is coming down to the ports, where largo supplies exist, and it has
                        to he shipped to Europe, where stooks of some magnitude are in the hands of
                        merohants and spinners. These oiroumstanoea may possibly prodnoe a temporary
                        depression of a notable kind, but it most in that case be dearly remembered
                        that any decline going below the onltivator's costof growing ootton, should
                        thsrt occur, carries with it the certainty of redooed acreage and careless
                        cultivation of the following orop and of a consequent rebound. Appearances
                        point to Lancashire's oonsnmption being somewhat larger this season than
                        last, but the takings will not be so large. The shipments to Great Britain,
                        which have been ronndly 4,100,000 fa the past season, may not be so large
                        during that opon which we are now entering, but the Liverpool stock is
                        likely to be larger and may even reaoh considerable figures. U is also quite
                        possible that the new season may at some time show a long period of small
                        spot markets whenever the spinner falls hack on his reserve stooks of
                        ootton. With regard to the Indian orop it ia at present impossible to say
                        much. The prospeots are enoouragfag in those districts which grow the
                        principal varieties of ootton. Shortage of rainfall has been reported fa the
                        Punjaub and fa Rsjputaoa, but these districts, although they grow some
                        Bengal ootton, are principally known for their wheat production. Elsewhere
                        the reins have bean sufficient or plentiful, and fa Gujarat exoMsive. The

                        last Europe during the past season has bought far less Surat than daring the
                        preoeding season, but the Indian and Japanese mills have been busy. The
                        Indian holders of ootton have followed the Amerioan policy of refusing low
                        prioes and have oarried over an unusually heavy stock into the new season.
                        It remains to be seen bow far suoh a policy will answer their purpose. From
                        Egypt the reports are distinctly good. Thera is saffioitnt water for the
                        cultivator, although the volume of water fa the Nile has been only
                        moderately full. A large acreage has been planted, and prospeots are at
                        present flattering. The crop bos yet to fear autumn fogs, but if it escape
                        these, or unless they are unusually injurious, a lull or large crop is to be
                        looked for. It mould therefore appear that at the present moment the
                        prospeots of all the principal crops an of a nature to encourage hopes of
                        oootinned abundanoe. Even if the American orop should prove disappointing
                        the large surplus earned over from the late orop will avert any real danger
                        of shortage. Crops and surpluses together ought to supply every requirement
                        of the spindles of the world for 1905-6. Appearances, therefore, are in
                        favor of another year's healthy trade, and it can only be hoped that as the
                        season pisses it may prove as good and as profitable for Lancashire as the
