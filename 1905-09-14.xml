All seemed favorable to the early consummation of the islanders’ hopes, but the Powers always prone to make a fetish of the status quo, did nothing. The Cretans passed resolutions, and Prince George but his pride in his pocket and visited one European capital after another, but all to no purpose, and on his return found sections of the population inclined to back their protests by armed revolution. It being impossible for a Prince, appointed by the great Powers to govern the island, to countenance an attempt to force the band of Europe by rioting and blooodshed, whatever his personal sympathies, □ot a little of the annoyance which would otherwise have found vent in resolutions and speeches, was kept down by his ac-tion and like confined steam, grew under pressure. Eventually the explosion came and a minority led by some able if turbulent poli¬ticians is now encamped on the mountains and engaged in skirmishes with the British and Russian troops of the International Garrison and the Cretan Police, varied by cattle lifting and the composition of appeals in particular.
                                        It is only natural that the Powers should on principle, refuse to discuss the Cretan question till order has been restored. But it is surely unthinkable that the prestige of Europe would suffer were the international forces to be with¬drawn, and their place taken by Greek troops to whom the insurgents would offer no resis¬tance. The suppression of the rebellion by the international troops would lead to much bloodshed and bitterness, would penalize the whole Cretan people for the misdeeds of a few. and would solve nothing. The islanders would remain just as anxious for union with Greece, the Powers would in a few years have to face a repetition of this summer’s disorders, and Greece would be more and more inclined to throw in her lot with the Sultan in the hope of gaining concessions in Macedonia. Neither credit nor honor are to be gained against the Cretan insurgents, and if Greece is not a strong power that is hardly a reason to neglect her appeals to be allowed to take measures for the pacification of the is¬land which she alone could carry out Prin¬ciple might well give place to expediency in Crete, and a continuance of the present policy of the Powers must lead, even if the present revolt and a score of other revolts are crushed, to bloodshed and discontent. The recent history of the island is a curious commentary on the results of European in¬tervention, and it is to be hoped that Europe will at last realise that union with Greece is the only solution that will ensure a perma¬nent settlement of the Cretan question</p>

Last year the total experts amounted approximately to 500 mil¬lion cigarette# weighing over 650 tons, whilst the previous year’s total of the cigarettes exported from Alexandria, Port Said, and Suez was about 400 million* so that there was an increase of one year of no less 100 millions.

                                receive a drawback on exports of half the
                                amount, which they consider unjust as finder
                                the customs tariff now in force they have to
                                pay the same amount of duty on cigarettes,!
                                whether they are consumed in the county or
                                ont of it. They therefore contend that the
                                cigarett a manufactured expressly for exporta-
                                tion should be exempt of duty altogsther, and

                                ed for export in bond. So far the Customs
                                authorities have not entertained, or rather
                                given their consent to this arrangement, but
                                should they at any future time sanction 
                                wonld give a farther great stimulus to the cigarette industry of Egypt, and Cairo in par¬ticular.
                                We may remark, en passantt that the design¬ation of the cigarettes made in this oorfhtiy' ’as Egyptian is a misnomer, as the tobacco comes almost entirely from Turkey, as most people are aware, and the paper used in rolling the cigarettes is imported from Austria principally.
                                A small quantity of the tobacco Comes from the district of Xauthfy in tire-province of Thrace ; and the export is almost entirely from Cavalla, where the leading manufacturers of Cairo and Alexandria possess large depth containing, at times, many thousands the ciga¬rettes being now exported to every civilised part of the globe—from Norway to Cape Colony f bales, from Japan to the West Coast of Africa, and to ^Cvery country on the continent of America as well. Besides a huge local and export trade, some of the leading firms supply as well the tobacco regies of France, Italy, and Austria.

                    <p>Un Francis 6tabli an Cairo depuia de nom brouses anuses, M. L. Lambert, a pris l’initia- tive de feire demarches aar demarches poor fairo aboutir le projet de la creation d’une moaqude k Paris.
                        A on journaliate qui eat alld le voir M. Lam bert a fait, aveo beanooap d’amabilita, les ds olarationa suivantes:
                        — Je 8oia vena expr8 k Paris poor aoa mettre an gouvemement fran^aia oette inures aante question, dont lea consequences politi ques seront enormes.
                        J’ai eu une longue conference hier aveo on bant fonotionnairo do ministfcre des oultes, qui a fait le meilleur acoueil k mon projet et ma oonaeilie de m’adresser au miniatro dee affaires £trangsres pour quo oeiui-ci entamat des negooiations aveo la direction des domaines afin de trouver k Paris un terrain oonvenable dont la concession nous permettrait d’edifier la moaqude taut dsirde.
                        Il y a quelques jours je m’etais Igalemeut rendu au minUtro de l’interieur qui a tranamis depuia le dossier oontenant vingt un documents rolatifs k oette demande de concession.
                        Ces documents sont aignds par les quatre grands cheikba de 1’University d’El-Arhar, c’eat-k-dire par les personnages lea plus influ¬ents du monde musulman.
                        L’an d’eax, Abd-el-Rahman-el-Maleky (Maro- oain), qui eat trss influent non seulement en Egypte, maia en Alg6rie et aurtout au Maroc, son pays d’origine, oil je vais me renoontrer avec lui dans quelques joare et lui fairo part du rsultat qu’auront donnd mes demarches, et qui sera aocompagn^ par son neveu, le fils d’Abd-el-Kader, approndrait aveo une joie sincere que la France a aooaeilli favorablement notre requete.
                        Le oheikh Abd-el-Rahman-el-Maleky m’avait manifesto le dsir de venir k Paris pour m’aa aiater dans mes demarches, et oela aurait trsa oertainement 4t4 du meilleur effet, mais au dernier moment il n’a pu aooomplir ce voyage.
                        Mais j’eapdre que le gouvemement frangai ne voudra pas tarder plus longtemps k prondro une decision, puisque depuis de nombrouses I ann^es des mosqudes ont 6t6 4difi6es k Londrea et k Berlin par lea soins des gouvemements | anglais et allemand.
                        Le prestige de la France aurait tout k gagner I k pareille decision: l’abandon de l’Egypte k [’Angleterre a cr6y obez les musulmans un | cbeux ytat d’esprit k notre dgard.
                        Vo ilk quarante-trois ans que j’habite le Cairo,
                        I j’avais accompagnd M. de Lesseps; j’ai do aombreuses relations en Egypte, et tous les musulmans avec lesquels j’ai eu l’oooasion de n’entrotenir m’ont toujours dit: Comment so ait-il que la France, pays bospitalier et g4n6
                        ' reux, ne fasse rien pour nous 1
                        Eh bien I le moment est venu, les fonds n6 ceaaairoa k l’yreotion d’une mosqu6e k Paris et aussi k Marseille — oh se trouvent de nom breux musulmans — sont prdts. De divers cdtds j’ai re$u en effet des offres de oonoours gyndreux et j'ai pu fairo parvenir au miniature de l’intyriear les listes de soascription, dont le nombre s’augmente cheque jour.
                        Le sultan de Tutquie, le Khydive d’Egypte et plusieurs princes, princesses, paches et riches musulmans ne manqueront paa de participer k oette oeuvre, jen suis con vain on.
                        Les chefs roligieux de l’lslam n’ont paa mar ohandy, en plus d’une oiroonstanoe, les nom breuses concessions de terrains aooord4es aux oongrygations religieuaes, et la France en a obtenu une large part.
                        (Test bien le moins que le dysir legitime dea musulmans soit pris en considyration. Nous avons tout k gagner, oar l’Allemagne nous sup- plan te chaque jour davantage dans l’influence que nous avons tonjoars possydye auprks des disciples de Mahomet, qui oependant nous ai ment toujours.
                        Je vais fairo dresser les plans de la future mosquye, qui ne sera autre chose qu’un oara- vansyrail comprenant one yoole et une salle do
                        union.
                        — Oh s’yihvera oette mosquye t
                        — Probablement prks des Invalides ; mais d’ici pen j’espkre £tre flxy k oet ygard. Boyer persuady que, le jour oh Paris aara sa mosquye, les musulmans y viendront volontiers et en grand nombre: ils a’y sentiront mieux ohtz eux.

Where a claim to any right is admitted the Settlement Officer shall record the local limits within which such right may be ed the extent to which the benefit thereof may be leased sold or bartered and such other particulars as may be necessary to define the nature incidents and extent of the right.
                        7.	—In adjudicating upon claims to land the following roles shall be followed : —
                        (i.) The rules laid down for land commis¬sions by the Title of Lands Ordinances shall be followed by the Settlement Officer, so far as they are not inconsistent with this Ordinance ; provided that a claimant shall not be barred under section 10 of the Title ofLand Ordinary 1899 on account of his not having presented a claim under that Ordinance, if he has during the five years preceding the presentation of his claim to the Settlement Officer exercised u of right any beneficial right in or over the land in question.
                        (ii.) AU waste forest and unoccupied land shall be deemed to be the property of the Government until the contrary be proved.
                        (iii.) In the oase of land which under the custemary methods in use with regard to the same is cultivable at irregular intervals, the fact that a person has cultivated the same for whatever period shall not by itself give him the absolute ownership of the land.
                        (iv.) The exercise by any person of rights in or over one or more portions or panels of tad shall not be taken as a presumption In his and nothing is at present known whioh should make the yield smaller than the last Europe during the past season has bought far less Surat than daring the preoeding season, bnt the Indian and Japanese mills have been busy. Tbe Indian holders of ootton have followed the Amerioan policy of refusing low prioes and have oarried over an unusually heavy stock into the new season. It remains to be seen bow far suoh a policy will answer their purpose. From Egypt tbe reports are distinctly good. Thera is saffioitnt water for the cultivator, although the volume of water fa the Nile has been only moderately full. A large acreage has been planted, and prospeots are at present flattering. Tbe crop bos yet to fear autumn fogs, bnt if it escape these, or unless they are unusually injurious, a lull or large crop is to be looked for.
                        It mould therefore appear that at the present moment the prospeots of all the principal crops an of a nature to encourage hopes of oootinned abundanoe. Even if the American orop should prove disappointing tbe large surplus earned over from the late orop will avert any real danger of shortage. Crops and surpluses to¬gether ought to supply every requirement of the spindles of the world for 1905-6. Appear¬ances, therefore, are in favor of another year’s healthy trade, and it can only be hoped that as the season pisses it may prove as good and as profitable for Lancashire as the season 1904-5.

                        It shall bo conclusive evidence that the land is needed for a purpose authorised by this Ordinance.
                        13.	—The Settlement Officer shall thereupon proceed to expropriate all rights existing in or over such land in manner provided by the Land Acquisition Ordinance 1903 as hereinafter varied.

              <head>ISLAND OF CYPRUS.</head>
              <p>LIMASOL AND PAPHOS.</p>
              <p>(FROM A CORRISPOMDINT.)
                  We now tarn to the southern part of the island of Cyprus which is that nearest of access to Egypt, and the part which was is contact with civilisation from earliest times. The whole of the southern coast, as would be expected, is relaxing, more so even than Beyront and the plain of Sharon as far as 1 could judge, and the British military and civilians stationed at Limasol and Larnaca are not, I think, to be envied.lt is also a doubtful question as to what will be the effect upon these two ports of call of the new railway and the opening of the harbour of Famagusta. The Larnaca and Limasol ►eamship company is, I hear, making prepara¬tions to look after their interests. But it is diffioult to see how larnaca will survive, save as the telegraph station for the oapital, if its trade is largely diverted. The plaoe however can boast of great antiquity, as under tbe ancient name of Cftion it was probably one of the oldest Phoeniota settlements in the Medi-terranean, and is thought to he the Chittim of Numbers XXIV v. 24 and elsewhere.
                  The roads from Nicosia to larnaca and to Limasol are of no particular interest, as they simply cross some bare foothills, the soil being of a chalky nature all over the low range to the southeast of the island. Bat some prettier scenery is met with about halfway between Nioosia and Limasol, where a oonple of midday rest houses are to be found, dose to two successive mountain torrents. And the road is lined the rest of the way with groves of carob trees until the very sight of thrm hcomee monotony itself. There are plenty of vines higher  on the hills, but save for some groves of very ancient fig and oiive trees near the sites of ancient towns and settlements, long since abandoned, the drive of 54 miles is disappointing. Moreover in summer the roads in Cypres everywhere full of white dost, save on the Troodos, so that a landau is the only suitable oon- ia-oe.
                  terestiog excursions. With the ancient Phoe¬nician Amattins on the seashore seven miles to the East and the Argive city of Carium two miles to the west, there would be plenty for the antiquarian to discover had not Signor di Ceenola, the Amerioan Consul, dug only too suooessfolly in the latter, and the French removed from the former a oolossai stone vase and other trea¬sures now in the Louvre. But coming down to crosadirg times the Englishman will like the hole, now converted into a native fa which Riohard I. married Queen Berongaxia. This site is in Limasol itself, while about seven miles off the road to Paphos, north of the salt lake and pro¬montory beyond, lies the remains of the tower of Colossi, where the King and Queen spent their honeymoon. The castle tower lies in a jsplendid situation with a magnificent view from the roof. The place is kept by an Englishman, who, with his wife, is very hospi¬table to stangera. The arms containing the British lions, the Jerusalem cross, and the flour de lys are still visible on the eastern wall.
                  Paphos is about 48 miles distent from Limisol by a hilly road with many zigzags np and down the pees, as yon arose ths nu¬merous valleys with their mountain torrents that oome down from Troodos. No Bible student and admirer of Paul and Barnabas would wish to miss those secluded spots which have such a history to tell
                  There is a Palaoe-Paphos and a Neo Paphos, and they are distant ten miles the one from the other. The former was the great centre of Aphrodite worship, and the surf of the coast below still breaks into foam in fan- tastio shapes. The ancient temple lies perched upon a cliff now about two-thirds of a mile from the shore. And hither came that fastful throng year by year from many tads to do node worship to the goddess. Doubtless this is what cansed Neo-Paphos with its tiny harbom to become the site of apro-oonsnlate fa apostolio times. But now, save for the commissioner’s yacht and a few small fishing craft with the remains of a mediicval castle as a break¬water to the bay, nothing except masses of stores and here and there a Corinthian pillar remains to mark the scene where Sergius Paulus was converted to the Christian faith. They show the visitor two pillars place to a Byzantine church where they say St Paul was i beaten. But it is possible from tradition to - complete the story. For we are told that the statue of the goddess was overthrown by the prayers of Barnabas. And there seems no ' room for doubting that it was the work of this apostle that led to the overthrow of this hideous form of worship. Now, perhaps, we see ’ why he was so anxious to return to bis native He felt he had a work

                        <head>THE COMING COTTON SEASON</head>
                        <p>Forecasts of the new season an seldom more difficult than when the crops are specially sub¬ject to the influence of the weather far some time to come. Nevertheless it is possible to sketch the broad features and probabilities of the new season on what is already known of the old. Moreover, fa one respect at least, the new ' i less uncertain than any ofitsim- predetoaeon. Spinners are already supplied with orders for months forward, and they are covered by contents for cotton. A period of good business—longer or shorter—is thus assured. Nor is any reason yet apparent which should prevent the giving of farther orders sa the old contracts expire. Harvests generally have been goofl fa most parts of the worrid, the chances of Improvement fa basinets now that peace is declared good, and from none of the large foreign markets need less than an average or fall demand be looked for. Thereis likely to be more rather than less activity in the home trade, and Lancashire is pnttiog up Dew mills to meet the demand from all quarters. When all of them are fully at work the actual consumption may rise to 60,000 Amerioan bales a week instead of of 65,000 to 56,000 estimated for the past twelve months. If these views may be partly modified by the knowledge that large stocks of goods are now held fa some of the Eastern may nevertheless prove broadly prioes this year—namely, a good business, the holding back of ootton by planters, sod specu¬lative activity. Only the development of tbe season’s business and the fortunes of the crop can decide theoorreot Unless cotton be too dear and prices in Manchester consequently too high, a fall business with the world is likely to be done, end in this sense — namely, fa a reasonable security for a good season’s demand the entry into the new season shows lees uncertainty then naual.
                            On the question of the price of cotton, the position at the present moment is less easy to define. The crop has to face the risk of heat (although the period of great heat is now be nearly over) and frost Information about the orop has been so much affected by the pro¬paganda of speculators and by the Bureau irregularities that its actual position is more obscure than usual. Broadly, it may be said that if the Barcau be trusted the crop mast be small, and that if the general reports received ■imaesol, however, is a centre of many in- ky merchants .ffpm their correspondents be
                            question, bnt on tbe whob the probabilities wonld seem to point to a bwer range of prioes for 1905-6. It is also not improbable that the oomfag season may show rather large fluctuations. The new orop is ooming down to the ports, where largo supplies exist, and it has to he shipped to Europe, where stooks of some magnitude are in the hands of merohants and spinners. These oiroumstanoea may possibly prodnoe a tempo¬rary depression of a notable kind, but it most in that case be dearly remembered that any decline going below the onltivator’s oostof growing ootton, should thsrt occur, carries with it the certainty of redooed acreage and careless cultivation of the following orop and of a consequent rebound. Appearances point to Lancashire’s oonsnmption being somewhat larger this season than last, but the takings will not be so large. The shipments to Great Britain, whioh have been ronndly 4,100,000 fa the past season, may not be so large during that opon whioh we are now entering, but the Liverpool stock is likely to be larger and may even reaoh considerable figures. U is also quite possible that the new season may at some time show a long period of small spot markets whenever the spinner falls hack on his reserve stooks of ootton.
                            With regard to tbe Indian orop it ia at pres¬ent impossible to say much. The prospeots are enoouragfag in those districts whioh grow the principal varieties of ootton. Shortage of rain¬fall has been reported fa the Punjaub and fa Rsjputaoa, but these districts, although they grow some Bengal ootton, are principally known for their wheat production. Elsewhere the reins have bean sufficient or plentiful, and fa Gujarat exoMsive. The tat Indian crop was lugfa tfceaoreerfthe pemt owp h tamMd,
                        and nothing is at present known whioh should make the yield smaller than the last Europe during the past season has bought far less Surat than daring the preoeding season, bnt the Indian and Japanese mills have been busy. Tbe Indian holders of ootton have followed the Amerioan policy of refusing low prioes and have oarried over an unusually heavy stock into the new season. It remains to be seen bow far suoh a policy will answer their purpose. From Egypt tbe reports are distinctly good. Thera is saffioitnt water for the cultivator, although the volume of water fa the Nile has been only moderately full. A large acreage has been planted, and prospeots are at present flattering. Tbe crop bos yet to fear autumn fogs, bnt if it escape these, or unless they are unusually injurious, a lull or large crop is to be looked for.
                                It mould therefore appear that at the present moment the prospeots of all the principal crops an of a nature to encourage hopes of oootinned abundanoe.
