                            left home on Thursday for a walk, and since then all the efforts of the

                    <p>The further hearing of Mr. Ninci's petition fora judicial separation from his
                        wife, on the ground of her adultery with Judge Constantine Dimiaras, late
                        President of the Hellenic Consular Tribunal at Alexandria, was continued
                        yesterday afternoon at 4 o'clock before the Italian Consular Court, under
                        the presidency of Judge Palqui, assisted by Mr. Amabile Cumbo and Mr.
                        Arrera. Maltre Colucci, counsel for the petitioner, disputed the
                        authenticity of one of the letters read to the Court by Maltre Guidotti.
                        This letter was supposed to have been written by the wife's father,
                        complaining of her husband maltreatment. The Judge, on examining the
                        writing, pronounced it to be a forgery. Counsel for the wife then explained
                        I that the document in question not an original manuscript, but simply a
                        translation I from the Greek to Italian. He promised to bring the original
                        letter into Court.</p>
                    <p>Maltre Coluoci then began to controvert the arguments of the council for the
                        defence, and showed that the first line of defence was based on five points,
                        in order to prove I that the fault lay with the husband via, (R). </p>
                    <p>That Mr. Ninci neglected his wife when ill. (II). That he was a man of
                        depraved tastes. [III). That he had a very violent temper. (IV). That be
                        insulted his wife prior to the hear 1 ng of the case by inserting articles
                        in the Press. (R). </p>
                    <p>The Helouan incident Maltre Dolucei refuted each of these charges. He showed
                        that Mr. Ninoi wave loving and dutiful, and that many witnesses could be
                        brought into Court to prove that during his wife's illness his conduct had
                        been most sympathetic. The truth was that he idolized his wife, that the
                        responsible position which he now 1 bolds as the commercial manager here of
                        so important a company as that of the Rxffinerie d’Egypto, showed. That
                        laboured most seriously in order to enrich his wife. When he had attained
                        that i position, his wife had ruined his lile by her t flagrant infidelity.
                        As to the disgraceful allegations in regard to the perverted instincts of
                        his client, Maltre Coluoci said that such charges were always tramped up in
                        these matrimonial cases in order to blacken the husband’s character. She has
                        complained during the eight years of her married life, and she now, through
                        her counsel, declared that her husband began to display his deprived
                        character three days after the marriage ceremony. Maitre Coluoci then read
                        some very significant letters from the lady to her husband. He went on to
                        speak of her hypocritical and homeless conduct towards her husband, and that
                        if Mr. Ninci was guilty of violent behaviour, it was only natural
                        considering that , it had been tried so much, and as to the Helouan
                        incident, be had only smacked his wife. In regard to the second line of
                        defence, tamely, that the reconciliation of husband and his wife annulled
                        the claim of the husband to a official separation, Maitre Colucci declared
                        that the reconciliation was only of a tacit and thus did not invalidate the
                        subsequent claim for a separation. He then declared that the wife's conduct
                        was very like the rise of the heroine of Paul Bourget's "Cruelle Bnigme,”
                        for, although she loved her husband, yet she was unable to resist deceiving
                        him. Mr. Ninci loved his wife to distraction, and his passionate devotion to
                        her fully explained the alleged violence of his conduct and his weakness in
                        submitting to a momentary reconciliation at Helouan. Counsel then cited a
                        number of legal authorities, all showing that to divest a husband of his
                        right to a judicial separation, the reconciliation between him and his
                        erring wife should be tantamount to a complete resumption of marital
                        relations. But in the case in question this was not so but was merely a
                        trick of his wife’s lover, Judge Constantine Dimaras, who, knowing the
                        intricacies of the Italian aa well as of the Hollenio Code, had suggested to
                        his mistress that she should be temporarily reconciled with her husband, and
                        then provoke an incident, such as occurred at Helouan, in order that she
                        herself should be the first to ask for a judicial separation. The diabolical
                        ingenuity of the judge was successful. He pretended that he had a difference
                        with his mistress and left Egypt, but when the Helouan incident had taken
                        place he at once returned to Alexandria. I Mr. Ninci was not quite certain
                        of his wife's infidelity prior to the reconciliation; he merely I had very
                        strong suspicions, suggested by the discovery that his wife always wore a
                        scapular and a portrait of the judge concealed in her bosom, as well as by
                        the impassioned Greek poems ho had found in the house addressed to his wife
                        by the judge. Counsel then proved that Mr. Ninci was not certain of his
                        wife's misconduct at that time, because when Mr. Ninoi desired to have a
                        duel with the judge, the seconds came to an arrangement As the seconds were
                        very respectable gentlemen, it was impossible for them to oome to arrange
                        matters if there had been any certainty as to the adultery. Until the last
                        moment had continued her relations with the judge in a house in
                        Sesostris-street, and when the judge left for the Pinens last week, she had
                        a terrible attack of hysteria, which disturbed all the inhabitant# of the
                        opponent. This fully showed the "diabolical persistence” of her passion for
                        her lover. As to alimony, Maltre Coluoci declared that counsel for the
                        defence had erroneously stated that, even if the wife waa alone guilty, it
                        should be granted. LB. 15 was demanded, but any alimony was out of the
                        question, unless it could be shown that the wife was entirely innocent; in
                        the present, where the wife alone was to blame, obligatory | alimony will
                        quit. Maltre Coiaooi, his client was a man of feelings, and would not allow
                        his to starve. If however, the Court granted fixed sum, such as LE 16, the
                        wife would Mare Egypt, and go to live with the judge at h« husband’s
                        expense. He was prepared to give her an allowance of LE 6 monthly. In spite
                        of the protestations of Maltre Guidotti, Maltre Colucci declared that the
                        entire family of the wife, prior to her marriage, existed on LE 8 per month,
                        so that LE 6 for her alone was enough. This ended the speech of Maltre
                        Colnooi.and Maltre Guidotti then ruse to rejoin but was informed by the
                        judge that, as it was late, he should send his pleading to him and that
                        judgment would be given in a few days’ time.</p>
