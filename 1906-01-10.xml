                    <head>The Coming Conference</head>
                    <p>Nobody can complain that there is little news of interest now-a-days in the
                        newspapers The most gigantic war on record only closed a few months ago in
                        time to usher in the first scene in the Russian Revolution, which for its
                        thrilling horrors is unsurpassed in modern history. Now, just when the
                        revolu- tion seems to have been stamped out, the h world finds itself on the
                        point of watching the doings of a conference which is likely to excite
                        greater interest than any similar event since the meeting of the Powers at
                        Berlin nearly a generation ago, for the Morocco Conference is viewed with
                        considerable apprehension, as its outcome may be that great war which has
                        for so long hung as a nightmare over the world. A telegram from London which
                        we publish in to-day’s issue states that the English Press considers an
                        amicable solution possible judging by the contents of the recent White Book.
                        But this optimism is not shared through out Europe generally- In Paris, not
                        with standing the excellent impression created in many quarters by the
                        disclosure of the very pacific remarks to which the Gorman Emperor recent-
                        ly gave utterance, there is still a feeling that France must continue to
                        prepare for any and every eventuality. So absolutely nothing will be omitted
                        in the adoption of precaution, which are still deemed expedient, and to
                        which the French Ministers of War and Marine have been devoting their best
                        atten- <cb n="6"/> tion. Even the most peaceably-disposed state men in that
                        country have long lost no oppor- tunity of proclaiming the opinion that
                        France must be rendered as strong as possible. They argue that only on such
                        conditions can trans- quillity be guaranteed, as these measures are a
                        practical insurance against any temptation to embark on an aggressive
                        policy, to which other Powers, deeming that they might have France virtually
                        at their mercy, might yield For it most be remembered that the con- ference
                        is solely due to the influence of the the Kaiser, thereby reproducing almost
                        exactly the same situation as, in the Far East, enabled the the Kaiser to
                        cut a slice one of .China to appease for a time the insatiable German greed
                        of territory. That being the inevitable result of submitting the future
                        political status of Mo- rocco to the collective judgment of "Europe, it is
                        imperative that the Sultan and his Imperial wire-puller i should be made to
                        understand that England, whether with or without the support of the other
                        Mediterranean Powers, will not permit Germany to secure a possible base for
                        naval operations on either the African or the Asiatic shores. There must be
                        no coquetry with that vital issue; if the Kaiser finds pleasure in posing as
                        self-appointed arbitrator in all inter- national disputes, well and good; no
                        harm can come from that affectation of omnipotence, But any and every
                        attempt, however insidious, to repeat in North-West Africa the mischievous
                        German aggrandisement in Eastern China must be met with a British “non
                        possumus" couched in the plainest and bluntest terms. There are quite Enough
                        European Powers having real Mediterranean interests, without adding an o
                        her, and that the most aggressive of all On the other hand it is conectured
                        that the policy of the Kaiser is doe to his desire to undertake the
                        Bismarckian idle if “the honest broker.” Both Great Britain and France
                        derive large political benefit from coming to terms on the North African
                        littoral; why should not Germany get, if not an equal share, something in
                        the nature of a commission? The replay is, of course, that Germany never had
                        any political status in Morocco, while her com- mercial interests there are
                        little more than visionary. Hence it was that the Berlin Government,
                        although unofficially made so quiased with all the details the Anglo-French
                        parternership did not receive formal notification of the new arrangement.
                        There-was no more reason why Germany should have been taken into council
                        than for, say, the inclusion of some South American Republic doing a small
                        amount of trade with the ‘sick man" of North Africa But the practical
                        acquisition of Shantung by Germany, and all that followed therefrom, shows
                        pretty clearly that the Kaiser does not hesitate to base his annexationist
                        designs on wholly imaginary Teutonic interests when genuine ones are not
                        within reach. Compensa- ion for the territorial gains of Russia in China was
                        the reason assigned at Berlin for that particular annexation, and not until
                        this excuse was formulated was the discovery made by the Kaiser tint his
                        Empire had great interests to safeguard in Shantung. It would not be without
                        recent precedent, therefore, were he hopeful of being bought-off from
                        continuing his opposi- tion to the proposed settlement of the Morocoan
                        trouble by the three Western Powers which are so deeply interested in the
                        welfare of of the Sultan’s archaic dominions. But he will find it very
                        difficult, we predict, to convince the London, Pans, and Madrid Cabinets
                        that it is a case in which the “honest broker” has earned some reward. And
                        in that case, he will proba- bly appreciate the expediency of ceasing to
                        pose as the saviour of Morocco.</p>
                    <p>There is still another conjecture At Paris and elsewhere on the Continent it
                        is imagined that the Emperor, recognising the naval and ;be military
                        collapse of Russia, with, possibly he political and economic collapses to
                        follow, is anxious to take advantage of Prance’s compa- rative isolation,
                        for it mast be remembered a chat although Berlin and St. Petersburg still
                        dead two great Alliances in their essence mutually hostile, there is much
                        more genuine friendship between their respective heads than exists at
                        present between them and their respec tive allies. Yet it is always much
                        easier, in the case of a Great Power, to commit a blunder of that kind to
                        escape from it without serious sacrifice of dignity, prestige, and
                        authority. The climber who continues to ascend by sheer strength wins
                        applause but when his muscles become tire and he slowly slips down, there is
                        more merriment than sympathy. But be the upshot of this entirely
                        unanticipated complication what it may, it is safe prophecy that the tangle
                        stronger than ever, and that the Western Powers will absolutely refuse to
                        pay commission to Berlin for services never rendered and for German
                        interests, such as they are, which remain totally unaffected.</p>

                    <head>CAIRO’S DISTRACTIONS.</head>
                    <p>Opera-square in Cairo presented a very gay appearance after dark on Monday
                        evening. The decorations, which had looked tawdry and garish by day, showed
                        only as a soft- coloured glow by night, and the tin lanterns hung round the
                        railings of the Esbekieh Gardens became a glorified chain of fireflies. The
                        facade of the Continental was a blaze of light and many flags floated over
                        the porch and verandah. The streets were filled with an admiring crowd of
                        onlookers, and the band beneath the statue of Ibrahim Pacha attracted each a
                        spell-bound audience that it was almost impossible to force a way
                        through.</p>
                    <p>Many of the European visitors were watch- ing the native fantasias but many
                        others pre- ferred to spend their evening dancing at Shepheard’s. Prince
                        Charles William of Sweden was in the large hall with Colonel Watson and
                        others of his friends and entourage, but he did not join the dancers. He
                        must have had a fairly busy day, for he had paid his formal visit to the
                        Khedive that morning, had re- ceived the return visit from the Khedive a few
                        hours afterwards, and had witnessed the review at Abbasieh in the afternoon.
                        Mrs. Phillips, Dr. Phillips, and his pretty sister were at Shepheard’s, and
                        so were Miss Lampson, Captain Tucker, Major Lawson and Mr. Merritt, aud Dr.
                        Brabant. A cheery party of Savoyards were passing a pleasant time; among
                        them were noticed Captain and Mrs. Morgan, Mrs. Valentine Smyth and her
                        niece, Miss Ambridge, Mrs. and Miss Smart, Mrs. Grafton and Dr. Armstrong
                        Very many of the visitors in the hotel were present, and the dancing room
                        was comfortably foil but not too crowded.</p>
                    <p>There are dances at the various hotels nearly every night in the week at
                        present, and the folk most be hard to please indeed who do not find enough
                        distraction in Cairo. </p>

                        1906. The other boat is to be employed on the She lal-Halfa service, on
                        which the Indiana now runs. She will also be completed by December next and
                        will have berth space for some 40 passengers, against the 18 berths which
                        are all that the Indiana boasts. A sum of £2,000 will be spent on the
                        construction of these boats. It will be remembered that the Ham-
                        burg-Amerika Company, on amalgamation, bought 5,000 £4 shares of the Anglo-.
                        American Nile Company at £5 per share, thus paying £25,000 in all. Of this
                        sum £20,000 goes to shipbuilding. The remaining £5,000 is to form part of
                        the new Hamburg- Anglo American Company’s reserve food. The advent of this
                        company to Egypt is of the greatest importance, for it mast be borne in mind
                        that not only will the Hamburg-Amerika Company be represented on the Nile
                        oaring to the recant fusion, hot that in a few months’ time it will start a
                        new and very fast service from Naples to Egypt. This company, in point of
                        carrying capacity, owns the largest fleet in the world, with the exception
                        of the International Mercantile Marine Co. (Morgan Combine). The packet
                        company began its Transatlantic service in 1847, with the Deutsch- land, 717
                        tons, and by 18(?)3 possessed 5 more sailing vessels like her, all having a
                        combined capacity of 4,000 tons of cargo, and each ac- commodating 200
                        passengers. The entire fl-et could then carry annually to New York only
                        12,000 tons of freight from. Europe. The ss. Borussia, 2,349 tons, appearing
                        in 1853, was followed by other steamers, monthly departures being kept up
                        until 1860, when the ships were sold, and enough steamers purchased to make
                        fortnightly departures to New York, the sail- ings being increased to weekly
                        ones in 1872. In 1888 the company decided upon twin-screws and the Columbia,
                        Augusta Victoria, Normania, and Furst Bismarck successively joined the
                        ever-welling fleet.</p>
                    <p>The very able administration of this pro gressive and prospering concern
                        boldly cul- minated in the Deutschland, 16,502 tons, built in Germany, whose
                        engines of 37,800 h.p. have surpassed all previous records. There are record
                        times of 5 days 7 hours 38 minutes, the entire distance of 2,982 miles being
                        traverseds an average speed of 23 36 knots per hoar, 545 knots being the
                        longest day’s run. This record for fastest time has not so far been improved
                        upon, but the Deutschland has attained an average speed of 23 51 knots
                        east-bound and of 23-15 knots west-bound, and covered 607 knots in one day.
                        The routes of the weekly twin-screw - express steamers carrying the American
                        and European mails are; Hamburg Dover, Cherbourg to New York, returning via
                        Plymouth and Cherbourg. Other services leave Hamburg every Thursday for New
                        York vie Dover and Boulogne-sur-Mer in addition to which there are regular
                        services from.Hamburg to Montreal, Halifax, Portland, Boston, Phila delphia,

                    <p>In Europe there are services from Hamburg to various other places. This
                        company also manages the passenger business of the Union Line to New York,
                        the Hamburg South Amer ican Company to Brazil and the Argentine Republic,
                        and the German East African Lim via Naples and Suez Canal. Winder and summe

                        the world, and the new steamer Meteor. In March last there were 16 steamers
                        building(110,050 tons) counted in the total tonnage given, but 39,150 tons
                        of river steamers, lighters, etc., are not included. 31.618 passengers were

                        organisation, is bound to prove as successful on the Nile as it has been in

                    <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                    <p>Sir,—Truly there seems no limit to human perversity. Who ever could have
                        imagined that an official like the Financial Adviser could have been so
                        naughty as to wantonly create alarm by questioning “the little game” of the
                        benevolent gentlemen who are buying up all the land they can lay their hands
                        on, in order to secure it for the poor fellah, in addition to providing the
                        Government ole ks and the public profitable investments having a great
                        future? Food is so cheap and rents are so low that such conduct is particu-
                        larly hard on the Government clerk.</p>
                    <p>How fortunate it is that so clever and modest a man as “Admirer,” who,
                        evidently, knows all about this matter, should have come boldly forward to
                        unmask this “bogey”; there is nothing like inflation about him or his
                        remarks. What a contrast! Besides, “Admirer” explains everything so clearly
                        and convincingly. Why, of course, it is self evident, now that “Admirer” has
                        explained it, that it is the natural consequence of the law of supply and
                        demand that because land in Cairo and Alexandria is twice as cheap as
                        similar land in Smyrna and Athens rents in the former cities should be twice
                        as dear as in the latter ones. Everyone must now see that speculation, land
                        and house grabbing, and company mongering have nothing to do with this
                        result and that it most be indeed very grandmotherly to think they had. It
                        was not frank either on the part of the Financial Adviser to pretend that
                        his ideas on these matters were original. Why, Sir, the "Sunday Times”
                        sounded what it had the audacity to call a “note of warning” some months
                        since and made some very catting remarks about Cronier, the Sucreries, and
                        the Banque In- dustrielle.</p>
                    <p>It is all clear now. Evidently, the local and the foreign banks which will
                        not make any farther advances on local securities and even demurred to renew
                        existing advances were only trying to break down the market in order to buy
                        one. Allons ! En avant ! Cons- puons le Conseiller Financier.</p>
                    <p>—Yours truly Innocent. </p>

                    <head>DEATH OF LORD RITCHIE. FATAL PARALYTIC STROKE. BIOGRAPHICAL NOTICE.</head>
                    <p>London, January 9.</p>
                    <p>Lord Ritchie has had a paralytic stroke at Biarritz. (Reuter)</p>
                    <p>London, January 9.</p>
                    <p>Lord Ritchie, who had a paralytic stroke at Biarritz, is dead. (Reuter)</p>
                    <p>The death of Lord Ri'chie has followed very suddenly after" his elevation to
                        the peerage. Born near dundee in 1838, the Right Hon. Charles Thomson
                        Ritchie was educated at the City of London School, and entered business as a
                        sugar refiner. He wag thirty-six years of age before he gained admis- sion
                        to the House of Commons. At the general election of 1874 he stood for the
                        Tower Hamlets, and won the seat from the Liberals. The moment was opportune.
                        During the discussions on the vexed question of sugar bounties Mr. Ritchie
                        made his mark as a businesslike speaker. On the resignation of Mr. Gladstone
                        in 1885 Mr. Ritchie was chosen Financial Secretary of the Admiralty, and in
                        the second Salisbury Administration was pro- moted to the Presidency of the
                        Lcoal Govern- ment Board. At first he was without a seat in the Cabinet, but
                        ere long won a place within the inner circle. He introduced the great Local
                        Government Bill of 18b8 fir the establish- ment of County Councils, and
                        added to his reputation by the skill with which he piloted the measure
                        through the House. After serving as an East-end member for over twenty
                        years, Mr. Ritchie was defeated by a few votes at St. George’s-in-the-East;
                        bat he was speedily selected to represent Croydon, and appointed President
                        of the Board of Trade. Subse- quently he was promoted by Mr. Balfour to the
                        Home Office, and, on the resignation of Sir Michael Hicks Beach, became
                        Chancellor of the Exchequer. He left the Cabinet after the momentous debate
                        upon the Finance Bill on June 9, 1903. Mr. Chaplin moved an amendment
                        against the repeal of the corn-tax, and Sir Michael Hicks Beach explained
                        the circumstances under which, as Chancellor of the Exchequer, he had
                        imposed the tax. Coming to the speeches of Mr. Balfour and Mr. Cham- berlain
                        on the subject of retaliatory tariffs and Colonial preference, Sir Michael
                        inquired whether they represented the views of the Cabinet or not. He could
                        not believe that this was the policy of a united Government, and he appealed
                        to those A misters who disagreed with the Colonial Secretary to speak oat It
                        was a dramatic moment Mr. Ritchie accepted the challenge, and, reading
                        evidently from a written document delivered himself of this significant
                        utterance ;</p>
                    <p>So far aa members of the Government who have spoken on this matter are
                        concerned, all that has been said has been that tho question of tho
                        preferen- tial treatment of tho Colonies should be discussed and inquired
                        into. For my own part, I feel bound to say that I should be surprised if
                        inquiry should show any practical means of carrying out that policy. I avow
                        myself a convinced Free Trader. I do not "hare tho views of those who think
                        that any practical means can be devised for overcoming the difficulties
                        which present themselves to me . in connection with their proposals ; and,
                        as at present advised, I cannot lx> a party to a policy which, in my
                        opinion, would be detrimental both to tho country and to tho Colonies. After
                        saoh an explicit declaration Mr. Rit- chie’s resignation was only a question
                        of time. He received his peerage among the recent Resignation honours and
                        elected to be entitled territorially after his birthplace, Dundee</p>

                    <p>The warrant officers, staff sergeants, and sergeants of the King’s Royal
                        Rifle Corps are giving a quadrille party at the Sergeants’ Mess at Abbassieh
                        on Friday, 12th inst., to mark the occasion of the anniversary of the wreck
                        of the Warren Hastings. It was in the middle of December 1896, if memory
                        serves aright, that that ill-fated vessel of the Indian Marine left Cape
                        Town carrying the King’s Royal Rifles, a battalion of the 84th York and
                        Lancaster Regiment, and certain of the Royal Artillery en route for India.
                        She was wrecked off the island of Reunion within a month of starting, and
                        there she lies in deep water to this day with no hope of salving. Cu-
                        riously enough there was no loss of life, though most of the people were
                        landed on Reunion with a sadly deficient wardrobe, as many of them were in
                        their bunks when the vessel ran ashore and there was no time to make
                        preparations. There were some stirring tales of bravery told at the time,
                        bat the details must be still fresh and green in the memory of those who
                        were present on the occasion. </p>

                    <p>London, January 9.</p>
                    <p>Commencing on the White Book, the Press considers that it indicates that an
                        amicable solution is probable, though doubts are express- ed as to German
                        designs on the Atlantic coast. Referring to Morocco, Sir Charles Dilke, in
                        the “Westminster Gazette,” has emphatically declared that there is no danger
                        of war. (R.)</p>
                    <p>Rome, January 9.</p>
                    <p>The Press is perplexed at the approach of the Morocco Conference. If Italy
                        support Germany she will be confronted by France and Great Britain united.
                        If she support France, she will be opposed by Germany and Austria.
                        Notwithstandtng this, confidence is felt on account of the appointment of
                        Marquis Vis- conti-Venosta as Italian delegate, as he will use his influence
                        to prevent a rupture. (Reuter;</p>

                        editorship of Dr. Professor E. Brec- cia, and affords an excellent sample of
                        the good work cam’ed on by the society, also of the energy and erudition of
                        Dr. Ereccia. The journal is illustrated by an exceedingly well- executed
                        coloured plate depicting a portion of the, once partly extant, temple of
                        Thoth at Hermopolis, as drawn nearly a century ago by Minutuoli, and 37
                        phototype pictures inserted in the text. After records of the society’s
                        proceedings a series of six learned essays are presented upon antiquarian
                        subjects and then follow a series of short reviews upon various important
                        publications. Among the essays there is a chronicle of the results of
                        excavations which have been carried out in the neighbour- hood of
                        Alexandria, divided into objects acquired within the city boundaries ; in
                        the eastern and western necropoli, the latter including Kom el Shougafa ;
                        also Rt Ram'eh, Aboukir, and Dekela.</p>

                        upon two cushions, the other holds a patera. A bird, apparently a hawk, with
                        extended wings, ap- proaches the held-out arm.</p>

                        photo- gravure which will take up a valued place in the always augmenting
                        iconography of that oft- delineated conqueror. It is to be hoped that a more
                        perfect head of the monarch now in M. Dattari’s cabinet,will soon be
                        published also. A fine terra cotta is shown in plate 31, but upon too small
                        a scale to be properly ap- preciated. It is the broke-off ansa of a vase and
                        représenta the Nile God in relief. The piece is of triangular shape, and
                        from the broader base springs an ornament of lotus leaves and buds ; whillst
                        in the centre, seated upon a calice of the flower, is the Nilus image,
                        holding a cornucopia and a papyrus stem. This fragment should be published
                        upon a large scale in the new edition of the Museum catalogue.</p>

                        Magna, found- ed upon personal visits to Ashmu, as well as upon all the data
                        he has carefully collected from the classics and modern archeologists. After
                        an introduction explaining the origin of the Kam at present occupying part
                        of the city’s site, now Ehuasje and some account. of papyri that have been
                        discovered there, Dr. Breccia proceeds with his record of the city. Its
                        primitiveEgyptian name was Chmounou, hence CopticSchmoun and Ashmounein. The
                        town was devoted to the worship of Thoth, the Ibis-head- ed deity the Greeks
                        identified with Hermes. It had been the capital of the l5th nome of ancient
                        Egypt and its founder was Thoth him self. Here personified as the Ibis a
                        symbol : among the very earliest, found upon the totemistic guidons of the
                        primitive tribes who conquered Egypt ; led by the most mighty of them all.
                        that of the Falcon, or Hawk. The antiquity of the city is evidenced by the
                        oldest Egyptian traditions as it is mentioned in the "Book of the Dead” and
                        was said to be the site at which the moon had first appeared when it was
                        created from the primeval chaos or mint. It continued to be one of Egypt’s
                        chief cities until the XXIII. dynasty. Under the Ptolemies it 8gain became
                        important, and its municipal privileges are being set forth by many Greek
                        and Latin papyri. I‘s position, h wever, declin- ed form the time when
                        Hadrian, near bye. founded the rival city of Antinoe The appendix provides a
                        list of some 200 papyri referring to Hermopolis Magna.</p>
                    <p>Another interesting essay is that of Mr. C.C. Edgar upon a terra-cotta
                        representation of the Archimedean screw, which, as is well known, was a
                        mechanical contrivance for raising water, and so useful for irrigation in
                        Egypt. The terra cotta, of which a photograph is given, is in the Cairo
                        Museum. It depicts a screw placed within a ribbed cylinder going. around
                        which, in a central band is a row of hollows for foothold. 'i'he workman
                        revolves the cylinder by treading in the foothold recesses as with a modem
                        treadmill, whilst apparently supporting himself with a horizontal bar. Mr.
                        Edgar mentions a British Museum figure of a similar kind.a fragmentary one
                        from Naucratis, and a model of the Archimedean screw in the Hilton Price
                        collection. A sum- mary is given of M.M. Lefebvre and Barry’s excavations at
                        Tehneh, where many Coptic papyri and ostriaca have been found, also numerous
                        Greek inscriptions. Many of these refer to the height of the Nile
                        inundations under Carinus, Numerian, Dioclatian, and Maximian, and allude to
                        the best scent gifts derived from the river. These texts quite decide the
                        identity of Tehneh and Achoris. À number of inscriptions and ex-votos come
                        from a temple and prove it was dedicated to Amon, Souchos, Hermes, Hera, and
                        the Dios- curi.</p>
                    <p>An article by the late Mr. Dotieh describes various monuments in the
                        Alexandria Mu- seum. A prey granite head is assigned to Alexander IV., son
                        of Alexander the Great. Another colossal head in red granite is shown to be
                        that of Ptolemy IV. Philopator. A list is given of 191 gold coins of the-
                        Byzantine Em- perors found in a little vase at Alexandria and of others pent
                        to the Alexandria Museum from the Museum at Cairo. The same writer pu-
                        blishes two columns from the ancient church of Saint Thomas, with
                        photographs of a small naos upon each with Christian symbols carved within
                        them.</p>
                    <p>The reviews contain a summary of Signor Girolamo Vitelli’s “Papiri
                        Fiorentini” in which he commences publishing the vast Florentine collection

                        Prominent physicians Endorse Pe-ru-na </head>
                    <p>DR. LLEWELLYN JORDAN, Medi- cal Examiner of the U. S. Treasury Department,
                        graduate of Columbia Col- lege, and who served three years at West Point,
                        has the following to say of Peruna: </p>
                    <p>“Allow me to express my grati- tude to you for the benefit derived from your
                        wonderful remedy. One short month has brought forth a vast change and 1 now
                        consider my- self a well man after months of suffering.</p>
                    <p>“Fellow sufferers, Peruna will cure you. "--Llewellyn Jordan. Doctors have
                        been loathe to endorse catarrh remedy because catarrh and catarrhal diseases
                        have, puzzled the medical fraternity for many decades. The popular
                        endorsements that Peruna has received at the hands of the people have
                        induced a great many doc- tors to try the remedy.</p>
                    <p>More prominent physicians use and endorse Peruna each year.</p>
                    <p>Dr. A. Morgan, 214 Gater street, In dianapolis, Ind., writes:</p>
                    <p>“Regular physicians do not, as a rule, endorse patent medicines. I have,
                        however, found In my practice that Peruna is a notable exception an not at
                        all like any other medicine gen- erally sold as ‘patent medicine.'</p>

                        posed of-herbal remedies of high medi- cinal value. </p>
                    <p>“It is a specific for catarrh of the head, lung, or stomach a fine remedy
                        for female trouble., and invaluable to mother, and children. </p>

                        know of to restore the system to normal condition and I recommend It to
                        convalescents. </p>
                    <p>“It is a high class family remedy, good for young and old.”--A. Morgan. </p>
                    <p>Peruna occupies a unique position in medical science. It is the only
                        internal systemic catarrh remedy known to the medical profession to-day. </p>
                    <p>Robert Roberts,M.D., Washing- ton, D. C., writes. </p>
                    <p>“Through my own experience as well as that of many of my friends and
                        acquaintances who have been cured or relieved of catarrh by the use of
                        Hartman’s Peruna, I can confidently recommend It to those suffering from
                        such disorders, and have no hesitation in prescribing it to my patients.”

                        <cols n="6"/> Catarrh is a systemic disease curable only by systemic
                        treatment. A remedy that cures catarrh directly at the depressed nerve
                        centers. This is what Peruna does.</p>
                    <p>Peruna immediately Invigorates the nerve centers which give vitality to the
                        mucous membranes. Then catarrh dis- appears. Then catrrah is permanently
                        cured.</p>
                    <p>Pe-Ru-Na Contains no Narcotics One reason why Peruna has found per- manent
                        use in so many homes is that it contains no narcotic of any kind Pe- runa is
                        perfectly harmless. It can be used any length of time without acquir- ing a
                        drug habit. Peruna does not pro- duce temporary results. It is permanent in
                        its effect.</p>
                    <p>it has no bad effect upon the system. and gradually eliminates catarrh by
                        re- moving the cause of catarrh. There are a multitude of homes where Peruna
                        has been used off and on for twenty years. Such a thing could not be
                        possible if Peruna contained any drugs of a nar- cotic nature.</p>

                    <head>*NEW EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>Not long ago, in reviewing a serious book on Egypt, we said that the people
                        of this country have at least the privilege of "seeing themselves as others
                        see them.” The book we now have before us again renews that privilege. Its
                        author tells us that he does not write for his Egyptian friends but rather
                        for the casual visitor. We take this as it is meant, and if anything wi
                        might say further on conveys the idea that the book is somewhat shallow, we
                        do not wish it to be considered a reproach. The opening chapter on
                        Alexandria is a bright contrast to the few scornful lines with which many
                        writers on Egypt dismiss farther allusion to our town. It is strange that so
                        little of the milk of human kindness appears to enter into the composition
                        of the men who write on Egyp- tology; they seem unable to appreciate
                        anything which belongs to modern times, but write as though they were on
                        excellent, terms with the people of remote dynasties. If the ancient
                        Egyptian could only have seen in prophetic vision how in the dim future
                        vandals were to come to this country, to pry into the secrets. of his tomb
                        and to scatter over the face of the earth all that the great object of his
                        life had been to conceal, it is difficult to picture the loathing with which
                        he would have regarded his would-be friends. But to return to the more
                        pleasing task before us. Oar author is evidently a man of some taste. He
                        says several very pretty things about Alexandrian ladies, or at least about
                        such of them as are to be seen driving in Cherif Pacha-street or on the
                        Ramleh road. The key note to the whole, book' is that he deals only with the
                        “creme de la creme.” He gives us beautiful portraits of many people, but few
                        of them much below the rank of a Cabinet Mi- nister ; most of these
                        portraits look about ten to fifteen years younger than many of the originals
                        we are need to see walking about in the streets. We hasten to say that this
                        remark doss not apply to the excellent full-page por- traits of Lord and
                        Lady Cromer. With the exception of a couple of portraits of hotel- keepers,
                        which are made on a very small scale, the author only leaves the class
                        above-men- tioned to give as a good many portraits of dancing girls. There
                        are also several illustra- tions of local scenes, all in the best style of
                        photogravure- We have called attention to the illustrations, not only
                        because they merit it but also because they give a good idea of the whole
                        book. All the information comes from above and is derived principally from
                        inter- views with the Khedive, Ministers, and Con- suls-General. Of course
                        an author who has access to such excellent sources of knowledge cannot be
                        expected to care much for the “man in the street,” and consequently we do

                        a pleasant style, and conveys some useful and interesting information.</p>
                    <p>Although (he author writes in good English ! we do not think he is an
                        Englishman. There are several passages in the book which do not comply wi'h
                        the unwritten English laws of good taste ; it looks as though the author’s
                        association with princes and princesses in Cairo have made it difficult for
                        him to appreciate some of his fellow-passengers up the Nile. He is more
                        particularly severe on the ladies. We will refer to one passage, the
                        incident described on pages 237 and 238. If such an incident were worth
                        recording, surely the author would have been better inspired if, instead of
                        the reflections he makes on it, he had simply said “honi soit qui mal y
                        pense.” If a book such as the one before us is to be wide’y read, it should
                        appeal to women as well as to men, but the pas- sages to which we allude
                        will certainly in- terfere with appreciation by the former. We think, too,
                        that the author expresses opinions much too freely on important sub- jects,
                        with which he is evidently bat very little acquainted, For instance, with
                        reference to the Assouan dam, he states on behalf of a celebrated
                        archaeologist, — whose name he is careful not to give, —not only the opinion
                        that the dam will not last long, but also, that it has already shifted about
                        fight feet. This is a statement of a fact that mast be apparent to every one
                        who visits the dam. Either it is a true or false assertion. If it were true,
                        or if it were inches instead of feet, it would only be too apparent to the
                        hundreds of people who must have seen it since the author’s friend, and is
                        it at all likely that if this were so, they could have refrained from
                        announcing to the world so important a fact? The author is apparently afraid
                        that some reader might take him seriously, so in the following page he gives
                        as the pub- blished reassuring opinions of Sir W. Garstin and Sir B. Baker,
                        authorities who will, we think, on this subject, pat his archaeological
                        friend in the shade. This]is a matter involv- ing such vast responsibilities
                        and conse- quences, that we do not think it is good taste to make it the
                        subject of a joke in any book, however frivolous.</p>
                    <p>The author gives us what he is pleased to call “The unpublished history of
                        the Abys sinian War,” alluding to the ill-fated expedi- tion sent there by
                        Ismail Pacha in 1875. It is, we suppose, still, too early to write the real
                        h’story of this war, but we are pre- pared to say that when it is written,
                        it will be something very different from the description above referred to.
                        There a-e several men still living in Alexandria who formed part of that
                        expedition, and who can give a much more authentic account of it. In most of
                        the more serious matters referring to Egypt the author is not very fortunate
                        in his allusions, but this does not apply t j his remarks on the Sudan,</p>
                    <cb n="4"/>

                    <p>which are characterised by a very much more serious tone, and an apparently
                        much more route observation, with referenoe to all matters south of Wady
                        Halfa. We say with pleasure that this part of the book gives us in concise
                        form the most accurate and up,to-date picture of the Sudan as it is that we
                        have yet seen. The author seems to have an exceedingly clear insight of the
                        modern Sudan question, its inception, its development, and its future
                        prospects, and in his final chapter on Fashoda he gives a clear and
                        comprehensive view of an exceedingly difficult and complicated situation. If
                        the visitor to the Sudan studies carefully the latter part of this book, he
                        will go there equipped with a very useful amount of in- formation.</p>
                    <p>The printing and illustration of the Book leave nothing to be desired; the
                        latter has attained a considerable degree of artistic success, and we never
                        remember seeing a book in which the portraits are more life-like; the index
                        is very complete and convenient for re- ference.</p>

                        les valeurs Aegyptiennes, nous a signale. pour hier, la National Bank et

                    <p>Notre marche des valeurs a été, ce matin, calme sur les Banques. La National
                        et l’Agri- cole ont cloture a leurs prix de samedi passe. La Banque

                    <p>L’improvements Corporation vient de ven- dre A Choubrah, un lot de 32
                        feddans de terrains A batir, dans lequel cette Societe avait une
                        participation d’un cinquième. Les benefices resultant de cette operation
                        pour la Societe se sont enlevés A- 28,000 livres, c’est-A-dire que le profit
                        de cette seule transaction représente une somme de 51/2 pour cent sur le
                        capital verse.</p>
                    <p>La société commence dono brillamment son deuxiAme exercice.</p>
                    <p>Nous avons enregistre dans notre dernière Circulaire la nouvelle suivant
                        Iaquelle l’E- gyptian Investment and Agency distribuerait proehainementun
                        dividende de 10 % par action sur le capital verse, ce qui, pour l’action
                        completement liberee, constituerait simplement du 2 et 1/2 pour cent.</p>
                    <p>Ajoutons, pour completer cette information, que 2,000 livres seraient
                        portees en meme temps A la reserve.</p>
                    <p>De l’etat comparatif annuel public par la Brasserie des Pyramides sur les
                        ventea de biAre et de glace effectuées par la société, il ressort que le
                        surplus de 1905 sur l’annee précédente s’eleve A la somme appreciable de
                        £5,955. Nous avions dit l’autre jouir que la societe estait en train
                        d’etablir son bilan et qu’on s'at. tendait A la distribution d’un dividende
                        de 4%. Suivant des informations plus precises, il s’agit,en réalité, d’un
                        dividende de 5%. on pou- vait, parait-il, donner davantage, mais, par esprit
                        de prudence, le conseil d’administration a prefere s’en tenir A cette
                        repartition raison- nable.</p>
                    <p>On sait qu’un groupe dit “Anglo-Belgian Co.” avait acheté le railway do
                        Fayoum. Or, le conseil de la communante protestante copte, tuteur de M.
                        Wissa Boctor (qui est detentuer de la majeure partie des actions de la
                        société, mais est en meme temps interdit) est intervenn et a annule la vente
                        On ajoute qu’en l’estat le groupe anglo-belge s’est empressA de se desister.
                        En attendant, le railway ne semble goAre aller comme sur des roulettes. Une
                        petition adressee an gouvernement par les notables de la province expose
                        eloquemment la deplorable administration du chemin de fer.</p>
                    <p>D’autre part, les negociants se plaignent amerement de la facon dont leurs
                        marchandises sont traitees. Suivant le correspondent de “l’Egyptian Gazette”
                        un avocat de Medinet El- Fayoum, Attia Effendi, a constate que deux boltes
                        de fromage A lui adressees avaient ete e moitie devoreasparies employes de
                        la station! Apparemment, le personnel de la Compagnie est affame, ce qui ne
                        serait, d’ailleurs, pas in- vraisemblable, vu qu’il a été mis depiuis long-
                        temps A la portion congue.</p>
                    <p>Le Tribunal Mixte du Cairo a pronouce ce matin son jugement dans le procès
                        en preemp- tion intent A par Rifky pacha A Nungovich bey A la suite de

                    <p>(Aujourd hui à midi et demie)</p>
                    <p>En dépit d’une baissa assez sensible à Lon- dres, ici notre marché montre du
                        soutien et meme de l’animation. L’attention de la spécu- lation se porte
                        surtout pour le moment sur l’Agricole, les Estâtes et v les Tramways a’A-
                        lexandrie.</p>
                    <p>Ces derniers sont en hausse sensible : les privilégiées atteignent 162 1/2,
                        et les divi- dendes, qui cotaient avant-hier encore 295, sont maintenant
                        demandées à 322.</p>
                    <p>Les banques ne suivent pas toutes le même mouvement : tandis que la National
                        fléchit 25 3/4, la Land Bank à 8 1/16 et la Cassa di Sconto à 213, la Banque
                        d’Athènes remonte à 133 1/4 et la Banque d’Abyssinie a 7.</p>
                    <p>Il en est de même des valeurs foncières : le Comptoir atteint 4 5/8, le
                        Trust 15,32 et les Estates 1 19/32, pendant que la Daïra réac- tionne à 17
                        1/2.</p>
                    <p>Quant aux valeurs commerciales et indus- trielles, les fluctuations sont
                        tontes en faveur de la hausse: la Biasserie des Pyramides monte à 112, les
                        Markets a 24/3, les Egyptian Hotels à 4 et les Nungovioh à 11 11/1.</p>
                    <p>Les Baux da Caire sont aussi un peu plus fermes a 116 1/2.</p>
                    <p>La tendance générale est bonne.</p>

                    <p>Paris. January 2.</p>
                    <p>We do not know whether even now M. Loubet may not remain at the Eysee for
                        another term, in spite of his announced fixed determination to re1 ire into
                        private life. The French New Year deputations to him on behalf of the
                        Council of State and other public bodies put very warmly their regret at
                        this determi- nation, and their wish that it could have been otherwise. But
                        the only chance seems to lie in the possibility that the election of a
                        President might result in a deadlock, say, between M. Doumer and M.
                        Fallieres, from which escape might be sought in a sudden "stampede” 'for M.
                        Loubet. If that should come about, it would be a result that would bev
                        regarde 1 with great pleasure in England, where M. Loubet is universally
                        considered an old friend whom we all know and esteem. However, the new
                        President, whoever he may be, will certainly carry on the Entente Cordiale.
                        All the indications continne to show that at least the two Powers chiefly
                        concerned are entering the Morocco Conference prepared for the worst, though
                        hoping the best. The French Northern Squad on is lying ready to sail fur an
                        unknown destination within an hour or two of the order being given, both
                        France and Germany have the reserves warned for mobi- lisation, and now
                        comes the news that the French Mediterranean Squadron is being rapidly
                        prepared for active service. Toulon seethes with activity in overhauling
                        ships, and in getting on heat'd all the ships their full complement of
                        ammunition, coal, and supplies. William II. in new role—that of the pacific
                        Kaiser—has given the French papers a good deal of material for comment and
                        speculation, and they have not been slow to avail them selves of the
                        occasion offered by the German Emperor’s recent utterances, as reported by
                        the "Temp?.” At the same time, it would be a mistake to suppose that
                        Frenchmen take for granted everything that the Kaiser chooses to say. In
                        spite of his repeated attempts at a reconciliation with France a
                        reconciliation for which neither Frace nor Germany is yet ready- the French
                        have always looked askance at His Majesty’s advances. They do not desire at
                        present anything more than his passive neutrality. And whenever he has tried
                        to force a commencement of closer relations be- tween the two countries, the
                        citizens of the Republic have met. his overtures with studied coolness. It
                        may be that this attitude on the part of a people whom Germany once humi-
                        liated ha? played its part in the reaction in the Emperor’s sentiments. For
                        it cannot be said that His Majesty has lately shown any very pronounced
                        desire to be conciliatory to France. Be that as it may, when William II.
                        somewhat theatrically exclaims: ‘I do not want war,” Frenchmen are apt to
                        shrug their shoulders, and ask: 'Why don’t you give us some proof of it,
                        instead of quarrelling with us over Morocco?’’ Writing in the ‘Aurore,’' M.
                        G. Clemenceau says: "No one will be more satisfied than myself d peace be
                        assured. But I beg to be excused fur not joining in the delight if the only
                        guarantee is the one drama ticallyy given by William II.—the sentiment of
                        his duty towards God and his people’’ I alone can take a decision,’ he
                        proclaims with magniloquence- What a solid foundation fui peace or for war!
                        For there is no boasting in this. The German people in this matter has not
                        the right to be consulted. When William II. considers that his ‘duty towards
                        God’ and towards his subjects is to make a warlike decision, that people
                        will have to rash to the slaughter-” M. Audre Mevil, who has tra velled in
                        Germany and knows the Germans, who has also adapted for France a book on the
                        intimate life of the German Emperor which who suppressed in the Fatherland,
                        writes on the same subject in the “Echo de Paris" “It is more than ever our
                        duty to be on the 'qui vive.' It is the more prudent course. We in lat not
                        allow fine phrases to have too great an effect, but must say to ourselves
                        that the only way of preventing a conflict. is to bi strong and united, and
                        to remain faithful to our friends ” In this last phrase resides the secret
                        of France’s determination to be dignified and fearless in face of the come
                        times arrogant attitude of the German Government. France has an alliance
                        with Russia, And she has made friends with England, and if Germany goes too
                        far she knows that her friends will not desert her in her hour of need
                        And—what is per haps more significant—Germany knows that too.</p>
                    <p>M. Marc Landry has provoked his fellow Frenchmen by the recital of simple
                        fact?. In an article in the ‘Figar,” he tells them of Germany’s maritime
                        expansion. Her mercantile marine now occupies second place among those of
                        the maritime Powers, and greatly surpasses that of France. The
                        Hamburg-American and</p>
                    <cb n="3"/>

                    <p>Norddeutscher-Lloyd lines are the "most im- portant of the whole world,” and
                        possess the largest, most rapid, and most modern vessels. To protect this
                        expansion of commercial inte- rests such thought is being taken for the navy
                        that the strictly military expenditure thereon shows an increase amounting
                        to £6,800,000 in twelve years. That, comments M. Landry, is a burden the
                        Empire can bear tolerably wall, owing to the rapid increase of its wealth
                        and population. The German Socialists might con- tradict M. Landry, but some
                        colour is lent to his statement by a document published by the German Naval
                        Department, which shows that, whereas the German naval expenditure amounts
                        to about 3s. 9d. per head of the population, the French is 6s: 5d. A society
                        has been formed in France which is to all intents and purposes a branch or-
                        ganisation of a company called the English Investments Corporation Limited).
                        The money collected for the French clergy is to be handed over for safe
                        keeping to this corporation, which will undertake to prove itself worthy of
                        its name. A pamphlet explaining the aim? of the English Investments
                        Corporation is now being circulated among Catholic capitalists. It. says:
                        —</p>
                    <p>"We have wished to place ourselves under the protecting and liberal aegis of
                        a Great Power. . . We have wished to cent alise in a single and common
                        treasure all the resources of Catholic mun ficence. . . This capital will be
                        accumulated in the largest banks in England in the baud? of the cleverest
                        and most upright financiers under the control of juris- consults and
                        bishops.” </p>
                    <p>Beneficent as the changes produced by French rule in Madagascar are in the
                        aggre- gate, they have given rise to one serious draw- back. Taxation now
                        presses heavily on the Datives that the poorer classes can no longer afford
                        to bay imported merchandise. Cotton fabrics are especially affected, the
                        import duty on these necessaries having been gradually raised from 3
                        percent, to 8 per cent., involv- ing an increase of 25 per cent, in price to
                        the purchaser. It is a difficulty with which Eng- land has otten been
                        confronted since she be- came an Empire builder. Civilisation and industrial
                        development ran away with a good deal of money at first, and that can only
                        be obtained by raising additional revenue. For a considerable period, too,
                        military and police charges are certain to be heavy, while no European Power
                        that has annexed uncivilised territory can hold back from educational im-
                        provements. When under native rule, the Malagasy contrived to get on quite
                        comfort- ably without these exhausting drains on the in sular Treasury, and
                        so could afford to spend freely on foreign manufactures of one sort or
                        another. Now that they have to practise self- denial for the attainment of
                        definite objects not yet appreciated or even believed in, they naturally
                        regard French rule as anything hot an unmixed benefit. But it is a safe
                        prediction that the next generation will be otherwise minded.</p>
                    <p>What is the dividing line between an old master and a modern painting or
                        sculpture? In history, the line between ancient and modern has long been
                        drawn about the middle of the 16th century, or, to be precise, at the battle
                        of Pavia. But in art the question has up to the present been left to be the
                        sport of the experts. Within the past few days, however, a Paris tribunal
                        has given a defining judgment which finally settles the point as far as
                        France is concerned. It now only remains to be seen whether the verdict of
                        France in such a matter is the.verdict of the world, as would have been the
                        case 150 years ago. This con temporary judgment of Paris is that every work
                        of art executed prior to 1800 may legally be labeled “ancient” ; every one
                        subsequent to 1800 is "modern.”</p>
                    <p>On the hypothesis that a man of full age may safely take unto himself a wife
                        without consulting bis grandmother, sunder bold re- formers are trying to
                        bring the French marriage laws up to date. I sounds almost incredible but is
                        none the less a fact, that a Frenchman under twenty-five years of age, whose
                        parent are dead and whose grandfatheror grandmother is alive, cannot enter
                        the married state without the written authority of both or either of them
                        Should the grandparent refuse, a formal request called an acte respectueux,
                        must be served, and after a certain lapse of time the wedding may take
                        place, These provisions are the cause of a host of vexations formalities. As
                        an instance we may take the case (cited by the Comte d’Hanpsonville) of a
                        man of twenty-four, whose parents were alive, and a girl of twenty-one whose
                        only living relative was her maternal grandmother. The would-be bride and
                        bride- groom lived in Paris, but were born in the country. When they went
                        before the registrar in Paris the lady was asked to produce cert ficates of
                        her own birth and the death of her parents and the paternal grandfather, as
                        well as her grandmother’s consent, duly attested The bridegroom was requited
                        to show his birth <cb n="4"/> certificate, the written approval of his
                        father and mother, and proof that he had complied with the military service
                        law. Both parties to the marriage were further called upon to prove
                        publication of their intentions in their res- pective birthplaces and in the
                        districts in- habited by the bridegroom’s parents and the bride’s
                        grandmother. The poor have neither the time nor the money requisite for
                        these formali- ties. The result is cohabitation without mar- riage and the
                        large proportion of illegitimate births which form a permanent feature in
                        French vital statistics. The latter show, at the same time, that the rate of
                        mortality is much higher amongst illegitimate than legitimate children. It
                        seems fair to assume, therefore, that a simplification of the marriage laws
                        would contribute towards a much-needed in- crease in the population of
                        France. A Clerical Deputy, the Abbe Lemire, has brought in a Bill to lower
                        the age limit from twenty-five to twenty-one and to do away with the acte
                        respec- tueux after the age of thirty, but it does not appear that public
                        opinion is yet ripe for the reform. The law as-it stands is directed against
                        improvident matches, and prudent restrictions of this kind appeal strongly
                        to the French character. Nothing, however, can alter the fact that France is
                        falling behind in the struggle for existence, and is poorer every year, in
                        com- parison with Germany, by as many lives as a 1 disastrous war would cost
                        her.</p>
                    <p>The French papers—like the English—are occasionally sad reading, and
                        disappointed affection more frequently than anything else furnishes the
                        material. A typically Parisian story was told a day or two ago, the outcome
                        of a particularly sad case of abandonment and despair. Imagine a dashing
                        young cavalry officer, who, in a provincial garrison town, falls violently
                        in love with a pretty little dressmaker, eighteen years of age. The cavalry
                        officer is a man of good family, with lots of money to spend ; the little
                        dressmaker is a poor girl and an orphan. Is it surprising that she falls an
                        easy victim to what at the begin- ning was a case of genuine love at first
                        sight on each side? Mothazet soon induced her to give up her needle and
                        thread, installed her in an elegant fiat near the barracks, and visited her
                        on every possible occasion. For a time, while love’s young dream continued,
                        the pair of turt'e-doves were very happy. When the young officer’s term of
                        military service expired, be took his idol to Paris, and all went merry as
                        before, But soon, their gilded existence was clouded over. Mothazet’s father
                        got an inkling of what was going on, and insisted on a rup- ture. He had
                        arranged a marriage for his son with the daughter of a wealthy merchant and
                        the young officer must comply with his father’s wishes. Otherwise he would
                        be cut off with a shilling. Reluctantly he made up his mind to obey. But he
                        said nothing to Lucienne, the little dressmaker. She found out everything,
                        however, and on the day of the wedding, when her lover, the man who had
                        abandoned her, came out of his lodgings decked for his wedding with another,
                        she reproached him bitterly for his desertion, and threw the contents of a
                        bottle of vitriol over him. The record ends as follows: he was attended to
                        in a neighbouring chemist's shop, and afterwards taken home. It is feared he
                        will lose his eyesight. The girl gave herself up to and wasthe police and
                        was detained</p>

                        <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                        <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers
                            the accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by
                            which they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange
                            them as accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that
                            none of them are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home
                            there are several things to be considered. To begin with there is the
                            difference in climate between Egypt and the various points at which you
                            may arrive in Europe.</p>
                        <cb n="2"/>
                        <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                            January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so
                            warm as Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more
                            uniformly warm than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt
                            far too early in the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is
                            perfect. The warmest place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                        <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent
                            at sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on
                            each of the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of
                            Europe.</p>
                        <cb n="3"/>
                        <p>They are as follows:-</p>
                        <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth,
                            Southhampton, London or Liverpool—occupy about 4 days. The short ones
                            are as follows:—</p>

                            Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines
                            are also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by
                            travellers to Egypt.</p>
                        <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to
                            Alexandria, without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made
                            without change in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                        <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                            Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German
                            Levant line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>

                            P.&amp;O. Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd
                            Trieste Vienna express from Alexandria.</p>
                        <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little
                            luggage is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several
                            good and responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed
                            charge to deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                        <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by
                            the fast Mail Steamers “Osiris" and “Isis” to Brindisi. One of these
                            leaves port Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the
                            Indian <cb n="6"/>mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                        <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                            attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats"
                            having been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to
                            Brindisi. If you are going straight through to England you will find the
                            train waiting at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without
                            changing. It has complete arrangements for sleeping and eating on board,
                            and you should arrive in London on the fifth day from leaving Port
                            Said.</p>

                        <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.’s steamers
                            which leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to
                            TAORMENA, one of the most charming and popular places on the island.
                            Giardini is the station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina
                            is most delightful, occupying about one hour. In and around the town is
                            much to interest the visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but
                            restored under the Romans. CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent
                            of Etna and here also is a fine Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and
                            Saracenic remains that are found all over the island, are an endless
                            sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting history, having been a
                            Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C. 413, and taken by
                            the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb is to be
                            seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                            about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                            delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city.
                            The Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of
                            S. Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The
                            Cathedral, Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also
                            worth a visit.</p>

                        <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every
                            Wednesday during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3
                            days.</p>
                        <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino
                            Co.’s steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave
                            it without wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely
                            places on its bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that
                            takes you to Sorrento [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                        <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can
                            will devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and
                            interesting portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are
                            too well-known to need comment here.</p>
                        <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five
                            hours brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent
                            admiring the City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence
                            itself the churches and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the
                            local promenades and excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is
                            the most attractive and fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the
                            Viale dei Colli, one of the finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago,
                            goes winding up through the hills a distance of four miles. The most
                            delightful excursion outside Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its
                            Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea level. This is made first by ordinary
                            train from Florence to St. Ellero, thence by cog-wheel railway to
                            Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks takes an hour, and most
                            striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                        <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; hero there is a
                            fine Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night
                            should if possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile
                            at sunset.</p>
                        <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near
                            Pisa and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient
                            half-way house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable
                            and the air and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                        <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy,
                            with the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European
                            cities and a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and
                            deliciously cool breezes from the surrounding mountains and the
                            Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                        <p>The patriarchal home of Italy’s most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                            gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings,
                            are a constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn
                            in Genoa. Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches
                            containing exquisite marble columns and historical paintings, and the
                            incomparable Campo Santo filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                        <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                        <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                            Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful
                            windows illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and
                            the monumental cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                        <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                            SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal
                            springs, change trains at Borgo San Donino and in half-an-hour you are
                            at Salsomaggiore.</p>

                        <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                            delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                            vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage
                            or bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every
                            turn. The approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any
                            other sea port. The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of
                            the sea, no hills behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of
                            Campaniles appear above the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering
                            town rises like a fairy mirage out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                        <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                            lakes.</p>
                        <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in
                            one-and-a-quarter hours by train by way of Monza :</p>
                        <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is
                            very beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                            enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo,
                            Cadenabbia, and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio
                            opposite. The walk from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio
                            is most enjoyable. A steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake
                            Lugano in three-quarters of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in
                            two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                            hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated
                            on the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M.

                            is an excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated
                            above the town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings,
                            “Entombment," by Ciseri, and ‘Tho Flight into Egypt,” by Bramantion.</p>

                            scenery on the trip from Lucerne, to Fluelen is a source of delight to
