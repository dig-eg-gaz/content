                    attached to this incident in French official circles, especially in view of the
                    fact that the King had 20 minutes close conversa- tion wjth the German
                    Ambassador after the dinner at the Elysee. (Reuter.)</p>

                            country. The bequest has been entrusted to the Daira khassa to deal
                            with. Mr. Dimas was born at Chimara, in Epirus, and he bequeathed £4,000
                            to that town, and also left bequests of £2,000 to the Greek-Orthodox

                            programme. Major R. M. Gamble, D.S.O., kindly presided. Songs by Mrs.
                            R.N, Gamble, Mrs. Acres, and Miss Mun- Gayin were enthusiastically
                            received, the latter in her song “Husheen” being vociferous- ly
                            applauded. Miss M. K. Gibson (who also kindly accompanied most of the
                            songs) gave, perhaps, the greatest pleasure of the evening, by her
                            exquisite rendering, on the violin, of “Salut d’Amour” and “Mazur,” both
                            of which had to be repeated. The songs by Rev. R. Wormell and Mr.
                            P.Byrne, with violin obbligato, were well rendered, and Mr. Byrne’s fine
                            voice showed to great advantage in his last song, “Love, could I only
                            tell thee.” The songs and duet, “Larboard Watch,” by Cpl. Murphy,
                            A.S.C., and Pte. Cowie, R.A.M.C., were not the least enjoyable items of
                            the programme, and were fully appreciated by all present. Last, but by
                            no means least, was Mr. Dodwell’s part of the evening’s entertainment.
                            As usual, his extremely funny songs and recitations were most cleverly
                            given, and fairly convulsed his audience with laughter. After repeated
                            encores, he was per- suaded to add another item to the programme. Votes
                            of thanks and the singing of “God-save the King” brought a most
                            enjoyable evening to a close. Amongst those present were Major and Mrs.
                            Gamble, Mrs. Finch, Mr. John Ross and party, Rev. H. P. Reid and party,
                            Mr. and Mrs. Seed, Dr. said Mrs. Barsumunian, etc. The collection at the
                            door realised P.T. 188, which, after deducting for expenses of printing,
                            etc., left P.T. 78 to be handed over to the Ins- titute’s poor relief
                            fund.</p>

                    <p>The Khedive has sent the following graciously worded letter to the President
                        of the Alexandria Municipality :—</p>
                    <p>M. le Président,</p>
                    <p>Dans sa séance plénière tenue le 26 avril courant, le Conseil Municipal
                        d’Alexandrie a, sur la proposition d’un de ses membres, voté à l'unanimite
                        un credit de mille livres pour la célébration du centenaire de Mohamed Aly
                        et nommé un comité qui prendra l'initiative de l’organisation des fetes.</p>
                    <p>Je suis touché des sentiments manifestés par la Commissión Municipale à
                        l’égard du fonda- teur de la dynastie, et je tiens à vous assurer, Monsieur
                        le Président, ainsi que les honorables membres de la Commission de ma vive
                        grati- tude qui est certainement partagée par la famille Khédiviale toute
                        entière.</p>
                    <p>Cet acte de loyalisme m’est d'autant plus agréable que je le dois à ma bonne
                        ville d'A- lexandrie, qui n’a cessé de me témoigner un véritable
                        attachement.</p>
                    <p>L'importance de la somme votée, à laquelle s’ajouteront les souscriptions
                        privées, me per- met de penser qu’une notable partie de ce crédit pourrait
                        être consacrée soit à une oeuvre de bienfaisance soit aux besoins de la
                        ville.</p>
                    <p>Persuadés que le Conseil Municipal saura prendre, dans le cas, les meilleures
                        dispositions, je saisis cette occasion pour vous donner, M. le Président,
                        l’assurance da mes sentiments af- fectueux.</p>

                    <p>The Alexandria Fête Committee held a meet- ing at the Municipality yesterday
                        to consider the above letter. Among those present were Mahmoud Sidky Pasha,
                        and Messrs. Amb. A. Ralli, Ahmed Bey Yehia, G. Zervudachi, Baron A. de
                        Menasce, Dr. Schiess Bey, L. Escoffier, P. Fenderl, Mansour Bey Youssef,
                        Soliman Bey Abani, E. Benachi, Mahfouz Bey, Padoa Bey, R. Rolo, Comte M. de
                        Zizinia, de Tschudi, Michel Sinadino, Bourgeois, Bartau Pasha, A. Sursock,
                        L. Stagni, Ismail Bey Hafez, R. Canivet, Turin Bey Yehia, W. P. Chataway,
                        aud J. Sedky Bey.</p>
                    <p>The Governor of Alexandria opened the pro- ceedings by reading his Highness’s
                        letter and expressed the most lively satisfaction in regard to the contents,
                        as they showed how cordially the Khedive approved of their efforts.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Ambroise Ralli seconded his Excellency ’s sentiments, and all present
                        testified by their enthusiastic applause to the great pleasure which the
                        Khedive’s letter had afforded them. Mr. Ralli’s speech was most eloquent,
                        and he ended by a call for three cheers for his High- ness, which was most
                        heartily responded to by all present.</p>
                    <p>The meeting subsequently discussed the question of organising subscriptions
                        for the madhouse which was to bear the name of Mohamed Aly. The madhouse
                        scheme met with the approbation of all present, with the exception of Count
                        Zizinis, who abstained from voting because he considered that the selection
                        of a work of public utility ought only to be decided upon after the matter
                        had been fully considered by a special committee.</p>
                    <p>The meeting decided that the executive Fête Committee, consisting of Mr.
                        Zervudachi, Yehia Bey, and Baron A. de Menasce, should be charged with the
                        collection of subscriptions, and should share in this work together with the
                        committee already appointed for this purpose.</p>

                        position. The Ministry of Public Works has authorised the committee to
                        illuminate the statue of Ibrahim Pasha, Abdeen-street, and the Nile banks at
                        Kasr el-Nil, and to erect two triumphal arches in Opera square and at the

                        the Ismailia quarter of Cairo, about 4 p.m. yester- day. A large number of
                        very distinguished Egyptians followed the body to its last resting place,
                        among them being Mustapha Pasha Fehmy (his nephew), Kairi Pasha (represent-

                    <p>A number of the Princes of the Khedivial Family have left cards and messages

                        had on board, Mr. G. Mason, loco. and stores super- intendent, Sudan

                    <p>Very heavy rain fell here on the night of the 21st inst. and washed away part
                        of the railway line. Bimbashi Sowerby, who was on the line, telephoned at
                        once to Railhead and to Suakin for assistance, and a special train, with
                        Miralai Macauley Bey, Director of Rail- ways, and 200 officers and men of
                        the Railway Battalion, with implements and tools, left here on the 22nd

                    <p>One case of smallpox has occurred amongst the Sudanese pilgrims at the

                        hundreds of children. The health of the pilgrims up to the present is said

                        shortly the Sudan Government will sell land to shipping agencies and banks,

                    <head>CAIRO IMPROVEMENTS.</head>
                    <p>One of the most important, though to the average citizen least noticeable, of
                        the improve- ments that are being carried out in Cairo is the renovation of
                        that part of the town lying between the Mousky and the Hamzawy. A year or
                        two back the Haret Essaih was almost entirely rebuilt with buildings
                        especially adapt- ed to the wants of the very important trading class that
                        affects that district, and the whole- sale dealers in European goods,
                        cottons, etc., etc., are now lodged there in offices and stores that are a
                        credit to the town.</p>
                    <p>Up to the present, however, the large block of land lying between the new
                        markets and the Ataba el Khadra, which is the central station of the tramway
                        system of the town, has been covered with miserable one-storied buildings,
                        mostly built entirely of wood, which have thus been allowed to monopolise
                        one of the most valuable sites in the whole of the city. At last, however,
                        the Wakfs Administration, to which this land belongs, has made up its mind
                        to do what should have been done several years ago, and the whole of the
                        wretched shanties on this laud that have hitherto formed the left-hand limit
                        of the entrance to the Sharia Mohamed Aly, are being pulled down to give
                        place to buildings which, it is to be hoped, will not only prove an immense
                        improvement to the appearance and character of the locality, but will
                        furnish accommodation that is sadly needed to enable the business of the
                        town to follow its natural course in this district.</p>

                    <p>Besides the monuments derived from the excavations, the Alexandria Museum has
                        been enriched by gifts from Messrs. Degiardé Brothers of two monuments in
                        lime-stone, which are very remarkable, one for native art of the Greco-Roman
                        period, and the other for Coptic art. M. Stoja has also made a gift to the
                        Museum of doors of tombs covered with paintings.</p>
                    <p>In April, 1,717 persons visited the Museum (of whom 318 paid for admission),
                        as against (336 paying) in April, 1904. 293 persons visited Pompey’s Pillar,
                        as compared to 86, and 575 visited Kom el-Shougafa, as compared to 482.</p>
                    <p>The summer hours of the Museum, i.e., May 1 to October 31, are 8 a.m. to 1
                        p.m. The hours for visiting Kom el-Shougafa and Pompey’s Pillar remain
                        unchanged, i.e., from 8 a.m. to sunset. On Wednesday the Museum is closed.
                        The Museum Committee has, at the request of Dr. Breccia, reduced the price
                        of admission during the summer to Kom el- Shougafa from P.T. 5 to P.T. 3,
                        and to Pompey 's Pillar from P.T. 3 to P.T. 1.</p>

                    <p>"A Country Girl" was given this evening at the Eldorado Theatre before a very
                        full house by the Bandmann-Dallas opera company. The company only reached
                        Port Said at 4 p.m. from Cairo, and practically stepped direct from the
                        train on to the stage. The perform- ance on the whole, was excellent. The
                        only thing exception could be taken to as being really below the general
                        standard, was the orchestra, who perhaps are, after all, not to be blamed,
                        for they consisted of scratch crews from the cafés here. The conductor had
                        great difficulties to contend with, and his unfor- tunately necessary
                        prompting rather marred the general performance. Apart from that and the
                        doubtful suitability of the theatre itself, which is really a music-hall, it
                        was a huge success.</p>

                    <p>An awed world is holding its breath and listening for the clash of arms and
                        ships, aye, and the ghastly tale of slaughtered and sunk. Even the shrieks
                        of greed that are wont to rend the air on the Stock Exchange are hushed, and
                        the issues of life and death of men and nations paralyze the imagination and
                        cry “halt" to speculation. There are sellers who must sell, but no one has
                        any heart to buy while the deep shadow of coming events looms dark over the
                        hearts of men.</p>
                    <p>There is practically nothing new to report since last week; the holidays
                        having occupied the greater part of the interval since we last wrote, and
                        the Settlement taken up the remainder of the time. There is a decided dearth
                        of new business, as the result of the impending naval action in the East
                        still hangs in the balance. As is always the case, the uncertainty of the
                        situation has been its weakest point, for even adverse facts are, in a way,
                        better than suspense and rumours of all sorts. Added to this we have a
                        slight friction nearer home, as a result of recent German utterances, and a
                        sharp break in the American market; so that the prevailing tone this week
                        has been dull—one might fairly say weak.</p>
                    <p>Egyptian stocks were steady, and Daira Sanieh shares were as high as 29 1/4
                        on Tuesday, but this market has weakened with the rest, Dairas tailing back
                        to 28 1/8. Bank shares were also easier, Nationals 27 and Agricultural 13
                        1/4, with little doing.</p>
                    <p>Persistent efforts are made to give a little impetus to the Egyptian mining
                        section, but there is not enough outside business to book them up. At the
                        moment there is a slightly better tone, notably for Nile Valleys at 21/4 and
                        Um Rus at 1 3/16. Both of these shares should be worth locking up at the
                        price.</p>

                    <p>The first meeting of the members representing Gharbieh province for the
                        K.A.S. was held at Tantah a few days ago, under the presidency of the
                        Moudir. The meeting was largely attended. Mr. Fosden, secretary-gene- ral of
                        the society, the sanitary inspector of the Gharbieh, the chief engineer of
                        irrigation (on behalf of the Inspector of Irrigation, who apologised for his
                        absence), Sibay Bey El Masry, representative of the moudirieh, two members
                        representing each markaz, the secretary of the society in Gharbieh, and
                        several press representatives were present.</p>
                    <p>Hosny Eff., secretary, gave a short history of the society, showing how the
                        society was about to fall and how, through the efforts of Prince Hussein
                        Pasha, it had risen again and kept its balance gradually. He stated that the
                        notables of Gharbieh did not, like those in other moudiriehs, pay any
                        attention to the im- provement of agriculture.</p>
                    <p>Sibaiy Bey el Masry suggested that in order to carry out the recommendations
                        of the cir- cular issued by the Government concerning the cotton worm, the
                        Government should make some arrangements between the Irriga- tion Office and
                        the society during the rotations. He also suggested that stores for seeds
                        and manure should be established by the society in each markaz. An
                        agricultural show in each town and city should be held annually during the
                        corn harvest.</p>
                    <p>Mohamed Bey Cherif suggested that experiments in manuring should be carried
                        out in each markaz at the expense of the members and under the control of
                        the society’s secretary.</p>
                    <p>Fathallah Bey Barakat stated that in his clover plantation, the stalk varied
                        from 1.70 to 2.60 metres in length. He explained how it was planted and
                        expressed his readiness to sell to the society any quantity of seeds that it
                        might require.</p>
                    <p>Soliman Bey Ghanam proposed that the Government should issue a circular to
                        the effect that only one-third of a plantation should be planted with
                        cotton. Hosny Eff., secretary, replied that such an action of the Government
                        would appear rather premature.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Fox Bourne, writing to the London Press on behalf of the Aborigines'
                        Protection Society, makes a strong protest against the bringing to England
                        of the Congo pigmies, now detained in Cairo. He says the pigmies are in the
                        category of “curious little animals which have been beguiled into captivity
                        not distin- guishable from that to which strange quad- rupeds, birds, or
                        reptiles are subjected when their captors expect profit from making a show
                        of them to gaping crowds of sightseers. What is this but a base form of
                        slavery?” Mr. Fox Bourne characterises the exhibition of these creatures as
                        an outrage on the humane princi- ples professed by all civilised nations,
                        and especially our own.</p>

                    <head>COL HARRISON'S DESCRIPTION.</head>
                    <p>Colonel Harrison has arrived in London from Cairo. Describing his stay with
                        the pigmies, the Colonel said to a Reuter inter- viewer: “When once I had
                        gained their con- fidence, they were quite friendly, and even- tually six of
                        them — four men and two women - volunteered to come with me to England. They
                        freely conducted me to their little vil- lages, and at night time erected
                        leafy struc- tures, under which I slept. They are of an extremely low order
                        of intelligence, and know absolutely nothing of what goes on around them.
                        They seem to have no religious instincts, and possess no idea of a Supreme
                        Being. Their average height is from four feet to four feet three and a-half,
                        and, curiously enough, as a rule the women are taller than the men. The
                        women have also better physical development. The men seemed to me to be
                        starved to death. A noteworthy fact was the prevalence of a terrible cough -
                        due, perhaps, to the dampness of the atmosphere. All the pigmies alike
                        suffer- ed from this to such a degree that it was diffi- cult to sleep at
                        night. I had quite expected to find that serious lung trouble was prevalent,
                        but was surprised to discover, as a result of medical examination of the
                        pigmies who ac- companied me back to Egypt, that the lungs were quite
                        healthy.</p>

                <div type="item">
                    <head>THE FINDING OF THE PIGMIES.</head>
                    <p>The finding of the pigmies is thus described:— “Darkness was just setting in
                        at the end of our first march in the forest when, during a terrible
                        thunderstorm, we came upon a small clearing among the trees, and knew that a
                        pigmy village was not far off. One of the party was despatched into the
                        neighbouring bush to see the pigmies, and to tell them of our approach. The
                        actual village was some distance from the clearing, the tiny huts being
                        hidden away between the trees, sometimes in almost inaccessible places. It
                        consisted of some dozen little leafed-in arbours seven feet in diameter, and
                        less than four feet high at the highest point. In front of these burnt a
                        bright fire, while within each of the dwell- ings crouched from eight to ten
                        of the pigmies. Later in the day, at my request, they came to my camp and
                        danced. They are tremendous dancers, and they will perform for hours at a
                        stretch without fatigue. Their movements are in perfect time, and by no
                        means ungraceful. About a hundred form up a line and dance round a couple of
                        native drums. These, and the shrill whistles which they employ when out
                        hunting, appear to be their only musical instru- ments.</p>

                <div type="item">
                    <head>EXTRAORDINARY SILENCE.</head>
                    <p>“On the first night only 35 came out to dance, all the women being kept in
                        the huts, but on subsequent occasions I have had as many as a hundred
                        performing before me. A striking characteristic of the people is their
                        extraordinary silence; they will sit for hours without uttering a word. They
                        are nomadic, and their only wealth is in spears. The num- ber of spears
                        determines the number of wives these people can afford. They are practically
                        nude. The women’s only clothing is a few leaves, while the men's attire
                        consists of a scrap of skin round the waist. Their whole personal belongings
                        consist of a poisoned spear or two and an old clay cooking pot. The women
                        carry their infants slung across their sides.</p>

                <div type="item">
                    <head>A WARLIKE PEOPLE.</head>
                    <p>"They are fearless hunters, and will boldly attack an elephant by rushing up
                        to it and planting a poisoned spear in the brute. They are also a very
                        warlike little people, and only a short while before my arrival in the
                        forest they had sallied out, attacked and looted a Belgian caravan, and
                        killed seventeen porters. There were no white men with the caravan, and the
                        native soldiers bolted. They eat like animals, even gnawing the bones of
                        their prey. When an animal is caught they cut it up, skin and all, and put
                        it in the cooking pot.</p>

                    <head>LIFE IN THE FOREST.</head>
                    <p>“Life in the forest is dreary in the extreme. It is always twilight, the sun
                        never penetrates through the dense foliage, and for nine months of the year
                        it pours with rain."</p>

                    <head>STOPPED IN CAIRO.</head>
                    <p>After living for three weeks in the forest Colonel Harrison, together with
                        the six pig- mies who had volunteered to return with him, again left for
                        Irumu. Nothing was heard of any attempt to stop the pigmies till the arrival
                        of Colonel Harrison at Cairo. Here it was found that Lord Cromer had
                        received instruc- tion from the Foreign Office to ascertain under what
                        conditions the pigmies were going to England, and if they were willing.</p>

                <div type="item">
                    <head>THEIR CONDITION.</head>
                    <p>The six pigmies included font men and two women. One of the latter — an old
                        woman — has distinctly ape-like features, and is parti- cularly repulsive in
                        appearance; while the other — known as the Princess — is described as a
                        comparatively beautiful girl. The old woman was found to be ill, and it was
                        con- sidered well for her to be sent to hospital at Cairo, and one of the
                        men also had an attack of bronchitis, which it was thought would necessitate
                        his detention for a few days. With these exceptions all are said to be in
                        good health, and were certified by the Sirdar's doctor at Khartoum and by a
                        leading physician in Cairo to be perfectly fit.</p>
                    <p>Colonel Harrison is still communicating with the Foreign Office on the
                        question of the pig- mies proceeding to England, for which he has full
                        permission from the Congo Government.</p>
