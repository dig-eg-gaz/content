                    <head>THE BUDGET.</head>
                    <p>While the Financial Adviser's Note on the Budget for 1907 contains nothing of
                        a sensational nature, its contents are, as always, o considerable interest
                        and value to all who tak the slightest interest in the financial an economic
                        condition of Egypt. Certain section deserve particular attention, especially
                        those dealing with the cotton crop, but the mos interesting and important is
                        that which deal with the general financial situation of the country,
                        inasmuch as it offers an explanation of the apparent anomaly that the
                        increase of the Revenue estimates has failed to keep pace with the actual
                        revenue for several year past. The surpluses have for the past three years
                        1904-05-06 totalled L.E. 7,348,000, ye the revenue estimates for 1907 are L.
                        E. 73,004 short of the actual receipts for 1905.</p>
                    <p>The Financial Adviser, after pointing out that his Budgets would seem to have
                        been framed on meticulously cautious lines, points out that the situation of
                        Egypt is very different from that of any other civilised State. It is more
                        than an agricultural-it is a "one-crop" country, absolutely dependent for
                        its existence on the Nile and dependent for it: wealth on the demand for its
                        chief product in the world's markets. Other States have many sources of
                        revenue. Their Governments, faced by a political or an economic crisis, have
                        every chance of meeting it as far as matters of finance are concerned – by
                        reason of the multiplicity of their resources. A light tax on the export of
                        coal produced millions during the Boer War and scarcely affected the
                        consumer. A slight addition to the excise is in unpopular but most lucrative
                        measure, and a multitude of other instances can be imagined. If one source
                        of revenue diminishes in volume. there are always others from which to draw
                        Such is the rule with the majority of European states lo Egypt, on the other
                        hand, the principal source of revenue is the Land Tax. derived mainly from
                        land under a single crop. Should that crop become less remunerative than in
                        the past, should the soil </p>

                <div type="item">
                    <p>become worked out, or should Egyptian cotton deteriorate in quality, the
                        country would be face to face with a most unpleasant situation. Imagine the
                        effect on the bourses of Cairo and Alexandria of a general decline in the
                        quality of Egyptian cotton and a corresponding decrease of the foreign
                        demand !</p>
                    <p>Under the present circumstances there is no need to apprehend any such
                        danger. But the future may always bring startling changes ; should Egyptian
                        cotton ever fall the recovery of the country froin what must under any
                        conditions be a serious blow could only be hastene'l by the present policy
                        of moderate estimates. The Government could raise a revenue of LE.
                        25,000,000 from Egypt. Enormous sums were undoubtedly raised in Isnail
                        Pasha's day, though the Treasury saw little of them in the name of the
                        State, with the result that when the crash came long years elapsed before
                        the country recovered from the combined effects of extravagance and
                        over-taxation. Another reason for moderate estimates advanced by Sir Vincent
                        Corbett is the need of capital expenditure on irrigation, railways, and
                        harbours. In most countries loans would be raised for these remunerative
                        undertakings, but the peculiar political situation of Egypt has made it
                        necessary to provide the necessary funds out of the large annual surplus to
                        which we are growing accustomed The Reserve Fund is therefore maintained by
                        the yearly surplus revenue, a system which is economically unsound, but
                        which has been rendered ne. cessary by political considerations. The Adviser
                        remarks on this subject :-"The system in economically unsatisfactory as the
                        interest that can be obtained on gilt-edged securities in which the
                        unexpended balance of the Reserve Fund is provisionally invested is little
                        more than 34 %. Had this money, as it was levied, been expended on
                        remunerative works, or had it been even left in the hands of the taxpayer,
                        it might have been employed to in. finitely better advantage, while loans
                        incurred as they are wanted might easily be made to yield a high return, of
                        which some 3 % to 4% would be interest on stock and the remainder clear
                        profit."</p>
                    <p>The political events of the year are not discussed : their financial benefits
                        are, how. ever, enumerated. We note &amp; considerable increase of military
                        expenditure, the permanent addition to the Budget of the increased charge
                        for the additional British troops dispatched to Egypt during the Akaba
                        trouble, a reduced balance available for Education and Public Works, and a
                        considerable delay in the work of the Commission charged to prepare
                        recommendations for improving the status of Government employés. We are none
                        the less assured by some of the gentlemen whose literary activity has helped
                        to bring about this state of affairs that they are actuated by the most
                        patriotic sentiments and a desire to lift a multitude of burdens from the
                        labouring shoulders of their countrymen. We suppose we must take them at
                        their word. Still their patriotism has proved expensive to the world in
                        general. </p>

                    <head>L THE PLACE DES CONSULS.</head>
                    <p>In a month's time the Alexandria Municipality will take over the Place des
                        Consuls, and that fine site will be made an open "place" after the style of
                        the Mohamed Aly Square. Before the massacre and bombardment the site was
                        (occupied by the French Consulate, but for all these years it has remained
                        utterly neglected, excepting during the last summer, when it was rented for
                        a considerable sum monthly as an open-air music-hall. One of the schemes
                        pr). posed is that the electric tramway from Ramleh should have a circular
                        line round this square, which would be a useful terminus for that line in
                        the heart of the city. It will eventually be a very fine site. On the west
                        side there will be a pile of Government buildings, including the Alexandria
                        Gouvernorat and other State offices. On the east side the French Consulate
                        is to be built. The French Consulate about four years ago agreed with the
                        Alexandria Municipality to submit to the French Government a proposal that
                        the site of the Place des Consuls should be exchanged for a site for the
                        consular buildings on the quay, plus L.E. 14,000 for building a new
                        Consulate, thus compensating the French Government for the difference in
                        area between the two sites. After considerable delay due to formalities in
                        passing the scheme through the two French Chambers, the French Government
                        asked L.E. 25,000 instead of L.E. 14,000. We think that as the delay was
                        solely due to official formalities it would have been far more dignified for
                        the French Government not to have exacted the last pound of flesh in this
                        bargain. Alexandria doubtless gains by having free ventilation from the sea
                        into its very centre, but it somewhat surprises us that the French
                        Government should make the city pay for delays for which it is in no wise
                        responsible. </p>

                            on the scene and succeeded in isolating the doomed building. The

                        admit of the abolition of the London board will be discussed. Only 80,000
                        shares were represented at Saturday's meeting, and it is evident that there
                        is a considerably larger number of shares held in Egypt. If the local

                        been respectively L.E. 2,650,000,* LB. 2,6 8,000 and L.B. </p>

                        king, to be well i established, it should not be possible to frame</p>
                    <p>estimates nearer the margin of reasonable probable lıy. ! The reply is twild.
                        In the first place, Egypt is on agricultural country, primarily dependent on
                        the Nile, which, in its tard, is dependent on climatic conditions, which are
                        practically impossible to forecast, while the selling value of its principal
                        product depends on the demand and supply in the world's market. Secondly
                        Byypt stepdo is crying reed of a very large capital expenditure on socb
                        remunerative objects as irrigation, railways, and barboni works. In any
                        other country in the wild these would be provided for by loans, bot, in the
                        pronliar circumstances of Egypt, soob a solo tip present serious
                        difficulties. The A 8808 dem was indeed bailt at considerable sacrifice in
                        the teeth of these difficulties, but further</p>

                    <p>o </p>
                    <p>The apparent surplus for 1904 was L.E. 3,030,000 but in order to arrive at an
                        exact comparison with the following years, there should be deducted a sumo
                        LE. 370,000 expended from the General and Special Reserve Funds then
                        existing, and which would now bu classed as special expenditure.</p>
                    <cb n="3"/>
                    <p>capital expenditure has only been rendere possible by the formation of a
                        reserve fang painfully amassed from year to year from ex cogs revenge. This
                        fund, though it nominal stands at the present moment at some L. 9,009,000,
                        is heavily earmarked for indispensable able works to be carried out in the
                        next fer years. It is therefore imperative that, in farming the estimates,
                        the almost promenade should be observed, in order that, even in moderately
                        bad year, there should be po deficit and that in good years there should be
                        some thing to spare to feed a dwindling Reserve. </p>
                    <p>The system is economically unsatisfactory as the interest tat can be obtained
                        on gil edged securities, in which the Dnexpende balance of the reserve fund
                        is provisionall invested, is little more than 31%. Had thi money, as it was
                        levied, been expended o rem onerative works, or bad it even been left i the
                        bands of the taxpayer, it might have bee employed to infinitely better
                        advantage, wbil loans inourred as tbey are wanted might easil be made to
                        yield a high retard, of which som 3 % or 4 % would serve as interest on
                        stock and the remainder be clear profit. </p>
                    <p>Tarning Dow to the estimates of expen ditore, although the gross increase in
                        1997; LE. 1,240,000, the figure is somewhat u oeptive. The financial
                        conditions, which existe till 1904, made anything like a scientifio syster
                        of accounts a practical impossibility, and i happened in some departments
                        that expend ture was partially met out of receipts, instea of being properly
                        brought into account. In the budget of 19 5 and 1906 most of these anom lies
                        were swept away, with the result, as explained at the time, of swelling the
                        figure on both sides of the accant. This year, th work has been completed by
                        the inolosion in the budget of the accounts of the "Boole Nationales" and
                        "Kattabs," while the tartbe step bas been taken of debiting the differen
                        departments with the price of Governmen land required by new buildings, and
                        tbe 008 of postage, transport and customs' daty.. </p>
                    <p>The amount whiob this year figures on botl sides of the budget ander these

                    <p/>

                    <p>Total ... ... - LB. 275,000 This leaves a balance of LE 965,000, bu from this
                        again must be deducted a somo LB 320,000, being the unexpended balano
                        carried forward for special credits granted for 1906, which will, it is
                        calculated, remain unexpended at the end of the year. Thes oredits would
                        paturally lapse on Docember 31 but as the works for which they were assigned
                        remain op finished, it would have been D60EHSA ry to re-grant them as
                        supplementary ore dits next year. This was what was actu ally done in the
                        case of the unexpender balances of 1905, which were re granted in January,
                        1906. The course now inaugurate will be followed in future budgets, and it
                        is an ticipated that the credits anexpended in exob year will approximately
                        balance the credit carried over from the year before, thus cecoring
                        substantial accaraoy in the estimates </p>
                    <p>If we deduct the cost of the decendia census (L E, 35,000), the net balance
                        left is L. Ę. 610,000 (of wbich L. B. 395,0 0 ordinary and L. B. 15,0.0
                        special expenditure) pot in itself an extravagant som, considering the
                        Revende figures above stated, </p>
                    <p>But even here certain reservations are per missible. I have no wish ondaly to
                        laboor the point, but it should be noted that of the above Bom about LR
                        123,000 is dirautly due to the peouliar circumstances which marked the early
                        part of this year. Though this cbargo falls legitimately on revenueas a
                        permanent and bona fide increase of exponditure. it may be hoped that,
                        anless goforeseen ciroomstances arise, tbere will be no necessity to
                        inoroase is to any considerable extent in fatore years. </p>
                    <p>The figures of the net administrative in crease are thus reduced to LR.

                        ball-room were thrown open. The children, as they entered, were awed with
                        admiration at the vision before them. A gigantic tree reaching the ceiling
                        stood at one end of the room, it branches entwined with ropes of glittering
                        silver, laden with coloured eleotrio lamp, while on the top soared an angel
                        with out spread wings, and on each side of the tree two long tables were
                        laden with reimbursed presents. </p>
                    <p>By half past five, over 400 happy young folk were gathered in the large ball
                        room and the scene was as pretty as one could wish to see, each small face
                        beaming with delight. A most excellent buffet was laid out at the other end
                        of the room, whilst small tables stood in the ball outside. After justice
                        bad been done to all the good things, dancing was commenced to the strains
                        of the hotel's excellent Tsigane band. </p>
                    <p>All the upper part of the hotel gave the appearance of a large fashionable
                        gathering of big and small. It is impossible to give names of those who were
                        there. All our smart society was present, the ladies being most handsomely
                        gowned. Amongst the sterner sex were official, QoDegls, notables, etc. </p>

                    <p>Lox, December 21. Well does Luxor merit its name of "Laksor," or "El Kosoor,"
                        which signifies "The Palaces," though its ancient glory, the temple erected
                        by Amenopbis III. and Ramses II., is likely to be eclipsed by the fatore
                        magnificence of the new palace in its vicinity now in the course of
                        erection. The history of the ancient temple with its dromor, obelisks and
                        pylon, is it not written with ample detail in every guide-book and
                        traveller's diary? The story of the latest triumph in hotel apple yet
                        remains to be told Built within two hundred yards of the historic monument,
                        its long wings facing close upon the river with its magnificent view, this
                        latest addition to M. Pagoon's palaces in Upper Egypt is per baps the finest
                        and most elaborate Ily-schemed hotel within the land of Egypt. | Pacing the
                        river on the west the whole of the back of the building looks over the
                        garden and fertile ground to the mountains on the East, sc that throughout
                        the day the brilliant health giving sunshine is pouring out to the balconies
                        and terraces in either one direction or the other. A boge oot stretched

                        experience of M Paging and his energetic manager, M Louis Sebaicb, the
                        latter of whom has been so largely responsible for the 8000088 of various of
                        the | hotels in both Luxor and Assouan. </p>

                    <p>MUSTAPHA PASHA KAMEL AT PARIS.</p>
                    <p>The following is the report of the interview which the Paris correspondent of
                        the "Pall Mall Gazette" bed with Mustapha Pasba Kamel on Monday week : </p>
                    <p>Mustapha Kamel Pasba is again in Parir, staying at the Hôtel des Iles
                        Britanniques, in the Rue de la Paix. lo view of the points raised by your
                        Cairo correspondent as to the connection between the Khedive and this young
                        and energetic chief of the Egyptian Nationalist movement, I thought to ask
                        the latter for some explanation. Mastapba Pasba war, as usual, surrounded by
                        a group of Egyptians and a French journalist or two. lo a lull in the
                        conversation, which ranged over the world's pollution from the Chorob crisis
                        in Prance to the Emperor William's gesture in dismissing the Reichstag, I
                        asked : "What are your exact relations with the Khedive?' "I have no
                        relations, either of ohio, 'fficiense,' or personal, with the Khedive," said
                        Mustapha. "Some time ago I used to fight his Highness when he expressed such
                        a desire or when I had something to submit to him. But, seeing that the
                        Khedive wished to stand well with the King of Bagland and the Boglish
                        Government, I considered it my duty to keep away from him. His ou omiss
                        would not have hesitated to say, 'He is well with the Boglish Government and
                        at the same time with the Bgyptian patriote, who demand the evacuation of
                        Egypt and the performance of British engagements. I ready bed, then, to
                        break with the Khedive, and in a conversation with him at Divonne in August,
                        1904, I explained to his Highness the necessity of 000 tiaging my work
                        independently of him. It was not a defection, but an act of necessity, as
                        gering tranquillity to the Khedive and good relations with Lord Cromer. The
                        Pasha and the Court. </p>
                    <p>"After my return to Egypt in October, 1904, I rendered my decision public in
                        8 letter to the Khedive. Since theo I have never thought of approaching his
                        Highness or of going to the Court. I consider that the National Bzyptian
                        movement has no need of any help except from those who serve it. A man who
                        is hungry or thirsty does not want to be encouraged to ask for meat or
                        drink. In like mapper, the Egyptians do not need encouragement in demanding
                        liberty and a Constitution, </p>
                    <p>"At the moment when the Khedive was in soob excellent relations with the King
                        and the Bigli-b Government, the National movement was following its course
                        without the least obstacle. That proves its independence and the stupid
                        character of the calampies launched against us by our enemi3g. It is
                        incontestable that the Khedive could only congratulate himself at the
                        realisation of or programme, for his throne would b3 more Solid as the froe
                        Sovereign of a free people ; bat, before all, we serve our country, and our
                        patriotism equals in faroe and sincerity that of the English. We find that
                        the political situation of the Khedive is already sufficiently delicate and
                        difficult the result, and, for the safety of his throne, we ought to avoid
                        adding to those difficulties." Tho Khadlvo's Posltion. </p>
                    <p>"How does it happen, then, that the rumour has arised of your having received
                        Khedivial money for founding the 'Egyptian Standard' ?" </p>

                    <p>"You ought to understand one thing. Since the affair of Tabab the Khedive is
                        no longer 'persona grata' with the English. lo official circles they
                        reproach him with not having marched boldly against the Sultan in this
                        frontier affair, and, on the other hand, he is not forgiven for having gone
                        to Constantinople after the difficulty was solved, aud of having affirmed
                        that nothing was changed in the real-1 tions of Egypt with Turkey. </p>
                    <p>"Then the affair with Danish wai also came to widen the breach. His Highness
                        was much grieved that is subjects should bsvo been beaten and banged in bis
                        dame, without the English authorities taking the trouble to ask bim it be
                        wisbed to pardon them or not. </p>
                    <p>"Por two years in succession the Khedive has been present at a review of
                        Boglish troops before the Palace of Abdeen, on the 'ooonsion of King
                        Bdward's birthday: This year, in consequence of the feast of Bi Ramadan,
                        calling bim to Alexandria, he was not able to go to Cairo for the review.
                        This beetle was interpreted by many people as being premeditated. Por these
                        reasons has arisen the suspicion that the Khedive bad 'secretly subventioned
                        the Nationalist party and that he has advanced money for my new jurul. The
                        Levantines, wtrom all Egypt regarded as intruders, have profited by the
                        situation to make Lord Crc mer and the correspondent of the Times" believe
                        that I have been subventioned by the Kbe dive." </p>
                    <p>Kamel Parbs referred to the fact that he had published the names of the
                        shareholders in the "Egyptian Standard Company, wbieb number thirty two!
                        Saob publication prova, he declared the sincerity of the patriotic party.
                        The capital of the company was L.E. 20,000. Since their aim was reform" and
                        liberty, it was not surprising that øvory one sympathised with the movement
                        in Egypt. No Princos Concerned. </p>
                    <p>I asked the Director of the "Bgyptian Standard" whether some of the Princes
                        were not lengoed with his party. "Oh, no, absolutely no," be said. "I regret
                        it, for their sokos. Not one of them concern himself with politics. Perhaps
                        they would show themselves on the stage is Egypt had a Constitution, but,
                        with absolute power in the hands of Lord Cromer, they may fear for their
                        material interests." </p>
                    <p>Mustapha Kamel Pasha began to speak of the real objects of the "Egyptian
                        Standard." It will preach the autonomy of Egypt sooh as has been recógoised
                        by Imperial firmane and international treaties. It will claim a liberal
                        Constitution and protest against injustice. It will aim; also, to remove the
                        misunderstandings between Egyptians and Baropeans, will work for union, and
                        to sustain the oppressed of any religion or nationality. The Danishwai
                        affair and the accusation of fanaticism brought against the Egyptians has
                        showa, Mustapha Pasha reliever, the absolute necessity for such an organ,
                        which will be edited in English and French. </p>
                    <p>"May I ask whether your stockholders are Bgyptian or Turkisb ?" </p>
                    <p>"Our stockholders are Egyptian," said my interloontor. "They are landed
                        proprietor, eminent lawyers, business men, and retired Government
                        tanotionaries. A small minority are of Tarkisb origin, but they are, to day
                        absolutely Egyptian in their sympathies. It is absurd to represent as

                        body on my legi for a few minutes. My spine lost the discovery atom of
                        strength and was often as all as an iron bar. Palpitations robbed me of

                    <p>ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING.</p>
                    <p>The second ordinary general meeting of the Corporation of Western Egypt,
                        Limited, was beld on Saturday week at the registered office of the
                        corporation, 115, Victoria Street, Westminster, London, 8. W., Major-General
                        Sir John C. Ardagh, K.C.M.G., K.C.L.E, C.B., R. E (the chairman),
                        presiding.</p>
                    <p>The Secretary (Mr. Alfred W. Deering F.C.I.S.) read the notice convening the
                        meeting and the report of the auditore.</p>
                    <p>The Chairman said : In rising to move the adoption of the report and accounts
                        now in your bands. and wbpcb, I presume, you will accept as read, I will
                        express to you my true that the confidence hitherto accorded the board may
                        continue to be reposed in it now that i has been enlarged by the inclusion
                        of myself and Mr. Dames Longworth, very large shareholder, who has had great
                        experience in the management of landed estates, and who's on nails I have no
                        doubt will prove of great value to us in the management of the affairs of
                        the corporation. 'l be success attendant upon the promotion of land
                        companies in Egypt is one of the most striking of recent financial phenomena
                        ; but I beg you to note that, where As most of these companies—even the most
                        successful have paid a heavy price per feddan for the acquisition of their
                        lande, we, on the other hand, being early in the field, have secured our
                        immense grants, aggregating no lewe than 600,000 foddans of cultivable land,
                        at a price which, even if we omit altogether the important railway and
                        mineral rights also included in the purchase prior, does not work out at
                        more than 68. 7d. per fedda. In other worde, bad we been capitalised on the
                        same basis as the companies I refer to the necessary capital would have ran
                        into many millions of poonde A glance at our balance sheet will show that
                        the cost of our lands being almost a nominal amount per fedden, we have been
                        able to devote large sums to railway construction, and 80 secare a tangible
                        asset of very great valoo-, value greatly enhanced by the Government
                        guarantee of interest in connection with it. I think you must have felt, in
                        reading the report, that an eminently satisfactory amount of work has been
                        affected during the year under review. The main difficulties of construction
                        of the railway, which is so vitally Necessary for the purpose of placing oor
                        extensive lands within easy reach of the Nile Valley, have been-800ce sfolly
                        surmounted, and a very rapid rate of construction may now be looked for.
                        Indeed, when the manufacturers have given delivery of the sleepers for use
                        in connection with the rails already on the spot, and there have been leid,
                        only rome 15 kilomètres (less than 10 miles) will require to be covered in
                        order to arrive at the oasis itself. The balance of the permanent way
                        material will go forward early in the new year, and we may confidently
                        assume that within a few months the line will completely laid. As you are
                        aware, all the rolling stock, with the exception of the passenger coachee,
                        bas already been delivered, the total sum actually spent on railway
                        construction being close upon £100,000. </p>
                    <p>You will realise that the necessary railway expenditure is well laid out when
                        you reflect upon the importance of the line in its bearing upon the lands op
                        in process of development. This completion of the railway will render their
                        lands saleable at prices which should give an immense return upon the
                        capital ex: pendedama retro, too, practically assured when the oasis is
                        removed by the railway and sales of the now lands are commenced. You have,
                        doubtless, read with interest the statement on land values made by Mr.
                        Beadnell and printed at the end of the report. This statement, based upon
                        expert knowledge, shows that we had greatly underrated the saleable value of
                        the lande. He gives, as a confervative estimate, the value of the first
                        class land at £30 £10 an acre, and £15 per acre and upwards to the
                        remainder. The cost of irrigation Under normal conditions will be some £5
                        per feddan, and the difference between the cost of irrigation and the price
                        of sale will be the pet profit to the corporation. Our lands, are you are
                        aware, are irrigated by artesian water, of which there is an abundant
                        supply, and their valpe, both for coreal props in general and for
                        cotton-growing in particular, bas been sufficiently evidenced by the
                        operations of the past season, the operations having conclusively </p>

                        being "specially celebrated for their fertility." The oases themselves,

                        several ce from the rest of Egypt by the Libyan desert. They cover a very
                        large area ; indeed, the operations of the corporation, including the
                        railway, comprise an area of no less than 74,000 square miles. The amount
                        expended to data on lard development is some £40,000. In addition to these
                        lands, wbpcb alone would more than justify the existence of the corporation,

                        preparatory to export, are in progress. The variation aluminous and ochreous
                        beds which have been located are being carefully surveyed, in order that,
                        when the means of transit are to hani, no time may be lost in utilising to
                        the fullest extent these important gou roes of revenue. I need bard's remark
                        that door unique position in relation to the oases will give us a practical
                        monopoly of the whole of the trade of this portion of Egypt.</p>
                    <p>Our general expenditure from the time of the inception of the corporation,
                        less recipe, shows the modest sum of about £6,000 only to be written cft
                        prior to the declaration of a dividend-a figure of comparative
                        insignificance when the revenue 30000 DE is opened in the near future since
                        it is probable that the sale of one year's grants may repay the whole of the
                        paid up capital of the corporation. This remark brings me to thy believe

                        progressed, the board have given careful consideration to the matter of the
                        issue of further capital and I may take you into our oo diffidence and
                        inform you that they consider the time almost ripe for making this issue in
                        the best interests of the corporation, and consider there is every prospect
                        of the 1980e being attended with complete success. They trust to perfect
                        their arrangements for this 1980e very early in the new year, meantime
                        pressing on the work of construction as rapidly as possible. To som op the
                        situation, I may describe your affsirgia, being in a most promising ag
                        condition, with every prospect of terminating with more than ordinary
                        promptitude that initial stage inseparable from the conduct of operations of
                        this magnitude, and we have every reason to believe that the financial
                        reward to 08-Isay ng because the board are, I think I may say, individually
                        as interested as any persons in the 8000089 of this undertaking, bonding
                        between them many thousands of shares – the financial reward to us will be
                        fally equal to our expectations, and will amply justify our mutual
                        confidence in the enterprise. I unfi de alley trust that when next we meet

                    <head>EGYPTOLOGICAL NOTES.</head>
                    <p>HELIOPOLIS.</p>
                    <p>The Belgian Government has sent the well known Egyptologist, M. Capart to
                        Egypt to make investigations at Heliopolis. Th. tion of the mission is
                        probably to find the necropolis of sacred animals, the site of which is
                        unknown. For the researches made thus far there have not proved altogether
                        satisfactory, possibly because they were incomplete. Pi-Ra, or Oo, was the
                        Egyptian name of Heliopolis, which was a Greek translation. The pity which
                        Surrounded the temple stood a little to the north or Marieb ; the obelisk,
                        still standing, is a vestigo of it, and the square of ruins around are
                        supposed to mark the bulwarks of the city. The temple of Rs was the most
                        spoient and most celebrated ; the earliest Pharaohs built, road thither; and
                        their departure from Memphis was signalled to the priests by a beacon fire,
                        on the wall of the capital, which was reposted by a wateber on the Mokattam
                        hille-the first known practical 080 of telegraphy, several thousand years
                        before the Bioge of Troy. </p>
                    <p>The temple, wbieb Herodotus describes and Strabo mentioned, was enlarged by
                        successive Pharaohs, like that of The 98. It was approached by an avenue of
                        sphinx rand till the 18th century there was a sphinx of rod granite, but
                        this has disappeared. The obelisks have also departed. One stands on the
                        Hippodrome of Constantinople, another adorne Reme, that which remains at
                        Heliopolis boars the cartopobe of Operation, and is 4,700 years old. The
                        temple probably suffered by the Hyksos invasion, out of many others, Cam.
                        buses giving it the coup de grace by burning it. When the Child Jesus flag
                        thither 865 idols were said to have fallen into the dust. Bat what tended
                        more than anything else to obliterate it was the one the neighbouring
                        villages made of it as a quarry. </p>
                    <p>The god to be first worshipped at Heliopolis was Atama, the sun before its
                        rising, then came the worship of R2, the body of the sun, Aton, the solar
                        disorder, and Sba, son of Rs. Apie was also adored, as also the ball Maevis,
                        the incarnation of Bs. </p>
                    <p>The Phoenix, flying thither every five hundredth year, alighted on a pyre of
                        myrrh and fragrant wood, to rise again on the third day, and go Bast. </p>
                    <p>The importance of the college of priests of Heliopolis was due to their
                        profound knowledge of astronomy, that formed 80 large part of Egyptian
                        religion-, knowledge which surprises even modern scientists. The fame of
                        Heliopolis went beyond Egypt and among others who came thither to seek
                        wisdom was Plato. </p>
                    <p>Mapetho, the historian to whom we owe the table of the Bgyptian King, was a
                        priest of Heliopolis. The discovery therefore of the necropoli of the
                        priests and of the ball Movie is of utmost importance. Professor Sciaparelli
                        has been long engaged in attempting to solve this problem, but no more than
                        two empty sarcophagi ot the ball Mnevis have been around. </p>

                    <p> Lieutenant G. B. Hobart, York and Lan. caster Regiment, bas been formally
                        seconded for service with the Khedive's Army. He joined the York and
                        Lancasters in August, 1900, and for a considerable time was attached to the
                        Chinese Regiment at Wei-bai-wei. </p>
                    <p>Lieutenant E. W. MacDonald, King's Own Scottish Borderer, bas been promoted
                        to the rank of captain, vice Mayor S. Campbell Johnston, promoted. Captain
                        Macdonald was appointed to "my Vuole 'lobby's" old regiment in May, 1898,
                        and served with the let Battalion in the Kharki War, including the
                        operations in Orange Free State, the actions of Paardeberg, Poplar Grove,
                        Karree Siding. Vet River, Zand Riveri; in the Transvaal, the actions of
                        Johannesburg, Pretoria, Zilikat's Nek, Vlak Ton tien, and other affairs east
                        and west of the Transvaal capital (Queen's medal with three clasps, King's
                        medal with two clasps). </p>
                    <p>Over a dozen subalterns of the Army Service Corps have just received their
                        triple stars, amongst them being Lieutenant P. R. Napier, who has been
                        latterly stationed at Khartoum. Captain Napier entered the Scottish Rifles a
                        few months before the outb:the outbreak of the Boer War, and was attached to
                        the Army Service Corps in the campaign of 1901-02, and was transferred to
                        the latter corps at the convolution of the war (Queen's modal with two olarp
                        ). </p>
                    <p>One of the most extraordinary features of the present administration is the
                        deferring of shipbuilding until the Hague Conference meets t otter its
                        well-woro platitudes. If the counsel of the Cor ference come to bought,
                        England will fios herself lamentably behind in war ship building, owing to
                        the fact that Germany, our future low, and France, not to mention Roggia,
                        are feverishly parking on their schemes. That the efficiency of our first,
                        and practically ruly line of defence sboa'd await on the delibera ios of an
                        irresponsible body is in itself a condemnation of the policy pursued by the
                        Government in the name of economy.</p>

                    <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                    <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers the
                        accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by which
                        they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange them as
                        accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that none of them
                        are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home there are several
                        things to be considered. To begin with there is the difference in climate
                        between Egypt and the various points at which you may arrive in Europe.</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                        January may be a little warmer than the Riviera and possibly not so warm as
                        Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly warm
                        than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too early in
                        the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is perfect. The warmest
                        place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                    <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent at
                        sea, and we therefore subjoin a list shewing the time occupied on each of
                        the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of Europe.</p>
                    <p><cb n="3"/></p>
                    <p>They are as follows:—</p>
                    <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth, Southhampton,
                        London or Liverpool—occupy about 14 days. The short ones are as
                        follows:—</p>

                    <p>The steamers of the P.&amp; O., the Egyptian Mail S.S,. Co., North German
                        Lloyd, Orient, and Messageries Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor,
                        British India, Bibby and Henderson Lines are also excellent, and their
                        steamers are largely patronised by travellers to Egypt.</p>
                    <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to Alexandria,
                        without change (3 hours). That to Port Said can now be made without change
                        in 4 ½ hours.</p>
                    <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                        Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German Levant
                        line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p>The quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp; O. Brindisi express
                        from Port Said, by the Egyptian Mail S.S. Co., from Alexandria to Marseilles
                        and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna express from Alexandria.</p>
                    <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little luggage
                        is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several good and
                        responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed charge to
                        deliver packages to any address in Europe. The Egyptian Mail S.S. Co., have
                        also made arrangements whereby luggage can be collected and sent to any
                        address.</p>
                    <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by the
                        fast Mail Steamers "Osiris" and "Isis" to Brindisi. One of these leaves Port
                        Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the Indian <cb n="6"
                        />mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                    <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                        attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats" having
                        been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to Brindisi.
                        If you are going straight through to England you will find the train waiting
                        at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without changing. It has complete
                        arrangements for sleeping and eating on board, and you should arrive in
                        London on the fifth day from leaving Port Said.</p>

                    <head>SICILY.</head>
                    <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s steamers which
                        leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to TAORMENA, one
                        of the most charming and popular places on the island. <hi rend="italic"
                            >Giardini</hi> is the station at which to alight, and the drive up to
                        Taormina is most delightful, occupying about one hour. In and around the
                        town is much to interest the visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but
                        restored under the Romans. CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent of
                        Etna, and here also is a fine Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and Saracenic
                        remains that are found all over the island, are an endless sources of
                        pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting history, having been a Greek city,
                        which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C. 413, and taken by the Romans in
                        B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb is to be seen. The cathedral
                        was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with about 300,000 inhabitants,
                        is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a delightful climate. Much of
                        interest is to be found in this fine city. <hi rend="italic">The Palazzo
                            Reale</hi> is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of <hi
                            rend="italic">S. Giovannia degli Eremiti</hi> with its picturesque
                        cloisters. The Cathedral, Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal
                        Park are also worth a visit.</p>

                    <head>CENTRAL ITALY.</head>
                    <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every Wednesday
                        during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3 days.</p>
                    <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino Co.'s
                        steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave it without
                        wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely places on its
                            bay—<hi rend="italic">Castellamare</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                            >Sorrento</hi>. The small steamer that takes you to Sorrento [you can
                        drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                    <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can will
                        devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and interesting
                        portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are too well-known
                        to need comment here.</p>
                    <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five hours
                        brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent admiring the
                            <hi rend="italic">City of Flowers</hi> and its surrounding country. In
                        Florence itself the churches and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst
                        the local promenades and excursions should not be omitted. <hi rend="italic"
                            >The Cascine</hi> is the most attractive and fashionable promenade in
                        Florence, whilst the <hi rend="italic">Viale dei Colli</hi>, one of the
                        finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago, goes winding up through the
                        hills a distance of four miles. The most delightful excursion outside
                        Florence is that to <hi rend="italic">Vallombrosa</hi>, with its <hi
                            rend="italic">Monastery</hi> 3,300 feet above the sea level. This is
                        made first by ordinary train from Florence to <hi rend="italic">St.
                            Ellero</hi>, thence by cog-wheel railway to <hi rend="italic"
                            >Saltino</hi>. The ascent through groves of oaks takes an hour, and most
                        striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                    <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; here there is a fine
                        Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night should if
                        possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile at
                        sunset.</p>
                    <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near Pisa
                        and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient half-way
                        house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable and the air
                        and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                    <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy, with
                        the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European cities and
                        a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and deliciously cool
                        breezes from the surrounding mountains and the Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                    <p>The patriarchal home of Italy's most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                        gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings, are a
                        constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn in Genoa.
                        Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches containing exquisite
                        marble columns and historical paintings, and the incomparable Campo Santo
                        filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                    <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                    <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                        Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful windows
                        illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and the monumental
                        cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                    <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                        SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal springs,

                    <head>NORTHERN ITALY (Continued) and The ITALIAN LAKES.</head>
                    <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                        delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                        vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange; no horse, cart, carriage or
                        bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every turn. The
                        approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any other sea port.
                        The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of the sea. No hills
                        behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of Campaniles appear above
                        the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering town rises like a fairy mirage
                        out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                    <p>Going northwards from <hi rend="italic">Milan</hi> you make the tour of the
                        beautiful Italian lakes.</p>
                    <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in one-and-a-quarter
                        hours by train by way of Monza.</p>
                    <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is very
                        beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                        enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come <hi rend="italic"
                            >Tremezzo</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Cadenabbia</hi>, and <hi rend="italic"
                            >Menaggio</hi> with the prettily-situated town of <hi rend="italic"
                            >Bellaggio</hi> opposite. The walk from <hi rend="italic">Tremezzo</hi>
                        along the shore of the lake to <hi rend="italic">Menaggio</hi> is most
                        enjoyable. A steam tram runs from <hi rend="italic">Menaggio</hi> to <hi
                            rend="italic">Porlezza</hi> on Lake Lugano in three-quarters of an hour,
                        then steamer to Lugano in two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                    <p>LUGANO is some 20 miles from Como and reached by train in one-and-a-half
                        hours. It has a population of 10,000 people and is charmingly situated on
                        the Lake of Lugano, amidst lovely Italian scenery. Around it rise M. San
                        Salvatore, M. de Caprino.and M. Generoso.</p>
                    <p>LOCARNO may be reached by rail from Bellinzona in forty minutes. This pretty
                        town, situated at the top of Lake Maggiore, has a mild climate and is an
                        excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated above the
                        town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings, "Entombment,"
                        by Ciseri, and 'Tho Flight into Egypt," by Bramantion.</p>

                    <head>A BROKEN-DOWN SYSTEM.</head>
                    <p>This is a condition (or disease) to which doctors give many names, but which
                        few of them really understand. It it simply weakness—a break-down, as it
                        were, of the vital forces that sustain the system. No matter what may be its
                        causes (for they are almost numberless), its symptoms are much the same; the
                        more prominent being sleeplessness, sense of prostration or weariness,
                        depression of spirits and want of energy for all the ordinary affairs of
                        life. Now, what alone is absolutely essential in all such cases is increased
                        vitality—vigour--</p>
                    <p>VITAL STRENGTH &amp; ENERGY</p>
                    <p>to throw off these morbid feelings, and experience proves that as night
                        succeeds the day this may be more certainly secured by a course of the
                        celebrated life-reviving tonic</p>
                    <p>THERAPION No.3</p>

                        conditions, in either sex; and it is difficult to imagine a case of disease
                        or derangement, whose main features are those of debility, that will not be
                        speedily and permanently benefited by this never-failing recuperative
                        essence, which is destined to cast into oblivion everything that had
