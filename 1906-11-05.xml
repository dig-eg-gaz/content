                    <p>GOLD FOR EGYPT</p>
                    <p>Commenting on the monetary situation, the "Statist" says that there continues
                        to be a very remarkable difference of opinion amongst those in the best
                        position to judge</p>
                    <p>as to whether the Egyptian demand for gold is or is not ended. There appears
                        no doubt that money is already flowing back from the provinces to Cairo, and
                        a great many of the best authorities are of opinion that now the return flow
                        will be so large as completelyto stop the imports of gold. On the other
                        hand, a high authority is of opinion that the demand is not ended; that
                        although money may now be expected to return to Cairo in considerable
                        amounts, further imports of gold will continue to be made for an indefinite
                        time. But the authority does not venture upon any estimate as to the amount
                        likely to be taken. It would seem from all this that the demand, which was
                        caused by the earliness of the cotton crop, and the desire of the growers to
                        take immediate advantage of the very high prices prevailing, is really now
                        practically satisfied-at all events will be satisfied by the middle of next
                        week. On the other hand, it is alleged that hoarding is going on on a very
                        considerable scale. Hoarding is characteristic of all countries in a
                        backward state of development.It is universal in the East, and Egypt is
                        still an Eastern country. Therefor, it is quite possible that more gold may
                        be taken for Egypt, although the majority of those in a position to judge
                        think that we may regard the demand as practically ended. </p>
                    <p>It is remarkable that France has contributed so little to supply the Egyptian
                        demand. Obviously it would be cheaper and more convenient to get gold from
                        France than from England.</p>

                    <head>Plaque Investigation.</head>
                    <p>The Advisory Committee appointed by the Lister Institute of Preventive
                        Medicine, and financed by the Indian Government, have recently published the
                        reports of their Working Commission, which has been conducting operations in
                        the Plague Research Laboratory, Parel, Bombay. Up to the present, the
                        Commission has mainly concerned itself with the epizootic spread of plague
                        among rats, and the means by which the disease may be communicated from that
                        animal to man. The reports which have now been issued must be regarded as of
                        a more or less preliminary nature, as it will be impossible for the
                        Commission to give their final conclusions until the completion of their
                        observations, which in many cases must be extended over a period of twelve
                        months. The reports bring to light, says the "Globe," several facts of great
                        interest; it has been ascertained that outbreaks of plague in India are in
                        the great majority of cases preceded by an outbreak of disease among rays,
                        and as there is abundance of evidence to show that this is the chief cause
                        of plague epidemics it will at once be obvious that a knowledge of its
                        causes and history is of paramount importance to us. It must be remembered
                        that in India the rat lives chiefly in dwelling houses, and that the
                        opportunities of the plague bacillus being transferred from the rat to man
                        are, therefor, of constant occurrence. There are several ways in which the
                        infection may be communicated, either by the rats soiling human food, or by
                        parasites which infest the rats, and will also feed on man, or through
                        direct poisoning from rat bites. Of these three causes the Commission has
                        come to the conclusion that by far the greatest danger arises from the bites
                        of parasites, and a series of experiments of a most intricate nature have
                        been made which tends to uphold their opinion.</p>

                    <p> St. Mark's Church.</p>
                    <p>The selection of sacred music rendered yesterday in St. Mark's Church,
                        Alexandria, at Mätins and Bronscng reflected great credit both on the choir
                        and organist. In the morning the Anthem "No Shadows Yonder" (from A. R.
                        Gaul's Holy City)' was sung with much tasta, and feeling. The tenor solo was
                        rendered with good effect by Mr. Purvis, who has a fine tenor voice. The
                        Evensong rejection "Nightfall" from "Ruth," by the same composer, was
                        excellently sung. The choir numbered nineteen voices.</p>

                    <p>The Greek Government has recently voted a subscription for the erection of a
                        School of Languages in Athens. The advantage of knowing the principal modern
                        languages is acknowledged everywhere. Thanks to the existence of the Berlitz
                        Schools in Cairo (Sharia Kamel) and in Alexandria (Rosette), Egypt has been
                        able to keep pace with European countries in the march of progress.

                    <p>Reception at Mansourah</p>
                    <p>By the hearty cheers given for Mustapha Pasna Maher, the active and
                        sympathetic Moudir, in response to his speech welcoming the squadron to
                        Mansonrah, and equally hearty cheers were also given for Mr. F.T. Murdoch,
                        the British consular agent.</p>
                    <p>In the evening the officers were entertained at dinner by the Moudir, and
                        later on the party adjourned to the Mansourah Club, which took this occasion
                        to inaugrate its new premises with a ball at which "All Mansourah" was
                        present.</p>
                    <p>Dancing commenced at 9:45, and at midnight an excellent supper was served in
                        one of the large saloons of the club. The Moudir again welcomed the guests
                        in a few well chosen words, and informed them that the whole of the
                        population of Mansourah both European and native had "united together" to
                        welcome them. Major Pateraon, on behalf of himself, brother officers, and
                        men of the squadron, returned thanks. Dancing then recommenced, and it was 3
                        a.m. before the Khedivial Hymn and "God Save the King" brought a most
                        pleasant evening to a close.</p>
                    <p>On Saturday afternoon a "tournament" was held at the Mansourah Tennis Club,
                        at which the officers were present, tea being provided by the president of
                        the club, Mr. Murdoch. In the evening Mr. Murdoch also entertained the
                        officers to dinner, the Moudir and a few other British residents also being
                        present.</p>
                    <p>On Sunday morning, after a march through the town, the detachment proceeded
                        on its journey, carrying with it the "hearty good wishes" of the entire
                        population of Mansourah.</p>
                    <p>In commenting on the Menoufieh maize incident reported in our issue of
                        Saturday, "AlMokattam" says: -"A few months ago, when the Denishwai affair
                        took place, the fellaheen of Menoufish did not fear the Inniskilling
                        Dragoons, whom they now welcome with open arms. Why? The answer is simple.
                        It was the anti-occupation papers which stirred up the ignorant fellaheen at
                        that time, when some of them published statements that 80 thousand Turkish
                        troops were at the gate of Egypt, that some other battalions were in
                        Alexandria; that Germany was co-operating with Turkey to make English
                        withdraw from Egypt; that Lord Cromer had been abused by his countrymen and
                        was to be dismissed, and that there was a National Party in Egypt, whose
                        leader had gone to England and convinced the great men of that country to
                        agree to his national aspirations, etc. But when the hue and cry of those
                        papers was suppressed by the circumstances which contradicted their fatal
                        utterances the previous effects of their threats to the British Occupation
                        were removed from the minds of the people, especially those who are now
                        welcoming and entertaining the British troops at Menonfish.</p>

                    <head>CAIRO ASSAULT CASE.</head>
                    <p>CONCLUDING EVIDENCE.</p>
                    <p>The following is a continuation of the report of the case, Waldberg v.
                        Bennett, in H.B.M.'s Consular Court, Cairo, which was partly telephoned by
                        our Cairo Correspondent on Saturday: -</p>
                    <p>Maître Carton de Wiart continued:</p>
                    <p>You asked for advertisements and begged for scraps of news at my office; but
                        I never had the slightest conversation with you.</p>
                    <p>Plaintiff: Did you make any communication to me at your house?</p>
                    <p>Me Carton de Wiart: You wished to enter my house, but came no further than my
                        garden. You then spoke to me till I cut you short, and as I turned my back
                        on you I told you to take care what you were about.</p>
                    <p>Plaintiff had no further questions to ask the witness. Mr. Bennett was then
                        cross-examined. He said he had seen the envelopes and the papers with marked
                        passages on Me. Carton de Wiart's desk. He thought this was a case of
                        "chantage." He telephoned to the plaintiff to call. He did not know whether
                        the plaintiff answered. In the afternoon he came to the office about 3:10
                        p.m. and found plaintiff waiting outside. Plaintiff said : "I have an
                        appointment with Maitre Carton de Wiart." He replied, "No; I sent for you,"
                        and then went into the office, telling him to follow. </p>
                    <p>"He stayed outside, so I called him in again. Pushed him out of the office
                        door and him two blows on the side of the face with my hand open, or at
                        least not clenched. At the entrance to the house I, literally and
                        metaphorically, kicked him out. He used foul language, which I need not
                        repeat, called a cab, and drove off.</p>
                    <p>Plaintiff: There was no one in the room when you assaulted me ? - No; no one
                        on the European side. (Witness then explained the arrangement of the rooms
                        in the office).</p>
                    <p>Was anyone on the native side ? - I cannot see round corners.</p>
                    <p>Did you say you would pay people to thrash me ?</p>
                    <p>What I said was, to the best of my recollection, to the effect that you would
                        be thrashed if I had to pay for it to avoid dirtying my own hands on
                        you.</p>
                    <p>Did you give a garbled account of this to the newspapers (Plaintiff here
                        denounced the "Morning News").- I did not go to them. I met the Editor of
                        the "Egyptian Morning News" at the Opera and gave him an answer to his
                        questions a brief outline of the facts.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Le Breton then summed up for the defence. He pointed out that Mr. Bennett
                        had committed no actual assault till bitten by plaintiff. That if any doubt
                        remained as to the character of the Editor of "The Oriental Truth" he would
                        beg the Court to suspend judgement till further witnesses were called. In
                        any case plaintiff's conduct justified severe reprisals.</p>
                    <p>Captain Waldberg then addressed the Court in what appeared to be an
                        Anglo-German dialect eked out by violent gesticulation. He declared that he
                        repudiated all accusations of blackmail. "He exbected shustice," and
                        concluded with the following striking paroration : "I don't want no damages
                        because a Ladin Amurrican never demands money combensation (Hilarity). Wod I
                        wan' is my glasses and the dwendy pounds if they have found them."</p>
                    <p>Captain Waldberg's command of the English language is so slight that we feel
                        anxious to learn who was the author of some of the passages that have
                        appeared from time to time in "The Oriental Truth," which show a better
                        knowledge of English than the Captain appears to possess.</p>

                    <p>Yesterday morning the Khedivial train, in which his Highness was traveling to
                        Mariout, had a narrow escape from wreckage. Shortly before the passage of
                        the Khedive's train a goods train running along the line dropped a buffer,
                        which lay on the line near Nusah bridge. But happily the Khedivial train
                        through striking the buffer, only received a slight jerk and it was not even
                        necessary to stop it.</p>

                    <p>"A CHINESE HONEYMOON."</p>
                    <p>"A Chinese Honeymoon" proved to be a better pieve than some of us expected,
                        though without anything bery striking. As far as the company was concerned,
                        it was quite well given. Good parts also were taken by Miss Leslie and Mr.
                        Percival, neither of whom have been given much to do so far. Miss Leslie was
                        the Princess Soo Soo, and rang very well, as did Mr. Percival as the
                        Emperor. Both were a little "stiff" as far as acting went. We missed several
                        old friends: Mr. Smith, Miss O'connor, and Miss Morra were all three absent.
                        Miss Probyn was the hotel maid of all work, and really distinguished
                        herself. "I want to be a lady" was admirably given by her. The best songs
                        were "Chin Chin Ching a ling" (or whatever it was) by Miss Leslie, "The
                        highly respectable very delectable Emperor" by Mr. Percival, the "Alagirl"
                        by Miss Corlass (who, to our joy, was once more in great form), and "The
                        Happy Land" by Mr. Cole. This last song was the gem of the evening. Mr. Cole
                        and Miss. Corlass had a most excellent duet, "The Chinese Honeymoon."
                        Indeed, all through they played admirably together as the Pineapple couple.
                        Miss Corlass had also a most effective dance, masked. It was a very hideous
                        mask, we must say, but we all knew her at once by her steps. Mr. Haydn as
                        the Lord Chancellor, and Mr. Lester as the Lord High Admiral (looked like
                        Mr. W.D. Night Watchman) were both Major's conducter was fairly good as the
                        late; but hardly up to the won't even meet respond to his appeals.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Attwell was not singing well. The part and the play seemed uncongenial to
                        him. It has its good points, but is really rather an absurd production with
                        its silly little hits at society, - the song about tact, for example, Miss
                        Corlass wasted much time and trouble in emphasizing points and words not
                        worth her notice. Otherwise her acting and dancing were delightful. Mr.
                        Harry Cole was at his greatest, and the stage as well as the audience were
                        kept laughing all the time. His "Indian Club" dance, improvised with his
                        torn coat, brought down the house, and Miss Corlass too. His phrenology
                        lecture and his palmistry were beyond praise. Miss Morra and Mr. Lester were
                        both quite good in their various parts: the cranium song and the "Fellow who
                        might" were prettily given. Miss Morra had also a very attractive duet with
                        Mr. Haydn - "Love Galloping," or some such title. Mr. Haydn's song about the
                        "Dandy Man" was excellent. Miss Nina Leslie again had a fairly prominent
                        part, and did it full justice; the dress suited her quite well.</p>
                    <p>One of the prettiest things of all was the octet in the second act. The
                        ladies' dresses were delightful, and at least on of them - if not one and
                        aff indeed - was much admired. But unfortunately the music grew so bad
                        towards the end that we could but long for the curtain.</p>

                        fo the clays from Khargeh Oasis sent him for assay and fire test :-</p>
                    <p>"I have pleasure to forward you..a fired sample of the two clays treated at
                        the different temperatures as suitable for salt glazed vitrified drain pipes
                        and Staffordshire blue bricks. The results in both cases are so admirable in
                        every respect that they deserve the very careful attention of your
                        directors. The clay No. 889 B, as you will see, takes the salt glaze very
                        well and produces ware quite equal to that of the best English make. The
                        clay No. 889 A will produce the metallic blue bricks such as come from the
                        best Staffordshire brick works without any difficulty.….I may add that the
                        clay No. 889 B, salt glazed as shown, is suitable for making all kinds of
                        salt-glazed pottery ware such as is now made at Lambeth, Bristol, and

                    <p>A.H.S. EXHIBITION AT SAN STEFANO.</p>
                    <p>The ninth Chryanthemum Show of the Alexandria Horticultural Society, which
                        was held on Saturday and yesterday at San Stefano, was a great success. The
                        groups seem to become larger every year, and the individual flowers more
                        attractive. So great was the number of exhibits that every nook and corner
                        of the Casino was full of plants and the only way of staging the collections
                        arranged by the native gardeners was to put them with the vegetables. It
                        seems clear that next year it will be absolutely necessary to erect a tent
                        outside.</p>
                    <p>The most remarkable feature of all was not the groups arranged by the
                        European gardeners, from whom we can expect taste, but the progress which
                        the native gardeners made in staging large groups. Some few years ago such a
                        thing was almost impossible; and it was only ten years ago that the society
                        began to especially encourage the growth of chrysanthemums. When it started
                        the flowers were small, and there was no encouragement to import new
                        varieties. Now the flowers are equal to those of Europe, and one only had to
                        look at the more important groups attentively to see that they contained
                        many of Calvat's latest varieties. Perhaps the most beautiful of all which
                        has just been imported is the little twisted like characteristic with the
                        form rather like a yellow Madame Carnot, or a J.C. Warren. That in our
                        opinion was the most beautiful flower of the Show. It was staged by Mr.
                        Zervudachi.</p>
                    <p>Another novelty, for Egypt at least, the Tokyo, a werid looking flower, white
                        in colour, with a strange second flower coming out of the centre, was shown
                        by Toussoun Pasha. The small white chrysanthomum which was so to be really
                        year in Mr. Zervudachi's group but was not efficient every exhibit this year
                        high chrysanthemums. It stress its actors the whole length of the ball
                        room.</p>
                    <p>The competition for the smaller groups of a hundred plants was very keen.
                        Baron Felix de Meusaca, who is beginning to take great interest in
                        chrysanthemums, obtained the first and Yehia Pasha the second prize. The
                        competition for pots with fifteen blooms should be encouraged; they are
                        effective and well grown, and present a pleasing effect for decorative
                        purposes. But what one who is interested in chrysanthemums wish to know was,
                        who would gain the 10 objet d'art, which was offered by Baron Felix de
                        Menasce for twenty-four good blooms. The competitors had a long table apart,
                        and the blooms were so large that they filled all the vacant space. There is
                        no doubt that they were much admired by the public, and that Mr. Zervudachi
                        well merited the first prize. Amongst his collection he had also the best
                        chrysanthemum in the Show. There were so many competitors in the other
                        classes that the committee decided to give extra prizes. The whole room was
                        filled with enormous blooms, which seem to get larger every year, and
                        consequantly it becomes more difficult for competitors to be certain winning
                        prizes. </p>
                    <p>The Municipality had a room apart. Their group, however, was hors concours;
                        but the committee decided to request the Municipality to be allowed to give
                        Mr. Monfront the silver medal for the way the flowers were arranged and the
                        manner in which they had been cultivated. Mr. E.C. Zervudachi showed us fine
                        collection of Oattelaya labiata Autumnalia which were placed on a table in
                        the centre of the ballroom.</p>
                    <p>The exhibitors of vegetables and fruit were not numerous; the only one of
                        importance was Mrs. Grafton, who staged some fine bananas, anona, and other
                        fruits.</p>
                    <p>The attendance on Saturday was good and included the leading members of the
                        British and other European colonies; yesterday there must have been nearly
                        two thousand people present.</p>
                    <p>The Horticultural Society and its committee are to be cordially congratulated

                            commissioned Mr. Root to declare publicly that Mr. Hearst's election
                            would bring injury and discredit to honest labour and honest
                            capital.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Root denounced Mr. Hearst as a deliberate demagogue, an exploiter of
                            sensationalism, an apologist for the murder of President Mac Kinley, an
                            upstirrer of useless discontent. After Mr. Root's speech the betting in

                            Progressive candidates. The Liberal Press, while attributing the defeat
                            to lavish expenditure in the past, says that the Moderates made use of
                            Conservative political machinery in the attempt to re-capture London.
                            They admit that the public dread of Socialism is induced by the

                        <p>The Conservative Press considers the result of the election indicative of
                            growing dissatisfaction with the Government, and warns Unionists that
                            the call to arms may come when least expected.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Balfour, speaking in the City, said that the results sbowed that the
                            country was beginning to see through the platitudinous pretences, by
                            means of which tbe Government obtained office.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Arquitb, speaking at Manchester, said that the Government intended,
                            without delay, to endow the Orange River Colony to the fullest extent
                            with self-government. He criticised very strongly the reconstitution of
                            the Education Bill by the House of Lords, and said that the Government
                            would not yield if it could, and could not if it would. (Router)</p></div>

                    <p>This match was played at Gheziret Badrane on Friday, 2nd instant, before a
                        very good attendance. Neither side were at full strength, but the game was
                        exceedingly fast and brimful of interest from start to finish. The Railway
                        men won the toes and elected to defend the Shoubra goal. The 'Medicoes' had
                        slightly the best of the opening exchanges, but Hayes and Windsor were very
                        safe at back.</p>
                    <p>The Institute forwards soon found their feet, and some very exciting play
                        took place. Hayes played a brilliant game at left back for the home team,
                        and time after time pulled up the visitors' forwards. Just before the
                        interval Captain Bostock got right througb the backs and a score seemed
                        certain. But Stephenson was equal to the occasion, and brought off a fine
                        save. Half time soon arrived with the score sheet blank.</p>
                    <p>The second half was even faster than the first, and but for some determined
                        play by both pairs of backs both goals would have been penetrated more than
                        once. The two goalkeepers brought off several good saves, Stephenson on two
                        occasions saving when a goal seemed inevitable. As time went on both sides
                        exerted themselves to the utmost to score, but the deciding goal did not
                        come till the last minute of the game. Newton then scored by slipping the
                        ball past Bevan, who had just managed to keep out a shot from Wheal. The
                        game ended a few seconds later in victory for the Institute by the only goal
                        scored in the match.</p>
