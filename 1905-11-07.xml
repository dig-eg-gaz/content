                        190ft. THE AGRICULTURAL SHOW. We learn that it is proposed henceforth to
                        hold tho Agricultural Show at Cairo biennially iiuhad of annually, aod the
                        out Show girea bp the Khedirial Agricultural Society et Gheeireh will take
                        place ,in the spring of 1907. It is felt the headquarters of the K.A.S. that
                        the annual agricultural shows done their work of educating the cultivators;
                        the days are past when the native farmrs assumed that had seen the last of
                        is cow when sent it to compete and the majority of ex- hibitors soonted the
                        idea that they would ever see the prises offered exoept in the society’s
                        noticea. The oaltivator has now fall oon- fidenoe in the integrity of the
                        Agrioaltnral Sooiety and in the jastioe of its awards, be has also learned
                        to apply to it for assistance against inseot pests and for advioe as to the
                        proper methods of cultivation; and the forma- tion of provincial branches of
                        the sooiety with agricultural experts as secretaries, which has been began,
                        will, in course of time, furnish eeoh moadirieh with a centre to whioh all
                        oan apply for advioe and for certain forms of assistance. It is an open
                        secret that the work at headquarters has often been made unduly heavy by the
                        neoessity of holding yearly shows, and it is now proposal to hold provinoial
                        exhi- bitions in alternate years. Mansoarah and the Fayoam set the example
                        this year. In 1906 one exhibition will be bald in Lower and one in Upper
                        Egypt, and to judge from the success of this year’s exhibitions, both shoald
                        be largely attended and have valuable educational results. It may be argued
                        that these results will be eqaalty well scoured oy an exhibition at
                        Ghezireh, but this conten- tion does not allow for the foot that large
                        numbers of the smaller proprietors do not and oannot visit the Cairo shows,
                        and that it is precisely this class whioh the Khedivial Agri- cultural
                        Sooiety wishes to interest and to inspire with up-to-date ideas on the
                        subject of cultiva- tion. As to the exhibits of machinery, it is muoh to be
                        regretted that any firms should have found the notice given them of the
                        post- ponement of the Agricultural Show at Cairo till 1907 too short, but if
                        the matter be con- sidered from a general point of view it will be
                        recognised that the exhibitors of agricultural maohinery will not be the
                        sufferers by the ohange. ‘The very transport of their machines to Cairo and
                        their installation and protection at the exhibitions occupied the time of
                        nu- merous employesss who could ill be spared, and gave the agents
                        themsleves great trouble, while there was not the same variety in the
                        machines exhibited that would be noticeable in biennial exhibition. </p>

                    <p>St. Petersburg, November 4. The Amnesty is of the widest description,
                        Applying especially- to political offenders. There are no signs of Russia
                        becoming quieter. Great disturbances and bloodshed are reported daily from
                        fresh places. The latest reports show that the horrors at Odessa were not
                        exaggerated. Hooligans aided by the police slaughtered whole families of
                        Jews, with inconceivable brutality. It is impos- sible to estimate the
                        number of the killed, but there ate at present 5,500 wounded in. the
                        hospitals. 300 corpses have already been buried. (Reuter)</p>

                    <p>The railway strike in Russia is ending. M. Witte has informed the strikers
                        that their demands have been granted. The police at Odessa have tardily

                        continues elsewhere. A hundred were killed and six hundred wounded at Minsk.
                        The resignation of the' Minister of the Interior, M. Bouliguine, has been

                        December, in view of the revision of electoral representation. It abolishes
                        the Dictatorship. Meanwhile four warships, convoying ten thousand troops,

                    <p>Owing to tho greatly increased pressure of work at the Ministry of Finanoe,
                        it has been decided to appoint anothor Under-Secretary of State, and Lord
                        Edward Cecil Pasha has been selected to fill the new post. Great sa-
                        tisfaction is expressed both in British and native circles at his
                        appointment. During his career in the Sudan servioe Lord Edward Cecil has
                        displayed in a marked degreo the qualities of a good administrator. He is
                        thirty-eight, a brilliant soldier, and a man of business as well as of
                        affairs. The be- sieged in Mafeking owe him a large debt. They hod pretty
                        bad times there long before the siege was over, but had it not been for Lord
                        Edward Cecil they would have starved long before relief came. He took upon
                        himself the responsibility of providing the town with just four times the
                        quantity of food the military authorities found necessary, and when the
                        contractors hesitated to exeoote a seven thousand pound order on the young
                        major’s sole responsibility, Lord Edward promptly got Baden-Powell to back
                        the bilL. But Muafeking was only one incident in his career. He has served
                        in Egypt several times, accompanied the famous special mission to King
                        Menelik ot Abyssinis, gained two medals for his services with the Dougoia
                        Expedition, earned more fame at Atbara, and added to it at Omdurman the D.
                        S. O. and two clasps. The mission to Menelik, by the way, nearly put an end
                        to Lord Edward’s career. While the party was on its way uue of the camels
                        fell down a deep ravine, aud Lord Edward and Captain Swayne clambered down a
                        rope of puggarees with the idea of rescuing the animal. They could not roach
                        the camel, however, and one of the Abyssinians went down. A moment later two
                        shots rang out—one ot them came pretty near to hitting Sir Rennell Rodd—-and
                        the native caino up hand over hand in doable- quick time. He had found two
                        lions devour- ing the camel! Lord Edward, who is, of course, a younger
                        brother of the Marquess of Salis- bury, married in 1894 Miss Violet Maxse,
                        daughter of the late Admiral Maxse, and sister to the editor of the
                        “National Review." As a girl, Lady Edward Cecil sat for Millais' "Puss in
                        Boots,” and during the Boer war she did splendid work among the sick and
                        wounded. </p>

                    <p>Our recent article on the American insurance scandals has been interpreted by
                        some persons here, whose knowledge of English is limited, as reflecting on
                        the agents in Egypt of the companies concerned. But the idea that the

                        it will not bear that interpretation for a moment to anyone conversant with
                        the English language.</p>

                    <head>THE LATE GRAND MUFTI. SUCCESSOR APPOINTED.</head>
                    <p>The funeral of the late Grand Mufti, Sheikh Mohamed Abd El Kader El Rafei,
                        took place early on Saturday afternoon. The Prime Min- ister, Mustapha Pasha
                        Fehmy, Fakhry Pasha, Fuad Pasha, the chiefs of the ulema, and the principal
                        dignitaries of the University of Al Azhar, Mr. Moberly, acting Commandant of
                        the Cairo Police, and a great number of notables and sheikhs were present.
                        The fu- neral service was bald at the Mosque of the Al Azhar University,
                        after which the foneral cortege moved on to the cemetery at El Me- gaonerin,
                        where the interment took place. The late Grand Mufti appears to have suc-
                        cumbed to heart failure while driving from the house of H. E. Boutros Pasha
                        Ghali to that of H.E. Ahmed Pasha Mazloum to con- clude a series ot official
                        visits which seem to have proved too fatiguing for his years. His friends
                        state that he showed no signs of illness when leaving his house in the late
                        afternoon. A successor to the Grand Mufti has already been found in Sheikh
                        Bakri Ashour, the acting Grand Cadi, who has aocepted the appointment.
                        Sheikh Bakri is reputed to be a learned theo- logian and bears a high
                        personal character.</p>

                    <head>CHRYSANTHEMUM. SHOWS. SUCCESSFUL EXHIBITS AT ALEXANDRIA.</head>
                    <p>The eighth of the Alexandria Horticultural Society’s Chrysanthemum Shows was
                        held in the San Stefano Casino on Saturday and Sunday last. It was the
                        largest yet held here, and was remarkable for the number of novel exhibits
                        it contained, this, evidently, being the result of according a certain
                        number of points in tho programme for new varieties not hitherto exhibited
                        in Egypt. Every year brings one or two new exhibitors who show extra-
                        ordinarily good blossoms. Mr. Rolo surprised the public last year by his
                        beautiful cut flowers a in boxes, and this year Madame Salvago and Yehia
                        Bey, who never exhibited before, were able to carry off prizes in every
                        class for which , they (competed. The group of Mme Salvago, though small,
                        was quite charming, and the fine heads of flowers that Yehia Bey produced
                        were as good as any that have been seen at San Stefano. But to those who
                        really under- stand chrysanthemums and their culture, the great feature of
                        the show was undoubtedly the mass of pot plants in the centre of Mr.
                        Zervndachi’s gronp, which had been so culti- vated that while the plant
                        remained small, the bloom was as large as if the roots had not been touohed.
                        The ball-room of the Casino was completely filled by four large groups,
                        three of which were for competition, while the fourth was the exhibit of the
                        Municipality, which never com- petes. All showed great taste in arrangement,
                        and the harmony in colour in each was well thought out. The difficulty
                        consequently lay in judging the strength of the plant and in the value of
                        the new importations into Egypt Perhaps among all the exhibitors the
                        greatest stride has been made by the Municipality; the difference in the
                        grouping of their plants was greatly noticeable. The Municipality is now
                        taking great interest in the culture of flowers. The reading-room was also
                        quite full of plants; the blossoms were enormous and although most of the
                        prizes seemed to go to three or four (competitors, yet in every class there
                        was much competition. Cultivation of the chrysanthemum has become so general
                        in Alexandria, that it almost seems as if the committee might venture to
                        take a further step, and offer prizes for special classes suoh as Pompou,
                        Incurves, etc. We must not omit to mention the boxes of well-grown flowers
                        staged by General Bullock, nor the interesting exhibit of Mrs. Crafton,
                        consisting of the leaf, flower, and fruit of the Philodendron pertusum. It
                        is not generally known that the fruit, which tastes like pineapple, takes 18
                        months to ripen. There was a mass of vases arranged by natives, most of them
                        well thought oat, though perhaps the harmony of colour which generally
                        pleases the Earopean eye, was somewhat wanting. Asa trial the oommittee
                        offered prizes for collections of vegetables, salad, and fruit, without
                        speoifiying too varieties. These exhibits were a success, and showed the
                        pnblic several vegetables which they probably had no idea were at the
                        present time to be obtained in the market. We noticed, for instance, peas,
                        figs, and strawberry grapes. The attendance on the opening day showed a
                        marked increase on former years, while on Sunday the attraction of the
                        Armenian bend helped to swell the large number who were drawn to the show.

                    <p>Saturday and Sunday's Chrysanthemum Show at Cairo was a thorough saocess from
                        the point of view of the judges, and the weather was delight- fully cool and
                        pleasant, with the result that the attendance was satisfactory and ths
                        visitors to the K. A.S building were content. The exhibits in nearly all
                        cases reached a very high standard, some of the groups being remarkably
                        beautiful, and the cut flowers attracting great attention. Mrs. Foaden, who
                        was by far the most successful exhibitor, secured no less than eleven first
                        prizes, her groups consisting of splendidly healthy blooms, and her other
                        exhibits being extremely tastefully arranged. Lord Cromer visited the Show
                        early on Satnrday afternoon, as did the Prime Minister and Husseith Fakhry
                        Pasha and many other well-known Cairo personalities, and there was a very
                        fair attendance on the second afternoon of the show. We need not say that
                        the arrangements were excellent, and that the excellent tea that was
                        provided and the music, for which we have to thank the C. O. of the 2nd
                        Royal Inniskilling Fosiliers, were heartily appreciated. The following were
                        the prize-winners in the various clasaes of exhibits:-</p>

                    <head>THE SUCRERIES COMPANY. MEETING OF DEBENTURE HOLDERS.</head>
                    <p>A meeting of the debenture-holders of the Egyptian Sugar Refineries was held
                        recently in Paris, at which, on the initiative of the French Council of
                        Foreign Bondholders, a committee was formod (the Paris correspondent of the
                        "Financial News" states) with the fullest powers to safeguard their
                        interests before the Cairo Tribunal of Commerce. The creditors of the
                        unfortunate concern have again been con- vened for November 17, after having
                        met on October 18 last, to receive the report of the experts.This
                        dcoament,the correspondent says, particularly incriminates the board of di-
                        rectors which up till last year distributed dividends, whilst the company’s
                        business never resulted in a single centime profit. On the contrary, for the
                        last five years the Egyptian Sugar Refineries constantly worked at a loss,
                        which did not appear in the obviously "doctored” balance-sheets. As to tbe
                        notorious Cronier bills which the managing directors aocepted, unknown to
                        their colleagues of the board, the experts declare they were duly entered in
                        the oompany's books; but the items reffering to that account were
                        subsequently omitted from the balance- sheets. Moreover, the bills once paid
                        by the company could not be found until they were discovered at the private
                        residence of a subor- dinate employe, who had staetd that he bad never seen
                        them. The debenture-holders will now await the meeting of November 17,when
                        the experts will read a supplementary report, whioh will also set forth the
                        exact state of the assets and liabilities of the company.</p>
