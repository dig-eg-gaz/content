interviewer, M. Joan Hew, indioate, however,
that he beliew in the more rapid extension
of lataea, to whioh there ere many oonveru,
"beeaooap aujourd’hui, domain proeqae, ’ and
that, aa regard* the “peril,’’ "S j’ai pru won
titreaux alarmists*, o’eet poor mieox oom-
bittre leer thtee I”—“if I have taken the title
of ajr book from the alarmist*, I have done to
the better to at took their then*.’’ In referring
to the pagan* ot the Sudan, Lord Cromer
•peak* of their adoption of the religion of
Mohamad a* being a diatinot atop forward.
The fact ia that the work of the Roman
i Catholic mUnion* in the negro oonntriee wnth
•	of Khartoum U rather one of oiriliaation than of
proeeiyti— a* far a* the attitude of the 8tate
ie omened, it would appear that them two
great aathoritiea hold almost identical view*.
Lord Cromer write* : "It oannot too dearly
be enderetood that proeelytiam forma no part
of the programme of the British Government
either in eoentriea whioh form part of the
dominions of the Crown, or in those where
British inflaenoe is ia some degree dominant”
and M. Binger remark* to hi* interviewer—
Tadaunietration, j'innate, a poor devoir de
Us ignoror, l’nn et 1’antra, lea muwionaireo st
lee marabouts." Both are at on* ia thoir views
of the neoeeaity imposed upon the Government
to give equal privileges to all religions bodie*.
In hu interview, M. Binger, deolinea to be
- drawn into any eipeamion of opinion aa to
the results of the spread of Islam—axoept for
the teaaark quoted above, that he	to
~ am any great peril therein. It may he urged
*	indeed that Christianity may be propagated
■ aeon successfully after the first principles of
sobriety, eo excellent a feature of the Moslem
religion, have keen acquired by the negro.
Indeed the advent of the liquor seller has
often proved the rein of the oonvert, and
nullified the aeH-morifictng efforts of the
_ Christian miaasonasy. But against this, we
meat set the foot, that even in Moslem
*■ countries which have paased under Christian
rola conversions to Christianity are very tare,
the Moslem population either showing n ten-
dency to free thought or retiring, as they
are retiring from Crete and Bosnia, to Moslem
lands. The results of preaching and education
ia Egypt, for example, are not enooutaging
m as tar as oonversion is concerned, though we
are ready to admit the great value of the
miaeinsia as a civilising factor. Still the rapid
spread ot Christianity in Uganda and Torn in
spite of pagan and Mohamedan, and alas 1
sectarian persecution, whioh did not seam till
d a few yean ago, should give us grounds for
hope that missionary activity on the Upper
Nile may be suoeeesful. All will depend on
*) the personal oharater and inflaenoe of the
x missions rise, and for that reason we hope to see
tr picked men, and only picked men, sent to the
wort.

the nepriver will not be developed until they
have reached the observatories. Comparisons,
boo, most he made between the wort of the
aetroaoesew at diffarant stations before many
of the doubtful points are decided, for there ia
a soamderahle difieranoe between the tisMs at
whioh the eolipee beoomes visible in different
ooantries. The rime* of the various pluses of

made for the Ratal Ha lighthouse, hot they
are sufficiently accurate for observations (other

            proceed with the elaboration of a treaty.
            (Later). Japan yielded all the outstanding
            questions and accepted the Russian proposal
            that there should be no indemnity, and that
            Saghalien should be divided without the
            payment of any redemption money. She with-

            ing with a gun yesterday in Moharrem Bey
            qnarter, when the weapon went off and injured
            lie sister, a little girl of eight years of age,
            who will be for at least twelve days in the
            doctor’s hands.
            Drowned in tiie Harbour —A lighter
            aden with stones caps’z id in the harbour
            yesterday. Of the crew of four, three were
            rescued, the fourth, a native named Abd el
            Aziz was drowned. His body has not yet been
            recovered.
            Suez Canal.—25 vessels passed through
            the CaDal on the 26th ar.d 27th inst., 13 of
            which were Brit'sh, 7 German, 1 Italian, 2
            frenob, 1 Spanish, 1 Norwegian. The receipts
            Tor the two days were frs. 789,387.78, making
            the total from the 1st. inst. frs. 8,108,880.57.
            Army of Occupation.—During the absenoe
            of Brigadier-General G. M. Bollock C.B., in
            Cyprus and Crete, the command of the Forces
            in Egypt will be assumed by Colonel F. W. N.
            IfacCraoken, D.S.O., Royal Berkshire Regiment,
            and that of the troops in Cairo by Lieut.-Col.
            I, C. C. Cox, Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers.
            Incident on the Quays.—We are informed
            to-day that in the incident to which—owing
            to the nature of the report translated from the
            Arabio whioh was given ns—we referred under
            the heading “an insistent woman,” a lady of
            great literary ability and social distinction was
            involved. A version of the affair, differing from
            that which we received yesterday, has been
            handed in the form of a complaint to H.B.M.’s
            Consulate. The case being sub jndice we pro-
            pose to abstain from all comment until the
            conclusion of the enquiry.
            A Drastic Remedy.—A native of Cairo,
            who has a great liking for any form of alcohol,
            indulged, we are told, too freely on Tuesday
            evening, and on returning home after hip
            carousal, sank into a drunken slumber. His
            two sons, who had long deplored their father’s
            proclivities, bethought themselves cf a certain
            cure, and promptly pht their idea into praotice
            by setting his beard and whiskers on fire. We
            trust that these two men will receive a severe
            pnnishmeDt, fob, whatever their intention, thtf
            act was exceedingly brutal.
            The El Rouei Affray.—The condition of
            Kamel Effendi Henein, of the seoret police,
            who was shot in the affray which we have
            already mentioned, shows a marked improve-
            ment. Further investigations by the polioe
            have proved that the Italians implicated in
            the affair were members of a band of thieves.
            Their headquarters in the Gamh el Ahmar
            quarter has been found to oontain a large
            quantity of stolen silks, jewellery and other
            valuables which have mysteriously disappear-
            ed from various shops and honses. It is hopei
            that the rest of the band will soon be captured.

            * the news of peace.
            NEWSPAPER PROSECUTION.
            THE WAR AND ITS RESULTS.
            We need not say that the news that peaoe
            >etween the two great Eastern Empires is a
            certainty at last has caused immense satis-
            action in every capital and not least in
            xradon, where the fact that the (Japanese
            alliance had been renewed, if not strengthened,
            w3a hound to render the continuance of a
            singularly desperate sanguinary struggle a
            source of pain to an allied people, united
            moreover to the ally of Japan’s foe by the ties
            of a cordial and generous friendship. The war
            that has jnst ended has been, without question,
            the most stubbornly fought encounter between
            two oivilised nations that has taken place since
            the Napoleonic struggles. Less protracted and
            therefore less bloody than the Amerioan Civil
            War, it was fought by trained armies far better
            equipped and organised than any of the vol-
            unteer forces that took part in the earlier years
            of the great. struggle. It was waged with an
            indifference to loss, a dogged and persistent
            courage that has never been excelled in war.
            The Japanese watchword — “reinforce and
            attack again”—held good in the faoe of every
            repulse, and, if the series of defeats whioh
            ! lussia had to sustain has led some to hold a
            ow opinion of the value of their army, it must
            be remembered that the Tsar’s soldiers, if often
            lieaten, were never routed, and that the care-
            essness and Degleot of too many of their offioers
            was atoned tor by the amazing persistence
            and resolution of the N.C.O.’a and men ,who
            showed the same dogged and unyielding oour-
            age that the Moojik has ever displayed on the
            lattlefield, the spirit that minimised the oon-
            sequences of deteat at Zorndorf and Borodino,
            and ensured victory at Poltava and the Shipka
            ] }ass. On the other side the Japanese have
            given proof that they possess the highest mili-
            tary qualities. An unyielding conrage that
            would not admit a repulse, a fervent and eelf-
            sscrificirg patriotism that made death prefer-
            able to surrender, joined to a thorough and
            scientific preparation for war, have proved them
            the most terrible opponents in the held and the
            most valuable allies. It has been said that the
            Japanese has not yet been tried by the test of
            defeat; surely an army that hurled itself for
            months against the forts of Port Arthur suffer-
            ing horrible loss without a glimmer of success,
            would rot easily be discouraged by defeat in
            the field, and what praise can be too high for
            Admiral Togo, who, after losing two out of his
            six battleships.and one'of his fastest cruisers by
            mines or collision in a single afternoon, watoh-
            ed Port Arthur and its six blockaded battle-
            ships with nndiminished vigilance, and finally
            crippled the hostile fleet in the great battle of
            August 10, 1904 without the loss of a single
            vessel 1
            To turn to the results 6f the war, Japan is
            eft supreme in Korea and Liao tung, the Man-
            churian railway south of Kharbin reverts to
            China, and Japan obtains useful fishing rights
            on the Siberian coast. The questions of the
            indemnity and of the interned war-ships are
            waived altogether. The 8&ghalien dispute is
            settled by a compromise, the southern half of
            the island reverts to the Japanese, to whom
            it originally belonged,while Russia regains the
            northern half just wrested from her in a brief
            and brilliant campaign by two Japanese reserve
            divisions. So much for the results of the war
            from a mftteriftl point of view.
            -Criticism of the Japanese attitude in accep-
            ing the Rnssian refusal to pay an indemnity
            or to surrender more than half Saghalien
            wonld he ill-timed till the facts are known.
            Japan may have been $oo magnanimous or
            she may have suffered more from the war than
            is generally supposed, but, in our opinion, her
            attitude is probably due to the renewal of
            the Anglo-Japanese alliance on a broader basis,
            whioh guarantees her against attack from any
            quarter, for a period during whioh she can
            recover from the economic disturbances caused
            by the war. In any case criticisms of the peace
            terms may well be left to the morrow. The
            war has ended, the butcheries of Port Arthur
            and the Shaho will not be repeated, and the
            glory of the “Rising Sun" htu suffered no
            eclipse.
            “EL MOAYAD” AND “EL SAYBKA.”
            We have already mentioned that Sheik Ali
            Ynssef, the proprietor and editor of the
            “Moay&d" had brought a charge of attempt at
            blackmailing against Ahmed Fouad, the editor
            of the T S&yeka,” or the "'ITiunderer,” a paper
            published in Cairo, and of a similar nature to
            “La Justioe,” the proprietor of which, Leon
            ?ehmi, was reoently sentenced to one year’s
            imprisonment on a charge of the same descrip-
            tion. It seems that Ahmed Fonad had publish-
            ed some scurrilous artioles in his paper
            regarding the elopement and seoret marriage ot
            Sheikh Ali Yussef with the daughter^ Sheik
            ! SI Saadat (which caused such a sensation and
            so much talk in native ciroles last year) on
            the former refusing to pay hinp £20T;1.
            The tribunal of 8ai'da Zenab has now an-thor-
            ised the Parquet to detain the aocused in
            prison provisionally for a fortnight, whilst the
            neoessary evidence is being got ready for the
            forthcoming trial before the Assize Court now
            Bitting in Cairo. Meanwhile the Parquet is
            examining the witnesses for both sides.

            COMING CHANGES.
            The following changes will take place daring
            the forthcoming relief season.
            The 2nd battalion Rifle Brigade now station-
            ed at Khartoum and at the Citadel in Cairo
            will embark for India about the third week in
            November. The Royal Berkshire Regiment at
            * lexandria, which arrived here from Sonth
            Africa on 30th November, 1902, will relieve the
            above battalion, and its plaoe will be taken
            by 1st Royal Dublin Fusiliers, which arrive
            from Malta in three detaohments, the first in
            September and the last in November. The
            Royal Inniskilling Fasiliers, now atKasr-el-Ni
            barracks, will send three companies to Crete
            and one oompany to Cyprus, and the four
            companies of the Kings Royal Rifles Corps
            at present serving in those two islands wil
            rejoin the headquarters of the battalion at
            Abbassieh.
            As we have already mentioned the Trans-
            port Assaye, which sails from Southampton
            on the 8th November, will briDg oat the last
            detaobment of the Royal Dublin Fusiliers
            from Malta and embark the Rifle Brigade
            at Suez for India, where it will be stationed at
            Chambatta.

            FRENCH TORPEDO CRAFT.
            (Fbom our Correspondent.)
            Port Said, Tuesday,
            The torpedo transport Foudre, having on
            board several small harbour defence torpedo
            boats, and also two of the latest submarines,
            and accompanied by one torpedo destroyer,
            and six sea-going torpedo boats, arrived
            here on Sunday en route from Bizerta to
            Djihuti and Saigon. The Bquadron is com-
            manded by Capitaine de vaisseau Niool and
            reports a fair passage. It leaves on Saturday.
            
            The Frenoh squadron now at Port Said is
            composed of the following craft:—
            The torpedo depdt ship Foudre, a vessel
            built on much the same lines as H. M. S.
            Vuloan. Displacing 6,036 tons the Foudre is
            capable of a speed of over 19 knots, and carries
            four 8.9 Q. F. guns, four 9-pr Q. F. and four
            i 3 pr Hotchkiss guns. She can carry no less
            than six torpedo vedette boats if required,
            and is at present taking out two submarines
            to strengthen the Frenoh forces in the Far
            East.
            The two submarines are of a new type de-
            signed by M. Romazotti. They are named the
            Perle and the Estnrgeon, carry fonr torpedo
            tubes and displace 68 tons. Their speed does
            not exceed eight knots, bnt they will |m most
            useful vessels if called upon to play a defensive
            role.
            The destroyer Rapifere was launched at
            Rochefort in 1901 and did 28 knots, one knot
            over her estimated speed, at her trials. She
            displaces 303 tons and is armed with one 9-pr.
            Q.F. andsix3-prs. The six torpedo boats whioh
            are to be convoyed to Saigon by. the ‘Foudre’
            are numbered 255, 284, 285, 286, 291 and 292.
            Their displacement varies from 87 to 90 tons.
            Bnilt for a speed of 25 knots they have .all
            done from 25 £ to 27 knots on their trials.
            Each carries two one-pounder antomatio. guns
            and two torpedo tubes, one on a turntable aft
            and one fixed in the bows. Altogether the
            little squadron will greatly inorease the defen-
            sive strength cf the Far Eastern Colonies of
            the Republic.
            THE GARDNER-BROWN COMPANY.
            This oompany started on Monday at the
            Khedivial Theatre a series of what should
            prove to be most successful evenings. '
            A packed house witnessed a lengthy and
            most amusing variety entertainment whioh
            lasted till a late hour.
            Renderings of “Please give me heaven" and
            ''Bluebell” called for much applause, and alto*

            THE CIGARETTE INDUSTRY.
            THE MURDER OF AN OMDEH.
            A NEW DEPARTURE.
            Mr. Nestor Gianadis, the well-known head
            of the cigarette industry of Egypt,[and Presi-
            dent of the Union des Fahricanto de Cigarettes
            d’Egypte, is leaving Alexandria on Saturday
            by the Austrian Lloyd steamer for Trieste, on
            his way to America, with the intention of
            starting a factory at Boston, the first of its
            kind established in that oonntry, or, in fact,
            in any other, and where Egyptian cigarettes
            will be manufactured out of Egypt. This new
            departure was decided upon in consequence ot
            the vexations regulations of the United States
            customs, and the nnmerona restrictions im-
            posed upon the importation of cigarettes from
            this country ; so that whilst the exports from
            Cairo and Alexandria to European and Far
            Eastern countries has been increasing by leaps
            and bounds within the past five years or so,
            that to the U. S. of America has remained
            practically stationary.
            Mr. Gianaclis will also visit Germany and
            England before embarking for New York and
            will be absent until December.
            AMATEUR ESTATE BROKERS.
            We qnite agree with what a writer stated
            in the columns of a Cairo contemporary yester-
            day, that the Government should at oree
            pat a stop to the scandal of petty employ^
            in several state Departments, notably the
            Ministries of Finanoe and Interior, acting as
            land brokers. Naturally the genuine brokers
            and firms engaged in this class of business
            are np in arms and intend making complaint
            to the chiefs of the departments in which
            some of their employes are aoting as brokers,
            and who, undoubtedly, can bavefho know-
            ledge of what is going in this direction.
            We think that an enquiry should be opened
            without delay by the responsible heads, and
            measures be taken to stop what amounts to
            a grave scandal.

            We have reoeived the following aooount from
            our Tahta (correspondent of the murder of the
            omdeh of Fazareh, whioh we reoorded In oar
            issne of yesterdaySheikh Genawi, the omdeh
            of Faztreh in the Tahta district, was the victim
            last Wednesday night of a brutal plot whioh
            was planned against him. The authors of the
            horrible oeimesat fire to a large rick of dried
            maize belonging to one of them, and then called
            the omdeh ont to take charge of the work of
            extinguishing the fire. Genawi rushed ont as
            soon as appealed to but no sooner did he reach
            the scene of the fire than he wm struck by two
            bullets. His wounds proved fatal in a very short
            time. Before expiring the omdeh named
            seven men whom he suspected of being parti-
            cipators in the dastardly act.
            As soon as Mohamed Helmi Effendi Issa,
            Si bstitnte of the Parquet, learnt. wfcat ha<
            happened, he went to the scene of the murder
            and held an inquiry. From this it was made
            dear that the seven men mentioned by Sheikh
            Genawi had been present at the fire and, as
            they were known to have cherished a great
            dislike to the omdeh, they were arrested. A
            woman, who was watching the fire, was also
            shot in the head, bnt it is believed that this
            was accidental, all the shots being intendec
            for the omdeh.

            The most Dotioeable item of the cotton-

            rednotion in the area attacked by the worm
            in the Behera district, the difference between
            that period and the preceding week being
            2,062 feddans. Damietta shows no recurrence,
            and can, therefore, be said to be entirely free,

            banging of * few doors, we start off on out
            journey. But there ere many stop*, and the
            carriage soon fills up ; Sanday tsa greet day
            far travelling in the country. Meet of the new-
            oomen are laden with fl iwers, which they place
            carefully in the rack, giving an opportunity far
            lurking earwigs to drop neatly on to nnoffend
            ing haada No word ia spoken ; we look at
            each other, and then, dully, out of the window.
            At length tbs aknoe is broken by a voioo an
            naturally kmd—the voice of one temporarily
            courageous, through injudicious feasting it
            may be, and whose chief our* at the prevent

            he says, addressing a red-haired man who sits

            indeed " hs replies, hoping thereby to still the
            inquirer's mind. Then he fixes his attention
            ostentatiously upon his book by way of hint
            But it is useless ; the interrogator, a littk,
            mild man with a fierce and heavy black mous-

            he means to converse ; the carriage is nearly

            round at the expectant faces, and approaches
            his victim again. “You’ll excu j me, sir," he
            begins, “bat might yon reside in this part f

            indeed and the little man is,for the moment,
            at a loss. Leaning forward, he taps the red
            haired one gently on the knee, eeomng him to
            look up, startled. “Me an my friends," toe

OUR PARIS LETTER.
(From ocr Corrwfobmwt).
Peris, Augoit as
The situation in Motoooo continues to give
French statesmen some cense tor anxiety.
After the acute atage of the chain between
Pranoe and Germany was diapoaed of, the
(Jnai d'Oraay and the Wilhalmatraaae agreed
by mntnal oonaent that until the International
Conference met. Prance and Germany should
call a halt to their deaigna in Morcooo. But
ahortly after, to quote the text of a semi-official
communication just publiehed here, "the
French Miniatry of Foreign Affaire learned of
, Count von Tat ten bach a mo vain ante at Pea,
ami ot hia endeavonra to indoence the 8ultan
in favor of German oontnota for the works
at the port of Tangier* and a German loan, to
the Maghren M Rouvier thereupon drew
Phnoe Kadolin'a attention to them fkota in
con vernation and in letter* , and the Preach
Minuter in Berlin mentioned the matter to
the Under Secretary of 8tate for Foreign
Adair*.'' The oloeing paragraph of the oom-
muhioetion referred to atatea :—"The attitude
of the French Government manifasta a aincei*
deaire to carry out loyally the procedure
adoptsd at the nqoeet of Germany for the
aettlemeot of the Morocco affair , while the
German Government on the other hand, ha*
spontaneously, and on aevetal oooaaiona, given
forrW aaauranoea aa to the nature of its inter'
vention. It w, therefore, permimikte to hope
that the negotiations now going on will reealt
in a satisfactory solution.” That is the lan-
guage of diplomacy and coo van two. The truth
is that Franch man believe they have been
"had ' by Germany, and that after having
giveu an undertaking to the Quai d'Oraay that
the 'status quo” would be respected, and
nothing done until the Oonforaooe met, Oouat
von Tattenhaoh, that etrenuoue representative
of the energetic Kaiser, has been making hay
while the sun shone—in other words, taking
advantage of the inactivity of the French
Minister. The announcement that knee the
understanding come to by M. Rouvier and
M. Radolm, German bankers have advanced
£500,000 to the impecunious Sultan, and that
. the Sultan has formally refused the French
Minister * demand for the relearn of the A lger
ian (a Prenoh subject) whom the Moorish
authorities urinated at Ghart, and took in
' chains to Pet, hat not tended to improve
matter*. a
M. Reu vter s attitude with regard to the
impudent arrest of the Algerian headmen
Bumiian by the Moroccan Government com-
bines firmness and scrupulous correctnem
admirably, lie has promptly demanded satis-
faction—the release of the man, the punish-
ment of the responsible kaid.and an indemnity,
failing which it is understood then will he a
demonstration, possibly on the Algerian
bonder in p.daieooe to the ooaet Pranoe
could do no lea*. Sven if Bumiian, aa ia said,
is only a very honorary kind of Fienchman,
belonging to an Algerian tribe that has long
been domiciled in Moroooo, he is a French
subject all the same, and there aaa be little
doubt that that foot was deliberately taken
into aooount by the Moorish anthondea Bet,
while Pranoe insists firmly on reparation for
the insult, she adherers to "oorreedtade* by
notifying her aodon to the other signatories of
the Madrid Convention. Thereby she tognifim
in the dearest possible manner that she, on
her part, means to aot ia good faith and a
thoroughly frank spirit pending the Conforenoa
It is an example of good manner* end straight
forwardness for other* to copy.
£
At the present moment, when the German
Emperor bulks *o largely in the eyes of Burope,
it may be intoreadng to reoall the analysis of
the Kaiser published by a Prenoh contemporary
a few days ago. The information waa, say* the
writer, oommamcated to him by a diplomat
who knows th* Emperor intimately. According
to this informant, not only i* th* ffaiirr incor-
rectly represented abroad, bet hi* tree aha
tauter ia for from being well known even by
hia own subject*. The devouring activity which
keep* him oeaeelemly travelling over hie Em-
pire, and taking hie yaoht to widely -putt
aces, oauaee people to picture the Earner aa
possessed of the most gigando designs He is
supposed to be voluntarily absorbed in mar-
velioua combi nation* whose extent embrace*
the entire world ; and when, with the dm
made rotting with which'he love* to MROund
all hia actions, he appears in any place, th*
most fantastic plana are attributed to him.
"How for this ia from the truth P exclaims
the writer. "If Norway had not thought it her
duty to proclaim her divorce from fl Milan, the
Emperor would have taken hie usual on in
this summer, and wa would not have had the
sei national meeting at Bjoerko*. But the King
of Sweden requested the Kaiser to modify hie
itinerary this year, and the Emperor went for
a cruise in the Baltic. Nothing certain has
yet been make known about th* mysterious
meeting of the Tror end the Easier ; and I do
not believe that the future will tall u* much
more, for in reality nothing exceptional oc-
curred. The Kaiser ia of an extraroefy lively
temperament and intellect, and he likes to ex-
change ideas, to pay and to leoarv* visits. He
does not mind if he oaosw the world to hold
iu breath at rimes, and it must he admitted
that modesty ia not the dominant trait of his
character. But it should aot he im^med that
he is for ever studying proWroro of grandeur
and supremacy. Hie Majesty ia, indeed, leas
occupied with question* of fcueige politic*than
to generally rapporod. With hie great facility
ri assimilation he often, inn tepid bird’s ay*
!p!ni*the oanTof foUovtoif*throf^efoeafy to
the Imperial Chancellor. It wo*Id be a pro
found error to picture the Kaiser always ah
sorbed, his finger on his brow, la contemplation
of the amp of the world, and ever ready to re
arrange it He is"—and this stay surprise
*ome readers - "by eaters a man of pease, who
does not wish to upset anything ; but be feels
the necessity of e nervous activity which makes
him fear he is wasting his time if he is not
displaying his snergie*. William II,” oonciud
*1 th* correspondent’s inforaaent, "is aot a
sovereign of the old robonl. He is not haunted
by ideas of the domination of th* world. He
is a very modern man and it he we* hot tbs
German Emperor, I could not do better than
oimpure him with President Roosevelt
forgetting for th* moment that he himself
really is the foreigner. But I do aot think
he makes himself quite as objectionable aa th*
tnvePing American. It is aa old complaint
with hotel keepers on th* Continent that
visitor* from the other side of the Atlantic
drink gpnLr* of the hotel water, bet seldom
a bottle of wine, and that for the minimum
tariff they expeutto have the best of every-
thing.

Tbs Prenoh art world has again fort nos of
its arost notable figures in the death of th#
veteran artist M. William Boagoeraao
Although nearly eighty years of age th* rid
man was at hia easel to th* last, and he leaves
behind him n splendid record of sixty years'
work, during, which be unnehed the art
treasures of his own and ttbur countries by
more than one notable canvas. His work sms
a strange mixture of the aeend end the pro-
fane “Nymph* end Satyrs,” ’The Infest
Jeans and St John the Baptist,” "The Birth
of Vanns,” and * Tbs Adoration of th* 8hep^

hi was equally successful ia these varied nb

no more heed to inch ad no* ihaa did his ouw-
tamporary M. Hen net, tha ragged old painter
who has predeceased M. Bougneruau by only
a few weeks. H# had Iris ideal and hia
scanner, and although everything round him
might suffer change and Modification, Bougue-
rrou's Angel* and Cupids, his nymph* and
mints remained eternally the same, ronrnally
harmonious, pleasing, and beautiful. And he
had do reason to regret to* aihereoee to the
ideal he had crested. It brought him fortsdu,
fame, and honor*, and even U he had been
denied all honor in hie own oonntry, his re-
putation, like that of th* kata Benjamin Con-
stant, was firmly wtihhshed abroad. He dwd
peacefully, like a labourer who has ooaepfetod
