                        <p>An interesting interview iwth M. Binger, "directeur des affaires
                            Africaines au Ministere des Colonies Francaises" appeared in "Le Matin"
                            on the 16th inst., the subject being the decision of the Church of Rome
                            to make more vigorous efforts to Christianise the large pagan population
                            of French West Africa. This subject is of special interest in view of
                            Lord Cromer's remarks under the head of "Missions" in his report for
                            1904. M. Binger naturally declines to go into details in view of the
                            fact that he is shortly publishing a work entitled "Le Peril Islamique"
                            in which he describes the causes that favor the spread of Islam in
                            Africa as opposed th Christianity. The expressions of which he made use
                            to his interviewer, M. Jean Hess, indicate, however, that he believes in
                            the more rapid extension of Islam, to which there are many converts,
                            "beaucoup anjourd'hui, demain presque," and that, as regards that
                            "peril," "Si j'ai pris mon titre aux alarmistes, o'est pour mieux
                            combattrre leaur these!"-"if I have taken the title of my book from the
                            alarmists, I have don so the better to attack their thesis." In
                            reterring to the pagans of the Sudan, Lord Cromer speaks of their
                            adoption of the religion of Mohamed as being a distinct step forward.
                            The fact is that the work of the Roman Catholic missions in the negro
                            countries south of Khartoum is rather one of civilisation than of
                            proselytism as far as the attitude of the State is concerned, it would
                            appear that these two great authorities hold almost identical views.
                            Lord Cromer writes: "It cannot too clearly be understood that
                            proselytism forms no part of the programme of the British Government
                            either in countires which form part of the dominions of the Crown, or in
                            those where British influence is in some degree dominant." and M. Binger
                            remarks to his interviewer-"l'administration, j'insiste, a pour devoir
                            de les ignorer, l'un et l'austre, les missionares et les marabouts."
                            Both are at one in their views of the necessity imposed upon the
                            Government to give equal priviliges to all religious bodies.</p>
                        <p>In his interview, M. Binger, declines to be drawn into any expression of
                            opinion as to the results of the spread of Islam-except for the remark
                            quoted above, that he declines to see any great peril therein. It may be
                            urged indeed that Christianity may be propagated more successfully after
                            the first principles of sobriety, so excellent a feature of the Moslem
                            religion, have been acquired by the negro. indeed the advent of the
                            liquor seller has often proved the ruin of the convert, and nullified
                            the self-sacrificing efforts of the Christian missionary. But against
                            this, we must set the fact, that even in Moslem countires which have
                            passed under Christian rule conversions to Christianity are very rare,
                            the Moslem population either showing a tendency to free thought or
                            retiring, as they are retiring from Crete and Bosnia, to Moslem lands.
                            The results of preaching and education in Egypt, for example, are not
                            encouraging as far as conversion is concerned, though we are ready to
                            admit the great value of the missions as a civilizing factor. Still the
                            rapid spread of Christianity in Uganda and Toru in spite of pagan and
                            Mohamedan, and alas sectarian persecution, which did not cease till a
                            few years ago, should give us grounds for hope that missionary activity
                            on the Upper Nile may be successful. All will depend on the personal
                            character and influence of the missionaries, and for that reason we hope
                            to see picked men, and only picked men, sent to the work.</p>

                        <head>TO-DAY'S ECLIPSE.</head>
                        <p>To-day the all absorbing topic of conversation throughout Egypt is the
                            eclipse of the worlds great luminary, which will be observed at Assouan
                            and the surrounding district in totality, and in other localities in
                            various degrees approaching totality, within a very short space of time
                            from the publication of this paper. For the accounts of the phenomenon
                            from various stations in Egypt, with which our correspondents will
                            furnish us, our readers must wait until to-morrow, when we shall give
                            them the fullest details obtainable. It must be remembered that much of
                            the valuable information which will accrue from the observations of the
                            trained scientists who compose the various commissions, cannot be
                            arrived at for some time. The majority of these observations will be
                            recorded by means of photography and the negatives will not be developed
                            until they have reached the observatories. Comparisons, too, must be
                            made between the work of astronomers at different stations before many
                            of the doubtful points are decided, for there is a considerable
                            difference between the times at which the eclipse becomes visible in
                            different countries. The times of the various phases of the eclipse as
                            seen from Alexandria, where the degree of totality will amount to 0.88,
                            are: - comencement at 2 hours 59 minutes 41 seconds p.m., maximum phase
                            at 4 hours, 9 minutes and 39 seconds p.m., end at 5 hours, 12 minutes
                            and 22 seconds p.m.. These calculations are made for the ras el Tin
                            lighthouse, but they are sufficiently accurate for observations (other
                            than those of profound scientists, who will, doubtless, make their own
                            calculations) from any point in Alexandria, or the immediate

                            referred under the heading "an insistent woman." a lady of great
                            literary ability and social distinction was involved. A version of the
                            affair, differing from that which we received yesterday has been handed
                            in the form of a complaint to H.B.M.'s Consulate. The case being sub
                            judice we propose to abstain from all comment until the conclusion of

                            indulged, we are told, too freeliy on Tuesday evening, and on returning
                            home after his carousal, sank into a drunken slumber. His two sons, who
                            had long deplored their father's proclivities, bethought themselves of a
                            certain cure, and promptley put their idea into practice by setting his
                            beard and whiskers on fire. We trust that these two men will receive a
                            severe punishment, for, whatever their intention, the act was

                            shot in the affray which we have already mentioned, shows a marked
                            improvement. Further investigations by the police have proved that the
                            Italians implicated in the affair were members of a band of thieves.
                            Their head-quarters in the Gamh el Ahmar quarter has been found to
                            contain a large quantity of stolen silks, jewwllery and other valuables

                    <head>THE NEWS OF PEACE. THE WAR AND ITS RESULTS.</head>
                    <p>We need not say that the news that peace between the two great Eastern
                        Empires is a certainty at last has caused immense satisfaction in every
                        capital and not least in London, where the fact that the Japanese alliance
                        had been renewed, if not strengthened, was bound to render the continuance
                        of a singularly desperate sanguinary struggle a source of pain to an allied
                        people, united moreover to the ally of Japan's foe by the ties of a cordial
                        and generous friendship. The war that has just ended has been, without
                        question, the most stubbornly fought encounter between two civilised nations
                        that has taken place since the Napoleonic strugles. Less protracted and
                        therefore less bloody than the American Civil War, it was fought by trained
                        armies far better equipped and organised than any of the volunteer forces
                        that took part in the earlier years of the great struggle. It was waged with
                        an indifference to loss, a dogged and persistent courage that has never been
                        excelled in war. The Japanese watchword – "reinforce and attack again" –
                        held good in the face of eery repulse, and, if the series of defeats which
                        Russian had to sustain has led some to hold a low opinion of the value of
                        their army, it must be remembered that the Tsar's soldiers, if often beaten,
                        were never routed, and that the carelessness and neglect of too many of
                        their officers was atoned for the be amazing persistance and resolution of
                        the N.C.O.'s and men, who showed the same doged and unyielding courage that
                        the Moujik has ever displayed on the battlefield, the spirit that minimised
                        the consequences of defeat at Zorndorf and Borodino, and ensured victory at
                        Poltava and the Shipka Pass. On the other side of the Japanese have given
                        proof that they possess the highest military qualities. An unyielding
                        courage that would not admit a repulse, a fervent and self-sacrificing
                        patriotism that made death prefereable to surrender, joined to a thorough
                        and scientific preparation for war, have proved them the most terrible
                        opponents in the field and the most valuable allies. It has been said that
                        the Japanese has not yet been tried by the test of defeat; surely an army
                        that hurled itself for months against the forts of Port Arthur suffering
                        horrible loss without a glimmer of success, would not easily be discouraged
                        by defeat in the field, and what praise can be too high for Admiral Togo,
                        who, after losing two out of his six battleships, and one of his fastest
                        cruisers by mines or collision in a single afternoon, watched Port Arthur
                        and its six blockaded battle-ships with undiminished vigilance, and finally
                        crippled the hostile fleet in the great battle of August 10, 1904 without
                        the loss of a single vessel?</p>
                    <p>To turn the results of the war, Japan is left supreme in Korea and Liao-tung,
                        the Manchurian railway south of Kharbin reverts to China, and Japan obtains
                        useful fishing rights on the Siberian coast. The questions of the indemnity
                        and of the interned war-ships are waived altogether. The Saghalien dispute
                        is settled by a compromise, the southern half of the island reverts to the
                        Japanese, to whom it originally belonged, while Russia regains the northern
                        half just wrested from her in a brief and brillian campaign by two Japanese
                        reserve divisions. So much for the results of the war from a material point
                        of view.</p>
                    <p>Criticism of the Japanese attitude in accepting the Russian refusal to pay an
                        indemnity or to surrender more than half Saghalien would be ill-timed till
                        the facts are known. Japan may have been too magnanimous or she may have
                        suffered more from the war than is generally supposed, the, in our opinion,
                        her attitude is probably due to the renewal of the Anglo-Japanese alliance
                        on a broader basis, which guarantees her against attack from any quarter,
                        for a period during which she can recover from the economic disturbances
                        caused by the war. In any case criticisms of the peace terms may well be
                        left to the morrow. The war has ended, the butcheries of Port Arthur and the
                        Shaho will not be repeated, and the glory of the "Rising Sun" has suffered
                        no eclipse.</p>

                        taken by 1st Royal Dublin Fusiliers, which arrive from malta in three

                        of cigarettes from this country; so that whilst the exports from Cairo and
                        Alexandria to European and Far Eastern countries has been increasing by
                        leaps and bounds within the past five years or so, that the U.S. of America
                        has remained practically stationary.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Gianaclis will also visit Germany and England before embarking for New
                        York and will be absent until December.</p>

                    <p>We quite agree with what a writer stated in the columns of a Cairo
                        contemporary yesterday, that the Government should at once put a stop to the
                        scandal of petty employes in several state Departments, notably the
                        Ministries of Finance and Interior, acting as land brokers. Naturally the
                        genuine brokers and firms engaged in this class of business are up in arms
                        and intend making complaint to the chiefs of the departments in which some
                        of their employés are acting as brokers and who, undoubtedly, can have no
                        knowledge of what is going in this direction. We think that an enquiry
                        should be opened without delay by the responsible heads, and measures be
                        taken to stop what amouts to a grave scandal.</p>

                    <dateline>Port Said, Tuesday.</dateline>
                    <p>The torpedo transport Foudre, having on board several small harbour defence
                        torpedo boats, and also two of the latest submaries, and accompanied by one
                        torpedo destroyer, and six sea-going torpedo boats, arrived here on Sunday
                        en route from Bizerta to Djibuti and Saigon. The squadron is commanded by
                        Capitaine de vaisseau Nicol and reports a fair passage. It leaves on
                        Saturday.</p>
                    <p>The French squadron now at Port Said is composed of the following craft:</p>
                    <p>The torpedo depôt ship foundre, a vessel built on much the same lines as
                        H.M.S. Culcan. Displacing 6,036 tons the Foundre is capable of a speed of
                        over 19 knots, and carries four 3.9 Q.F. funs, four 9-pr Q.F. and four 3-pr
                        Hotchkiss guns. She can carry no less than six torpedo vedette boats if
                        required, and is at present taking out two submarines to strengthen the
                        French forces in the Far East.</p>
                    <p>The two submarines are of a new type designed by M. Romazotti. They are named
                        the Perle and the Esturgeon, carry four torpedo tubes and displace 68 tons.
                        Their speed does not exceed eight knots, but they will be most useful
                        vessels if called upon to play a defensive role.</p>
                    <p>The destroyer Rapiere was launced at Rochefort in 1901 and did 28 knots, one
                        know over her estimated speed, at her trials. She displaces 202 tons and is
                        armed with one 9-pr. Q.F. and six 3-prs. The six torpedo boats which are to
                        be convoyed to Saigon by the 'Foudre' are numbered 255, 284, 285, 286, 291,
                        and 292. Their displaceent varies from 87 to 90 tons. Built for a speed of
                        25 knots on their trials. Each carries two one-pounder automatic guns and
                        two torpedo tubes, one on a turntable aft aud one fixed in the bows.
                        Altogether the little squadron will greatly increase the defensive strength
                        of the Far Eastern Colonies of the Republic.</p>

                    <head>THE MURDER OF AN OMDEH.</head>
                    <p>We have received the folling account from our Tahta correspondent of the
                        murder of the omdeh of Fazareh, which we recorded in our issue of yesterday:
                        Sheikh Genawi, the omdeh of Fazareh in the Tahta district, was the victim
                        last Wednesday night of a burtal plot which was planned against him. The
                        authors of the horrible crime set fire to a large rick of dried maize
                        belonging to one of them, and then called the omdeh out to take charge of
                        the work of extinguishing the fire. Genawi rushed out as soon as appealed to
                        but no soonder did he reach the scene of the fire then he was struck by two
                        bullets. His wounds proved fatal in a very short time. Before expiring the
                        omdeh named seven men whom he suspected of being participators in the
                        dastardly act. </p>
                    <p>As soon as Mohamed Helmi Effendi Issa, Substitute of the Parquet, learnt what
                        had happened, he went to the scene of the murder and held an inquiry. From
                        this it was made clear that the seven men mentioned by Sheikh Geuawi had
                        been present at the fire and, as they were known to have cherished a great
                        dislike to the omdeh, they were arrested. A woman, who was watching the
                        fire, was also shot in the head, but it is believed that this was
                        accidental, al the shots being intended for the omdeh.</p>

                            shows no recurrence, and can, therefore, be said to be entirely free, as
                            in the preceding week only <measure>9 ½</measure> feddans were attacked.
                            A diminution of <measure>239 ½</measure> feddans is reported from

                    <head>A SUNDAY JOURNEY.</head>
                    <p>The little station in the remoter Thames Valley is steeped in the calm of
                        Sunday evening. It is little only by comparison, for, as a matter of fact,
                        it has four long platforms, two of which, however, serve for the lines on
                        which the expresses pass to and fro, and are therefore seldom occupied. It
                        stands facing the round, green Berkshire hills. Down in the road below, a
                        few hobbleddehoys, with hair well greased, and looking stiff and
                        uncomfortable in the garb of Sunday, are clustered about the stile opposite
                        the station gate, chewing straws and waiting to see the train. They are
                        aware of something awkward attached to the wearing of Sunday clothes, but
                        are able to put things right and recover self-respect by commenting
                        unfavorably on the passers by, emphasising each criticism with a guffaw. One
                        or two holiday makers are coming slowly towards the station, bearing the
                        day's harvest – great bunches of flowers. An express roars by from he west,
                        and under cover of its noide and stir our train takes us by surprise. It
                        steals in quietly, drawn by a goods engine, as a precaution against
                        indecorous speed, and, with the banging of a few doors, we start off on our
                        journey. But there are many stops, and the carriage soon fills up; Sunday is
                        a great day for travelling in the country. Most of the newcomers are laden
                        with flowers, which they place carefully in the rack, giving an opportunity
                        for lurking earwigs to drop neatly on the unoffending heads. No word is
                        spoken; we look at each other, and then, dully, out of the window. At length
                        the silence is broken by a voice unnaturally loud--the voice of one
                        temporarily courageous, through injudicious feasting it may be, and whose
                        chief care at the present moment is to make himself heard.</p>
                    <p>"The river looks beautiful to-day, don't it?" he says, addressing a
                        red-haired man who sits opposite. The red-haired man is reading, and has
                        apparently no wish to be disturbed. "It is, indeed," he replies, hoping
                        thereby to still the inquirer's mind. Then he fixes his attention
                        ostentatiously upon his book by way of hint. But it is useless; the
                        interrogator, a little, mild man with a fierce and heavy black moustache, is
                        relentless. Here is someone with whom he means to converse; the carriage is
                        nearly full, and he will have an audience. He glances round at the expectant
                        faces, and approaches his victim again. "You'll excuse me, sir," he begins,
                        "but might you reside in this part?" The red-haired one replies absently.
                        "Yes, indeed!" and the little man is, for the moment, at a loss. Leaning
                        forward, he taps the red-haired one gently on the knee, causing him to look
                        up, startled. "Me and my friends," the little man continues, 'comes down
                        every Sunday for a day on the river. Meself, I'm a tobacconist," he adds
                        irrelevantly. Then, noticing that the victim is preparing to resume his
                        book, and that the eyes of the eyes of the carriage are upon them both, he
                        goes on deliberately. "It's a cewrious thing, how these injun-drivers manage
                        as they do, always bringin' us safe home to port, as one might say. Did you
                        ever notice that, sir?" Wearily the red-haired one glances over the top of
                        his book, and ejaculates the usual, "Yes, indeed!" But any virtue that this
                        phrase may once have possessed is clearly gone now, for, without a pause,
                        the little man continues: "I gives'em tuppence meself, aiways--makes a point
                        of it, I do. I says, "There, me man, there's tuppence for a drink." "And
                        what," asks the red-haired man, resigning himself to the inevitable, "does
                        the engine-driver say?" "Oh, he is grateful, very grateful he is; it must be
                        terrible work--all the responsibilty and that. I'm a tobacconist meself." he
                        adds meditatively, rather as a refrain than for the sake of any further
                        light the information can bestow.</p>
                    <p>"I should have thought," goes on the red-haired one wearily, "he would have
                        expected more than that."</p>
                    <p>"Then you're mistaken, sir," the little man rejoins quietly. "You are indeed.
                        A tip's a tip--I don't care whether it's tuppence or a sovereign. No man's
                        above a tip--that's what I say." And he looks fiercely round as though
                        courting contradiction. </p>
                    <p>But we are not disposed to take any active part in the fray; we are content
                        to sit and listen. "I don't care who he is," repeats the little man as we
                        shriek through a station. "Take the case," says the red-haired one
                        thoughtfully, "of the Archbishop of Canterbury." "Well, of course," the
                        little man replies, and he looks rather perplexed, "it'll all depend on the
                        way it's given, and all that." "Take your tuppence," continues the
                        red-haired one remorselessly, "and go to the Archbishop of Canterbury." "I
                        don't say but what it mightn't be difficult," says the erst-while
                        persecutor, with a troubled face, "givin' it him so as he should take it
                        right, I mean." "Or," goes on the red-haired one, "the Pope of Rome." "And I
                        shouldn't mind offerin' it to him," is the reply, given with some heat. The
                        little man feels driven into a corner. "No man's above tuppence," he
                        repeats, "I don't care who it is great or small--and if he is, he's no
                        gentleman." The conversation seems in some danger of becoming personal, and
                        the little man s not indisposed to be noisy. Therefore he of the red hair
                        seeks to pacify, by remarking, "Of course, there's a good deal in what you
                        say; "but the white glare of electric light shining on engines and long
                        lines of carriages, and a glistening net of rails, warns us that we are
                        drawing near to Paddington. We wonder whether the little man will put the
                        engine-driver to the test this time.</p>
                    <p>There are so many in our compartment, and we have, most of us, so much to
                        collect, flowers and bags and umbrellas, that the little man, still keeping
                        close to his red-haired friend, has a considerable start-but the train is a
                        long one, and we may yet come up with him. As I pass the engine, I notice
                        the driver standing beside it. He is looking wrathfully up the platform, and
                        murmuring oaths to himself. I follow his gaze and perceive our travelling
                        companion explaining something colubly to the red-haired one, who stands
                        patiently by. The little man looks crestfallen, there are tears in his eyes,
                        and he seems a little unsteady of his legs; the great black moustache adds,
                        by its very fierceness, to the pathos of the scene. "The first time I've
                        known such a thing happen, sir, believe me, I can't undstand it, nat
                        anyhow," he says, as I pass. He is quite crushed, and his day as been
                        completely spoiled; on such trail props deos human happiness rest. He will
                        never care to look back upon this outing now, after such public disgrace. It
                        seems a pity that the engine-driver would not take it, after all. </p>

                    <head>EGYPTOLOGICAL BOOKS</head>
                    <p>The first par of the second volume of 'Le Musee Egyptien' has been published,
                        and keeps fairly up to the high level of its predecessor. As this last dates
                        back to 1890, it may be as well to remind the reader that it aims at
                        reproducing in somewhat luxurious form the most striking Egyptian monuments
                        which do not appear fully elsewhere. Among the seventeen plates here given,
                        two of the most striking are those of the statue of Mentuhotep discovered at
                        Deir el-Bahari in 1901 by Mr. Howard Carter. M. Maspero, who writes the
                        accompanying description, reminds us that he at first attributed the statue,
                        on grounds that he now seems to have been insufficent, to Mentuhotep I., but
                        that Dr. Naville's and mr. Hall's subsequent disocoveries have convinced him
                        that the person depicted is Mentuhotep V. He has a very curious theory to
                        account for the fact that the bust of the statue is carefully worked, and
                        that the strong, keen face looks as if it must have been an excellent
                        portrait of the living model, while the lower part of the figure is not only
                        clumsy, but dues not even coincide with the Egyptian canon of proportion. M.
                        Maspero's explanation is that the statue was for use at the Hab-sed
                        festival, where the king was exhibited to his subjects at the top of a
                        staircase in imitation of the god Osiris, and that, seen from below, the
                        figure would appear in drawing. He also thinks that the statue was put in
                        the tomb where it was found, in default of the corpse, Mentuhotep being
                        either slain in battle or assassinated. This may be; but was not the whole
                        purpose of the Hed-sed ceremony the exhibition of the deified, but living
                        king, for adoration; and is there any evidence that he was ever replaced by
                        a statue.</p>
                    <p>M. Revillout has published in the Recue Egyptologique a full translation from
                        the demotic of "The Romance of Petibast," from which he seeks to prove,
                        among other things, that the twenty-second, or Bubastite dynasty, founded by
                        the Biblical Shishak or Sheshong, was of Asiatic origin, and connected with
                        those "Ethiopians" who, according to the Book of Chronicles, invaded Judah
                        in the reign of Asa. M. Revillout, who is seldom without some quarrel on his
                        hands, this time falls foul of the Viennese scholar Dr. Krall, of whom he
                        speaks in incontinent terms.</p>
                    <p>General Frey, who was the commander of the French contingent in the
                        expedition for the relief of Pekin as published a small book in which he
                        seeks to show that the Annamites must be descended from the Egyptians,
                        because both nations used hieroglyphs and the signs are in many instances
                        the same. Had the gallant officer carried his researches into ancient
                        scripts a little further, he would have found, that all pictographs portray,
                        for the most part, the same objects, the number of things at the disposal of
                        archaic man for use as symbols being apparently strictly limited. Thus, the
                        eye, the hand, the disc of the sun, and the crescent of the moon can be
                        found nearly everywhere.</p>

                    <head>FROM ITALY.</head>
                    <p>KING'S INTEREST IN AGRICULTURE</p>
                    <p>(From Our Correspondent)</p>
                    <p>The King of Italy has again given further evidence of the great interest he
                        takes on all matters affecting agriculture, by his attendance at the
                        Agricultural Exhibition, held in Cuneo. The visit was by no means a formal
                        one, his Majesty, who was accompanied by the Queen, making a careful
                        inspection of each section. The King appeared to be greatly pleased with the
                        general excellence of the exhibits.</p>
                    <p>The question of olive culture is again very much to the fore, and his Majesty
                        is showing much interest in the proposed efforts to restore what was at one
                        time one of Italy's greatest sources of revenue. For that purpose the
                        Government is to be asked to grant the money necessary to exterminate the
                        olive fly, which has wrought almost as much damage to olive crops in the
                        past as did the cotton worm to the cotton crop in Egypt. In the interests of
                        olive culture, it is reasonably hoped that the Government will do all in
                        their power to assist the cultivators, just as in Egypt the Ministry of the
                        Interior gave their support to the movement to eradicate the cotton worm,
                        and as in France the destruction of all insects injurious to any kind of
                        cultivation is imposed by law.</p>
                    <p>Mention of the Italian efforts in this direction, recalls attention to the
                        fact that formerly olive growing was a great industry in Egypt. Why cannot
                        the industry be revived? Surely the matter should be well worth the
                        attention of agriculturists.</p>

                    <head>IN A JAPANESE HOSPITAL</head>
                    <p>An English nurse in Tokio, writing "The Hospital," Nursing Section, says:</p>
                    <p>The hospital, which is built on the pavillion system, has accommodation for
                        about 4,300 patients, but at the time of my visit with another nurse only
                        about 1,500 were being nursed within its walls. The officers are nursed in
                        the older building, and have small single rooms, containing a bed of the
                        Lawson Tait pattern, a small table, and a few other necessaries. The
                        ordinary Tommes aer nursed in wards constructed since the outbreak of
                        hostilities, raised wooden building with iron roofs, boarded floors, and
                        bare wooden walls. The ventilation seemed good, plenty of sliding windows
                        and ventilators worked by pulleys, all of ground glass.</p>
                    <p>Many of the wards contain 38 beds, arranged in double rows, not much space
                        between and certainly not arranged for bulky people. The beds area all
                        wooden, sort of oblong narrow boxes, raised about eight inches from the
                        floor, with bamboo mattresses, small hard bolsters (suggestive of
                        knapsacks), and the usual Japanese pitons (padded quilts), covered with
                        unbleached cotton material. A few of the beds had bright scarlet blankets,
                        but our guide said that these were chiefly resereved for the cold season. A
                        narrow board, fixed to the head of each bed, serves as a table for medicine
                        bottles, teacups, pipes, tobacco, books, etc., and, of course, the
                        inevitable fan. Some of the patients had small photographs and pictures
                        fastened to the walls, while others had scraps of heather or a few wild
                        flowers in small bottles, and quite a number sported small glass bowls of
                        gold fish.</p>
                    <p>The surgical patients, many of whom were hopping round on crutches, looked
                        particularly bright and happy. Several of them were suffereing from the
                        effects of frost-bite, one having had all his toes amputated and another
                        hand. They all wear white kimonos with a small red cross on the left sleeve,
                        those well enough to go outside the wards being provided with round white
                        caps, also adorned with a red cross. A large proportion of the medical
                        patients were undergoing treatment for beri-beri, or kakke, as the Japanese
                        call it. Massage is given extensively for these cases also galvanism. There
                        were a few cases of malaria, also a sprinkling of pneumonias and a very
                        small proportion of enterics.</p>
                    <p>Outside each ward is a large black slab, giving details of the patients'
                        diseases, also stating whether they are able to walk or require to be
                        carried. Small wooden tags with patient's name, regiment, etc., are hung
                        outside the ward doors, a corresponding tag being fastened to each bed.</p>
                    <p>The critical cases are nursed in small two-bedded wards, furnished as simply
                        as the larger ones, only that the beds are provided with green mosquito
                        nets. We saw several men with ber-beri of the severe type, but were told
                        that these were improving under treatment. One man had been operated on for
                        cancer of the stomach, another had traumatic pleurisy--the result of a
                        bullet wound – another had partial paralysis, caused by a bullet wound in
                        the spine. We saw a case of meningitis, and an advanced tuberculosis.
                        Enterics were very much in the minority.</p>
                    <p>Dressings were being done in a sort of surgery, those patients unable to walk
                        being carried across on stretchers. There was a large centre table covered
                        with brown American cloth, on which stood various instrument sterilisers all
                        bubbling away vigorously, large glass jars of corrosive sublimate, lysol and
                        alcohol, also jars of gauze, cases of wool, etc. The instruments in use were
                        lying in antiseptic solution, in covered metal trays. The dressers wear
                        white over-alls and appear to work to with bare arms. Dressing macintoshes
                        are conspicuous by their absence, sheets of oiled paper being used
                        instead.</p>
                    <p>One poor fellow, with six bullet-wounds in the upper arm, was sitting like a
                        statue, while the dresser probed vigorously. It must have been
                        excruciatingly painful, for the man looked ghastly, and the perspiration
                        streamed off his face, but he made no sound – Japanese pluck.</p>

                        requires the addition of water to make it ready for use. It is quickly and
                        easily applied with a whitewash brush, with half the labour and at one third
                        the cost of paint. HALL’S DISTEMPER ensures cleanliness, and is pleasing to

                        DISTEMPER is of special value in hot climates. Owing to its cool, pleasing
                        colours, great weather-resisting and germ-destroying properties, it lends
                        itself to every kind of wall, wood, brick or stone coating, possessing all

                        "TIMES."</head>
                    <p>The announcement that Lord Carson has</p>
                    <p>resigned the great office which he has filled</p>
                    <p>with sch exceptional distinction for nearly</p>
                    <p>seven years will be received with deep regret</p>
                    <p>throughout the British Empire. Deep also</p>
                    <p>will he the sorrow with which his innumerable</p>
                    <p>friends and admirers will read the correspondence</p>
                    <p>which has preceded his decision ....</p>
                    <p>The truth seems to he that Lord Carton</p>
                    <p>never abandoned the hope of bringing the</p>
                    <p>Home Government round to his view of the</p>
                    <p>controversy between the India Government</p>
                    <p>and Lord Kitchener. The Home Government</p>
                    <p>were determined not to take his view; and, as</p>
                    <p>we said when the first batch of papers on the</p>
                    <p>matter was issued, we believe that, in spite of</p>
                    <p>the weighty arguments and authorities urged</p>
                    <p>upon the other side, their decision was on the</p>
                    <p>whole right and wise. We cannot keep thinking</p>
                    <p>he would have been bettor advised had be not</p>
                    <p>withdrawn his first resignation. He says that</p>
                    <p>when he left England the Government knew</p>
                    <p>that he disagreed wholly with their proposals.</p>
                    <p>He must himself have known that, this being</p>
                    <p>so, it woold be extremely difficult for him to</p>
                    <p>carry them out. He alleges that he loyally</p>
                    <p>commenced the attempt, and we do not for</p>
                    <p>one moment donbt that this was his intention,</p>
                    <p>but the task was in practice impossible for a</p>
                    <p>man with his strong convictions. Lord Curzon</p>
                    <p>has proved himself to be the greatest Viceroy</p>
                    <p>of our times as Lord Kitchener is the greatest</p>
                    <p>of our younger soldiers. They are both men</p>
                    <p>whom the Empire can ill spare, and it is</p>
                    <p>lamentable that one of them should withdraw</p>
                    <p>from a position which he has filled with such</p>
                    <p>splendid ability, because their views on a great</p>
                    <p>question of Indian policy are irreconcilable.</p>
                    <p>Lord Curson, we trust, will soon find another</p>
                    <p>field for his high and varied gifts.</p>

                    <p>The whole nation will deplore the failure to reconcile differences between
                        these two great men, and will regret above all that Lord Curzon has been
                        made to feel that than has been a lack of straight forwardness and perfect
                        candour in the treatment he has received. His brilliant services must not be
                        lost to the country. With Lord Cromer, Lord Milner, and Lord Kitchener, he
                        ranks among the greatest living Englishman who have served in the King’s
                        Dominions beyond the Seas. We cannot leave the matter without pointing out
                        that in this, as in so many of its notions, Mr Balfour’s Government has made
                        difficult situations still more embarrassing by a task of simple directness
                        and firm adhesion to lines of policy when they have been once laid down.
                        Strong and decided Governments, composed of men of first-rate ability, are
                        alone worthy to be served by strong and able men.</p>

                        desirous of extending his term beyond the normal limit. In several cases,
                        which it is needless to review, he had pursued a policy that was not in

                        services which he had rendered during his first five years of office had

                        Secretary of State is fairly entitled to claim that he bad endeavoured to
                        give Lord Curzon constant support in the many measures of administrative
                        reform which he had initiated, including the partition of Bengal, on which

                        has indeed been privileged to render splendid service to the British Empire!
                        Alas! that that fruitless piece of gasconading adventure, the expedition to
                        Tibet, should remain an indelible blot on a record of such brillian

                    <p>The White Paper issued yesterday will, we think, prove a final plea for a
                        strong administration at Downing street. For although our sympathies are on
                        the whole with Lord Curzon in this affair, we are bound to add that the
                        Viceroy has been hoist with his own petard. It was Lord Curzon who reared
                        the Russian bogey against which Lord Kitchener has taken action. It was Lord
                        Curzon and his friends who repeatedly endeavoured to pierce and fortify the
                        "cactus hedge," as Lord Rosebery called India's land frontier, and who
                        declared, with Lord Roberts, that invasion is a real peril.</p>

                        concerned, to a brilliant career. India would be more inclined to welcome
                        the Earl of Minto if the circumstances of his succession were happier. His

                        two strong personalities such as the late Viceroy of India and Lord
                        Kitchener would end in a conflict, and the resignation of one of them. The
                        "Debats" praises very highly Lord Curzon's work in Central and Southern
                        Asia, where his policy, founded on a thorough personal knowledge of the
                        problems, has extended the range of British influence, added to her
                        commercial prosperity, and consolidated her political power. Lord Curzon is
                        described as one of those great administrators whom England has always been
                        able to find in the ranks of her aristocracy or amongst her merchant
                        princes. Like many other Englishmen of his class he has devoted his time,
                        his brains, and fortune to the study of "the great game," fitting himself
                        for a high position, and exercising its functions, for for gain, but out of
                        pure pride in them, so he has retired sooner than do what he thought to be

                        continuance, which may mean the success, of the Porsmouth Peace Conference.
                        But there is hardly a voice raised throughout the world in tones of
                        confidence: optimism has vanished in a cloud of despair. Briefly, the
                        situation seems to be just what it was when the envoys first came together.
                        Willing and able to find the way of agreement on all minor matters, the two
                        Governments are directly and obstinately at variance on the essential points
                        of the discussion. Japan demands the cession of Saghalien and the payent of
                        an indemnity. Russia will give neither an inch of territory nor a pound of
                        money. If these be really, as we are led to believe, the respective
                        attitudes of the belligerents, it is plain that neither Mr. Roosevelt nor
                        any one else can prevent the frightful calamities of a new campaign.</p>

                        different in kind from Rissia's. She has, in our opinion, quite as much to
                        gain from a settlement now as Russia. She has won all the victories and she
                        can go on winning more. But she cannot feel certain that further victories
                        will increase the strength of her diplomatic position. If the war continues
                        she will capture Vladivostok, and in all probability inflict another great
                        defeat on the Russian army in Manchuria. But the ut-most that she could hope
                        for would be to drive Russia out of Manchuria and to deprive her of her
                        Pacific provinces.</p>

                    <head>COTTON GROWING IN NORTHERN NIGERIA. (FROM THE "BULLETIN OF THE IMPERIAL
                        INSTITUTE.")</head>
                    <p>A series of articles has appeared in previous numbers of the "Bulletin of the
                        Imperial Institute," giving an account of the present state and future
                        prospects of cotton growing in various parts of the world, both British and
                        foreign. A memorandum on this subject by the High Commissioner of Northern
                        Nigeria, compiled from reports prepared by Resident Officers in
                        Protectorate, has been received recently at the IMperial Institute, from
                        which the following information is taken.</p>
                    <p>Northern Nigeria is one of the most promising of the new fields that are
                        being opened up to join in supplying Lancashire with cotton. It stretches
                        for 700 miles from the French territory of Dahomey on the west, to Lake Chad
                        and the German Cameroons on the east and for over 400 miles from the French
                        Sudan on the north, to the boundaries of Lagos and Southern Nigeria on the
                        south. The rivers Niger and Benue traverse it near its southern boundary,
                        and numerous tributaries flow from the north into these; so that the country
                        is well supplied with water ways, which afford easy means of transporting
                        the cotton from the interior to the coast for shipment to England. The light
                        railway from Zungeru to Zaria, which is contemplated, will also open up new
                        districts suitable for cotton cultivation.</p>
                    <p>In this part of Africa the districts near the coast are covered with heavy
                        forests; palm oil, rubber, and other industries are carried on with which
                        cotton cannot compete in point of attractiveness to the native, and the
                        rainfall is too heavy to be favorable to cotton growing. Further inland the
                        country becomes more open, and in Norhern Nigeria the southern boundary of
                        which is 200 miles from the sea, the rainfall is moderate though sufficient;
                        and there is a much better prospect of the development of an export trade in
                        cotton, notwithstanding the competition of other industries.</p>
                    <p>Large areas of land are suitable for cotton growing, which has been practised
                        by the natives for many hundreds of years. The native cotton is reported by
                        an expert of the British Cotton Growing Association, who visited the country
                        in 1904, to be fine and white of good strength, not quite as smooth as
                        American, and to be about one inch in staple and to be suitable for use in
                        Lancashire in unlimited quantities. He formed a most favorable opinion of
                        the possibilities of cotton growing in this Protectorate, and stated that
                        the soil was well adapted for growing American seed. Imported seed has been
                        taken eagerly by the natives, and has given yields considerably above those
                        given by the indigenous variety. It is believed that cotton cultivation will
                        bring with it many improvements in the agriculture of the country such as
                        the use of imporved implements, ploughs, carts, and the use of draught
                        animals. Oxen, horses, mules, and asses thrive in Northern Nigeria, although
                        they fail on the coast, so that their use in agriculture is possible.</p>
                    <p>As regards the steps to be taken to develop the industry, there are two
                        methods of attaining an export trade in cotton: the first is to encourage
                        the native production as much as possible; the second is, by the creation of
                        large plantations under European supervision. It is considered that the
                        former of these is the one to which the efforts of the Government should be
                        directed, and such efforts need be no hindrance to the development of the
                        second plan.</p>
                    <p>Reports coming from the residents in charge of the various districts into
                        which Northern Nigeria is divided, show how widely cotton cultivation is
                        extended throughout this protectorate. The report from the province of Nupe
                        is very full, and from it the following details are gathered.</p>
                    <p>This province is especially well suited to the cotton industry. It lies on
                        the north bank of the Niger, and is traversed by many tributary streatms, so
                        that the most distant centres of cotton growing are nwhere more than two
                        days' journey from a river. Cotton is already grown throughout the province,
                        the best districts being situated near the Gurara and Bako rivers and to the
                        west of the Kaduna river. Up to October, 1903, however, the crop was only
                        grown to supply local needs. The plan adopted in the neighbourhood of the
                        market town of Bida will serve to give an idea of the native methods of
                        growing and employing cotton.</p>
                    <p>The crop is raised on small patches of only one or two tenths of an acre in
                        area, and these only form some half percent of the cultivated land of the
                        farm. The cotton is grown on land which has been used for some time for
                        millet. A pieceof new land is first cleared of the long grass and small
                        trees that occupy it; the roots are then removed, and mounds of earth about
                        a foot high and four feet apart are scraped up by means of rude hoes. These
                        are made from local iron, and might with advantage be replaced by light
                        English hoes such as are used in India. Crop after crop of "dawa" (that in
                        guinea corn or great millet, Sorghum vulgdre), and "gero" (African millet),
                        which are sown together on each mound, are taken off the land, until ony
                        very poor yields are obtained. The land is then allowed to lie fallow for a
                        few years; after which a good patch is selected and the cotton is planted
                        during July and August when the soil is well saturated by rain, the seed
                        being dibbled in in the centre of the old mounds.</p>
                    <p>The quantity of seed used is much less than s customary in Egypt, where from
                        eight to fifteen seeds are placed in each hole, and about 1 1/8 bushels of
                        seed is used per acre. Here the plants are much farther apart, namely, four
                        feet each way, and only three or four seeds are placed in each hole; so that
                        two or three pounds of seed is all that is required per acre, and the need
                        for thinning th eyoung plants is avoided. About six or seven thousand plants
                        mature per acre. The distance between the plants is, as a rule, too great,
                        and involves a loss both in labour and yield. The rains are usually good,
                        consequently irrigation is not needed.</p>
                    <p>The first picking, which is the best of three, is made in December, and may
                        amount to two or three hundred pounds per acre; the second picking takes
                        place some forty days later and yields about half the quantity, and the
                        third and final picking is completed in February; it is of poor quality and
                        amounts to only about one-third of the first. The yield per acre has not yet
                        been ascertained with any precision; but it is thought not to exceed 500 lb.
                        of seed cotton (that is, the seed with the lint attached) per acre on the
                        average, though it has been estimated at a much higher figure than this on
                        good soil in a good season.</p>
                    <p>The cost of the labour devoted to cotton is very small; but as the farmer's
                        family help in the work it cannot be ascertained with exactitude, and the
                        following estimates in terms of one day's work of one man must be taken as
                        being only rough approximations. The total labour given to a crop may be
                        taken as being 62 days' work per acre, distributed into 24 days for the
                        preliminary clearing, 2 days for the sowing, 6 days for each of four
                        weedings and 4 days ofr each of the three pickings. On a native farm the
                        cost per day for a labourer may be estimated at 385 cowries, or about 1 ½ d.
                        (250 cowries are about equivalent to 1d.); so that the labour involved in
                        growing a cotton crop amounts to only 7s. 9d. per acre. It should be noted,
                        however, that on a plantation conducted by white men the full rate of 9d. a
                        day would have to be paid.</p>
                    <p>The retail prices of seed cotton at Bida is approximately 1d per lb.; and the
                        Niger Company are buying all the cotton they can get at Egga and other
                        riverside stations at this prices. The grower, however, does not receive
                        more than half of this, unless he brings his crop to market and sells it
                        there himself. he usually disposes of it to women traders, who come to his
                        farm and carry it away. Thus for a crop of 500 lb. per acre he would receive
                        £3 oz 10 d., which would give him 4 d. a day for the sixty two days' work.
                        This estimate shows that under favorable conditions the cultivation of
                        cotton is fairly profitable.</p>
                    <p>It is judged that one farmer, with the help of his family, could cultivate
                        five acres of cotton without interfering with the raising of his usual food
                        crops. The important question arises whether he can be induced to do this.
                        One incentive that might be tried is the enactment that part of his tribute
                        should be paid in cotton; and it is hoped that the security for property and
                        the freedom from exactions now resulting from the administration of justice
                        will afford an inducement which did not exist before under the Falani rule,
                        and will before long be appreciated and produce its effect.</p>
                    <p>Some remarks on the native trade in cotton, when ininfluenced by the recent
                        opportunities for exporting it, will aid in forecasting the future. The
                        women traders referred to above carry the cotton to the market and sell it
                        to other women, who gin it and spin it by the most laborious processes. A
                        woman buying 16 lb of seed cotton for 400 cowries (16). gins it in one day,
                        and sells the resulting pound of cotton seed for 250 cowries (1d), to be
                        used as food. In three days more she can spin the lint into yarn for the
                        local weavers, and sell it for 1,000 cowries (4d); she thus clears 850
                        cowries (3 4d) for her four days' labour; that is, 212 5 cowries or 0 85d.
                        per day. The Niger Company is now offering 4d. per lb. for ginned cotton. If
                        the woman after ginning the 1 6 lb f seed cotton sells the resulting ½ lb of
                        lint instead of spinning it, she will receive 2d for the lint and 1d for the
                        seed, and clear 1 4d, for her day's work; it is therefore greatly to her
                        advantage to sell the lint to the company.</p>
                    <p>This advantage, however, will not be shared with the farmer; but it is
                        thought that by introducing ginning machines some of the benefit will reach
                        him and so stimulate a greater inclination to grow cotton. The present cost
                        of ginning 100 lb. of seed cotton by hand may be taken as 8s. 4d; in
                        Togoland a machine gin was used, actuated by an improvised gear employing
                        man-power as the driving agent, and the cost was 1a for ginning the same
                        quantity. In Egypt a 40 inch knife gin, capable of ginning 315 lb of seed
                        cotton per hour, costs £22; it requires 3 ½ horse power to drive it, and the
                        price charged to the growers is only 5 ¾ d. per 100 lb. That gins can be
                        worked by the natives is shown by the considerable success that attended the
                        presentation of one by the Niger Company to the Emir of Bida sixteen years
                        ago. The gain by using machinery is thus very great, and in time the farmer
                        might be induced to bring his cotton to gins established at various centres,
                        and reap some of the benefit of the saving in labour. He might possibly get
                        10s. for the lint and 4s. for the seed for every 100 lb. of seed cotton he
                        produced, thus receiving £3 10s per acre, instead of the £1 os. 10d he
                        realises at present.</p>
                    <p>As a first step in this direction it is suggested that gins might be
                        presented to the chiefs of various towns, who should be allowed to charge a
                        fair rate for ginning, but make no other profit. A fair rate to allow for
                        carriage to the market would be 1 s 6 1 per day's march for 100 lb.</p>
                    <p>At present the farming of the province is almost entirely devoted to growing
                        food crops, and locally they are more frofitable than cotton, but the demand
                        for them is limited to the immediate neighbourhood of the farms; they will
                        not bear the cost of transport to a distance, whilst cotton can be easily
                        transported with a view to profit.</p>
                    <p>The immediate steps to be taken should evidently be in the direction of
                        inducing the native be in the direction of inducing the native farmers to
                        grow ore cotton; but the possibilities of growing this staple on large
                        plantations should not be overlooked. On the one hand the European would
                        have to pay much more for his labour than the native farmer, namely, the
                        full rate of 9d a day; but on the other hand he could effect economies by
                        the use of horse-drawn ploughs and by employing wheeled vehicles for
                        transport. There is abundant labour available near the villages, and an
                        enormous extent of good cotton soil practically untouched; but such projects
                        should only be taken up by firms with large resources and after careful
                        investigation. </p>

                    <p>LE KRACH CRONIER ET LA SOCIETE DES SUCRERIES ET RAFFINERIE D'EGYPTE.</p>
                    <p>Nous recevons d'un corresondant la communication suivante:</p>
                    <p>Les actions de la Societe des Sucreries et Raffinerie d'Egypte fort
                        depreciees depuis quel ques mois ont degringole a fr 83 a la suite du
                        suicide du President du Conseil d'Administration. Une baisse aussi
                        considerable ne pentguere etre attribuee aua une panique, car il est douteux
                        qu'on connaisse deja l'etundue du prejudice qu'a pu causer a la societe la
                        deconfiture de M/ Cronier. Il faudrait pour quure baisse de la moitie de la
                        valeur de l'action soit justifiee que la Societe ait perdu plus du tiers de
                        son actif soit plus de 30 millions. Or une telle perte n'est pas possible vu
                        qu'un sixieme tout au plus du capital est liquide on tout au moins apte a
                        devenir liquide; tout le reste de l'actif est immobilise et ne peut etre
                        realise d'emblee.</p>
                    <p>On peut encore supposer que Cronier a engage la societe dans des speculations
                        malheureuses, mais la aussi les faits semblent plutot prouver que Societe
                        agissait contrairement aux interets de Cronier. Tandis que les speculateurs
                        a la hausse accaparaient les sucres de la place, la Societe de Sucreiries et
                        Taffinerie d'Egypte en profitait pour jeter sur le marche des quantites
                        enormes de sucre qui entravaient certainement la hausse provoquee par oet
                        accaparement. Les statistiques doua nieres attestant qu'il a ete exporte par
                        la Societe pendant les neuf prmiers mois de l'exercice actuel (soit de
                        Novembre a Juillet dernier) du sucre pour 8 millions ¼ de francs de plus que
                        pendant la periode correspondante de l'annee derniere.</p>
                    <p>Loin d'agir ainsi elle cendait alors que Cronier et les autres speculateurs
                        achetaient. Iln'y a dono, autant qu'on peut en juger, aucune apparence que
                        la Societe des Sucreries ait fait cause commune avec son president.</p>
                    <p>Il reste une derniere hypothese, a savoir que Cronier soit un debiteur
                        important de la Societe par suite d'achats de sucre qu;il aurait pu faire
                        pour realiser aussitot apres et se crear de la sorte des ressources
                        immediates pour faire face aux exigences de la speculation. Dans ce cas les
                        pertes seraient encore limitees. Quoiqu'il en soit, il est bon de ne point
                        exagerer les choses et de ne pas perdre de vue que la Societe des Sucreries
                        et Raffinerie d'Egypte, a la condition d'etre bien geree, deviendra une des
                        entreprises les plus prosperes d'Egypte.</p>

                        obligatoire dans toute l"egypte, qu'il serait preferable, en raison de la
                        persistance de la morve a Alexandrie, que reglementation fut elaboree, vu
                        l'urgence que presente la question, par la Municipalite elle-meme, pour le
                        perimetre de la ville d'Alexandrie.</p>

                    <p>La Cie des Tramways ayant demande, en vue d'eviter des accidents eventuels, a
                        rectifier quelques-unes de ses courbes, en ecartant davantage les voies, la
                        Delegation l'y autorise, en principe, sauf a la Cie a soumettre au prealable
                        a l'administration, un plan indiquant les emplacements ou elle se propose
                        d'apporter ces modifications ainsi que la largeur de l'ecartement des voies
