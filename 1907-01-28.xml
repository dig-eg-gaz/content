                    <head>THE GERMAN ELECTIONS.</head>
                    <p>Our telegrams state that the most important election ever held in Germany has
                        resulted in favour of the Kaiser and a Government majority seems now
                        certain. The issue was of enormous importance, for the Germans had to choose
                        between two alternatives, whether the Hohenzollern dynasty was to dictate
                        the policy of the Empire without asking popular advice, or whether the
                        people were to have &amp; larger share of self government and a more final
                        control of their own taxation. The German people, as the results of the
                        elections show, have decided that they wish to be governed directly by the
                        Emperor and his representatives in preference to exercising themselves a
                        controlling influence over their own destiny Heine says somewhere that an
                        Englishman loves liberty steadily as he loves his lawful wife, a Frenchman
                        passionately as a mistress, but a German’s love of liberty is as a man’s
                        love for his grandmother.</p>
                    <p>The truth of this comparison is seen in these elections. The German people
                        are just awakening to self-consciousness, and with it to an intense desire
                        for a larger share in the control of administration. They think that if
                        colonial policy costs money, they ought to have an equal vote with their
                        Sovereign in colonial policy. The last vote of the late Reichstag directly
                        impaired the prerogative implied in the Kaiser’s claim to be War-Lord, for

                        African possessions, where war is actually raging. The Emperor therefore, in

                    <p>asking his people whether they really meant him to give way before the
                        opposition of his dark subjects in South Africa. He determined on a bold
                        course, and by dissolving the Reichstag called on the people of Germany to
                        stultify the decision and authority of their representative body. The
                        Kaiser’s action clearly showed the German people thta he was ready to
                        disallow the authority of the Reichstag, and that it was the duty of his
                        subjects to simply obey and give him the means which he thinks his military
                        policy requires. The German people have replied the Emperor’s challenge with
                        all due sub missiveness and have given him a majority instead of returning a
                        Reichstag which would demand full control over its own finances. In other
                        words, they havo deliberately thrown away their rights to a larger share of
                        self government for the sake of the Kaiser’s Wel Politik. The issue was
                        clearly put before the German people, and neither the Emperor nor his
                        opponents endeavoured to minimise the momentous nature of the struggle.</p>
                    <p>Herr Maximilian Harden, in his weekly review, “Die Zukunft,” describing the
                        issues before the German people in the elections, said:— “We want to rule
                        ourselves as well and as conscientiously as we can. The German may be proud
                        of much that his country has produced. The German peasant, artisan, soldier,
                        and business man can hold his own with any. There is great activity among
                        the arts, in industry, in banking, in commerce, and at least as much is
                        accomplished as in other countries and with scanty means. . . . But we are
                        badly governed, and the most important State institutions no longer satisfy
                        the demands of the times. In international politics we Can do nothing
                        considerable for years to come, thanks partly to Uncle Edward and partly to
                        our own fault. . . . Things cannot possibly go worse than they have under a
                        Hohenlohe or a Bulow ; our next aim must be to assure Parliamentary
                        government.” These opinions were re-echoed throughout all the Liberal and
                        Socialist Press of the Fatherland. The appeals on the other side were no
                        less vigorous The Conservative “Reichsbote ’’(Berlin, Jan. 8)says :—“A
                        determining fight has begun for the maintenance of our national honour, for
                        the future, even for the very existence, of the Empire. The German people
                        must now prove whether they can keep sacred the hardly won fruits of 1870,
                        or whether egotism and political and national indifference have consumed the
                        springs of life of the German nation, and will now deliver the latter over
                        to the dominion of elements owning no Fatherland. ... If the anti-national
                        parties are returned to the Reichstag in undiminished force, this will be
                        the signal for joint action by Germany’s foes ; it will be the prelude to a
                        great struggle for the annihilation of everything German, which has for
                        years been the dream of the Slav, Romanic, and Anglo-Saxon worlds. . . .
                        During the past few years the German Empire has forfeited much of its former
                        prestige, a fact which is due partly to want of firmness on the part of the
                        Government, but chiefly to the deplorable attitude assumed by our Imperial
                        Parliament. The security of the Empire demands imperatively that our
                        national prestige abroad shall not suffer further. The 25th of January
                        decides. If on that day victory is with those who on Dec. 13 refused to
                        grant a vote for South-West Africa, if victory is with Ultramontanism, which
                        is inimical to the Empire, the time will have come when our enemies will
                        believe the moment for revenge has arrived. We shall then in a very short
                        time hear the rattle of musketry in the Vosges; Polish hordes will carry
                        fire and sword through the East of the Empire, and the thunder of the
                        'Dreadnought’s’ guns will roar off the German emporium of Hamburg. We shall
                        have peace only if Germany is united and strong.”</p>
                    <p>From a purely impartial view of the election results it is clear that,
                        despite the great progress of the Socialist Party during the last few years,
                        the masses of the German people are still unconscious of the elements of
                        political emancipation and prefer to be governed by an autocrat rather than
                        by parliamentary principles such as prevail in England. After all, their
                        decision may be politically a sound one, but that is for the historians of
                        the future to decide.</p>
                    <p>Although no definite decision has been arrived at with regard to the opening
                        of the next Reichstag, it is believed in trustworthy quarters that the
                        opening ceremony will take place either on February 14 or February 19. It is
                        not likely that the Reichstag will sit longer than four months at the most.
                        Its work will consist in bringing forward and voting upon the supplementary
                        credits, the next Budget, the projected law with regard to professional
                        societies, and perhaps, if necessary, one or other of the treaties of
                        commerce which have been left in abeyance for the time. All other measures
                        will be postponed until the Session of next autumn.</p>

                        Evangelical community in Cairo is progressing favourably. Already several
                        meetings of the leading members of the colony have been held, and at the

                        arms was finally adjusted, and amidst another exchange of official
                        handshakes the interesting function was brought to a olose.</p>
                    <p>The crowd, which had considerably increased while the ceremony was in
                        progress, preserved a most respectful demeanour, and made no demonstration

                        Port Said for Odessa late on Saturday night. They were put upon a special
                        train from Alexandria at Hadra station and, accompanied by police and an
                        escort from the Russian Consulate here, they were taken to, Port Said, where
                        they were embarked on a Russian steamer. The special train was ran direct
                        from Hadra to Port Said without changing. An officer of the Alexandria City
                        Police and twenty Russian detectives were also on the train.</p>
                    <p>THE POLICE CHARGES</p>
                    <p>The only charge brought by the authorities of the Alexandria Government
                        against any British aubject is that against <persName>Mr. William Patrick
                            Foley</persName>. This man will ba tried as soon as the summons is
                        issued, which will be done on the application of the police authorities. The
                        charges against the subjects of other Powers for taking part in tbe
                        disorders have not yet been made ont, because it is first neccessary for the
                        Egyptian authorities to draw ap "process-verbaux” in such cases, but this
                        procedure is not needed in the case of a British subject, against whom it is
                        only necessary to issue a summons. </p>

                    <p>DANCE AT TEWFIK PLACE</p>
                    <p>The dance at the Tewfik Palaoe Hotel no Saturday night formed a very fitting
                        conclusion to the enjoyable week of festivities at Helouan. The finals of
                        the tennis tournament had been played off that morning, <persName>Mrs.
                            Macintosch Walker</persName> and <persName>Mr. Tomlinson</persName>
                        carrying everything before them; and in spite of the hard work of the last
                        few days anrd nights everybody was in excellent form for the last event of
                        the season. There was a large dinner party at the Grand that night at which
                            <persName>Messrs. Gunter</persName> and <persName>Macnaghten</persName>
                        presided; and the dining-room at the Tewfik has its full share of cheery
                        parties preparatory to the danee. The programms was an excellent one and a
                        most happy air of friendliness pervaded the precincts of the old palace,
                        everybody knowing everybody, and all bent on enjoying themselves. To
                        enumerate those who were present is but to recapitulate the names of those
                        who also dance 1 through the cheery hours at the Grand on Thursday; and
                        doubtless there will be other occasions in the future when the same merry
                        band of Helousuites will meet again to revive their friendships. At the
                        conclusion of the programme the tennis prizes were distributed in the hall,
                        Miss Tottenham presenting them to the victors, and Mr. Tomlinson proposing a
                        vote of thanks to the afore mentioned <persName>lady and to Mr.
                            Sawyer</persName>, both of whom had been instrumental in organizing the
                        sports. After tha distribution of prizes an adjournment was made in the
                        direction of the supper room ; and though various more sober-minded of the
                        guests took this opportanity to slip away quietly to their bedrooms, there
                        were others who continued their festivities for some time longer; and
                        strains of music penetrated the adjoining corridors till well into the early
                        hours of the morning.</p>
                    <p>While on the subject of Helouan, mention must be made of the latest addition
                        to the resources of the place in the shape of a delight-ful little chalet
                        'San Giovanni,” which has been erected this season under the anspices of
                            <persName>Mr. Springer of Al Hayat</persName>. This little cafe-
                        restaurant is situated some two miles from Helouan on the very banks of the
                        Nile and should prove a most delightfol object for an afternoon's drive or
                        ride. It is approached by an excellent road for which thanks are mainly due
                        to Hafez Effendi, that most energetic of inspectors who has already
                        performed wonders in Helouan, and who doubtless will do much more to win the
                        gratitude of the inhabitants. The chalet is a pretty building surrounded by
                        a garden, and has a wide verandah running roand it. Inside it there are
                        dainty tea and reading rooms, while while flat roof spaces as well as the
                        verandahs have also been provided with chairs and tea tables.lt is indeed a
                        delightful little retreat and should be in great quest especially in the
                        warmer weather. The view across the river is perfect; and the arrangements
                        and buildings are as complete and dainty as Mr. Springer knows how to make
                        them. For the convenience of people wishing to visit the cafe, a motor
                        serivice has been instituted, the cars starting from the railway station
                        upon the arrival the trains ; and through "San Giovanni” has only been open
                        for a few short weeks, and the weather has not proved kind to al-fresco
                        meals during that period, people are already finding their way down there in
                        increasing numbers. </p>

                    <head>HELOUAN BATHS</head>
                    <p>Of the various improvements made recently in the celebrated Halouan Bathing
                        Establishment none has been more effective than the heating apparatus which
                        has been installed this year. The old system with its wasteful boilers has
                        now been superseded by a modern hot steam apparatus which not only provides
                        a genial glow over the various rooms and passages of the establishment, but
                        which also supplies heat to the sulphar baths with wonderfal regularity and
                        expedition. Thus in under five minutes the contents of a large bath can be
                        heated to 102° Fahr. with little or no loss of its medicinal qualities; and
                        the heat can be regulated and maintained in a manner impossible under the
                        old system.</p>
                    <p>These powerful sulphur springs of Helouan have been in use from time
                        immemorial, and are still said to be the finest palliative for all rheumatic
                        and gouty complaints. Under the control of the Government the baths have
                        been equipped with all the latest modern improvements and now compare with
                        those of the best known thermal establishments of Europe. There are separate
                        wings given over to the use of ladies and gentlemen respectively, each
                        containing, in addition to the ordinary large baths in private rooms,
                        various other baths for special purposes. There are the special Helouan
                        sulphur baths in which the patient is massaged by two attendants while lying
                        immersed by the water; there are the new Vichu baths for toning and bracing
                        up the system, the patient lying on india-rubber cushions while needle
                        sprays of water, hot or cold, fall from long pipes overhead; and there are
                        the electric light baths where the patient its within a cabinet lined with
                        over forty electric lights of twenty-five rcandle pewer each. There are also
                        large unroofed swimming baths in the rear of the establishment where the
                        milky white water is somehwere foot deep, and these are well patronized
                        during warmer weather. <persName>Dr. Hobson</persName> has his consulting
                        rooms within the establishment and there is a staff of competent r u ses and
                        masseurs to carry out the treatment, the services of two female and four
                        male attendants from Harrogate being requisitioned during the season. At the
                        present moment over 100 baths are taken daily on an average ; and every year
                        sees an addition in the number of the patients who derive benefit</p>

                    <p>from these wonderful waters. The action of the sulphur contained therein is
                        incredible; it tarnishes and corrodes the metal forments of the baths almost
                        as soon as it comes in touch with them, and nothing has yet been discovered
                        to withstand it. However scrupulously clean the baths are kept the enamel is
                        very quickly discoloured by it; and where tiles or bricks are used the
                        surface becomes eaten away in a remarkably short space of time. The wear and
                        tear is consequently very high no pains nor expense are spared to keep the
                        bath and arrangements in as good a condition as possible. </p>

                        committee on the Philippines by a very decided majority of members, none of

                    <p>The bill provides that a guaranty shall be made to the company with

                        cash capital actually invested in such agricultural bank. The loans are
                        limited to $ 5,000 in any one sum, the interest charge limited to 10 per
                        cent, and no loans shall be made except for the purpose of assisting agri-
                        culture in the Philippine Islands.</p>

                    <p>Saturday’s performance of "Lohengrin” did not come up to our expectations,
                        but, to be Irish, we never expected that it would. It was not for want of
                        pains being taken; all worked with sea and seemed surprisingly satisfied
                        with the result. Nevertheless its conception was very far from meeting
                        requirements. It was hard to discover much of the solemn and ethereal
                        harmonies of the Holy Grail, the "symbol of the supra sensual,” amid the
                        almost light-hearted deportment of the orchestra and flaccid sentimentalityy
                        of the performers. The mystic was constantly being sacrificed to the
                        romantic, with a result as unhappy as it was unintelligible. No doabt
                        allowance mast be made for the drama being given in Italian by artiste,
                        whose capabilities are foreign to anything Wagnerian, and before a housee
                        which delights in emitting "bravos” at odd moments and in applauding vooal
                        gym-nasties; but these considerations are hardly sufficient to justify the
                        inadeguate manner in which the work was grasped. Since we have a good
                        all-round opera company this season, it seems a pity that they should try to
                        exceed their limtations when there is so wide a choice within their scope.
                        We are tempted to a Johnsonian reminder: "A cow is a very good animal in the
                        field, but we turn her out of a garden.” </p>

                    <p>TO THE EDITOR OF THE "EGYPTIAN GAZETTE."</p>
                    <p>Sir,—I have read with much interest in your issue of yesterday a letter
                        written by ‘A Casual Visitor” on the above subject. He points out the fact
                        that Belgian joists have been employed in the construction, and that the
                        quantity used is about 10,000 tons, a truly noble quantity tor a building of
                        its size. Secondly, he says that the college was called into existence by
                        British enterprise and generosity to commemorate our late Queen Victoria,
                        and complains that the building specifioatiou did not call for British
                        material. I have been in the building business for a number of years, both
                        in this country and in England, and have bought in my time large quantities
                        of Belgian and English joists, and my experiance has taught me that for
                        ordinary building work and such purposes as floors aud ceilings, etc., which
                        is the purpose for which they are required in this instance, Belgian joists
                        art quite good enough, although their ultimate breaking strain might be
                        somewhat lower than that of British joists of similar section. As a set off
                        against this, however, there is a difference of price, the difference being
                        as a role about £2 per ton c.i.f. Alexandria in favour of the Belgian joist,
                        so that, according to ‘A Casual Visitor’*” estimate of the quantities, the
                        committee of the Victoria College may at least congratulate themselves on
                        having saved in 10,000 tons of joists a magnificent sum of about £20,000,
                        which sum it is hoped will be need in furthering the education of the pupils
                        at the college, which might otherwise have been spent in profits to the
                        rolling mills where the British joists wotld have been made. The British
                        Chamber of Commerce can hardly be expected to have very much power in
                        influening the letting of such a contract for joists unless it can induce
                        the British manufacturers to arrive a good deal nearer the mark as regards
                        price, for it is well known among engineers that for ordinary structural
                        work the Continental joist is as suitable as, and far cheaper than the
                        British, although I am willing to admit that, for special purposes, the
                        latter area more reliable. In my opinion the 10,000 tons is rather a full
                        estimate of the quantities ; probably 300 or 400 tons would be nearer the
                        mark.</p>

                        <p>(Midnight) The results of the polling for 53 seats are known : 19 second
                            ballots will be necessary. The Socialists are the chief losers.</p>
                        <p>It is estimated that they have lost 18 seats and retained 5 in the
                            Capital, but failed in the desperate assault on the so-called “Emperor's
                            Division,” where the second ballot is expected to result in the
                            re-election of a Radical member.</p>
                        <p>The Emperor received batches of the results at the Palace. The city is
                            unusually excited. A crowd watching the results exhibited on a screen at
                            a newspaper office after the announcement of the Socialist losses,
                            marched in procession to Prince von Bulow’s palace singing the national
                            anthem.</p>
                        <p>The Prince appeared in the courtyard. Speaking behind locked gates he
                            quoted Bismarck's remark that once the German people had succeeded in
                            putting the saddle on the horse they would soon be able to ride. He said
                            that Germany to-day had shown they ware still able to ride: the whole
                            world will recognise that the German people have a firm seat and
                            overthrow everything opposing their welfare and greatness. (Reuter)</p>

                        <p>The last returns show the Socialist losses up to the present number 13
                            seats, but it is expected that they will lose still further in the
                            seoond ballots. The Centrists are holding the ground. The Conservatives
                            are gaining. A Government majority seems certain. The great feature of
                            the Socialist losses is that they have occured in centres, such as
                            Lepizg, Magdebourg, and Breelau. (Reuter)</p>

                        <p>Political circles are surprised at the greatness of the victory over the
                            Socialists. Several large towns regarded as faithful to the Socialist
                            party, such as Liepzig , Koenigsberg, Breslau, and the industrial
                            centres of Saxe and Thuringe, have a ready declared in favour of the
                            National party. Demonstrations have taken place before the Imperial
                            Castle and the Palace of the Crown Prince. The results already known
                            prove that the object of the dissolution of the Reichstag has been
                            attained. (Reuter)</p>

                            ballots. The following have been returned : 89 Deputies of the Centre,
                            29 Socialists, 41 Conservatives, 20 National Liberals, 10 of the Empire
                            Party, 18 Poles, 80 various. The Socialists lose 19 seats. Havas</p>

                        <p>Out of 397 seats, the Centre has gained 89, Conservatives 41, Sooialists
                            29, National Liberals 20, and the other groups 58. The Socialist losses
                            amount to 19 seats. There will be 160 second ballots and in 92
                            Socialists are standing. Everything now depends opon the Centre. If it
                            supports the Sooialists the latter will regain the lost ground.</p>

                            patriotic crowd on Friday night, when they prevented it from going to
                            the Emperor's Palace. An enquiry has been opened.</p>
                        <p>The Chief of the Police, in the course of an interview, stated that the
                            prohibited the demonstration because he did not wish the Emperor’s sleep

                    <p>The balance-sheet of this company for the year ended on the 30th September,
                        1906, shows a net profit amounting to L.E. 3,897.619 m/m. This sum
                        represents the results of the working of the factories of the company since
                        the profit derived from the sale of the five feddans belonging to the
                        company was partly employed in redeeming the following Items of assets :</p>
                    <p>Buildings.................................. L E. l,312</p>
                    <p>Machinery and Installations …..... 18,035</p>

                    <p>Total ….…. L.E. 16,793</p>
                    <p>The above sum of L.E. 2,289 profits brought forward from last year, and has
                        been employed in the total redemption of the "Preliminary Expenses” account.
                        The figure of LE. 3,897 could then be considered as the first benefits which
                        would enable the company to pay a dividend, but the board of directors
                        deemed it more prudent to carry forward the above sum, and to await the
                        results of the following year before making a distribution of dividend. The
                        effect of this decision will be to consolidate the present situation of the
                        company, which is already satisfactory, and to lower the estimation of its
                        stocks.</p>
                    <p>The present board ot the company consists of: Messrs. J.Rolo (chairman),
                        Eugene Debourr, Baron J. de Menaces. E Nahman, M. Salvago, A. Suarez, C. de
                        Tschidi, and G. Zervudachi. The capital of the company amounts to £150 000
                        divided into 148,500. Ordinary shares of £1 each, fully paid, and 6,000
                        D.ferred shares of 5 shillings each, fully paid. According to the statutes,
                        the profits of the company are to be distributed in the following manner :
                        After first setting aside 5 % for the Ordinary shares, the balance is to be
                        divided as follows : 5 % to the directors, 25 % to the Deferred
                        shareholders, and 70% to the Ordinary shareholders.</p>
                    <p>It is interesting to recall the fact that at the time of issure, the shares
                        of the company had reached a very high figure, but that after the
                        unsatisfactory results of the first year’s working, the shares fell from
                        £2.10 to £1.5 0. We give below the fluctuations which have taken place in
                        the quotations of Spinning shares since 1899 :</p>

                    <p>The present qutation is 3/4, but we think this is abnormally low, considering
                        the satisfactory results which may be expected in the future, and the
                        nominal price, ie., £1, does not seem to us to be too high for the present.

                    <head>THE MYSTERY OF CLEOPATRA.</head>
                    <p>MR. TREE'S PLAY REVIVES AN OLD CONTROVERSY.</p>
                    <p>According to Pascal, the size of Cleopatra’s nose influenced the course of
                        the world’s history. Now, apropos of <persName>Mr. Tree’s</persName>
                        production at His Majesty’s, controversy again rages around the personality
                        of the Alexandrian Queen, her ancestry, her style of dress and living, even
                        the colour of her eyes and complexion. <persName>Mr. Edwyn Bevan</persName>,
                        in a letter in , ‘‘The Times,” criticises the archaeological aspect of Mr.
                        Tree’s production. He sweepingly asserts that in the matter of the
                        historical correctness of scenery and costume the play "is false not in this
                        or that detail, but , radically io its whole conception.” </p>
                    <p>Commenting upon this statement, <persName>Mr. Percy Macquoid</persName>, who,
                        in collaboration with <persName>Mr. Comyns Carr</persName> and Mr. Tree, is
                        responsible for , the production, told a member of the "Daily News” staff
                        that the Court of Cleopatra was Grecco-Egyptian, and by no means pure
                        Egyptian. </p>
                    <p>"In the notes prefacing the programme of the play at His Majesty's,” he said,
                        "it is further stated that it has been thought advisable, in the mounting of
                        the production, to eliminate the Greek feeling that existed. And it is
                        perfectly certain by reference to the mummy cases and statuettes of the
                        period that Egyptian art, although then in its decadence, was still
                        conservative.”</p>
                    <p>"Can yon mention any other authority on this point?” asked the
                        representative.</p>
                    <p>‘‘Well, <persName>Henry Housaaye</persName>, an acknowledged authority on the
                        subject, assert that every where in the decoration of the Ptolemies’
                        surroundings the local colouring of Egypt was introduced. It would be wise,
                        I think, for. Mr. Bevan, before he makes the assertion that Mr. Tree’s
                        production 'is false, not in this or that detail, but radically in the whole
                        conception,' to quote some authority besides his own, to the effect that
                        Cleopatra did not inhibit a palace built by one ot her ancestors. To this
                        descent our critic refers, as being pure Greek, with the exception of 'a
                        very remote Persian ancestress.’ The historical fact, however.is that the
                        lady in question was Cleopatra, a princess of Coele Syria and Palestine, who
                        married Ptolemy V. in 193 B.C., that is, some 130 years before the birth of
                        Shakespeare’s heroine.”</p>
                    <p>"And what of the assertion that there is no single instance of a marriage
                        between a Ptolemaic prince and a native Egyptian ?”</p>
                    <p>"We never made such a statement,” was the reply; "but it wonld be presumed
                        that Mr. Bevan knows the state of confusion and demoralisation that existed
                        at the Alexandria Court between the reign of Ptolemy VI and Ptolemy XIII.
                        This is what Professor Mahaffy says on the subject: ‘We have now reached the
                        moment when the history of Egypt under the Macedonian dynasty declines in
                        dignity and increases in complication. Hitherto, though it was usual to
                        associate the Queen or the Prince Royal in the government, there is no doubt
                        about the reigining King. From henceforth we have almost constantly rival
                        brothers, asserting themselves in turn Queen-Mothers controlling their King
                        sons—internecine fends and bloodshed in the Royal house—till the stormy end
                        of the dynasty with the daring Cleopatra VI. The historian is bound to
                        chronicle these wretched complications, to unravel these problems of
                        chronology, and yet they only affect the reigning house, and tell us nothing
                        of interest to posterity. We must have recourse to private papers, journals,
                        cx'rac's of obscure persons, bills of stewards, and lists of tax gathers, to
                        learn something of the gradual relapse of the country from Hellenism into
                        the ineradicable Egypt of the native race.”</p>
                    <p>CLEOPATRA’S APPEARANCE.</p>
                    <p>"Do not Professor Mahaffy’s views thus corroborate your own statement that
                        the incidental accidents of marriage had materially affected the personal
                        appearanoe, tastes, and manners of the later Ptolemies ?”</p>
                    <p>"The incidental accidents of marriage mentioned, on which Mr. Bevan lays so
                        great a stress,” replied Mr. Macquoid, "do not always refer to legitimate
                        accidents. And the proclivites and character of our own British Solomon,
                        James I., by no means point to our national characteristics. The appearance
                        of Cleopatra on the coins of the period and in the bust at the British
                        Museum is typically Semitic, and pieces of Egyptian furniture of the last
                        century before Christ, although termed Greeco Egyptian, are distinctly more
                        Egyptian than Greek.</p>
                    <p>"To open a controversy on the subject," concluded Mr. Marquoid, "is to my
                        mind perfectly useless, as the producers of the play were as well inforned
                        as Mr. Bevan is of the existence of Greek, and also Roman, taste at the
                        Court of Cleopatra. Finally, to quote our critic's well-known statement, the
                        very fact that 'Celopatra liked to be named the new Isis, and on State
                        occasions appeared in the garb of the native goddess,’ demonstrates how
                        desirous she was of identifying her personality and her immediate
                        surroundings with the country she ruled.”</p>

                    <p>"I felt that 1 was going altogether wrong in health three years ago, and what
                        I subsequently suffered only those of my own sex can appreciate. Yet today,
                        at 43 years of age, I am well, bright and energetic, and the constant wonder
                        and envy of many women. And to all I say that the credit of this great
                        change in me is due in every way to Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale
                        People. They alone reward me when I was passing through the time of trouble
                        that women of middle age have to face, and I know how valuable and helpful
                        they are at such a crisis.”</p>
                    <p>These words uttered by Mrs. Elizabeth Campbell, of 18. Silver-screet,
                        Sunderland, convey a world of meaning to the countless women who countinue
                        to suffer in silence with little or no hope of relief.</p>
                    <p>"The first warning I received of impending trouble," saif Mrs. Campbell, "was
                        a strange dizziness at time, will sudden flushes, feelinghot and cold in
                        turn. Then something like cold settled on me. I felt weak and lazy, with a
                        tight feeling across the chest and a difficulty in breathing. My heart felt
                        as though it was labouring under a heavy load. At night I would break oat in
                        perspiration and feel as if the I room was stifling me yet perhaps the next
                        hour I would become quite cold, especially my feet, and shiver with a chill
                        down my back, which ached with a dull, gnawing pain that took all my
                        strength away. Frequently the dizziness attacked me if walking upstairs or
                        when in the street. One morning, when making a cup of tea, I fell forward in
                        a fainting fit, and narrowly escaped falling into the fire. I received a
                        terrible shock; for days doctors were in constant attendance. I fell away,
                        so weak and thin that my life was despaired of.</p>
                    <p>"Still I lingered on - one day a little better, the next day worse—when one
                        afternoon a violent spasm shot down my back, through my legs, like stabs of
                        burning knives. Doctors said that sciatica had developed, and I no doubt got
                        the poisons og this in my system through being out in bad weather. With this
                        new trouble on top of all my previoos sufferings medicine seemed quite
                        useless to me.</p>
                    <p>"A good friend called and recommended Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale
                        People, and I then remembered how often this medicine was praised by women.
                        I sent for a box and I began taking the pills. Before long I felt that I was
                        on the mend.</p>
                    <p>"So I continued the pills, determined not to give up taking them until I was
                        cured. My appetite picked up and I could take food and digest it. I rallied
                        steadily and felt a good circulation in my veins. My head became clear and
                        free from dizziness, while I had no pains in my back. I soon got about again
                        : in fact afer a few weeks' steady treatment of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills I
                        felt fit to go about my work as usual. I took less than six boxes of Dr.
                        Williams’ Pink Pills, but I thoroughly recovered. Now I feel more hearty and
                        active than many a woman half my age, and I have never had an ache in my
                        body since Dr. Williams’ Pick Pills cured me.”</p>

                        already mentioned, the best information that can be gleaned is the total
                        amount lent, and as for private dealings these must for ever remain an
                        unknown or at least a very uncertain quantity. The total amount lent by
                        companies (chiefly English insurancee companies) <persName>Dr.
                            Eid</persName> palces at L.E. 1,400,000, and be adds a further L.E.
                        800,000 for private transactions (which figure, we must admit, we think to
                        be a distinct under-estimation),making in all L E. 2,200,000. For this it is
                        impossible to obtain the exact number of loans, and in consequence the
                        average amount of a loan cannot be stated.</p>
                    <p>This much, however, is possible, and this the energy of Dr. Eid has
                        accomplished. The number ot loans made by the banks is known, as is the
                        number registered at the Greffes, and the difference gives approximately the
                        number of loans contracted otherwise than with the banks. Dr. Eid sets out
                        these figures in two columns for the last six years, and in lookirg at this
                        table we see the following : —</p>

                    <p/>
                    <p>Assuredly the striking increase of these figures muat speak for itself.
                        Striking, however, though it is, it need give rise to no alarm, for it is
                        both natural and justifiable, and as, Dr. Eld shows us later, is a testimony
                        of the increasing wealth of the country. Of course the introduction of the
                        Agricultural Bank in 1903 with its facilities for small loans has had much
                        to do with the numerical increase of the mortgages, and it may be safely
                        asserted that each advance made by this institution is a direct blow, as we
                        said before, at the almost criminal extortion of the village usurer and in
                        inverse proportion a corresponding benefit to the fellah directly, and
                        indirectly to the country as a whole. But another cause also has been
                        recently at work whereby the number of private mortgages has been so
                        markedly reduced,and that is the extraordinarily rapid rise in the last year
                        or two in the price of town and building property. In place of advancing
                        money to a mortgager whereby the mortgager, by investing the same in town
                        land, acquired a comparative fortune in a very short time, every capitalist
                        h s entered the field as a buyer of property, and few private capitalists
                        to-day are content with the average investment of a sound mortgage, but all
                        spare money is now employed in the purchase of land wish a view to a rapid
                        rise and the re-sale thereof.</p>
                    <p>But to return once more to figures. The actual number of mortgages contacted
                        is by itself of little value. We must also have the superficial area of the
                        agricultural land of the country and the average amount of each mortgage :
                        and the difficulty is to fix this average amount. To do this recourse most
                        be had to the information if private persons, and although there may be the
                        most competent, the recourse in a category of statistics is admittedly
                        precarious, but the best obtainable under the circumstances. In the first
                        place it must be recognised that private loans command a higher rate of
                        interest, being frequently made through family relations and for other
                        reasons of similar importance in the East where consideration or toleration
                        plays so leading a part, considerations moreover which no bank —no mere
                        corporation without a soul- could ever be expected to recognise.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Eid takes the mean amount of the mortgages advanced by the banks in 1905,
                        namely, LE. 165, and to obtain a rough approximation of the average sum of a
                        private transaction he doubles this L.E. 165, making it L.E. 330. At this
                        figure he calculates the total of the mortgage indebtedness from private
                        sources other than the five banks to reach the figure of L.E. 5,500,000 for
                        the years 1902 to 1905. Previous to the year 1902 the wants of the</p>

                        opening of ths Assouan Dam, the introduction of new banking and financial
                        companies, and in particular the foundation ot the Agricultural Bank, have
                        one and all given a tremendous impetus to financial and agricultural
                        schemes, with the result that in 1903 the number of mortgages registered
                        sprang from 16,000 to 37,000 in a twelve-month. And from 1902 to 1905, of
                        mortgages property so called the sum total of indebtedness from all sources
                        amounted to L.E. 28,245,000.</p>

                        various loans, the first according to their nature, town or country or urban
                        and so forth ; the second according to their importance, that is, according
                        to the amount of the loan, which varies from L.E. 1 to L E. 10,000, and the
                        third and last according to the time of the duration of the mortgage ;
                        tables too long to set out here in fall but well worth the careful perusal

                        <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                        <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers
                            the accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by
                            which they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange
                            them as accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that
                            none of them are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home
                            there are several things to be considered. To begin with there is the
                            difference in climate between Egypt and the various points at which you
                            may arrive in Europe.</p>
                        <cb n="2"/>
                        <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                            January may be a little warmer than the Riviera, and possibly not so
                            warm as Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more
                            uniformly warm than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt
                            far too early in the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is
                            perfect. The warmest place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                        <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent
                            at sea, and we therefore subjoin a list showing the time occupied on
                            each of the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of
                            Europe.</p>
                        <cb n="3"/>
                        <p>They are as follows:-</p>
                        <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth,
                            Southhampton, London or Liverpool—occupy about 4 days. The short ones
                            are as follows:—</p>

                        <p>The steamers, of the P.&amp;O. North German Lloyd, Orient and Messageriea
                            Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor, British India, and Bibby Lines
                            are also excellent, and their steamers are largely patronised by
                            travellers to Egypt.</p>
                        <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to
                            Alexandria, without change (3 hours). That to Port Said, can now be made
                            without change in 4 1/2 hours.</p>
                        <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                            Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German
                            Levant line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                        <cb n="5"/>
                        <p>The most expensive but quickest through Continental routes are by
                            P.&amp;O. Brindisi express from Port Said, and the Austrian Lloyd
                            Trieste Vienna express from Alexandria.</p>
                        <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little
                            luggage is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several
                            good and responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed
                            charge to deliver packages to any address in Europe.</p>
                        <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by
                            the fast Mail Steamers “Osiris" and “Isis” to Brindisi. One of these
                            leaves port Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the
                            Indian <cb n="6"/>mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                        <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                            attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats"
                            having been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to
                            Brindisi. If you are going straight through to England you will find the
                            train waiting at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without
                            changing. It has complete arrangements for sleeping and eating on board,
                            and you should arrive in London on the fifth day from leaving Port
                            Said.</p>

                        <head>SICILY.</head>
                        <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.’s steamers
                            which leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to
                            TAORMENA, one of the most charming and popular places on the island.
                            Giardini is the station at which to alight, and the drive up to Taormina
                            is most delightful, occupying about one hour. In and around the town is
                            much to interest the visitor. The theatre is of Greek origin, but
                            restored under the Romans. CATANIA is the starting place for the ascent
                            of Etna and here also is a fine Cathedral. The Greek, Roman, and
                            Saracenic remains that are found all over the island, are an endless
                            sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting history, having been a
                            Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C. 413, and taken by
                            the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb is to be
                            seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO, with
                            about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys a
                            delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city.
                            The Palazzo Reale is of Saracenic origin and close to it the church of
                            S. Giovannia degli Eremiti with its picturesque cloisters. The
                            Cathedral, Museum, Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also
                            worth a visit.</p>

                    <div type="article">
                        <head>CENTRAL ITALY.</head>
                        <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every
                            Wednesday during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3
                            days.</p>
                        <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino
                            Co.’s steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave
                            it without wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely
                            places on its bay—Castellamare and Sorrento. The small steamer that
                            takes you to Sorrento [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                        <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can
                            will devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and
                            interesting portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are
                            too well-known to need comment here.</p>
                        <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five
                            hours brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent
                            admiring the City of Flowers and its surrounding country. In Florence
                            itself the churches and galleries are of absorbing interest, whilst the
                            local promenades and excursions should not be omitted. The Cascine is
                            the most attractive and fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the
                            Viale dei Colli, one of the finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years ago,
                            goes winding up through the hills a distance of four miles. The most
                            delightful excursion outside Florence is that to Vallombrosa, with its
                            Monastery 3,300 feet above the sea level. This is made first by ordinary
                            train from Florence to St. Ellero, thence by cog-wheel railway to
                            Saltino. The ascent through groves of oaks takes an hour, and most
                            striking panoramas are unfolded to view.</p>
                        <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; hero there is a
                            fine Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night
                            should if possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile
                            at sunset.</p>
                        <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near
                            Pisa and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient
                            half-way house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable
                            and the air and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                        <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy,
                            with the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European
                            cities and a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and
                            deliciously cool breezes from the surrounding mountains and the
                            Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                        <p>The patriarchal home of Italy’s most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                            gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings,
                            are a constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn
                            in Genoa. Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches
                            containing exquisite marble columns and historical paintings, and the
                            incomparable Campo Santo filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                        <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                        <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                            Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful
                            windows illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and
                            the monumental cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                        <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                            SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal
                            springs, change trains at Borgo San Donino and in half-an-hour you are
                            at Salsomaggiore.</p>

                        <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                            delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                            vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange ; no horse, cart, carriage
                            or bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every
                            turn. The approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any
                            other sea port. The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of
                            the sea, no hills behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of
                            Campaniles appear above the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering
                            town rises like a fairy mirage out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                        <p>Going northwards from Milan you make the tour of the beautiful Italian
                            lakes.</p>
                        <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in
                            one-and-a-quarter hours by train by way of Monza :</p>
                        <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is
                            very beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                            enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come Tremezzo,
                            Cadenabbia, and Menaggio with the prettily-situated town of Bellaggio
                            opposite. The walk from Tremezzo along the shore of the lake to Menaggio
                            is most enjoyable. A steam tram runs from Menaggio to Porlezza on Lake
                            Lugano in three-quarters of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in
                            two-and-three-quarter hours.</p>

                            is an excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso, situated
                            above the town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting paintings,
                            “Entombment," by Ciseri, and ‘Tho Flight into Egypt,” by Bramantion.</p>

                            Pilatus, Burgenstock and Sonnenberg needing a special visit each. Other

                            scenery on the trip from Lucerne, to Fluelen is a source of delight to
