                        Mr. Ewing Matheson, a well- knownmember of thelnstituteof Civil Engineers,
                        and while expressing confidence in the nnited experience of the chief
                        experts in this branch of the profession—men like Mossrs. Mansergh,
                        Hawksley, and Bateman—ho said Sit Benjamin Baker would be well advised to
                        lengthen the period of observations before tho present struc- ture of the
                        dam was added to in any way. “The Nile dam,” said Mr. Matheson to our
                        representative, “was no doubt designed for its present height of water, with
                        a margin of safety, and to raise it to a considerable height means >oviving
                        the old question of flooding the island of Philm over again, and matters of
                        publio safety that are much more important. .It is impossible to foretell or
                        conceivo the damage which would bo done if the dam were over- taxed." </p>
                    <p>Mr. Matheson cited the disastrous Roods at Sheffield and Johnstown,
                        Pennsylvania, as instances of insufficient planning. "I visited Johnstown,”
                        he said, "twelve months after the catastrophe, and saw traces even then of
                        that terrible flood. Fifteen miles away from the scene of the buret, there
                        wore locomotives swept aside and overturned, and it was all due to
                        insufficient calculation, addod^to tho usual light-heartodness of the
                        Americans in their dbnstructive undertakings.</p>
                    <p>The two main considerations in the proper working of a dam of this kind are
                        the rush of wator and the height—tho ‘height’ being a technical expression
                        for tho hydrostatic pres- sure. It is the rush of water which creates what
                        we call the ‘scour,’ or attrition along the conduits or subterraneau
                        passages; and it was wiih a' view to.preserve them that, in the Assouan
                        case, they were paved for a certain portion. Sir Benjamin Baker's recent
                        visit was to report on the working out of these calcula- tions, and as a
                        result this pavement is to be extended. But it will be a matter for the most
                        anxious consideration before tho dam is raised, as projected, merely to
                        increase the area of irrigation purposes. Far better wait another year or
                        two, and estimate wear and tear upon toe present construction.</p>
                    <p>"Are there any precedents f” we naked. "Yea, of one kind or another," was the
                        reply, "and the experience in this class of work among British engineers all
                        over tho world, as well as m work under British supervision, fortifies us
                        against any novel theories or experimente.There have been just sufficient
                        failures to bring them up to tho mark, and in the construction of masonry
                        dams no possible precaution is now- nogleoted, oven where, as in tho case of
                        the present construction at Leeds, the volume ol water is not to be compared
                        with that of the Nile.</p>
                    <p>"Everything, depends upon the margin of safety as allowed originally. It must
                        have entered iuto the minds of the designers that the dam might be raised or
                        thiokeued later on; and it remained then to see that the dovetail- ing of
                        the rock foundations wero sufficient for auy increase in superincumbent
                        weight. Personally, I should advise waiting for another year or two, as I
                        have said, balore considering additions involving perhaps 6lbs. extra
                        pressure to the square inch of surfaco. The advantages to be gained are
                        dwarfed iuto insignificance c impure! with the awful oxtent of the danger
                        incurred</p>

                    <p>The tolling of the faneral bell at St. Catherine's Cathedral last night
                        announoed that already a year had elapsed since the death of Archbishop
                        Gaudenzio Bonfigli. This mom- ing, a speoial service was held at the
                        Cathedral, Pietro Magri’s requiem mass being sung by tho brothers of the
                        Christian Schools, Arch- bishop Briante officiating. All the clerical orders
                        of the city were represented, and grouped near the high altar were H. E. the
                        Governor, several of the consuls, headed by the French Consol, etc. The
                        service was of the most impressive character, and the large congregation, it
                        oould be ^ seen, was deeply affected. The splendid Hiseremini mei especially
                        was rendered with supremo pathos. At the close of the requiem, the
                        celebrant, attended by his clergy, left the altar preoeded by the crucifix
                        and acolytes, and went towards the catafalque for the absolu- tion,, the
                        time the Christian Brothers sang Libera me. . This oeremony over the
                        Archbishop went to St. Mark’s ohapel, where the mortal remains of tho .fata
                        Archbishop Bonfigli are laid, and where a monument to his memory has been
                        ereotod. Mr. Moriondo, president of the memorial committee, here address-'
                        ed the Archbishop iu Italian, handing over the memorial to hisjordahip’s
                        care. Archbishop Briante replied, thanking the committee for their beautiful
                        gift to the church, which would always receive the most tender and reverent
                        care.</p>
                    <p>The parchment containing a record of the ceremony and the names of the clergy
                        con- nected with the chdrch, was then signed by the oonsuls present and read
                        by the Pro-Vicar General Amadio Amato, to whoso initiative and untiring
                        efforts the erection of the monu- ment is maiuly due, and who deserves the
                        thanks of the Catholic community. » The members of the St. Catherine's Club
                        kept order during the service admirably.</p>

                    <p>The Tigris enters its delta at Baled, near thesite of the ancient Opis, where
                        were situated the famous weirs of antiquity and which were 'described by
                        Tavernier. I used to think that these weirs were altogether artificial, bnt
                        an examination of the site has made me think that they were natural bars of
                        .vory hard conglomerate, as hard as. the compactest crys- talline limestone,
                        which overlay stiff clay. The crests of the weirs wore probably artifi-
                        cially raised. This conglomerate can bo seen to-day.along the left bank of
                        the river from Samarra to nearly opposite Boled. It has a thickness of over
                        ip metres at Samarra, and under it can be seen some 6 metres of stiff ~*any
                        above the water’s edge of the Tigris. The conglomerate dips under the
                        allurvum of the Tigris below Beled and its termination was in Probability a
                        great cataract near Beled known .ally as "Sadd Nimrud,” or Nimrod’s dam.
                        'file Nahrwan and Dijail canals look out from above these weire^ .The
                        Nahrwan canal was ruined by the Tigris changing its course, and the
                        undermining and sweeping away of these great cataracts sealed the ruin of
                        all the irrigation systems fed by the Tigris. From Beled to Bagdad the
                        Tigris has a length of about 110 kilometres, and a width of from 4
                        kilometres to 350 'metres. Where the river is wide, it flows over a bed of
                        shingle and has a velocity pf some 6 to 7 kilometres per hour. Navigation by
                        sailing boats is impossible against the current.</p>
                    <p>From Bagdad to Gurnn,whore tho Tigris and Euphrates meet, the river has a
                        length of 740 kilometres. The distance from Gnrna to Basra is 60 kilometres,
                        and 100 kilometres further on is the Persian Gulf. Tho distances along the
                        Tigris are therefore as follows . . ' From Beled to tho Sea J 1010
                        kilometres From Bagdad to Basra 800 „ From Bagdad to the Sea 900 „
                        After.leaving the rapids at Beled, the bed of tftj Tigris, like that of the
                        Euphrates, is'every- where mud. The watere are yellow like those of the
                        Tiber and the Euphrates. Bagdad is the real northern terminus of river
                        navigation on the Tigris. It has taken, the place of the ancient Opis, which
                        was further north</p>

                    <head>Letter to editor</head>
                    <p>A QUEER GRAMMAR. To rta Editor of the Egyptian Gazette. Sir,—In reply to
                        “Grammarian’s” lette.r in yesterday’s “Gazette,” I hive to inform him:— .(1)
                        Not long before reviewing Dirr’s Arabic Grammar, the “Gazette” published my
                        opinion of another grammar of the classical language, which was most
                        flattering and which was afterwards shared by the editor of a well-known
                        literary Arabic periodical inJJairo in his review of it (2) ’ Before sending
                        in mf artiole on Dirr’s grammar I gave the book to a native friend (who is a
                        competent Arabio scholar) to read and return to me with his opinion. He
                        brought it after a few days and told me what he thought of it in fewer but
                        severer words than I used. I then gave him my article to read and he
                        approved of every word I said. Moreover, I have not yet met one who knew the
                        book and did not share my opinion of it (3) Since sending my article to the
                        "Ga- zette” 1 have learned that the book had been sent to an Euglish
                        gentleman who is a well- known Arabic scholar, but although he refused to
                        review it he marked here and there what he considered flagrant errors. The
                        reason of his refusal is therefore not far to seek. . (4) I confirm every
                        word I said in my review, but I cannot enter into any discussion with one
                        who makes the ridioulous statement that it is grammatically correct to say
                        el ingi- lyz tayiba because he means the English as a nation, and pretends
                        that most of the other mistakes are obvious slips. (5) "Grammariau” has the
                        fault of more than one other resident in the country who no sooner- picks
                        up? a few words of Arabio (and before he could write a sentence correctly
                        without the aid of some one else) than be rushes.to the press with a
                        wonderful grammar of his own. It would have been better for “Grammarian” to
                        study the language for many more years before venturing to write a book
                        dealing with it (6) "Grammarian’’ will have to get all the , mistakes I
                        pointed out, and many more, cor- ; need before the book ceases to be called
                        a . "queer’’ grammar.. As regards his personal reference to me, there is no
                        need for me to reply, as this sort of controversial method is beneath
                        oontempt.— Yours very truly, The Whiter of the Review.</p>

                    <p>Mr. Justice Kekewich in the Chancery Divi- sion on,Tahsday w§ek continued the
                        hearing of the notion in whioh'Dr. Robert William Eelkin Rued the Palmerston
                        Industrial and Finance Corporation, Ltd., and Mr. Alfred -Bridge, a company
                        promoter, of-15, Cockspur-street, W., claiming rescission of an agreement to
                        take 800 shares in the Sudan Exploration, Ltd., and a declaration that
                        defendants were liable to indemnify the plaintiff in respect of all expen-
                        ses incurred by him in relation to the transac- tion, or in the alternative
                        damages for alleged misrepresentation. The corporation denied that its
                        policy or business was controlled by Bridge, and did not admit that the
                        representations alleged to have been made by him were made on behalf of the
                        corporation or with its know- ledge. The.defendant Bridge pleaded that if he
                        did. make any representations or statements concerning the present or future
                        value of the shares they were bona fide expressions of opi- nion. Defendant
                        Bridge counter-claimed againit the plaintiff for alleged misrepresentation.—
                        Mr. P. Ogden Lawrence, K. C. and Mr. J; H. Simmons appeared for plaintiff,
                        Mr. Ashton Cross for the Palmerston Corporation, and Mr. W. J. L Ambrose for
                        Mr. Bridge. Plaintiff, continuing his evidence, said that up to the issue of
                        the writ in this action he had never received a certificate for or transfer
                        of the 800 shares in the . Sudan Exploration, Ltd.</p>
                    <p>In cross-examination by Mr. Ashton Cross, for the Palmerston Corporation,
                        plaintiff said he knew the property whioh the Siidan Explo- ration had been
                        formed to acquire. From his knowledge of the country witness believed the
                        company's property to be valuable. Ho wa3 anxious to g|t some Sudan sbures
                        if he could pay cash for them. The 10$. nominal shares could not be obtained
                        for less than £1. Ho Btill believed in tho success of the Sudan Company if
                        it was well managed. Mr. Ashton Cross said he agreed that the Palmerston
                        Corporation sold the shares to Dr. Felkip and those shares had been
                        delivered. Plaintiff, >n auswer to counsel, said ho be- lieved that the 800
                        shares were in the Sudan Company's hands' for transfer. In cross-examination
                        by ' Mr. Ambrose, plaintiff said he understood that the Palmerston
                        Corporation was to put the shares on the mar- ket at-£2 when the
                        pooling-arrangement came to an end. He always understood that Bridge was
                        actiug for the Palmerston Corporation. This concluded plaintiff's case, and
                        Mr. Ashton Cross, submitting that ho case had been made out against the
                        corporation, called Mr. Allred Bridge, who described himself as a director
                        of. the Palmerston Corporation, of which,he said,tho plaintiff also beoamo a
                        direc- tor. When the question of the Sudan Explora- tion shares was uuder
                        discussion, plaintiff said that if he went into the matter ho should want a
                        share of the profits, and witness then told him he had better become a
                        director. Plaintiff, said witness, worked hand-in-hand with him in the Sudan
                        matter, and advised the corporation to take up the shares. Witness denied
                        that he ever made any representations to induce plaintiff to go into the
                        share transaction, and he said that Dr. Felkin must have understood the
                        whole transaction.</p>
                    <p>Cross-examined by Mr. Lawrence, witness said that he was a company promoter,
                        and prior to his going to Cockspur-street he carried on business at 8,
                        Union-court, FC., where he promoted a number of companies. May I take it
                        that, all the companies you promoted oome to grief?—No.—Witness men- tioned
                        the Pan-African Syndicate, Ltd., and the London and Provincial Dairy Company
                        as suocossful promotions. Witness denied that at the time he
                        left'Union-courtoxocutions were out against him at his office and at his
                        house at Surbiton. Wore there any baukruptcy petitions present- ed against
                        you ?—Yes. May I tako it that altogether 8, Union-court, got too hot for yon
                        at tho time you migrated to the West End ?—No, not at all.—Witness said he
                        sometimes advertised for directors willing to invest It was not true to
                        suggest that witness was the Palmerston Corporation. He agreed that there
                        was no entry in the mi- nute-books concerning the agreement with tho
                        plaintiff. At the date of the signing of the bill by the plaintiff witness
                        admitted that the only transfer of Sudan shares to the Palmer ston
                        Corporation was one for 600 shqres. They had, however,’ made arrangements to
                        acquirejurther shares.</p>

                    <p>The abovo teams met at Abbassieh xm Wednesday last. Both teams hold a good
                        record. The K.R.R’s, it seems, have not been defeated sinoe 1902, whereas
                        the representatives of the Shamrook have only been beaten onoe in some
                        sixtyodd matches,60 a good game was expected. The pitch was in splendid
                        order as the Irishmen took the field in the following order : Goal, Dadgeon
                        ; backs, Shanks and Reid ; halves, Millar, Nixon, and Smyth ; forwards,
                        Todd, Hutton, Cunningham, Fallon, and Walsh. The Rifles won the spin of the
                        coin and defended the city goals. There would be almost 900 spectators
                        present when Cunningham commenced operations.. The opening minutes proved
                        sensational as the Inuiskillings bom- barded the Rifles’ goal for fully five
                        minutes. The custodian clearing the Rifles now broke away per Bibbleton, but
                        Smyth robbed and returned. Todd getting possession centred well bnt Fallon
                        sent behind. On the kick-off tho Rifles took play towards Dudgeon, but the
                        latler was not to be oanght napping and cleared in Gillispie’s best style.
                        At this stage the referee (a sergeant of the K.KR.’s) had occasion to retire
                        owing to a misunderstanding of the roles, Mr. MoKenzie, Royal Engineers,
                        filling the vacanoy (amid cheers). On play being resumed Cunningham got away
                        and sent across to Todd, who outwitted two opponents and seut strongly into
                        goal, where Fallon headed over the bar. Flay remained in midfield, until
                        Fallon broke away, but when in a good position ho was! fouled by Bibbleton.
                        A fight ensued, both players being oantioned. The Rifles’ right wiug now got
                        away but Smyth intercepted and returned. Some very spirited play ’took place
                        around the Rifles’ goal. At last, however, the custodian cleared. The
                        Irishmen were now ’ having the best of matters and a shot of Cunningham's
                        deserved a better fate. A free against the Green and Buff Brigade proved
                        unproductive. It was close on half-timo as Hutton gave the Dark Greens’
                        defence some trouble. Half-time now arrived with the repre- seratives of the
                        Shamrock pressing for all they were worth,but there was no score yet on
                        either side.</p>
                    <p>After the usual refreshments both teams took tho field. The first thing
                        noticeable was a great sprint by Todd. The ball, however, found touch. The
                        Rifles now took play in hand, but Smith robbed the right wing -time after
                        time. A corner to the Rifles looked ridrie too rosy for the Green and Buff
                        Brigade, HoWeker Nixon cleared and the InniskUliugs were seen fio advantage.
                        Walsh, however, ran the ball ovet tho liue. On the kick off Bibbleton got
                        away, on his own, but Smith was on his track aneb blocked his passage once
                        more. Not to be deniod, the Rifles got down towards Dudgeon and scored, but
                        Johnny Bibbleton was given offside. On resuming, Millar got away on his own,
                        and alter dodging a couple of opponents sent across to Cunningham, who had a
                        good try for goal. The Rifles now pulled themselves togother and worked
                        their way down towards Dudgeon but Nixon and Smith were not to be beaten so
                        easily and play was once more trans- ferred, when Hutton got well away and
                        gave to Todd, who aont in a "daisy cutter” to tho Custodian, who fell on the
                        ball but too late, as Fallou gut the ball at his toe and into the net it
                        went, drawing first blood for the Innis- killings amidst deafening cheers.
                        Oa the ball being centred the K.RR’s got away but’ Reid returned the ball.
                        Great was the excitement that now prevailed (at this stage Mion was injured
                        and had to retire). Both teams were now playing a most determined and very
                        hard game. If anything, the Inniskillingswere having tho best of matters at
                        this stage. The shield holders were playing a fine combination game. It was
                        a treat to watoh the five forwards play so woll considering tho
                        circumstances under which they were placod. It was now wearing np to
                        full'time as Walsh missed the much desired spot by inches.
                        Shortlyafterthereferee’s whistle sounded for full time, leaving the
                        Inniskillings winners of one of the most exciting games that ever took place
                        in Cairo, and still undefeated. Final result 2nd Royal Inniskilling
