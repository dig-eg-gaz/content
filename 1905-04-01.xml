                                Among them are such significant details., as lighting and cleaning

                                fact that all these arrangements are carried out completely, it
                                appears that some discontented ones are asking for diversions in the
                                shape of the creation of a Municipality. But would such a pleasing
                                alteration of things as they at present exist be feasible or
                                politic, or bring about greater economy. In cosmopolitan countries

                                Council. chosen wholly or in part by the popular rote is to
                                anticipate the impossible. What harmony could ever be supposed to
                                exist in. an assem­bly composed, let us say, of Arabs Mussul­mans,
                                Copts, Persians, Negroes, Mograbins. Turks, Armenians, Syrian*,
                                Greeks, and Italians, with, in addition, a minority of French,
                                Germans, Austrians, Russians, and English, not to speak of other
                                nationalities or , those who are simply "proteges." And this point
                                is to be especially borne in mind, for amongst these individuals one
                                would End a large number with but a passing interest in the country
                                and whose main ambition is to make their respective fortunes in the
                                least possible. Space of time and afterwards return to their native
                                countries. It is therefore fairly evident that these people would
                                consider chiefly the interests of the moment and endeavor in many
                                cases to procure immediate advantages, peculiarly profitable to
                                themselves, without preoccupying this minds with the true in­terests
                                of the town and the future conse­quences involved in the measures
                                they ordain. The warnings afforded by the irregularities omitted in
                                Alexandria are allowed into re­main in beautiful abnormity by those
                                eager for I reform- An honorable and a just Municipality has been
                                extolled. But the ideas put forward by these would be reformers are
                                all purely theoretical. They are idle fancies and unworthy of
                                consideration. A new Administration of this gender organised at
                                Cairo would be even worse that existing at Alexandria, for its
                                com­position would not his in the major part European. Considerable
                                funds are necessary to properly conduct a Municipality, but this is
                                considered a trifle by those who exalt the idea. To procure the
                                necessary revenue for the suggested future Municipal Treasury in
                                perspective namely, something about LB.250,000 or possibly more, all
                                kinds of new imposts are proposed, snob as taxes on beasts of burden
                                and carriages, toll rights, taxes on comestibles, forage, cattle,
                                building materials, etc., etc. In consequence, therefore, all the
                                reforms benefiting almost the whole of the Cairo public inaugurated
                                under the guidance of Lord Cromer, would totally disappear.</p>
                            <p>The Public Services of Cairo are entirely in the hands of</p> the
                            Egyptian Government, which has all the moans and personnel sufficient
                            for all purposes, and it would be ridiculous to assert that they are not
                            as well administer­ed as existing circumstances allow. The Mi­nistry of
                            Public Works, excepting of course the Irrigation Department, may be
                            considered as very advantageously replacing a Municipal­ity, which, even
                            admitting that it was perfect, could never be served by a more competent
                            staff. The Capital is otherwise more favored than other towns in Egypt
                            where Councils have been established. It is precisely to this privileged
                            situation that Cairo owes the numerous improvements with which the town
                            has been endowed of recent years, as well as the creation of new
                            quarters where roads were planned by the Government and land I offered
                            to the public on moot reasonable terms. If the price of building sites
                            has been quadrupled in the best quarters of Cairo, enrich­ing many, the
                            merit therefore descends prin­cipally on the Government, which has done
                            everything possible to beautify the town and still continues to expend
                            very largely with the same object. Simply to asphalt the streets in the
                            native quarters, for example, the Public Works expends actually £20,000
                            a year, whilst a new bridge over the Nile is undertaken at a cost of
                            nearly £200,000. This new bridge, opening up as it will a passage to
                            property on the right of the river, serves to extend the town and bring
                            about the formation of other new quarters, and without its costing a
                            penny to Cairenes, bat on the contrary offering increased resources to
                            the investor. One cannot reproach the Government in respect of not
                            keeping in line with progress. The in­auguration of the tramway service
                            is due to the Government’s initiation, and it is very capable that
                            wherever the tramways have pene­trated the general aspect of the
                            quarters his been transformed, the roads are well main­tained, and
                            congenial new buildings have been erected. Moreover, the introduction of
                            this service has very largely contributed towards the increased value of
                            land on the outskirts as to drinking Water, it will be remembered the
                            Ministry of Finance granted the Water Company last year nearly £40,000
                            towards the installation of artesian wells and new pumping machinery at
                            Rod el Fang. These expenses have been incurred for the express purpose
                            of endowing Cairo with drinking water of the very first quality, and all
                            this without the <p>exaction of any additional taxation.</p>
                            <p> Studying the procedure of “exhausting" the L.E. 250,000 annual
                                expenditure deem­ed necessary, the argument is brought for­ward that
                                among other things seweres might be laid down, and for the purpose,
                                over and above the before mentioned taxes, all the houses of the
                                Capital could be specially taxed. It is well known that the sanitary
                                conditions</p> of Cairo are to-day good, and will compare favorably
                            with those of the principal cities in Europe, For many years, it is
                            trues the mortality tables were based on a population well under the
                            correct figures, and consequently formed an exaggerated percentage, but
                            since the last census it is proved beyond all doubt that the death-rate
                            in the Capital is really normal. Among the European section this varies
                            between 23 and 25 per thousand. All arguments, then, in favor of sewers
                            based on the figures of the mortality, are without foundation. But would
                            anyone care to realize what these sewers would cost 1 Sir William
                            Willcocks’s scheme, which merely provided for the damage of part of the
                            town only, fixed the primary outlay at £600,000, plus the enormous sum
                            of £70,000 for annual maintenance. Now it is precisely this low death
                            rate in Cairo that has induced the Government to deliberate twine, and
                            to await the development of the new quarters before undertaking
                            expansive work which, when completed, would reach very probably the
                            total amount of £1,000,000, not to count an annual expenditures of
                            £100,000 for up-keep. The Government indeed several years ago laid down
                            quite a network of rain­water drains which hare gives excellent results
                            and demand but a very small Outlay for main­tenance. This network will
                            be extended in proportion to the advance made with the asphalting being
                            laid down in the native quarters. The Public Works have in addition
                            achieved the long boulevard that branches off from Kasr el Nil leading
                            to the railway sta­tion; the prolongation of this Abbas boulevard will
                            be accomplished very shortly. A destruc­tor for the purpose of burning
                            the refuse of the town is erected;palatial barracks for the City Fire
                            Brigade are completed, besides other improvements too numerous to
                            mention. Realizing all that the Government has done in the past, we may
                            well assume that it will continue in the same direction during too
                            future, now that the Anglo-French Convention releases it from the
                            difficulties hitherto experienced in obtaining from the Caisse de la
                            Dette the necessary finances for all the purposes of administration. It
                            may be farther remarked-that new bridges over the Nile are contemplated,
                            also other measures for the general improve­ment and embellishment of
                            the town are under consideration and all is accomplished without any
                            surtax. But notwithstanding, the mild pro­posal is beard that others
                            than the Govern­ment should take in hand the reins of the administration
                            of the town and determine and administer the requisite revenue inviting
                            further impositions on Cairo proprietors, com­mercial and industrial
                            concerns, and too public in general ; besides, be it remembered,
                            de­manding a revival of all the vexatious taxes suppressed after patient
                            effort. It is even asserted that if the new means of revenue set forth
                            by these would-be administrators were insufficient for the needs of the
                            "Cairo Muni­cipality" they could be augmented by count­less other new
                            imposts. Those who appreciate the Government’s work—and it cannot but be
                            appreciated—should in the general interests protest against such
                            ridiculous proposals, for they are directly opposed to the present
                            pri­vilege enjoyed here of being exempted from taxes—excepting Customs
                            due# and taxes on building property. To anyone acquainted with the
                            situation of business affairs here and the many obstacles encountered in
                            establishing industries in this country with a view to pros­per, the
                            above-mentioned proposals in favour of special taxes, to obtain annually
                            a fabulous sum to scatter to the winds, most appear altogether
                            preposterous.</note>

                                        unluckily caught with large stocks. The yam and cloth mode

                                        made plain to you, when we say that'the production of tbe
