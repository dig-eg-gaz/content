                    <p>Trains run alongside the steamers on the quay, and passengers can be conveyed
                        to Famagusta, Nicosia, Morphou and intermediate stations. Good hotel
                        accommodation for tourists is provided at Famagusta, at the Savoy Hotel (Mr.
                        Najem Houry proprietor). Olympus Hotel, Mount Troodos, 6000 ft. above the
                        sea. Magnificent Scenery. Perfect climate. Season May to end of October. For

                        Army Contractor, Limassol, Cyprus. There is a good carriage road from Kopia
                        (on Railway) to Troodos. At Famagusta may be seen the fine old Latin
                        Cathedral (now a mosque) begun in 1300 and finished in 1312, together with
                        other ancient ruins and the Venetian fortifications, the finest in the
                        world. Also the tower or palace, the scene of "Othello'' and of Ford's
                        "Lover's Melancholy.'' The climate of Cyprus in the winter months is
                        delightful and the Island will well repay a visit.</p>

                    <head>Lord Cromers Entry into political Life</head>
                    <p>It is impossible for us, says the "Spectator," to overrate the significance
                        of Lord Cromer's early incursion into our political life at home nor can we
                        foresee at once the exact effect of| the impact of his opinion upon that of
                        his countrymen. Obviously be thought that a warning was necessary. Let us
                        consider quite dispassionately the value of it. It does not come from a
                        layman . it comes from a brilliantly successful! administrator, one of whose
                        chief duties for many years has been the direction of finance and the
                        framing of Budgets. We would call attention to this point, — that it is an
                        expert financial opinion. Bat while Lord Cromer's experience of Free-trade
                        was financial, it was also political. He recalled the occasion when, under
                        Lord Salisbury's Government, the Sudan was opened up, and the assurance was
                        given to the Powers that equality of opportunity would be guaranteed to all
                        the traders of the world. Britain would claim no preference over any of
                        them. This assurance, he tells us, smoothed, and indeed made possible, the
                        path of Empire in the Sudar, and he expresses himself as supremely grateful
                        to the doctrine of Free-trade, which proved itself so I benevolent a
                        coadjutor in the Imperial task. Lord Cromer's warning, then, is that of an
                        expert financier and a stout Imperialist, who has ends of the other.
                        Principle and practice have never been more beautifully correlated than in
                        his career. Opponents of Free-trade speak as though "Cobdenism" were
                        inevitably allied to the predispositions of the "Little Englander Yet here
                        are the doctrines of Cobden stated with less reserve than we often hear them
                        by the most prominent "Great Englander" of our time. Nor can any one really
                        detract from the significance of the warning on the ground that it is mean
                        to help a particular party. Lord Cromer notoriously served both parties with
                        equal loyalty in Egypt ; and when he retired he went out of his way to
                        record the generous sanction which his policy had enjoyed from the present
                        Government. Indeed, if Lard Crore; speech is examined, what mere party
                        aspiration does it, or can it, help! No one can say that it is likely to
                        help the cause of Tariff Reform. If it had been intended to strengthen the
                        hands of the Government, it would not have condemned, as dangerous to Free
                        trade, one of the most important of the Government proposals. His grave and
                        reiterated! warning as to the perils of a non contributor old age pensions
                        scheme, with its attendant burdens on the taxpayer, were one of the most
                        memorable portions of his speech. Lord Cromer instincts, of course, draw him
                        strongly to the Unionist Party, yet his words appeal only to that part of it
                        which has been driven into political impotence by the madness of the rest.
                        On the face of it, Lord Cromer's speech ix &amp;perfectly candid, impartial
                        utterance delivered with all sincerity and conviction at some personal
                        inconvenience because he felt that the times demanded it. He stands boldly
                        by the side of those who, as the Duke-of Devonshire expressed it in his
                        letter of welcome to the new vice-president of the Unionist Free-Trade Clab,
                        are determined to do three things, no matter what may be the consequences on
                        a rigid party system. Those three things are to detend the Union, to combat
                        Socialistic legislation, and to maintain Free trade. </p>
                    <p>We say that Lord Cromer's Warning was demanded by the times, because the time
                        is plainly ripe for a reconsideration of the basis upon which the Unionist
                        Party shall continue to exist. This much is admitted by the "Times," which
                        declares that changed circumstances make it inexpedient to set up Tariff
                        Reform as a test of party loyalty. An increasing number of Unionists who
                        were and are Tariff Reformers apparently share the conclusion of the
                        "Times," and we can hardly doubt what the effect of Lord Cromer's speech
                        will be on the minds of other waverers. We do not forget, of course, that
                        Mr. Balfour has never imposed a test, but in the constituencies it has been
                        notoriously applied. We do not ask any one to substitute the appeal to
                        authority for private conviction, but we would nonetheless point to the
                        peculiar, indeed unique, weight of Lord Cromer's experience as an argument
                        in the Fiscal dispute that cannot honestly be overlooked. Finally, Lord
                        Cromer's treatment of the question of old-age pensions was most telling,
                        because he did not deal with it on the moral side, bat simply as a financier
                        deals with a purely financial matter. Where is the money — the twenty or
                        thirty million pounds—to come from? That is a question which cannot be
                        separated from the proposal to create old-age pensions. On every one who
                        asks for pensions he's the onus of proving how the money is to be raised. It
                        is ridiculous, as Lord Cromer showed so aptly in his amusing story of the
                        Conjurer, to talk, as at least one Labour Member has done, as though a
                        scheme were one thing and its cost quite another, — as thought it were the
                        business of the Member of Parlia ment to advocate whatever seductive plans
                        leaped to his brain, and the business of the Chancellor of the Exchequer to
                        pay for them. Lord Cromer, who year by year and month by month in Egypt had
                        both to create the scheme and to provide for the cost, will not for a moment
                        countenance such folly and heresy "Where can I find the money ?" was the
                        puzzle be had always to solve, and he will never sanction the shirking of it
                        by others. Lord Cromer evidently believes that we have very nearly reached
                        the limit of the money producing power of our present taxes, and that the
                        great sum necessary for State-granted old age pensions could conceivably be
                        produced only by a Protectionist tariff, to the vast detriment of the
                        country in numerous ways, —though even this test would be a very difficult
                        one. Old age pensions, in a word, must mean in the end a resort to a tariff.
                        Will a Free trade party consent to ran the risk that this will be the
                        ultimate price which will have to be paid for old-age pensions, even though
                        the Government have recklessly pledged themselves to a universal
                        non-contributory scheme. We fancy that if many Liberals revealed their
                        honest opinion, they would confess that they would be heartily glad to see
                        the proposal of State Paid pensions wiped off the slate. We trust that on
                        the point Lord Cromer's speech, for which we offer him our sincere
                        gratitude, may be the means of inducing reconsideration, and perhaps even
                        calling a halt. If Lord Cromer should prove to have winged Tariff Reform
                        with one barrel and old-age pensions with the other - and we are by no means
                        sure that he has not done so—he will indeed have been a memorable
                        achievement. </p>

                            the cost of obtaining them from Egypt is practically prohibitive it
                            behoves the Sudan Government and the Gordon College authorities to lose
                            no time in creating, as far as possible, a local supply commensurate
                            with the growing requirements of the country. However, be considers that
                            these difficalties are gradually being overcome, and in that connection
                            pays a tribute to the Egyptian ministry of Public Instraction and to Mr.
                            Currie, the principal of the college, and his Enropean and native staff.
                            In regard to the vernacular Training College, he attended the
                            examination of the young Sheikhs, and was much struck with the
                            advancements they had made in a comparatively short period. "The reports
                            of those who have already passed out of the college and have taken up
                            Government as schoolmasters, minor judges, &amp;e., are, ont exception,
                            satisfactory." Sir Resid om knowledges the great services to the college
                            of the Earl of Cromer and Sir Henry Craik, and thinks there is no cause
                            for any misgivings that exceptional facilities are being given to the
                            Department of Education to the exclusion of other more pressing needs in
                            the country's development. Progress during year has been satisfactory.
                            New primary schools will be built at Atbara, Port Sudan, and Eb Obeid,
                            and thus perhaps provide recruits for secondary and technical schools,
                            though there is a great demand onthe part of the Government and private
                            employers for the product turned outby the primary schools. As the
                            result of a tour of inspection round the Eastern Sudan, Mr. Currie
                            considers that the country is progressing so rapidly that the services
                            of natives with any kind of technical qualification must become more and
                            more imperatively called for every year. Satisfactory results are
                            recorded in the higher primary school, the training college for teachers
                            of English, the technical school, and the instructional workshops. Mr.
                            Currie concludes by expressing his indebtedness to hjs whole staff, and
                            says : "The loyalty and industry of maw Pictectoun the junior members of
                            the Egyptian staff have been beyond all praise, and I am proud to have
                            an opportunity of testifying to it." The expenditure for the tear ended
                            December 1906, was veges gerne detec expenditure £14,596 18s.6d. being
                            £32 11s. 10d. in excess of the income.</p>

                    <p>Foundation Stone Laid</p>
                    <p>Yesterday afternoon the foundation stone of the new Deaconnesss' Hospital was
                        laid at Hadra in the presense of almost the entire Germany COlony of
                        ALexandria. In the morning a special service was held in the German
                        Protestant Church, when an eloquent address was delivered by the Rev. Buek.
                        After the service Count Bernstorff and the committe of the hospital
                        proceeded to the house of the German Consul at Alexandria, Mr. Munderlich,
                        where they took lunch. The Party then went to the iste of the new hospital,
                        where there was a large and distinguished gathering awaiting the,. The
                        ceremony of laying the foundation stone was commenced by the singing of a
                        hyme, after which Mr. Wunderlich delivered a most impressive speech, as
                        follows:-</p>
                    <p>Ladies and Gentlemen, Today we are gathered with the twofold object of
                        celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the day on which the first sisters
                        of Kaiser Pharoahs to commnce their work of love, and also to lay the
                        fondation stone of the buildinh of the hospital. The house Mother of
                        Kaiserswerth has edited a memoire on the history of the fifty years of
                        existance of the Alexandria hospital and has dedicatd it to the daughter
                        establishment to celebrate its jubilee. This memoire, which we appreciate as
                        the most ideal jubilee gift, has to our great regret not yet arrived so that
                        we are unable to place it, as was our intention, under foundation stone, as
                        one of the most important documents. I am consequently obliged to refer for
                        what concerns the history of the foundation of the hospital, to the memoire
                        of Pastor Julius Disselhof, bearing the title of "Association of Deaconesses
                        of the Rhine and of Westphalia and its Spheres of Work" which appreaed in
                        1882. In this work the history of the foundation and development of our
                        hospital is given in so simple and unornamented fashion that one could
                        believe oneself to be reading an Evangelic epistle of the New Testament.
                        Listen, rather, and judge for yourselves. For the comprehension of the
                        history which I will read to you, I will inform you that the founder of our
                        hospital is Pastor Julius Fliedner, who in 1883 founded the mother house at
                        Kaiserwerth. The history o fthe foundation says:-'The hospital of the
                        Deaconesses at Alexandria . In the Winter of 1856-7, Fliedner was obliged to
                        recuperate his health by staying in Cairo. Invited by the Consuls-General of
                        England and Prussia to found at Alexandria a Deaconesses' hospital to
                        recieve sailors and other foreign invalids, they promised him besides to
                        obtain from their Govenrnments special support for the undertaking as well
                        as annual subsidies. The existing European hospital at Alexandria directed
                        by sisters of charity was over-filled. That is why a second hospital was
                        required. Besides, in the Autumn of 1857 a priest had to be summoned for the
                        Evangelic German Protestants in whom the Deaconesses would find support.
                        Fliedner then wrote:-</p>
                    <p>What could I do? Could I reject the prayer offered to us on this occasion to
                        protect in their faith our co-religionists in this important town of Africa,
                        in this town which is developing 80 enormously not only from a commercial
                        point of view in the Mediterranean, but also as the centre of communication
                        be tween India, Australia, and Europe, where Europeans collect in masses,
                        among whom are large numbers of Protestants. Such decided me to rent the
                        house of Turkish Pasha at Alexandria for 7,500 piastres (416 thalers), and
                        by the will of God I founded there a hospital in the healthiest quarter of
                        the town, in the Turkish centre 50 metres from the sea, with splendid rooms
                        on the first floor, a courtyard and small garden. In November 1857 the three
                        first Deaconesses disembarked at Alexandria and courageously began their
                        first care, the foundation of the hospital. It was only in February 1858
                        that they were able, after having surmounted many difficulties, to receive
                        their first patients. The first was from Berlin, the second from Bavaria.
                        Little by little the invalids came in, one might say of every race under the
                        sky. Consequent upon the expiration' of the rental contract in 1862,
                        Fliedner was obliged to purchase the old building in order not to bring to
                        an abrupt end the work so well carried out. After the death of Fliedner the
                        alternative was to be faced of undertaking very costly restoration or
                        building new hospital. The latter course was chosen in view of the fact that
                        the old building could never satisfy the existing demands and those
                        competent to judge declared that it was absolutely necessary to isolate the
                        patients from the centre of the town. These difficulties called the writer
                        to Alexandria. After having experienced in 186§ the pleasure of acquiring in
                        front of Moharrem Bey port, a site for 10,000 thalers, well situated in
                        every respect, the new hospital was rapidly constructed on a ground
                        surrounding a perfect manner and has acquired great esteem at Alexandria.
                        The charitable action of this hospital so well known in Alexandria, that it
                        is superfluous to give statistics which would be trying to our patients. I
                        would however, relate an episode in the peaceful and beneficial existence of
                        the hospital, which throws light on the spirit which governs our hospital.
                        It is the unforgettable action of the Sister Superior of the Deaconesses'
                        Hospital Barbara Erckmann who directed it for many years. Twenty five years
                        during the sad and terrible events of which Alexandria was the theatre, when
                        rebellion ruled, and furious and savage mobs devastated the town, and the
                        majority of the Europeans took refuge on the boats of their countries,
                        Sister Barbara Erckmann and her deaconesses alone remained at their posts
                        and awaited the events with their trust in God An enraged crowd hurled
                        itself against the gates of the hospital, yelling and shouting for
                        admittance, The moment was critical, But Barbara Erckmann opened the gates
                        and approached the mob in her simple manner saying "what do your wish of us,
                        have we not always done you good? If you have sick and wounded bring them."
                        Like the miracle of Arion, to refer to the legend, which subdued the savage
                        beasts by the sound of music, so the powerful personality of Barbara.
                        Erckmann, her trust in God, her simple Grandeur, silenced the savageness of
                        a fanatical and unchained populace. She was only asked to lower the flag
                        floating above the hospital as it could serve as a signal,and the appeased
                        crows retired without causing the least damage. This episode is very typical
                        of the spirit which reigns at the Deaconesses's hospital, and has
                        contributed from its humble commencement to its development. (To be

                    <head>St. Andrews Dinner</head>
                    <p>Scotsman all the world over celebrate their Saint's Day with enthusiasm and
                        the Scotsmen of Egypt do not intend to be behindhand. For some years small
                        gatherings have taken place, notably in Alexandria, where Mr. Hewat, the
                        "doyen" of the community, has gathered his compatriots together from year to
                        year, but not until last year was a serious effort made to unite all the
                        Scots of Egypt in a large gathering. That this effort has now resulted in a
                        great success Saturday night's dinner has proved. No less than 77 sat down
                        in the new dining room of the Savoy, which was decorated with Scottish flags
                        and heather in honour of the occasion. The chairman of the evening was Mr.
                        Ronald Graham, and the Croupiers, Major Haig and Dr. Clark. Among the many
                        well-known Scotsmen present were Colonel Macdarlane, D.S.O. Mr Mitchell
                        Innes, Dr. Dunlop, Mr. Hewat, Major Jamieosn, Mr. Lang Anderson, the
                        Reverend Robert Somers, Mr. Macpherson Grant, Mr. G.b. Kerr and Mr.
                        Dalgleish. The toast of the King having been honoured, Dr. Dunlop proposed
                        the toast of H.H.The Khedive which was cordially received. Mr. Mitchell
                        Innes in proposing "the land we live in" told some excellent stories, and
                        the laughter renewed when Mr. Ross Taylor, in proposing the health of the
                        Committee and Secretary, spoke of the difficulty of getting haggis made in
                        Cairo and gave a comic account of the contents of which the Secretary in his
                        reply delicately referred to as the "tups waum" whatever that may mean,
                        though we hear that the chef called it "le grand poche de mouton" The
                        company were enthusiastic in rendering thanks to those who had taken the
                        burden of the organization of the gathering and particularly to Mr. Scott
                        Moncrief, by whose painstaking work a most successful banquet was arranged,
                        the catering of which reflects great credit on Mr. Wild, the resourceful
                        manager of the Savoy Hotel. The evening was brought to a close with reel
                        dancing and Scottish songs, the Band and Pipers of the King's Own Scottish

                    <p>Should Cairo Be Chosen?</p>
                    <p>The movement in favour of holding a great congress in the capitol of Egypt
                        with in view to the reform of Islamic institutions is very significact of
                        the great signs of upheaval that have occured throughout the East since the
                        defeat of Russia by Japan and any attempts to make Islam a creedof
                        pregessive mankind instead of a hardened, stationary belief must win the
                        sympathy of everybody, who is not estanged from him fellow men by narrow
                        religious bias. It is claimed by Christians that it is the unique
                        distinction of their religion that it can be revived and largley restated
                        without altering its essential truth, but that this is not the case with the
                        religion of the Muslem world, for it is quote impossible to reform Muslim
                        society or give it a new principle of life, inasmuch as the Koran has told
                        the Faithfil once and for all and in every detail what to believe and to do,
                        thus leaving no opportunity for growth. If this standpoint is true, then the
                        Congress is doomed to be a failure and the reform of Islamic institutions an
                        impossibility, as all those institutions emanate from the Koran. But whether
                        these arguments contain any germs of truth in them or not, the fact remains
                        that the movement has been accepted with considerable appreciation in Cairo
                        and it well deserves to be carefully noted, for many grace problems are
                        intimately bound up with its success and failure. </p>
                    <p>The most practical difficulty in regard to the realisation of the scheme is
                        whether, assuming the congress is well backed, it should be held in Cairo or
                        Constantimople. We would venture to suggest that neither Cairo nor
                        Constantinople should be selected. Both, it is true, possess the advantage
                        of being the capital of Moslem Countries: but what is there to ensure the
                        attendance of the Faithful in sufficient numbers to render the deliberations
                        of the Congress truly representative. Mecca and Medina would be far more
                        preferable, provided the Congress were held during the pilgrimage. In that
                        case there would be no lack of attendance from all parts of the world of
                        Islam, and the solemnity of the occasion coupled with the thousands
                        participating would lead to the decisions arrived at a weight and authority
                        not to be otherwise attained. The only possible drawback would be that the
                        reformers would be in a hopeless minority there. </p>
                    <p>The one and Only reason, however, why Cairo was selected was, not because of
                        its association, although they may have had and should have some weight, but
                        because neither in Turkey nor Russia would absolute freedom of speech be
                        permitted, as it will be in the country. This, there can be no question, was
                        the dominant consideration in favour of holding Congress in Cairo. Of course
                        the promoters of the COngress would not readily avow that such circumstances
                        had a determining influence upon their choice and it would be most
                        distasteful to Kamel and his clique to make such a confesion. That would be
                        a concession to the "Oppressor," with a big "0", amounying to almost a
                        surrender. But at the same time these agitators, as well as those who have
                        the reform and regeneration of Islam really at heart, know perfectly well
                        that only in a country dominated by men to whom liberty of speech is a
                        sacred right, will they be permitted to ventilate their opinions without
                        fear of the consequences. </p>

                    <p>The Mecca Commission</p>
                    <p>(From Our own Correspondent</p>
                    <p>Aden, November 20</p>
                    <p>The Mecca Commision has arrived at Hodeida from Sana, with the two Turkish
                        pashas who accompanied them to Sana, after a fruitless stay of about one
                        month there. The Mufti of the Hanafi sect was buried at Sana and the other
                        members have reached Hodeida more or less in ill-health. I alluded in my
                        last letter to the result of their negotiations with the Imam, which has
                        already been cabled to the Porte by Faizi Pasha. They have failed in
                        accomplishing their object or even in meeting the Imam, and after all they
                        met with the same fate as the preceding Turkish Commission. Contrary to what
                        was expected the Imam refused point blank to go to Amran when asked to do so
                        by the Commission to confer with them or to appoint a place for a meeting
                        Negotiations by letter had then to be resorted to by the COmmission, with
                        the result that their mission has proved a fiasco. They wrote to hom to ask
                        hom to state his demands and at the same time they tried to bring home to
                        him the necessity of coming to terms with the Turks, and the moral
                        obligation on the Yemenites of obedience to the spiritual Head of Islam. But
                        he expressed his inability to agree to any proposal short of complete
                        autonomy for Upper Yemen, and stated that if he did so, he would be deposed
                        and another appointed in his place. It is said that the Porte is prepared to
                        grant local self-government to Upper Yemen and to give the Imam the position
                        enjoyed by the Sharif of Mecca, but the Imam claims more than that. </p>

                        Major Stuart-Wortley, as he then was, went over to spend a short time in
                        Berlin as the guest of Sir Edward and Lady Ermyntrude Malet, at the British
                        Embassy, and it was then that he was introduced to Prince William, to who he
                        related the story of his perilous descent of the Nile to Meeting with the
                        intelligence that it was all over with Gordon and Khartoum. The Price was
                        entranced with the adventurous story; and it is probable that no one in
                        Europe has a better knowledge of all our wars, little and big, or the last

                    <p>Delay of Mails </p>
                    <p>The night mail train from Benha only arrived at Alexandria this morning at
                        8:30 o'clock thus seriously delaying the local mails. We have received the
                        following official report upon the accident which caused the delay: </p>
                    <p>The bridge on the mainline between Cairo and Alexandria over the Tewfick
                        canal (just south aod Benha) was opened on Sunday as usual to permit boats
                        to pass, When it was being closed against part of the gear on which the
                        bridge could ot be properly closed and trains could not run over it. Traffic
                        is being diverted via Khatatba amd Teb el Baroud or via Belbeis and Zagazig,
                        but there must necessarily be considerable delay to traffic on the airo-
                        Alexandria main line until the bridge is repaired. Gangs have been working
                        on it all night. </p>

                            Empress. He dealt lengthily with the efforts made in numerous circles in
                            both countries to restore the old friendly relations. The history of the
                            last decade would show that the temporary estrangement was nothing but a

                            threatening rain held off. To-day promises to be warmer and plesant, a
                            moderate breeze in blowing from the North and the barometer is rising.

                        <p>The moderate Nationalists.</p>
                        <p>In an article on the various Egyptian political groups the Cairo
                            correspondent of the "Times" makes the following comments on the
                            Moderates :-</p>
                        <p>It may be urged that "El Moayad" and "El Minbar" the principal organs of
                            Moderates, have proved their political common sense by the recent
                            pleading for a better understanding with the occupying Nation. It is,
                            however, difficult to forget the fact that these journals were little,
                            if at all, behind "El Lews" in the vehemence with which they attack
                            British policy during the recent frontier dispute with turkey, and still
                            lose no opportunity of assailing almost every Arabic journal that is not
                            in Muslim hands. Again, the genuineness of their conversations have not
                            yet been tested; their attitudes -to take hypothetical case- in the
                            event of a recurrence of the tension between turkey and the powers which
                            did so much to rally the Egyptian nationalistic forces in the winter of
                            1905 - 1906, or of a divergence of opinion between the Khedive and the
                            British government, could alone furnish proof of their sincerity. Not
                            that they could be expected to take a line hostile to the Sultan or to
                            the Khedive, but were their councils to the Muslims of Egypt informed by
                            a greater prudence and calm than in the past, cynical observers-such as
                            the able staff of "El Watan" the principal Coptic organ - could no
                            longer accuse them of being animated solely by desired secure British
                            radical support at Kamel Pasha's expense.</p>

                        <p>To the editor of the "Egyptian Gazette"</p>
                        <p>Sir,</p>
                        <p>The announcement of the formation of another new party, styling itself
                            the Republican Nationalists, should be welcomed, for its programme,
                            which is said to solely consist in the demand for the immediate
                            constitution of an independent, autonomous republic of Egypt, is
                            decidedly far more explicit than the vague generalities in which Kamel,
                            Sheikh Aly, the Party of the People, et hoe genus omne, indulge in. It
                            is almost impossible to discriminate between the various shades of
                            opinion, which divide in innumerable gradations the Egyptian Liberals
                            from the Nationalist Extremists. We now, at any rate, have a party,
                            which has a simple and definite programme, comprehensible even to a
                            bowab. I have of late asked a number of my native friends what exactly
                            are the differences dividing the various political parties represented
                            by "Al Liwa," "Al Garida." "Al Moayad, "Al Minbar," ete, and they
                            invariably answer that they do not know nor car, for although they read
                            these newspapers do not take the trouble to discriminate between the
                            personal polemics of their editors. Now however, the Republicans will be
                            able to take advantage of the hopeless confusion reighning in Egyptian
                            Politics, and with their concise and trenchant programme, coupled with
                            an energetic, go ahead system of propaganda and aided by a violent
                            journalistic organ, they should make a great deal of progress. The
                            development of this party will be awaited with much interest doubtless
                            in Europe and it ought to gain the sympathies of some of the Radicals in
                            the House of Commons. Truley yours, A. Politician</p>

                        <p>Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People are a very strengthening
                            medicine. They are very effective in cases of scrofula, ricketa, St.
                            Vitus's Dance and swelling of the glands. To children of from five to
                            six years give a third part of a pill after each meal, and give half a
                            pill to those of from six to twelve years, or a pill and a half per day.
                            Divide the pills with a penknife just before administering them. M.
                            Meynet made his little daughter take Dr. Williams' Pink Pills, and this
                            is what he writes :— </p>
                        <p>"I send you my sincere thanks for the good which Dr. Wiliams' Pink Pills
                            for Pale People have done my child. She was very much ran down and very
                            weak, and had no appetite, but Dr. Williams' Pink Pills remedied her
                            ailings and she is now well and happy."</p>
                        <p>M. Marius Bouchet also writes :—</p>
                        <p>"My child was very weak and poorly nourished. On account of stomach
                            disorder I made him take Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People, and
                            now he is quite well."</p>
                        <p>Dr Williams' Pink Pills are good for people of all ages and temperaments.

                        <p>To the Editor of the "Egyptian Gazette"</p>
                        <p>Sir.—Last night at 7 o'clock, on returning from Ramleh, an inspector at
                            about Ibrahimieh askked for the tickets and startled me out of your
                            newspaper by demanding if I was a British officer and unless I was I
                            could not travel half fare. I explained I was not a military man, had
                            asked for a ticket for Alexandria, paid full fare and being occupied
                            reading had recieved my ticket mechanically and crumpled it into my
                            pocket without seeing it, depending on the hoped for honesty of the
                            officials as I often do to my great misfortune. I declined to pay from
                            Ibrahimieh or get off and was absurdly asked to turn out all my cash (I
                            had just collected a considerable amount) to look at my change, as if
                            the officials could pick out their own coins from hundreds of others. So
                            to their disgust I refused to make a useless exhibition of myself. A
                            police official opposite me and many others witnessed me pay full fare
                            for "Alexandria" and saw the inspector tear up my ticket and scatter it
                            round the car letting no one see it. I complained again to a ponderous
                            official in gold braid and buttons at the Gare de Ramleh, telling him
                            this sort of thing is continually happening to passengers and in my
                            instance there is the same measure once a week or so. He said little,
                            appeared used to this sort of complaint, but he likewise was under the
                            peculiar impression that I should display all personal cash for his
                            edification. This was quite unnecessary and uncomplied with as the fare
                            was pilfered and I probably and purposely recieved a wrong ticket.
                            Scores of passengers can prove this sort of thing in their own cases and
                            that the minor employes are ever on the qui-vive to meanly add to their
                            private incomes. The other night coming to Alexandria I was not given a
                            ticket till near Ibrahimieh and this because an inspector was coming. I
                            expressly told the fare collector I got on at Ramleh and gave him P.T.
                            2, full first class fare. He gave me a ticket and rapidly vanished into
                            the next car. This ticket was for P.T. 1 from Ibrahimieh only where we
                            just stopped. The man saw me get on and passed me many times previously.
                            I lost nothing but the Company did. Had I complained my half frane would
                            be denied and I would have to pay over again on my own assertion.
                            Recently a French Levantine near me looking like an Englishman travelled
                            half fare and when on being asked he confessed in fun he was was a
                            British officer in mufti. Regulations I think grant this small privilege
                            to men in uniform only and British officers are gentlemen above
                            troubling over pennies in this manner. About one week ago 8 to 10
                            passengers with myself travelled free from Ramleb because the ticket
                            official knew not one ticket from another and could not serve us. We had
                            none to show the inspector who vented a jolly French laugh with the new
                            man alongside him. It was "Maleesh" all round and we rode gratis into
                            Alexandria with full official consent. From a passenger standpoint this
                            arrangement is perfectly charming and is not a complaint but an example
                            of how things are mismanaged. Recently at midnight arriving in
                            Alexandria I paid P.T. 10 for my jaunt There were few passengers. I
                            tendered half a dollar. The official had a bag full of change, yet
                            claimed he had none but woild gave it later. I was reading and forgot
                            also, though I doubt if he would if the financial posotions were
                            reversed. The "E.G." could be filled every day if passangers had
                            patience for penning complaints over the mean low tricks of our tramway
                            minor employes Many like myself wish to pay for what we hope to expect
                            and dont require unnecessary annoyance, arguments, explanation, fuss end
                            waste of time and temper with any official great or small. Some German
                            papers allude to the "hereditary stupidity" of the native Egyptian, but
                            they could easily include some foreign employés of our local tramear
                            company, or the occasional deposit in Mohamed Aly square of whole tram
                            loads of passengers on Sunday évening from Moharrem Bey with practically
                            no farés paid could not occer. I witnessed this a few times as the
                            result of violent arguments with irate passengers. Also the recent
                            semi-collision of two full trams on the single line at the Presbyterian

                        celui-ci n'opère bien que lorsqu'il est pris avec de bons aliments et des
                        boissons fortifiantes, telles que vin, café, thé. Chacun choisit, pour se
                        purger, l'heure et le repas qui lui conviennent le mieux, selon ses
                        occupations. La fatigue de la purgation étant annulée par l'effet de la
                        bonne alimentation, on se décide aisément à recommencer autant de fois que
