                    <p>Trains run alongside the steamers on the quay, and passengers can be conveyed
                        to Famagusta, Nicosia, Morphou and intermediate stations. Good hotel
                        accommodation for tourists is provided at Famagusta, at the Savoy Hotel (Mr.

                        other ancient ruins and the Venetian fortifications, the finest in the

                    <head>Lord Cromers Entry into political Life</head>
                    <p>It is impossible for us, says the “Spectator,” to overrate the significance
                        of Lord Cromer’s early incursion into our political life at home nor can we
                        foresee at once the exact effect of| the impact of his opinion upon that of
                        his countrymen. Obviously be thought that a warning was necessary. Let us
                        consider quite dispassionately the value of it. It does not come from a
                        layman . it comes from a brilliantly successful! administrator, one of whose
                        chief duties for many years has been the direction of finance and the
                        framing of Budgets. We would call attention to this point, — that it is an
                        expert financial opinion. Bat while Lord Cromer's experience of Free-trade
                        was financial, it was also political. He recalled the occasion when, under
                        Lord Salisbury's Government, the Sudan was opened up, and the assurance was
                        given to the Powers that equality of opportunity would be guaranteed to all
                        the traders of the world. Britain would claim no preference over any of
                        them. This assurance, he tells us, smoothed, and indeed made possible, the
                        path of Empire in the Sudar, and he expresses himself as supremely grateful
                        to the doctrine of Free-trade, which proved itself so I benevolent a
                        coadjutor in the Imperial task. Lord Cromer’s warning, then, is that of an
                        expert financier and a stout Imperialist, who has ends of the other.
                        Principle and practice have never been more beautifully correlated than in
                        his career. Opponents of Free-trade speak as though “Cobdenism” were
                        inevitably allied to the predispositions of the “Little Englander Yet here
                        are the doctrines of Cobden stated with less reserve than we often hear them
                        by the most prominent “Great Englander” of our time. Nor can any one really
                        detract from the significance of the warning on the ground that it is mean
                        to help a particular party. Lord Cromer notoriously served both parties with
                        equal loyalty in Egypt ; and when he retired he went out of his way to
                        record the generous sanction which his policy had enjoyed from the present
                        Government. Indeed, if Lard Crore; speech is examined, what mere party
                        aspiration does it, or can it, help! No one can say that it is likely to
                        help the cause of Tariff Reform. If it had been intended to strengthen the
                        hands of the Government, it would not have condemned, as dangerous to Free
                        trade, one of the most important of the Government proposals. His grave and
                        reiterated! warning as to the perils of a non contributor old age pensions
                        scheme, with its attendant burdens on the taxpayer, were one of the most
                        memorable portions of his speech. Lord Cromer instincts, of course, draw him
                        strongly to the Unionist Party, yet his words appeal only to that part of it
                        which has been driven into political impotence by the madness of the rest.
                        On the face of it, Lord Cromer’s speech ix &amp;perfectly candid, impartial
                        utterance delivered with all sincerity and conviction at some personal
                        inconvenience because he felt that the times demanded it. He stands boldly
                        by the side of those who, as the Duke-of Devonshire expressed it in his
                        letter of welcome to the new vice-president of the Unionist Free-Trade Clab,
                        are determined to do three things, no matter what may be the consequences on
                        a rigid party system. Those three things are to detend the Union, to combat
                        Socialistic legislation, and to maintain Free trade. </p>
                    <p>We say that Lord Cromer’s Warning was demanded by the times, because the time
                        is plainly ripe for a reconsideration of the basis upon which the Unionist
                        Party shall continue to exist. This much is admitted by the “Times," which
                        declares that changed circumstances make it inexpedient to set up Tariff
                        Reform as a test of party loyalty. An increasing number of Unionists who
                        were and are Tariff Reformers apparently share the conclusion of the
                        “Times,” and we can hardly doubt what the effect of Lord Cromer's speech
                        will be on the minds of other waverers. We do not forget, of course, that
                        Mr. Balfour has never imposed a test, but in the constituencies it has been
                        notoriously applied. We do not ask any one to substitute the appeal to
                        authority for private conviction, but we would nonetheless point to the
                        peculiar, indeed unique, weight of Lord Cromer's experience as an argument
                        in the Fiscal dispute that cannot honestly be overlooked. Finally, Lord
                        Cromer’s treatment of the question of old-age pensions was most telling,
                        because he did not deal with it on the moral side, bat simply as a financier
                        deals with a purely financial matter. Where is the money — the twenty or
                        thirty million pounds—to come from? That is a question which cannot be
                        separated from the proposal to create old-age pensions. On every one who
                        asks for pensions he’s the onus of proving how the money is to be raised. It
                        is ridiculous, as Lord Cromer showed so aptly in his amusing story of the
                        Conjurer, to talk, as at least one Labour Member has done, as though a
                        scheme were one thing and its cost quite another, — as thought it were the
                        business of the Member of Parlia ment to advocate whatever seductive plans
                        leaped to his brain, and the business of the Chancellor of the Exchequer to
                        pay for them. Lord Cromer, who year by year and month by month in Egypt had
                        both to create the scheme and to provide for the cost, will not for a moment
                        countenance such folly and heresy “Where can I find the money ?” was the
                        puzzle be had always to solve, and he will never sanction the shirking of it
                        by others. Lord Cromer evidently believes that we have very nearly reached
                        the limit of the money producing power of our present taxes, and that the
                        great sum necessary for State-granted old age pensions could conceivably be
                        produced only by a Protectionist tariff, to the vast detriment of the
                        country in numerous ways, —though even this test would be a very difficult
                        one. Old age pensions, in a word, must mean in the end a resort to a tariff.
                        Will a Free trade party consent to ran the risk that this will be the
                        ultimate price which will have to be paid for old-age pensions, even though
                        the Government have recklessly pledged themselves to a universal
                        non-contributory scheme. We fancy that if many Liberals revealed their
                        honest opinion, they would confess that they would be heartily glad to see
                        the proposal of State Paid pensions wiped off the slate. We trust that on
                        the point Lord Cromer's speech, for which we offer him our sincere
                        gratitude, may be the means of inducing reconsideration, and perhaps even
                        calling a halt. If Lord Cromer should prove to have winged Tariff Reform
                        with one barrel and old-age pensions with the other - and we are by no means
                        sure that he has not done so—he will indeed have been a memorable
                        achievement. </p>

                            Wingate expresses his satisfaction at the completion of the unfinished
                            wing of the College and the decision of the Government to allot funds
                            for the building of a large primary school thus setting free a

                            behoves the Sudan Government and the Gordon College authorities to lose
                            no time in creating, as far as possible, a local supply commensurate

                            these difficalties are gradually being overcome, and in that connection
                            pays a tribute to the Egyptian ministry of Public Instraction and to Mr.
                            Currie, the principal of the college, and his Enropean and native staff.
                            In regard to the vernacular Training College, he attended the
                            examination of the young Sheikhs, and was much struck with the
                            advancements they had made in a comparatively short period. “The reports
                            of those who have already passed out of the college and have taken up
                            Government as schoolmasters, minor judges, &amp;e., are, ont exception,
                            satisfactory.” Sir Resid om knowledges the great services to the college
                            of the Earl of Cromer and Sir Henry Craik, and thinks there is no cause
                            for any misgivings that exceptional facilities are being given to the
                            Department of Education to the exclusion of other more pressing needs in
                            the country's development. Progress during year has been satisfactory.
                            New primary schools will be built at Atbara, Port Sudan, and Eb Obeid,
                            and thus perhaps provide recruits for secondary and technical schools,
                            though there is a great demand onthe part of the Government and private
                            employers for the product turned outby the primary schools. As the
                            result of a tour of inspection round the Eastern Sudan, Mr. Currie
                            considers that the country is progressing so rapidly that the services
                            of natives with any kind of technical qualification must become more and
                            more imperatively called for every year. Satisfactory results are
                            recorded in the higher primary school, the training college for teachers
                            of English, the technical school, and the instructional workshops. Mr.
                            Currie concludes by expressing his indebtedness to hjs whole staff, and
                            says : “The loyalty and industry of maw Pictectoun the junior members of
                            the Egyptian staff have been beyond all praise, and I am proud to have
                            an opportunity of testifying to it." The expenditure for the tear ended
                            December 1906, was veges gerne detec expenditure £14,596 18s.6d. being

                        <p>Yesterday afternoon the foundation stone of the new Deaconnesss' Hospital
                            was laid at Hadra in the presense of almost the entire Germany COlony of
                            ALexandria. In the morning a special service was held in the German
                            Protestant Church, when an eloquent address was delivered by the Rev.
                            Buek. After the service Count Bernstorff and the committe of the

                            by the singing of a hyme, after which Mr. Wunderlich delivered a most
                            impressive speech, as follows:-</p>
                        <p>Ladies and Gentlemen, Today we are gathered with the twofold object of
                            celebrating the fiftieth anniversary of the day on which the first
                            sisters of Kaiser Pharoahs to commnce their work of love, and also to
                            lay the fondation stone of the buildinh of the hospital. The house
                            Mother of Kaiserswerth has edited a memoire on the history of the fifty
                            years of existance of the Alexandria hospital and has dedicatd it to the
                            daughter establishment to celebrate its jubilee. This memoire, which we
                            appreciate as the most ideal jubilee gift, has to our great regret not
                            yet arrived so that we are unable to place it, as was our intention,
                            under foundation stone, as one of the most important documents. I am
                            consequently obliged to refer for what concerns the history of the
                            foundation of the hospital, to the memoire of Pastor Julius Disselhof,
                            bearing the title of "Association of Deaconesses of the Rhine and of
                            Westphalia and its Spheres of Work" which appreaed in 1882. In this work
                            the history of the foundation and development of our hospital is given
                            in so simple and unornamented fashion that one could believe oneself to
                            be reading an Evangelic epistle of the New Testament. Listen, rather,
                            and judge for yourselves. For the comprehension of the history which I
                            will read to you, I will inform you that the founder of our hospital is
                            Pastor Julius Fliedner, who in 1883 founded the mother house at
                            Kaiserwerth. The history o fthe foundation says:-'The hospital of the
                            Deaconesses at Alexandria . In the Winter of 1856-7, Fliedner was
                            obliged to recuperate his health by staying in Cairo. Invited by the
                            Consuls-General of England and Prussia to found at Alexandria a
                            Deaconesses' hospital to recieve sailors and other foreign invalids,
                            they promised him besides to obtain from their Govenrnments special
                            support for the undertaking as well as annual subsidies. The existing
                            European hospital at Alexandria directed by sisters of charity was
                            over-filled. That is why a second hospital was required. Besides, in the
                            Autumn of 1857 a priest had to be summoned for the Evangelic German
                            Protestants in whom the Deaconesses would find support. Fliedner then
                            wrote:-</p>
                        <p> What could I do? Could I reject the prayer offered to us on this
                            occasion to protect in their faith our co-religionists in this important
                            town of Africa, in this town which is developing 80 enormously not only
                            from a commercial point of view in the Mediterranean, but also as the
                            centre of communication be tween India, Australia, and Europe, where
                            Europeans collect in masses, among whom are large numbers of
                            Protestants. Such decided me to rent the house of Turkish Pasha at
                            Alexandria for 7,500 piastres (416 thalers), and by the will of God I
                            founded there a hospital in the healthiest quarter of the town, in the
                            Turkish centre 50 metres from the sea, with splendid rooms on the first
                            floor, a courtyard and small garden. In November 1857 the three first
                            Deaconesses disembarked at Alexandria and courageously began their first
                            care, the foundation of the hospital. It was only in February 1858 that
                            they were able, after having surmounted many difficulties, to receive
                            their first patients. The first was from Berlin, the second from
                            Bavaria. Little by little the invalids came in, one might say of every
                            race under the sky. Consequent upon the expiration’ of the rental
                            contract in 1862, Fliedner was obliged to purchase the old building in
                            order not to bring to an abrupt end the work so well carried out. After
                            the death of Fliedner the alternative was to be faced of undertaking
                            very costly restoration or building new hospital. The latter course was
                            chosen in view of the fact that the old building could never satisfy the
                            existing demands and those competent to judge declared that it was
                            absolutely necessary to isolate the patients from the centre of the
                            town. These difficulties called the writer to Alexandria. After having
                            experienced in 186§ the pleasure of acquiring in front of Moharrem Bey
                            port, a site for 10,000 thalers, well situated in every respect, the new
                            hospital was rapidly constructed on a ground surrounding a perfect
                            manner and has acquired great esteem at Alexandria. The charitable
                            action of this hospital so well known in Alexandria, that it is
                            superfluous to give statistics which would be trying to our patients. I
                            would however, relate an episode in the peaceful and beneficial
                            existence of the hospital, which throws light on the spirit which
                            governs our hospital. It is the unforgettable action of the Sister
                            Superior of the Deaconesses’ Hospital Barbara Erckmann who directed it
                            for many years. Twenty five years during the sad and terrible events of
                            which Alexandria was the theatre, when rebellion ruled, and furious and
                            savage mobs devastated the town, and the majority of the Europeans took
                            refuge on the boats of their countries, Sister Barbara Erckmann and her
                            deaconesses alone remained at their posts and awaited the events with
                            their trust in God An enraged crowd hurled itself against the gates of
                            the hospital, yelling and shouting for admittance, The moment was
                            critical, But Barbara Erckmann opened the gates and approached the mob
                            in her simple manner saying “what do your wish of us, have we not always
                            done you good? If you have sick and wounded bring them.” Like the
                            miracle of Arion, to refer to the legend, which subdued the savage
                            beasts by the sound of music, so the powerful personality of Barbara.
                            Erckmann, her trust in God, her simple Grandeur, silenced the savageness
                            of a fanatical and unchained populace. She was only asked to lower the
                            flag floating above the hospital as it could serve as a signal,and the
                            appeased crows retired without causing the least damage. This episode is
                            very typical of the spirit which reigns at the Deaconesses’s hospital,
                            and has contributed from its humble commencement to its development. (To

                            and the Scotsmen of Egypt do not intend to be behindhand. For some years
                            small gatherings have taken place, notably in Alexandria, where Mr.
                            Hewat, the “doyen” of the community, has gathered his compatriots
                            together from year to year, but not until last year was a serious effort
                            made to unite all the Scots of Egypt in a large gathering. That this
                            effort has now resulted in a great success Saturday night’s dinner has
                            proved. No less than 77 sat down in the new dining room of the Savoy,
                            which was decorated with Scottish flags and heather in honour of the
                            occasion. The chairman of the evening was Mr. Ronald Graham, and the
                            Croupiers, Major Haig and Dr. Clark. Among the many well-known Scotsmen
                            present were Colonel Macdarlane, D.S.O. Mr Mitchell Innes, Dr. Dunlop,
                            Mr. Hewat, Major Jamieosn, Mr. Lang Anderson, the Reverend Robert
                            Somers, Mr. Macpherson Grant, Mr. G.b. Kerr and Mr. Dalgleish. The toast
                            of the King having been honoured, Dr. Dunlop proposed the toast of
                            H.H.The Khedive which was cordially received. Mr. Mitchell Innes in
                            proposing “the land we live in” told some excellent stories, and the
                            laughter renewed when Mr. Ross Taylor, in proposing the health of the
                            Committee and Secretary, spoke of the difficulty of getting haggis made
                            in Cairo and gave a comic account of the contents of which the Secretary
                            in his reply delicately referred to as the “tups waum” whatever that may
                            mean, though we hear that the chef called it “le grand poche de mouton”
                            The company were enthusiastic in rendering thanks to those who had taken
                            the burden of the organization of the gathering and particularly to Mr.
                            Scott Moncrief, by whose painstaking work a most successful banquet was
                            arranged, the catering of which reflects great credit on Mr. Wild, the
                            resourceful manager of the Savoy Hotel. The evening was brought to a
                            close with reel dancing and Scottish songs, the Band and Pipers of the
                            King’s Own Scottish Borderers being much appreciated. The following was

                            largley restated without altering its essential truth, but that this is
                            not the case with the religion of the Muslem world, for it is quote
                            impossible to reform Muslim society or give it a new principle of life,
                            inasmuch as the Koran has told the Faithfil once and for all and in
                            every detail what to believe and to do, thus leaving no opportunity for
                            growth. If this standpoint is true, then the Congress is doomed to be a
                            failure and the reform of Islamic institutions an impossibility, as all
                            those institutions emanate from the Koran. But whether these arguments
                            contain any germs of truth in them or not, the fact remains that the
                            movement has been accepted with considerable appreciation in Cairo and
                            it well deserves to be carefully noted, for many grace problems are
                            intimately bound up with its success and failure. </p>
                        <p>The most practical difficulty in regard to the realisation of the scheme
                            is whether, assuming the congress is well backed, it should be held in
                            Cairo or Constantimople. We would venture to suggest that neither Cairo
                            nor Constantinople should be selected. Both, it is true, possess the
                            advantage of being the capital of Moslem Countries: but what is there to
                            ensure the attendance of the Faithful in sufficient numbers to render
                            the deliberations of the Congress truly representative. Mecca and Medina
                            would be far more preferable, provided the Congress were held during the
                            pilgrimage. In that case there would be no lack of attendance from all
                            parts of the world of Islam, and the solemnity of the occasion coupled
                            with the thousands participating would lead to the decisions arrived at
                            a weight and authority not to be otherwise attained. The only possible
                            drawback would be that the reformers would be in a hopeless minority
                            there. </p>
                        <p>The one and Only reason, however, why Cairo was selected was, not because
                            of its association, although they may have had and should have some
                            weight, but because neither in Turkey nor Russia would absolute freedom
                            of speech be permitted, as it will be in the country. This, there can be
                            no question, was the dominant consideration in favour of holding
                            Congress in Cairo. Of course the promoters of the COngress would not
                            readily avow that such circumstances had a determining influence upon
                            their choice and it would be most distasteful to Kamel and his clique to
                            make such a confesion. That would be a concession to the “Oppressor,”
                            with a big “0”, amounying to almost a surrender. But at the same time
                            these agitators, as well as those who have the reform and regeneration
                            of Islam really at heart, know perfectly well that only in a country
                            dominated by men to whom liberty of speech is a sacred right, will they
                            be permitted to ventilate their opinions without fear of the
                            consequences. </p>

                        <p> The Mecca Commission</p>
                        <p>(From Our own Correspondent</p>
                        <p>Aden, November 20</p>
                        <p>The Mecca Commision has arrived at Hodeida from Sana, with the two
                            Turkish pashas who accompanied them to Sana, after a fruitless stay of
                            about one month there. The Mufti of the Hanafi sect was buried at Sana
                            and the other members have reached Hodeida more or less in ill-health. I
                            alluded in my last letter to the result of their negotiations with the
                            Imam, which has already been cabled to the Porte by Faizi Pasha. They
                            have failed in accomplishing their object or even in meeting the Imam,
                            and after all they met with the same fate as the preceding Turkish
                            Commission. Contrary to what was expected the Imam refused point blank
                            to go to Amran when asked to do so by the Commission to confer with them
                            or to appoint a place for a meeting Negotiations by letter had then to
                            be resorted to by the COmmission, with the result that their mission has
                            proved a fiasco. They wrote to hom to ask hom to state his demands and
                            at the same time they tried to bring home to him the necessity of coming
                            to terms with the Turks, and the moral obligation on the Yemenites of
                            obedience to the spiritual Head of Islam. But he expressed his inability
                            to agree to any proposal short of complete autonomy for Upper Yemen, and
                            stated that if he did so, he would be deposed and another appointed in
                            his place. It is said that the Porte is prepared to grant local
                            self-government to Upper Yemen and to give the Imam the position enjoyed
                            by the Sharif of Mecca, but the Imam claims more than that. </p>

                        <p>Sir Joseph Saba Pasba, K.C.M.G. left from Cairo by yesterday's every

                        <p>Colonel Stuart-Wortly, the order of Highcliffe Castle, is no stranger to
                            the Kaiser, the present tenant. On returning from the Nile Campaign in
                            1886, Major Stuart-Wortley, as he then was, went over to spend a short
                            time in Berlin as the guest of Sir Edward and Lady Ermyntrude Malet, at
                            the British Embassy, and it was then that he was introduced to Prince
                            William, to who he related the story of his perilous descent of the Nile
                            to Meeting with the intelligence that it was all over with Gordon and
                            Khartoum. The Price was entranced with the adventurous story; and it is
                            probable that no one in Europe has a better knowledge of all our wars,
                            little and big, or the last twenty years- a knowledge derived from first

                            at 8:30 o’clock thus seriously delaying the local mails. We have
                            received the following official report upon the accident which caused
                            the delay: </p>
                        <p>The bridge on the mainline between Cairo and Alexandria over the Tewfick
                            canal (just south aod Benha) was opened on Sunday as usual to permit
                            boats to pass, When it was being closed against part of the gear on
                            which the bridge could ot be properly closed and trains could not run
                            over it. Traffic is being diverted via Khatatba amd Teb el Baroud or via
                            Belbeis and Zagazig, but there must necessarily be considerable delay to
                            traffic on the airo- Alexandria main line until the bridge is repaired.
                            Gangs have been working on it all night. </p>

                        by general applause when he expressed Germany's thanks to the British Royal
                        Family and people for the brilliant reception accorded to the Emperor and

                        both countries to restore the old friendly relations. The history of the
                        last decade would show that the temporary estrangement was nothing but a
                        huge misunderstanding. (Reuter)</p>

                        <p>The moderate Nationalists.</p>
                        <p>In an article on the various Egyptian political groups the Cairo
                            correspondent of the "Times" makes the following comments on the
                            Moderates :-</p>
                        <p>It may be urged that “El Moayad” and “El Minbar” the principal organs of
                            Moderates, have proved their political common sense by the recent
                            pleading for a better understanding with the occupying Nation. It is,
                            however, difficult to forget the fact that these journals were little,
                            if at all, behind “El Lews” in the vehemence with which they attack
                            British policy during the recent frontier dispute with turkey, and still
                            lose no opportunity of assailing almost every Arabic journal that is not
                            in Muslim hands. Again, the genuineness of their conversations have not
                            yet been tested; their attitudes -to take hypothetical case- in the
                            event of a recurrence of the tension between turkey and the powers which
                            did so much to rally the Egyptian nationalistic forces in the winter of
                            1905 - 1906, or of a divergence of opinion between the Khedive and the
                            British government, could alone furnish proof of their sincerity. Not
                            that they could be expected to take a line hostile to the Sultan or to
                            the Khedive, but were their councils to the Muslims of Egypt informed by
                            a greater prudence and calm than in the past, cynical observers-such as
                            the able staff of “El Watan” the principal Coptic organ - could no
                            longer accuse them of being animated solely by desired secure British
                            radical support at Kamel Pasha’s expense.</p>

                        <p>To the editor of the "Egyptian Gazette"</p>
                        <p>Sir,</p>
                        <p>The announcement of the formation of another new party, styling itself
                            the Republican Nationalists, should be welcomed, for its programme,
                            which is said to solely consist in the demand for the immediate
                            constitution of an independent, autonomous republic of Egypt, is
                            decidedly far more explicit than the vague generalities in which Kamel,
                            Sheikh Aly, the Party of the People, et hoe genus omne, indulge in. It
                            is almost impossible to discriminate between the various shades of
                            opinion, which divide in innumerable gradations the Egyptian Liberals
                            from the Nationalist Extremists. We now, at any rate, have a party,
                            which has a simple and definite programme, comprehensible even to a
                            bowab. I have of late asked a number of my native friends what exactly
                            are the differences dividing the various political parties represented
                            by “Al Liwa,” “Al Garida.” “Al Moayad, “Al Minbar,” ete, and they
                            invariably answer that they do not know nor car, for although they read
                            these newspapers do not take the trouble to discriminate between the
                            personal polemics of their editors. Now however, the Republicans will be
                            able to take advantage of the hopeless confusion reighning in Egyptian
                            Politics, and with their concise and trenchant programme, coupled with
                            an energetic, go ahead system of propaganda and aided by a violent
                            journalistic organ, they should make a great deal of progress. The
                            development of this party will be awaited with much interest doubtless
                            in Europe and it ought to gain the sympathies of some of the Radicals in
                            the House of Commons. Truley yours, A. Politician</p>

                        <p>Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills for Pale People are a very strengthening
                            medicine. They are very effective in cases of scrofula, ricketa, St.
                            Vitus’s Dance and swelling of the glands. To children of from five to
                            six years give a third part of a pill after each meal, and give half a
                            pill to those of from six to twelve years, or a pill and a half per day.
                            Divide the pills with a penknife just before administering them. M.
                            Meynet made his little daughter take Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills, and this
                            is what he writes :— </p>
                        <p>“I send you my sincere thanks for the good which Dr. Wiliams’ Pink Pills
                            for Pale People have done my child. She was very much ran down and very

                    <p>Alexandria Tramways</p>
                    <p>To the Editor of the "Egyptian Gazette"</p>
                    <p>Sir.—Last night at 7 o'clock, on returning from Ramleh, an inspector at about
                        Ibrahimieh askked for the tickets and startled me out of your newspaper by
                        demanding if I was a British officer and unless I was I could not travel
                        half fare. I explained I was not a military man, had asked for a ticket for
                        Alexandria, paid full fare and being occupied reading had recieved my ticket
                        mechanically and crumpled it into my pocket without seeing it, depending on
                        the hoped for honesty of the officials as I often do to my great misfortune.
                        I declined to pay from Ibrahimieh or get off and was absurdly asked to turn
                        out all my cash (I had just collected a considerable amount) to look at my
                        change, as if the officials could pick out their own coins from hundreds of
                        others. So to their disgust I refused to make a useless exhibition of
                        myself. A police official opposite me and many others witnessed me pay full
                        fare for “Alexandria” and saw the inspector tear up my ticket and scatter it
                        round the car letting no one see it. I complained again to a ponderous
                        official in gold braid and buttons at the Gare de Ramleh, telling him this
                        sort of thing is continually happening to passengers and in my instance
                        there is the same measure once a week or so. He said little, appeared used
                        to this sort of complaint, but he likewise was under the peculiar impression
                        that I should display all personal cash for his edification. This was quite
                        unnecessary and uncomplied with as the fare was pilfered and I probably and
                        purposely recieved a wrong ticket. Scores of passengers can prove this sort
                        of thing in their own cases and that the minor employes are ever on the
                        qui-vive to meanly add to their private incomes. The other night coming to
                        Alexandria I was not given a ticket till near Ibrahimieh and this because an
                        inspector was coming. I expressly told the fare collector I got on at Ramleh
                        and gave him P.T. 2, full first class fare. He gave me a ticket and rapidly
                        vanished into the next car. This ticket was for P.T. 1 from Ibrahimieh only
                        where we just stopped. The man saw me get on and passed me many times
                        previously. I lost nothing but the Company did. Had I complained my half
                        frane would be denied and I would have to pay over again on my own
                        assertion. Recently a French Levantine near me looking like an Englishman
                        travelled half fare and when on being asked he confessed in fun he was was a
                        British officer in mufti. Regulations I think grant this small privilege to
                        men in uniform only and British officers are gentlemen above troubling over
                        pennies in this manner. About one week ago 8 to 10 passengers with myself
                        travelled free from Ramleb because the ticket official knew not one ticket
                        from another and could not serve us. We had none to show the inspector who
                        vented a jolly French laugh with the new man alongside him. It was “Maleesh”
                        all round and we rode gratis into Alexandria with full official consent.
                        From a passenger standpoint this arrangement is perfectly charming and is
                        not a complaint bnt an example of how things are mismanaged. Recently at
                        midnight arriving in Alexandria I paid P.T. 10 for my jaunt There were few
                        passengers. I tendered half a dollar. The official had a bag full of change,
                        yet claimed he had none but woild gave it later. I was reading and forgot
                        also, though I doubt if he would if the financial posotions were reversed.
                        The "E.G." could be filled every day if passangers had patience for penning
                        complaints over the mean low tricks of our tramway minor employes Many like
                        myself wish to pay for what we hope to expect and dont require unnecessary
                        annoyance, arguments, explanation, fuss end waste of time and temper with
                        any official great or small. Some German papers allude to the “hereditary
                        stupidity” of the native Egyptian, but they could easily include some
                        foreign employés of our local tramear company, or the occasional deposit in
                        Mohamed Aly square of whole tram loads of passengers on Sunday évening from
                        Moharrem Bey with practically no farés paid could not occer. I witnessed
                        this a few times as the result of violent arguments with irate passengers.
                        Also the recent semi-collision of two full trams on the single line at the
                        Presbyterian Chorch coming full tilt for each other could be avoided by more
                        than the bare 10 feet that myself and others witnessed, one tram having to
                        beat retreat all the way back to the E.T.C. offices. Sir, I am too weary to
                        add more except that “oinseach” is Celtic for “foolish old ladies” and the
                        word can often be locally applied applied. Hoping you can find a corner for
                        part of the foregeing and thanking your for any space occupied.</p>
                    <p>I am, Sir,</p>
                    <p>Faithfully yours,</p>
