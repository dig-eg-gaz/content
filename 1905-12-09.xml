                            <p>The Sultan and The Powers</p>
                            <p>For the moment the tension that has been existing between the Sultan
                                and the Powers is releived, and the Sublime Porte is state to have
                                accepted the Macedonian financial scheme subjecct to numerous
                                modifications. The crisis, it is hardly needful to point out, is
                                only temporaryily releaved even if we assume that the Sultan's
                                concessions are genuine, ffor the Macedonian problem will never be
                                solved by the peaceful methods of diplomacy or such mild acts of
                                coercion as the seizure of custom houses. The Blue Book issued
                                yesterday week on the situation shows very clearly the disturbed
                                state of the country, and gives information as to the steps taken by
                                the Powers to bring about an improvement. Whether the measures that
                                have been, and are now being taken will improved the position is
                                quite a different matter; unfortunately there is not much room for
                                hope that they will. The fault does not rest with the Sultan, as
                                some agitators would have us believe. It is true, of course, that
                                his honesty of the officials is seldom very conspicious; but the
                                main difficulty is in the dissensions of the Christian. The creeds
                                of the rival sects are still of that sturdy nature which disdains
                                toleration: and accordingly the long list of Macedonian outbreaks
                                contain many outrages and murders committed by one Christian body on
                                the other, while the Turkish Government looks on, only occasionally
                                interfering that it may impartially massacre both. Whille the
                                Churches are strong enough to defy the Government and to play on the
                                fanatic feelings of their followers by egging them on, and while the
                                neighboring States are able to interfere and to stir up racial as
                                well as religious strife, it is safe to predict that the condition
                                of Macedonia will not be greatly ameliorated. The establishment of a
                                strong Administration able to depress disorder severly, whether
                                committed by Christian of Turk, seems to real way out; but at the
                                moment it is not possible; and the other alternative suggested, that
                                the country shall be divided among the disputants, would probably
                                lead to open war. </p>

                        <head>The Price of Admiralty</head>
                        <p>There are several points of view from which the coming increase in the
                            German navy mmay be regarded- for the decision to build larger
                            battleships constitutes a substantial increase even though the numbers
                            may not be augmented. From one point of view, of course, it is a
                            confession of allure, emphasised by the fact that the Germans hitherto
                            have built small battleship as a matter of deliberate policy. In
                            learning the lesson from the 14,100 tons of the Royal Sovereigns, which
                            is to entail still further enlargement, but we have never found at one
                            moment the necessity for the immense expenditures which must be incurres
                            by the German empire in the widening of the KAirser Wilhelm Canal as
                            well as by the enlargement of docks an the deepening of the fair ways of
                            the harbours. The need which entails all this is obviously urgent, and
                            the thinking department of the German warlike services is sound and
                            sure. The "big battleship" questionn is settled for a long time to come. </p>
                        <p>The point to be considered by us is, of course, what effect will the
                            increase in the German fleet have upon our own programmes of the future?
                            Their estimates will amount to £15,500,000 a year in future, and the
                            personnel is to be increased by 18,000 men and 600 officers. The actual
                            addition to the numbers of the fleet will be (if the Reichstag accepts
                            the Bill), six armoured cruisers of the largest size, and fifty sea
                            going torpedo craft. The first point which occurs is, obviously, that by
                            building cruisers of power equal, or superior, to any of ours up to the
                            Minataur class the Germans have put an end to belief that we could, at a
                            pinch, use our cruisers in line against their light battleships. At the
                            same time, the belief which some people hold in the Triumph and
                            Swittsure receives a damper. Even the Canopus class will shortly be of
                            doubtful value in the North Sea. </p>
                        <p>But the chief question which we have todecide is politico strategic. What
                            is the underlying object of the Emperor and his advisers. It gives
                            offence to speak of German Navy as the Kaiser's "toy"; and the postulate
                            sometimes advanced as an axiom that the German Empire must have a fleet
                            commensurate to its dignity as a Great Power puts that navy much in the
                            light of a toy; or at any rate, of the carriages and horses requisite
                            for a big wig to keep up his position. It would be an insult to so keen
                            a stateman as Kaiser Wilhelm to suppose that he intended to expend
                            enourmous sums of money, involving severe new taxation, without a
                            definite end in view. Let it be said at once that there is no good
                            ground for supposing that the German navy is being increased with any
                            intention of attacking England. The next great bid for world power on
                            the part of the Germans will take place when the throne of the Emporer
                            Franz Josef is vacant, and the most serious obstacle in the way of
                            German ambition is France. That is, perhaps, now recognised by the
                            French, who, simultaneously with the new German advance are about to
                            inaugurate a new era of shipbuilding, framed to keep them at least
                            upsides with their spectaculr enemy when both programmes are completed. </p>
                        <p>If this hypothesis be correct, the gravity of our own task is enhanced,
                            not diminished. We are on excellent terms with France, and hope with all
                            our hearts that we shall for ever remain so. But it is a far cry to
                            1917, and in the meantime, the standard of our fleet is still "equality
                            with the fleets of the two next strongest Powers, with a margin." France
                            and Germany competing with each other, therefore, impose upon us the
                            task of keeping a breast of the two. We have always deprecated the cry
                            for huge shipbuilding programme, which the necessities of the case did
                            not seem to demand. But a new fact has arisen. In twelve years' time the
                            "two next strongest Powers" will possess thirty six battleships of a
                            class purerior to all the vessels we possess, save nine; vessels
                            embodying not only evolutionary progress, but a new theory of naval
                            warfare. It is not too much to say that we shall require to build from
                            thirty to thirty four vessels of equal power during that period. In
                            fact, our normal programme will have to be three battleships a year for
                            a considerable part of the time. Of armoured cruisers, as expensive now
                            as battleships were a few years ago, the number requisite cannot be
                            estimated. Such is the price of Admiralty- the necessary price of
                            national security- in an era when the world prates of disarmament and
                            arbitration. </p>

                            <p>Military mutinies are spreading throughout the country. Occasionally
                                the loyal troops intervene, but in general they are unopposed. A
                                battalion at Ekaderinoday seized the arsenal and marched to
                                Novorosyk, where they won over the garrison and armed the workmen.
                                In another case a regiment demanded the removal of unpopular
                                officers. The colonel complied. (Reuter)</p>

                        <div type="cable"><dateline>London, December 8</dateline>
                        <p>Sir Archibald Hunter has been gazetted General. (Reuter)</p>
                        <p>The promotion of General Hunter, announced in to-day's telegram, will
                            cause general satisfaction in Egypt and the Sudan where the gallant
                            General has so many friends. If Lord Kitchener was the brain of the
                            Egyptian army, General Hunter was its sword arm. For fourteen years he
                            was in the front of all the fighting on the Southern border. He was
                            Intelligence Officer during the anxious days before Ginnis, when the
                            Camerons and 9th Sudanese were beset by triumphant Dervishes in Kosleh
                            fort, and reinforcements were far to the northward. Going out on a
                            sortie one day, he lingered behind the retiring force to pick off
                            Dervishes with a rifle he was wont to carry on such occasions; there he
                            received a wound in the shoulder, which he is not quit of today. When
                            Nejumi came down in '89, Hunter was in the front of everything: he
                            fought all day at the head of the blacks at ARgin, and commanded a
                            brigade of them at Toski. He was again woundeda spear thrust in the
                            arm while he was charging the thickest of the Dervishes at the head of
                            the 13th. Thereafter he was Govenor of the frontier at Halfa, Govenor of
                            the frontier at Dougola, Govenor of the frontier at Berberalways on
                            the frontier. </p>
                        <p>The late G.W. Steevens, in "With Kitchener to Khartoum," thus describes
                            him:- "When there was fighting he always led the way to it with his
                            blacks, whom he loves like children, and who love him like a father.
                            Fourteen years of bugle and bullet by night and day, in summer and
                            winter, fighting Dervishes year in and year out- till fighting
                            Dervishes, Dervishes has come to be a holy mission, pursued with a
                            burning zeal akin to fanaticism. Hunter Pasha is the crusador of the
                            nineteenth century. In all he is and does he is the true knight-errant-
                            a paladin drifted into his wrong century. He is one of those happy men
                            whom nature has made all in one piece- consistent, simple, unvarying;
                            everything he does is just like him. He is short and thickset; but that,
                            instead of making him unromantic, only draws your eye to his long
                            sword."</p></div>

                        desiring Mr. Asquith to lead the Commons and Sir Henry the Lords. This will
                        mecessitate the recasting of the Cabinet. </p>

                        social legislation must remain in the House of Commons. Sir E. Grey
                        considers that Mr.Asquith is better able to unite the Imperialist and
                        Radical wings of the party, and that Sir Henry Campbell Bannerman can not
                        only serve the party better in the Lords, but that he will have more leisure
                        to discharge the multifarious duties of the Premiership. </p>

                    <p>Luxor, Dec 8</p>
                    <p>An exciting incident occurred yesterday in the hills in the neighbourhood od
                        Edfou, where a patrol of coastguards came unexpectedly upon the notorious
                        brigand chief, Yassine, who attacked some men, employed by a mining company,
                        last week in the desert by Keneh. An engagement ensued wherein Yassine was
                        shot dead. The neighbourhood is much relieved to be free for ever of the
                        presence of this savage outlaw. </p>

                    <p>"Deltaner"(Alexandria) writes:-</p>
                    <p>A great deal has been said in you columns on the above subject and I have
                        reason to believe that it has not always been said in vain. I therefore hope
                        that my letter will help to stop an act of great cruelty, which is daily to
                        be witnessed in the streets of our town. I refer to the carrying about og
                        live wild ducks, which are often bound together by the feet and slung over
                        men's shoulders in bundles of forty and more. These poor animals, with their
                        legs and wings tied together by rough grass hope, suffer terrible pain being
                        carried in this way the whole day long though the streets and every minute
                        roughly handled to show them to likely buuyers. With great exertions they
                        try to keep their heads up as long as they can but pain added to thirst soon
                        makes them weak and finally their heads drop, many of them weak and finally
                        their heads drop, many of them being blinded to keep them quiet. Do people
                        who see them carried past ever think of what excruciating agony these poor
                        beasts must suffer? Why should their torturers not be compelled to carry
                        them in cages if they are allowed to carry them about alive? Is this not a
                        striking case for the S.P.C.A.? A duck is also an animal, why should it not
                        be protected as other animals are?Certainpeople will probably mutter or even
                        print something about "semtimitialist" and declare that it is not right to
                        disturb poor people in gaining their daily bread. The cost of "caffas" will
                        not ruin the dealer in ducks, but the critic would probably reverse his view
                        of the case if he were forced to look at it with his feet over his head for
                        twelve hours and the weight of his body pulling at his ankles. </p>

                    <p> A orowded and enthusiastic andience last night listened to the production of
                        Giordano's opera Fedora at the Zizinia Theatre. The orchestra, presided over
                        by Signor Giovanni Zaocani, ably rendered the composer's work, bat the clou
                        of the performance were the singing and acting of Signora Gemma Ballincioni.
                        In such an operatio work as Fedora, written bo as| to make the culminating
                        music of every act fall within the role of the prima donna, sn00888 depends
                        upon that lady's weal talents and histrionio abilities, and Signora
                        Bellincioni displayed both to an eminent degree. The pertection of dramatio
                        art was exemplified by her through the whola opera, accompanied by an
                        achievement as vocalist which, in the recond act, obtained for ber, in anion
                        with other prominent members of the companyi' no less </p>
                    <p> than fontcalls before the curtain. Her continual, | but never exaggerated,
                        and always appropriate, changes of facial expression were an ideal
                        embodiment of dramatio art ; but the inental effort necessary for these was
                        not permitted to detract from the vocal expression. The climax of the score
                        in the first act, where Fedora sings at the death-bed, exhibited the
                        composer at his best, and the numeroas duets in the second act were finely
                        rendered ; Signor Palet singing with much verve and excellent
                        voice,sometimes perhaps with a little excessive gestare, the somewhat
                        prolonged sections allotted to him. In the third act Signora Bellincioni
                        attained a farther triumph in her rendering of the prayor -perbaps the most
                        melodions number of Giordano's work. The whole performance of the opera was
                        excellent, but if the interval between the acts could by a little energy be
                        shortened it would be an advantage. </p>

                        for antiquities in the neighbour. hood of Alexandria. The most successful

                        ; also several funeral stela whose design is copied from Attic grave
                        reliefs. More valuable than these are some painted stela, which are really
                        artistic and of merit. A series of urns and vages, decorated with colored
                        festoons of flowers and numerous terra-cotts statuettes, complete the
                        trouvaille. </p>

                        statue of Psammetious I has been unearthed, in an attitude of adoration,
                        also ten statues of royal guards of the Ptolemaic epocb and a splendid torso
                        of a prieit of Serapis. </p>
                    <p> At the Necropolis of Strabo a tomb has been found decorated, and a painted

                    <p> The account by M. Breccia is merely provi. sionary and will be followed by

                            down to its knees.- The lady oried out in evident alarm, but at the same
                            time showed the greatest coolness, and throwing back the weight of her
                            body, she speedily brought up the horso again, and rode on. The hyrse,

                        <p> 1. A few evenings ago the electric light suddenly went ont, leaving
                            houses and streets in darkness. It was abont the dinner hour and I
                            people had to dine by lamp and candle light,| a thing which most of them
                            had nearly forI gotten how to do. Some more or less amusing Tincidents
                            are reported as having popurred. In one of the hotele, the company had
                            nearly finished dessert when the light went out. Lamps were procured and
                            the conversation went on, one lady remarking to her hnaband that he
                            ooght not to have salated her in the darkness. The hasband said he had

                        <p> Considerable aneasiness was caused among certain people in Helouan on
                            Wednesday by the ramour of a obatemplated Massulman uprising against the
                            Christians. Some Rassian Jawa who had come to the town apon hearing the
                            romoor speedily left for Cairo, and it was reported that many others who
                            had arrived from Europe with the intention of coming to Helonan to spend
                            the winter, bad remained in Cairo. It was feared that, to some extant at
                            | least, the rumour would have affected the prospects of the season at
                            Helocan, but yesterday, a number of those persons who had remained in
                            Cairo found themselves sufficiently reassured to continue their joqraey.
                            There does not seem to be ground for the story that a lady staying at
                            Helogan has been molested by an Arab, but I understand that during a
                            discussion with regard to the alleged projected aprising, one Arab in
                            the service of a Baropean expressed his intention to kill his employer
                            first of all. Among Europeans generally, howover, there has been no
                            alarm whatever, and no importance at all is attached to the rumours of a
                            distarbance. </p>

                        <p> Many visitors to Helouan complain of the long time taken by some of the
                            trains in making the journey from Cairo. Whilst allow. ing that it may
                            not be possible for all trains to cover the distance in thirty-five
                            minutes, as is done by the best of the expresses, it is felt that it is
                            really too much to ba compelled to spend an hoor within a few minutes on
                            the way. There is also a movement on foot to request the railway
                            authorities to provide more accommodation for non-smokers. </p>
