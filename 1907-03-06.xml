                    <head>THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY</head>
                    <p>The General Assembly has not surprised us. The assurance that its proposals
                        were likely, nay, certain, to be moderate and reasonable, might impose upon
                        visiting M.P.'s, but our opinion of the mentality of that august body has
                        been in every way confirmed. We do not deny that many of its resolutions
                        were commendable -indeed some were excellent. We have not the slightest
                        objection to new rail. ways, canals, girls schools or colleges, on the
                        contrary. But we do object to the proposals for placing the financial and
                        general adminis. tration of the country under the control of a Parliament or
                        of a reorganised General Assembly if either of those bodies — still happily
                        in nubibus-contain the men of whose financial ideas we had more than a
                        glimpse on Sunday. We do not: wish to discuss the question of a Parliament
                        here. We merely wish to point out that the Assem. bly calls for a heavy
                        expenditure on oducation, railways, and school buildings ; it demands the
                        suppression of school fees, the incurring by thọ State of large expenses on
                        numerous beneficial objects, and in the same breath votes the suppression of
                        the date taxa and unanimously opposes a worthy member who suggests that
                        universal free education be introduced, its cost to be covered by a rate
                        levied on agricultural land. In short, the Government is to be asked to
                        spend more and take less than the little it now gets from the average
                        Egyptian tax-payer, unless, indeed, our sages of the Assembly have some
                        wonderful scheme for raising money up their sleeves. Very significant, too,
                        is the fact that those who demand education at all costs refuse to endure
                        the prospect of paying the rates ! What self-sacrifice, what devotion to
                        principle, and what a blow to those who believed that eading Egyptians would
                        submit to a small pecuniary inconvenience for the sake of the children of
                        their poorer neighbours !</p>
                    <p>We beg our contemporary, the “Egyptian standard,” recently launcued amidst
                        the plaudits of that particular section of the Nationalist party which
                        follows Mustapha Pasha Kamel, to devote a little attention to chis subject.
                        Mr. Charles Rudy and Mr. Moloney should have a little sarcasm to pare now
                        and then for Egyptians, or are they compelled by contract to criticise nono
                        but their countrymen and to generalise concerning ufficiale, soldiers,
                        tourists, and Britons in general on the strength of the impoliteness or
                        mmorality of a very limited number of indi</p>
                    <p>iduals, to the exclusion of all “subject races ?” We bave seen what is to be
                        thought of the inancial proposals of the men who dream of ruling Egypt. Here
                        is a contrast the work of the men who have ruled Egypt:</p>
                    <p>The abovauts for tbe year 1906 abna that the revenge amounted to £1.5,837
                        000, and the expenditare to £13.16 ,0 W, tbus leaving a surplus of £2,175,
                        100. Recent calonlations reveal the tsot that doring the last twenty years,
                        extra rdinary ex: penditure to the extent of £19,303,000 has been inoarred
                        for irrigation, railways and pablic buildings. There is now an apspent
                        balance of £8,702,000 in the Reserve Fand. Also, the Caisse de la Dette
                        holds £3,050,000 as reserve food and working balance. These figures make a
                        total of £31,055,000. Of this amount, only £3,610,000 has been borrowed. The
                        remainder, amounting to €13,455,000, has been provided out of surplas
                        revenue. As regards the continuation of romanera. tive publio works, even
                        when the amount now in the Reserve Fand is expendet, it is estimated that,
                        when the Domains Loan, which has now been reduced to about £1,900,000, is
                        paid off, the land remaining at the disposal of thy Governmont will be worth
                        at least from £ ,0 2,000</p>
                    <p>to £6,000,000. Need we say that as business men we prefer the performances of
                        a Cromer to the promises of our native confrères.</p>

                        <p>ST. PETERSBURG, March 6. The general attitude of Russia on the eve of the
                            opening of the Dama is possimistic. The only question discussed here is
                            how long it will be before another dissolation. The Tsar will not attend
                            at the opening. The Dowager Empress has started for England on a
                            prolonged visit to Queen Alexandra. </p>
                        <p>(Reuter) ST. PETERSBURG, March 5. The Dama was quietly opened by the
                            vicepresident of the Coonoil of the Empire. When the Ukage convening the
                            Assembly was read the members on the Right rose and cheered the Emperor,
                            the rest remained seated and silent. M. Golovin, Copatitational
                            Democrat, was elected president. He said that all parties were united in
                            the desire for the welfare of the nation. He hoped they would co-operate
                            with tho Monarch in carrying out the social legis. lation indicated by
                            the first Dama. (Reuter)</p>
                        <p>ST. PETERSBURG, March 6. The Dama has been opened. M. Golovine, candidate
                            of the Left, who was elected presidont by 331 votes against 91,
                            expressed the hope that the Dama, apited in spite of its divergences of
                            viowa, would succeed, in accord with the Tear, in deriving benefits from
                            social legislation, in conformity with the principles of the first Doma.
                            He added that thia institation, representing the nation, would dover

                            geographical point and of practically no account to Earopean politios,
                            Djiboati has, among its neighbours on ib9 Red Sea and African littorals,
                            been rapidly rising in the scale of importance, and information gathered
                            in Cairo regarding the aims of M. Klobukowski's embassy proves that

                            Mr. Tattersal states that yarns made from Egyptian cotton in the Bolton

                            The figer numbers in weft are decidedly strong, and extreme rates have
                            been paid for quiok delivery. Combed desoriptions are practioally sold

                            anecdote on the satject which deserves reproduction :</p>
                        <p>I can recall an iooident narrated to mo at one of the earliest meetings
                            of the Commission of Enquiry. At this meeting, Nabar deliver d &amp;
                            very eloquent and detailed account of the reasons which had induced bim
                            to establish the so-called International Tribunals, to the effect that
                            these Courts were absolately inde. pendent of the Goveroment and
                            therefore could be relied upon to administer justice. He added that
                            justice was the basis of all genolie reform and of all true
                            civilisation. When Nabar had fiojsbed bis speech, M. de Bli. gnières,
                            then Minister of Pablic Works, rose and said he could not allow this
                            speech to pars in silence without shaking the band of its anthor and
                            thanking him for the services be had rendered not only to Egypt bat to
                            humanity by the poble sentiments he had expounded 80 ably. Upon M. do
                            Blignières sitting dowo, Major Baring, as he was thod, remarked "if
                            talking was over they had better begin busi1988." This aneodote, wherber
                            true or false, illastrates c'early the lack of mataal sympathy which,
                            subsequent to oor military occupation, characterised the relations

                        <p>Sir Benjamin Stone whose camera finds such constant employment during the
                            Session on the Terrace of the House of Commons, bas (the "Times"
                            romarks) jast resumed bis Parlia. mentary daties after a somowhat
                            protracted visit to Egypt. Thanks to the valuable assist. ance of the
                            British autboritieq, Sir Benjamin was able, in the course of his
                            travels, to secure a opique collection of photographic records depicting
                            the present aspeot of the great mona. ments and objeots of interest in
                            the Nile basin, and reprodaoing scenes, insoriptions, and museum relios
                            of the past, as well as pictures showing the present condition and the
                            appostance of the native population, their village castoms, and modern
                            improvements in their habits of life. Not the least interesting of the
                            negatives taken are those of the besati-! fal raios of Kom Omba ; also
                            those of the recently-excavated tombs of the Q 10008 near the plains of
                            Thebes, which were explored two or three years ago by Icalian workers,
                            and in which the coloured decorations are an fresh and brilliant as when
                            first executed. The member for Enst Birmingham bas also taken some
                            excellent photographs of the excavations and workings at Deir-elBabari,
                            where M. Naville found the image of the sacred cow (now in the museum at
                            Cairo), and where he has since opened a Royal tomb of great historio
                            interest. Most noteworthy of all, however, are the views which Sir
                            Benjamin bas taken in the Valley of the Tombs of the Kings, where Mr.
                            Theodore Davies and Mr, Cirelly have just opened the remarkable tomb of
                            Q 1000 Teie, this partionlar "and” happen. ing at the moment of Sir Be
                            jumin's visit. The collection likewise includes faithful. pictares of
                            the inscriptions at the Temple of Abydos, the wall sculptures of Karnak,
                            Dendera, and the Rxmeseqm, the recently.opened tombs at Alex sndria, and
                            the rock tombs above 48800an. </p>

                        <head>TO OUR VISITORS</head>
                        <p>The Egyptian Gazette has much pleasure in presenting to its subscribers
                            the accompanying description of some of the many interesting routes by
                            which they may travel homewards. Great care has been taken to arrange
                            them as accurately and concisely as possible, and it will be found that
                            none of them are fraught with difficulty. In choosing the route home
                            there are several things to be considered. To begin with there is the
                            difference in climate between Egypt and the various points at which you
                            may arrive in Europe.</p>
                        <cb n="2"/>
                        <p>This depends partly upon the month in which you leave Egypt, for Cairo in
                            January may be a little warmer than the Riviera and possibly not so warm
                            as Sicily, but in March it will be warmer than Rome, and more uniformly
                            warm than many other places in Europe. Many people leave Egypt far too
                            early in the year, for as a rule the weather in April and May is
                            perfect. The warmest place to go to on leaving Egypt is Sicily.</p>
                        <p>Some will want to take into consideration the number of days to be spent
                            at sea, and we therefore subjoin a list shewing the time occupied on
                            each of the various routes between Egypt and the Continent of
                            Europe.</p>
                        <p><cb n="3"/></p>
                        <p>They are as follows:—</p>
                        <p>The long sea routes—from Port Said or Alexandria to Plymouth,
                            Southhampton, London or Liverpool—occupy about 14 days. The short ones
                            are as follows:—</p>

                        <p>The steamers of the P.&amp; O., the Egyptian Mail S.S,. Co., North German
                            Lloyd, Orient, and Messageries Maritimes are the largest. The Anchor,
                            British India, Bibby and Henderson Lines are also excellent, and their
                            steamers are largely patronised by travellers to Egypt.</p>
                        <p>As regards the train journeys from Cairo, the shortest is that to
                            Alexandria, without change (3 hours). That to Port Said can now be made
                            without change in 4 ½ hours.</p>
                        <p>The least expensive way to England is by the Moss, Papayanni, Prince, and
                            Westcott lines of steamers from Alexandria to Liverpool. The German
                            Levant line has also good steamers from Alexandria to Hamburg.</p>
                        <cb n="5"/>
                        <p>The quickest through Continental routes are by P.&amp; O. Brindisi
                            express from Port Said, by the Egyptian Mail S.S. Co., from Alexandria
                            to Marseilles and the Austrian Lloyd Trieste Vienna express from
                            Alexandria.</p>
                        <p>As regards heavy luggage, it must be borne in mind that very little
                            luggage is allowed free on the railways of Europe, but there are several
                            good and responsible forwarding agents in Egypt who undertake at a fixed
                            charge to deliver packages to any address in Europe. The Egyptian Mail
                            S.S. Co., have also made arrangements whereby luggage can be collected
                            and sent to any address.</p>
                        <p>The quickest manner of getting to Europe from Port Said is undoubtedly by
                            the fast Mail Steamers “Osiris" and “Isis” to Brindisi. One of these
                            leaves Port Said every week, as soon as possible after receiving the
                            Indian <cb n="6"/>mails from the great liner arrived from Bombay.</p>
                        <p>These small but comfortable ships have enormously powerful engines, and
                            attain a very high rate of speed. They are called the "Ferry Boats"
                            having been specially built to carry the British mail from Port Said to
                            Brindisi. If you are going straight through to England you will find the
                            train waiting at Brindisi which will take you to Calais without
                            changing. It has complete arrangements for sleeping and eating on board,
                            and you should arrive in London on the fifth day from leaving Port
                            Said.</p>

                        <p>The direct route to Sicily is by the Florio-Rubattino Co.’s steamers
                            which leave Alexandria weekly for MESSINA, where one takes train to
                            TAORMENA, one of the most charming and popular places on the island. <hi
                                rend="italic">Giardini</hi> is the station at which to alight, and
                            the drive up to Taormina is most delightful, occupying about one hour.
                            In and around the town is much to interest the visitor. The theatre is
                            of Greek origin, but restored under the Romans. CATANIA is the starting
                            place for the ascent of Etna, and here also is a fine Cathedral. The
                            Greek, Roman, and Saracenic remains that are found all over the island,
                            are an endless sources of pleasure. SYRACUSE has an interesting history,
                            having been a Greek city, which was designed by Demosthenes in B.C. 413,
                            and taken by the Romans in B.C. 212, when Archimedes was slain—his tomb
                            is to be seen. The cathedral was once an ancient pagan temple. PALERMO,
                            with about 300,000 inhabitants, is the capital of the Island, and enjoys
                            a delightful climate. Much of interest is to be found in this fine city.
                                <hi rend="italic">The Palazzo Reale</hi> is of Saracenic origin and
                            close to it the church of <hi rend="italic">S. Giovannia degli
                                Eremiti</hi> with its picturesque cloisters. The Cathedral, Museum,
                            Botanic Gardens, Villa Giulia and Royal Park are also worth a visit.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div type="item">
                        <head>CENTRAL ITALY.</head>
                        <p>The fine steamers of the North German Lloyd leave Alexandria every
                            Wednesday during the season for Naples, the voyage being only 3
                            days.</p>
                        <p>NAPLES is also reached in 10 hours from Palermo by the Florio-Rubattino
                            Co.’s steamers, which leave daily. One cannot approach Naples or leave
                            it without wishing to explore some of its islands, besides the lovely
                            places on its bay—<hi rend="italic">Castellamare</hi> and <hi
                                rend="italic">Sorrento</hi>. The small steamer that takes you to
                            Sorrento [you can drive too] will take you on to Capri.</p>
                        <p>From Naples to ROME is a train journey of but five hours. All who can
                            will devote at least one week to visiting the many historical and
                            interesting portions of the Eternal City, whose charms and beauties are
                            too well-known to need comment here.</p>
                        <p>Leaving the Eternal City with much regret, a railway journey of five
                            hours brings you to FLORENCE, where another week can well be spent
                            admiring the <hi rend="italic">City of Flowers</hi> and its surrounding
                            country. In Florence itself the churches and galleries are of absorbing
                            interest, whilst the local promenades and excursions should not be
                            omitted. <hi rend="italic">The Cascine</hi> is the most attractive and
                            fashionable promenade in Florence, whilst the <hi rend="italic">Viale
                                dei Colli</hi>, one of the finest walks in Europe, opened 35 years
                            ago, goes winding up through the hills a distance of four miles. The
                            most delightful excursion outside Florence is that to <hi rend="italic"
                                >Vallombrosa</hi>, with its <hi rend="italic">Monastery</hi> 3,300
                            feet above the sea level. This is made first by ordinary train from
                            Florence to <hi rend="italic">St. Ellero</hi>, thence by cog-wheel
                            railway to <hi rend="italic">Saltino</hi>. The ascent through groves of
                            oaks takes an hour, and most striking panoramas are unfolded to
                            view.</p>
                        <p>PISA is easily reached from Florence in about 2 hours ; here there is a
                            fine Cathedral and the Leaning Tower. A stay of at least one night
                            should if possible be made in order to enjoy the view from the Campanile
                            at sunset.</p>
                        <p>VIAREGGIO. One of the most delightful places on the Italian Riviera near
                            Pisa and on the main line from Rome to Genoa. It is a very convenient
                            half-way house between Egypt and England, and where living is reasonable
                            and the air and surroundings exceptionally good.</p>

                        <p>GENOA (La Superba).—The most picturesque and interesting city in Italy,
                            with the record of having one of the lowest death averages of European
                            cities and a phenomenally equable temperature—warm in winter and
                            deliciously cool breezes from the surrounding mountains and the
                            Mediterranean in summer.</p>
                        <p>The patriarchal home of Italy’s most ancient nobility, whose palaces,
                            gardens, and famous collections of statuary, frescoes, and paintings,
                            are a constant delight to thousands of travellers who annually sojourn
                            in Genoa. Then there are the superbly decorated medieval churches
                            containing exquisite marble columns and historical paintings, and the
                            incomparable Campo Santo filled with its wonderful tombs.</p>
                        <p>From Genoa to Milan is a matter of only three hours by rail.</p>
                        <p>MILAN is a good centre for Northern Italy before making the tour of the
                            Lakes. The Cathedral is the principal attraction, with its beautiful
                            windows illustrating the History of the Bible. The public gardens and
                            the monumental cemetery are also worth a visit.</p>
                        <p>Between Bologna and Milan and only an hour and a half from Milan is
                            SALSOMAGGIORE, a renowned health resort on account of its thermal
                            springs, change trains at <hi rend="italic">Borgo San Domino</hi> and in
                            half-an-hour you are at Salsomaggiore.</p>

                        <p>VENICE is a 5 hours journey by rail from Milan, and one of the most
                            delightful places imaginable to pass a quiet stay. The total absence of
                            vehicular traffic strikes one as very strange; no horse, cart, carriage
                            or bicycle is to be seen, and yet there is the sound of life at every
                            turn. The approach to Venice from the Adriatic is unlike that of any
                            other sea port. The town seems to be gradually, like Aphrodite, born of
                            the sea. No hills behind, no stretches of rock, but first the tops of
                            Campaniles appear above the horizon, then slowly the whole glittering
                            town rises like a fairy mirage out of the calm lagoon.</p>
                        <p>Going northwards from <hi rend="italic">Milan</hi> you make the tour of
                            the beautiful Italian lakes.</p>
                        <p>COMO, the birthplace of the younger Pliny, is reached in
                            one-and-a-quarter hours by train by way of Monza.</p>
                        <p>Boats leave Como frequently for the other towns on the lake, which is
                            very beautiful, and the scenery on either side going up the lake is most
                            enchanting. CERNOBBIO is a charming spot; then come <hi rend="italic"
                                >Tremezzo</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Cadenabbia</hi>, and <hi

                            from <hi rend="italic">Menaggio</hi> to <hi rend="italic">Porlezza</hi>
                            on Lake Lugano in three-quarters of an hour, then steamer to Lugano in

                            and is an excellent winter resort. The church Madonna del Sasso,
                            situated above the town, is worth a visit, as it contains interesting
                            paintings, “Entombment," by Ciseri, and ‘Tho Flight into Egypt,” by
                            Bramantion.</p>

                        celui-ci n'opère bien que lorsqu'il est pris avec de bons aliments et des
                        boissons fortifiantes, telles que vin, café, thé. Chacun choisit, pour se

                        occupations. La fatigue de la purgation étant annulée par l'effet de la
                        bonne alimentation, on se décide aisément à recommencer autant de fois que
                        cela est nécessaire.</p>
