                        <p>SALES OF SUDAN LANDS.</p>
                        <p>Though a certain amount of annoyance may be caused by the recent decree
                            of the Sudan Government forbidding sales of land by natives without the
                            consent of the pro- vincial governors, we are convinced that the measure
                            is, in the main, both wise and just. The Egyptian and British
                            Governments have not occupied the Sudan solely with a view to their own
                            profit, nor do they intend to permit strangers to buy up valuable lands
                            for a song and oust native proprietors from their holdings by taking
                            advantage of their embarrassments We are prepared to hear severe
                            criticisms passed by interested in- dividuals on the action of the Sudan
                            author ities. They will be accused of restricting trade, restraining
                            free commercial intercourse, inter- fering with free contracts, and so
                            forth ad nauseam, but their detractors will find it hard to explain why
                            a Government, which exists ostensibly for the benefit of the Sudanese,
                            should not interfere in contracts in which one of the parties is as a
                            rule an astute and esurient foreigner, the other dusky gentleman without
                            sufficient foresight to look beyond the day after to-morrow, and without
                            the knowledge that might otherwise enable him to obtain a fair price for
                            his hands. In our opinion tie Sudan Government has only done its duty in
                            checking or regulating sales which might have unpleasant results in the
                            future. The Sudanese who parts with his lands for a trifle to-day, and
                            is content with the trifle, will be the first to complain when he
                            realises to-morrow that be has made a bad bargain, and being of a
                            hot-tempered and somewhat fanatical nature, may attempt to settle
                            accounts vi et arms. That a number of European landlords, com- pelled by
                            the climate to be absentees for half the year, should become owners of
                            the greater part of the tillable areas of the Sudan, is not the
                            intention of the Government, whose in- terests will not be served by
                            agrarian quarrels between natives and Europeans or by the speculative
                            purchase of lands by individuals who cannot develop them. We have no
                            doubt that certain large areas which require irriga- tion or reclamation
                            on a scale that is far beyond the means of the small proprietor will
                            fall into European hands, and see no reason why they should not. There
                            are likely to be several Kom Ombos in Senaar and the Ghazireh Province,
                            concessions that can only be deve- loped by the expenditure of large
                            sums that are likely enough to run into six or even seven figures, but
                            we do not imagine that the Sudan Government intends to allow every petty
                            trader who has entered the country to offer derisory sums to natives for
                            lands that he hopes to sell at fifteen or twenty times their cost price.
                            The days are past when Govern- mets permitted the hardy pioneer to
                            acquire gold miner or fat acres of arable land with the expenditure of a
                            few hawks bells and beads, with a little rum and calico thrown in. </p>

                            on the 1st of November. The sitting will be private, but the president

                        <p>Big Fire at Assiout. — Our Assiout Correspondent writes:—On Sunday night
                            a big fire broke out in the house of Khashaba Bey, one of the wealthiest
                            men in Assiout. The outbreak was due to the fact that a small boy, six
                            years old, had set fire to a curtain and left it burning as if nothing
                            had happened. Nobody noticed anything until the whole house was ablaze.
                            The Inspector of the Interior happened to be at Assiout and worked hard
                            in trying to subdue the flames, together with the wekil of the moudirieh
                            and the hukumdar; but the conflagration continued for about fourteen
                            hours. They, however, succeeded in confining it to the house where it
                            broke out. The damage is estimated at £16,000.</p>
                        <p>Where to go in the Summer Evenings.— We need not remind our readers that
                            one of the greatest sights of Egypt is that of the Pyramids, especially
                            by moonlight. A great want has been filled by the establishment of a bar
                            and restaurant there,and visitors all testify to the excellent
                            arrangements that have been made for catering to their wants at this
                            rather out-of-the-way spot. The “Pyramids Bar and Restaurant,” situated
                            opposite Mena House Hotel and at the foot of the Pyramids, is a place
                            where one can obtain everything one requires to satisfy the “inner man”
                            at very reasonable rates. A sure guarantee that all the mineral waters,
                            wines, spirits, beers, etc., retailed at this bar and restaurant are of
                            the best quality, is the fact that they are supplied by Mr. N. Spathis,
                            the well-known merchant and mineral water manufacturer. [Advt.]</p>
                        <p>The Gardner-Brown Troupe. —The Gard- ner-Brown variety company is at
                            present per- forming nightly at the Alcazar Music-hall in Cairo, where
                            it has met with such success that Mr. Gardner-Brown has decided that his
                            company shall remain in Cairo until the middle of September, when they
                            will continue on their way to India. The Sisters Romaine, of whom Cairo
                            music-hall goers retain pleasant recollec- tions from their performances
                            here last year, form the chief attraction of the troupe. These two young
                            comediennes sing duets of lighter vein with great “verve” and also dance
                            grace- fully, and the audience is always reluctant to let them leave the
                            stage. Mr. Leo Montague is an excellent comedian, sings well, dances
                            well, and does not indulge in vulgarity which is so much in evidence on
                            the music-hall stage. Mr. Geo. Montague is most amusing and clever in
                            his ventriloquial efforts and is always greet- -ed with much applause.
                            Mr. Gardner-Brown himself provides an excellent Bioscope “show,” and
                            Mrs. Gardner-Brown sings a number of well-known songs, which are
                            illustrated by lantern-slides, in a very pleasing manner. It is
                            necessary to point Out to the management of this music-hall that a very
                            great improvement in the playing of the band is to be desired. Not
                            content with playing out of tune to such a degree as to jar upon the
                            nerves of every mu- sical and unmusical person in the hall, the members
                            of this band,consisting of more than a dozen, absolutely disregard each
                            other’s efforts and so fail entirely in combination. In addi- tion to
                            these two unpardonable sins, of neither of which any band, pretentious
                            of a Knowledge of music should be guilty, they greatly depre- ciate the
                            efforts of the artistes by playing so loudly that one has to strain
                            one’s ears in order to hear the sounds proceeding from the stage. It
                            would be well for the band-conductor to bear in mind that the audience
                            is desirous of hear- ing the performers and can have but little interest
                            in a band of such poor quality.</p>

                        <p>JUDGMENT AGAIN UPHELD.</p>
                        <p>The Court of Cassation, consisting of Ahmed Bey Afifi, president, Yehia
                            Bey Ibrahim, Youssef Bey Chawky, Ahmed Bey Chawky, 1 Ahmed Bey Helmi,
                            and Mr. Halton, sat yesterday morning to hear the appeal lodged by
                            Hassan Bey Wassif, Moudir of Ghirgeh, against the sentence passed by the
                            Criminal Court of Appeal on June 29, by which Hassan Bey Wassif, the
                            Cadi, and the clerk of Badawi Bey Rifaa were condemned to two years’
                            imprisonment and the two witnesses to the alleged forgery were each
                            sentenced to six months’ imprisonment.</p>
                        <p>The office of counsel for the prosecution was filled by Ali Bey Abou El
                            Fatouh, while the defendants were represented in Court by their
                            advocates, among them Omar Bey Loutfi, Skander Bey Ammoun, and other
                            well-known members of the Cairo Bar.</p>
                        <p>After the Court had refused the coun- sel for the prosecution’s demand to
                            produce a letter of Hassan Bey Wassif in Court, the case for the
                            prosecution was heard. At 10.30 a.m. the Court retired for a quarter of
                            an hour, and on the resumption of the sitting Omar Bey Loufti pleaded
                            the cause of the ex-moudir. The principal heads of his defence
                            were:-</p>
                        <p>(1.) The copies of conclusions of counsel for complainant and the
                            voluminous written pleadings of the Parquet had not been served on
                            counsel for the defendant till one day previous to the hearing, and the
                            Court had refused to allow an adjournment to enable the defence to
                            prepare a reply.</p>
                        <p> (2.) The Court had not given counsel for the defence sufficient time to
                            finish his pleading before it rose.</p>
                        <p>(3.) After the judgment of the Assiout Court Badawi Bey Rifaa had
                            admitted before wit- nesses that he had signed the power of attorney
                            with full knowledge of the facts and had denied the fact, by alleging
                            that he had been imposed upon, at the instigation of a relative in whose
                            house he had been staying.</p>
                        <p>(4.) After judgment of First Instance had been delivered the Parquet
                            filed in the dossier of the case a letter calculated to influence the
                            judges in their opinion of one of the items of evidence for the
                            prosecution, and that this letter was filed without giving notice
                            thereof, to the defendants or their counsel.</p>
                        <p>After hearing Omar Bey Loufti’s defence and that of counsel for the
                            remainder of the accused, the Court retired to consider its verdict and
                            1.35 p.m. returned and gave its decision rejecting the appeal.</p>

                        <p> A RIDICULOUS STORY.</p>
                        <p>A very extraordinary version of the Hamade incident has found its way
                            into certain French and German contemporaries, who state that Sheikh
                            Hamade was arrested under the belief that he bore a proclamation from
                            the late Grand Mufti of Egypt announcing that the Turks were no longer
                            worthy to hold the Caliphate and, so to speak, excommunicating the
                            Sultan. We need not say that there is not a word of truth in this
                            ridiculous story, which has probably been sent on its travels by an
                            opponent of the late Sheikh Mohamed Abdou, whose whole life makes his
                            participation in an Arab conspiracy abso- lutely unthinkable.</p>

                        <p>Dr. Meshaka of Cairo writes:- Allow me to bring to your notice the
                            following. I had occa- sion to have under my care a few cases apparently
                            similar to the suspicious choleraic cases reported in Luxor a few weeks
                            ago. They resemble cholera in having a severe onset, severe colic, and
                            the other usual symptoms, with great dejection; but here the similarity
                            ends. In about three or four hours or more the symptoms abate and the
                            case takes a favora- ble turn, while on the following day the patient
                            very possibly goes to work, only a little depressed and weak. The
                            lighter cases are much more numerous, and need no special reference,
                            except that most take the same Course as the first. In all the worst
                            cases, and in most of the light ones, I have found that eating prawns
                            lies at the root of the evil. Vendors care little whether their prawns
                            are fresh and good, or old and putrid, as long as they sell; and since
                            nobody else cares either, the poor folk are allowed to be poisoned.</p>

                            by Europeans and natives. The arrangements made by the police outside

                        <p>Dear Sir,—In regard to Ramleh bathing I confess to having read the
                            complaint of “Mer- maid” with astonishment. She must be a prude. What
                            can be more picturesque than the brown colour of the bodies of bathing
                            natives? It is a fine sight to see them swim- ming, and I am always glad
                            to see that they like their seabaths. They never molest bathing and
                            swimming Europeans, and after all it is their own country and their own
                            coast. I think "Mermaid” is quite mistaken in her views.— Yours very
                            truly,</p>
                        <p>A Reader.</p>

                        <p>OPENING OF RAILWAY.</p>
                        <p>(From our Correspondent).</p>
                        <p> Nicosia, July 27.</p>
                        <p> The temperature during the last week has been somewhat higher in the
                            plains, ranging up to 102° and 103° Fahrenheit in the shade. </p>
                        <p>The formal opening of the Cyprus Govern- ment Railway will not take place
                            until some time in the autumn, when the Government returns to Nicosia.
                            The line will, however, be open to traffic from the 1st proximo between
                            Nicosia and Famagusta. Steady pro- gress is being made with the
                            construction of the line between Nicosia and Morphou, a distance of some
                            24 miles. It is greatly to be hoped that money will be forthcoming to
                            make it possible to extend that portion of the line as far as
                            Karavostassi, a distance of 12 miles beyond Morphou. Karavostassi is a
                            small natural harbour in the south bend of Morphou Bey, and a
                            considerable quantities of goods are regularly shipped from there to
                            Alexandria and other places. It is the nearest and most convenient
                            shipping place for the whole of that locality, embracing Morphou, Lefka,
                            and the lovely Marathassa Valley. Karavostassi receives for shipment
                            every year several million oranges and lemons from Lefka, and large
                            consignments of fruit and vegetables from the other two places.</p>
                        <p>WELCOME INNOVATIONS.</p>
                        <p>There is some talk of the establishment of a creamery and ice-making
                            factory near Nicosia. It is a much needed want. It is almost im-
                            possible to obtain good fresh butter—certainly not through the
                            summer—and cream and cheese made by modern methods, and with improved
                            appliances, are also difficult to get. I have alluded before now to the
                            lack of ice and refrigerating facilities, and if Nicosia wishes to be
                            regarded as at all up-to-date she ought certainly to make a move in the
                            direction here indicated .</p>

                        <p>Your recent article on “Cyprus as a place of arms” has been read here
                            with much inte- rest, and residents in Cyprus not unnatu- rally hope
                            that the political changes now taking place may have the effect of
                            drawing attention to the various advantages of the Island and help
                            towards developing her un- doubted possibilities.</p>
                        <p>NEW WEEKLY PAPER.</p>
                        <p>A new weekly paper has lately been started, called the “Semaia tis
                            Kyprou,” the proprietor of which is, I understand, Mr. Th. Theodo- tou.
                            The editorship, it is stated, will be undertaken by Mr. Catalanos, late
                            editor of the “Evagoras,” which was recently suppres- sed by the
                            Government.</p>
                        <p>NEW HOTEL AT PLATRES.</p>
                        <p>A new hotel has lately been opened at Platres, the charming little
                            village, situated at the southern slope of Mt. Troodos. The manager and
                            proprietor is Mr. Theodotou of Limassol. This village is becoming very
                            popular in the summer among the higher classes of Limassol, and quite a
                            number of pretty villas have been built there during the last two or
                            three years.</p>

                        <p>HONOR FOR LOCAL SHOTS.</p>
                        <p>We note with satisfaction that at the great annual rifle meeting of the
                            National Rifle Association just concluded at Bisley, two of our local
                            shots, Messrs. Craig and Schilizzi, representing the Cairo B.R. Club and
                            the Alexandria B.R. Club respectively, had the honor of being presented
                            to King Edward on the occasion of his Majesty's visit to present the
                            prizes.</p>
                        <p>The shooting this year at the Bisley meeting, which annually attracts
                            from almost all parts of the world, has been of a remarkably high order,
                            and speaks volumes for the infan- try weapon of the British service,
                            which has again proved itself to be equally as good, if not slightly
                            superior to any other military rifle in existence.</p>
                        <p>We congratulate Mr. Craig, whose name appears in at least six of the
                            prize lists, on his success; and we would express the hope that our
                            local rifle clubs may be more numerously represented in the future at
                            that great rendez- vous of riflemen.</p>

                        <p>BY AN EMPLOYER OF LABOUR.</p>
                        <p>It is a hopeful sign that a spirit of in- trospection is just now abroad
                            among us. We are hearing a good deal, amongst other things, about the
                            "degeneration of the national cha- racter,” and undoubtedly it is a
                            subject de- serving of most earnest self-examination. It is my purpose
                            to allude here to one unmistak- able feature of this degeneracy, which I
                            have some opportunity of observing closely, and which no one can deny is
                            acting as a potent drag upon the moral and material well being of the
                            masses of our people, both young and old.</p>
                        <p>Engrafted upon an alarming amount of poverty and want, so largely
                            deducible from an obsolete fiscal policy, a spirit of reckless
                            thriftlessness is apparent, which shows itself in no more pronounced
                            form than in the reckless gambling which seems to be the end- all and
                            be-all of the bulk of our poorer classes at the present time. In fact,
                            the extent to which gambling on horse-racing has infected the national
                            life of the masses will hardly be credited by those whose tastes or
                            general condemnation of this particular vics has removed them from any
                            intimacy with its statistics.</p>
                        <p>It is not among those who can better afford this species of excitement
                            that the greatest harm is being worked, but among those poverty-stricken
                            thousands whose daily bread depends upon the sweat of their brows, and
                            who barely exist in a state of perennial want, in our great centres of
                            population. Is it pos- sible to imagine any more miserable spectacle
                            than that of wretched men, who cannot afford to keep their unhappy
                            families from semi- starvation, but who nevertheless, by hook or by
                            crook, scrape enough together to back a horse with the tempter at the
                            street-corner, in the demoralising hope, which no failure will cause
                            them to abandon, that some day luck will come their way? It is a hope
                            which tends to depress all genuine effort in the workless loafer and in
                            the small wage-earner alike.</p>
                        <p>Go any day into such a place as one of our great meat markets. There, if
                            you know what to look for, you will find the gutter bookie in shoals,
                            and doing his business under the very noses of the police. The
                            regrettable thing is that so few, comparatively, are ever interfered
                            with, and, in consequence, some very unfor- tunate inferences are drawn.
                            But until penal- ties are very largely increased the evil will
                            continue.</p>
                        <p>Worst of all, however, is the fact that the rising generation are quite
                            as much, if not even more deeply, vitiated than their fathers by the
                            fever of chance. There are bookmakers who devote themselves nowadays to
                            betting with boys. They will take coppers, even down to single pennies,
                            and so vast are the numbers of their young clients that they find it
                            pays them excellently. To indemnify themselves for their offer of
                            facilities in such small sums, they compel these boy gamblers to bet on
                            the composite system, that is to say, they cannot win by backing a
                            single horse in coppers, but must spot a placed horse in three races. It
                            is, of course, a much harder task, and winners are correspondingly
                            reduced in numbers, but the bait held out is a bigger prize for the
                            successful backer.</p>
                        <p>These copper bookies swarm all round the warehouses and big printers’
                            estalblishment, in the neighbourhood of which every day purblind
                            youngsters may be seen running up to them with their slips of paper and
                            a few coppers. These boys are of all ages, from twelve upwards, earning
                            from 5s. to 10s. a week. Numbers of them live in the East End, and tramp
                            every day about three miles to their work in the City, and back again.
                            Many of them have to pay over their earnings to their parents, with the
                            exception of a shilling or eighteen-pence a week, and deliberately walk
                            backwards and forwards between work and home so that they may thus save
                            a few pence to back a horse with their bookie. And for the same purpose
                            I have known them frequently to go without food in the middle of the
                            day.</p>
                        <p>The consequence of all this in that they become careless and inattentive
                            at work, until retribution overtakes them,and they lose their
                            employment. Many employers, recognising the demoralising influence of
                            some of thee halfpenny papers, with their racing tips and betting
                            prices, have prohibited their introduction into their premises. But the
                            boys somehow or other contrive to smuggle them in, and while they spend
                            all their morning thinking- in place of attention to work—of what they
                            shall back at lunch-time, during the afternoon their minds are employed
                            in wondering whether their hor- ses will win, for the wily bookie of the
                            gutter does not allow his copper clients to back their fancies both
                            ways. At last, of course, as these wretched boys get thoroughly
                            hypnotised, they not infrequently end in robbing their employ- ers or
                            parents, and are tempted to adopt any means to supply themselves with
                            money. But there is another means to hand by which this downward descent
                            is facilitated.</p>
                        <p>Just as there is the gutter bookmaker, so there is his complement, the
                            gutter usurer. This latter individual will lend any sum, down to
                            sixpence, which he deems within the paying capacity of his clients, with
                            whose circums- tances he is invariably well acquainted.</p>
                        <p> There is a man, whom I have frequently watched, in a certain London
                            district, who is doing an immense business as a moneylender of small
                            sums. His usual loans are sixpence or </p>
                        <cb n="2"/>
                        <p>a shilling. On the former he charges an interest of a halfpenny, on the
                            latter a penny. It is generally towards the end of the week that his
                            clients come to him, and his loans must always be paid on the following
                            payday at the week’s end. He therefore makes an exceptionally quick
                            turnover.</p>
                        <p>He has got about 6,000 to 7,000 names on his books, of which number the
                            greater part are pretty regular customers requiring his accommodation
                            each week, and thus, at the rate of 1s. 8d. in tee pound, he has become
                            a wealthy man. His haunts are the doorways of certain public-houses, and
                            the neighbourhood of warehouses and works at times when his knowledge of
                            his customers’ hours of egress and probable necessities tells him that
                            busi- ness is to be done. In order to get through the press of work that
                            besets him, he is now always accompanied by an assistant, and when much
                            racing is toward he is exceptionally busy.</p>
                        <p>It is a queer business, and a feature of the strange invisible life of
                            our masses. If of less harmful character than that of the bookie; it
                            undoubtedly fosters and is fostered by the same demoralisation upon
                            which the latter battens. To the usurer resorts the boy who has wasted
                            his little all in vain attempts upon the gutter bookmaker, but who
                            cannot rest without the wherewithal to continue in the same course.
                            Probably Sixpence is too much for him to borrow, so he combines with two
                            equally broken companions, on the scale of twopence apiece.</p>
                        <p>The only security the usurer requires is the borrower’s place of business
                            ; his home is nothing. If he fails to pay up, the usurer pays a visit to
                            the borrower’s foreman, who is, not improbably, also a client of the
                            former, and the wretched debtor, youth or man, also finds himself in the
                            streets and out of work. Facilis descensus, for even the gutter has its
                            grades of solvency.</p>
                        <p>As may be imagined, the power which such a man gradually absorbs in a
                            district is as wonderful as his gains, and his influence upon the social
                            life of his sphere of action often manifests itself in many singular
                            forms. Not the least curious is the use to which he is sometimes put by
                            the unhappy women whose partners in life he assists to his fellow-
                            knight of the gutter. Finding themselves often left without the bare
                            necessities of existence for themselves and their children, they visit
                            the usurer and procure small sums, which are debited to their husbands,
                            and thus, in- directly, they succeed in obtaining from their gambling
                            helpmates something to rub along with which they would otherwise be left
                            without.</p>
                        <p>In this respect the gutter usurer may seem to be something of a
                            benefactor, but he is undoubtedly the means also of increasing the
                            misery and acerbity of these wretched homes, where the husband's
                            liability is too often avenged by blows and foul abuse.</p>
                        <p>Thus the eternal misery of our humblest masses is piled up year by year,
                            under its high priests, the gutter bookie and usurer. The ill-gotten
                            money which is occasionally won from the former rarely finds its way to
                            any other bourne than the pot-house bar. The winner for a brief period
                            becomes a gutter hero among his mates, and ruffles it as a ’ente fellow.
                            jTo win, if possible, Beems more demoralising than to lose; for the
                            working-man, who thus suddenly comes into a bit, receives along with it
                            no notion of thrift. As I have too often had occasion to observe, he at
                            once loses his head. He in- continently goes off work and loafs about
                            from pothouse to pothonse until his gains are spent. Then, having
                            sacrificed his regular wages, he once more turns up to work, and if, as
                            is possibly the case, he finds himself cast out, he joins the great army
                            of the un- employed, and sinks one stage lower in the social scale.</p>
                        <p>Such are certain of the influences which are working for the
                            disintegration of the lower social levels of our national life, and it
                            is very certain that if they cannot be shocked we must resign ourselves
                            to an inevi- table, if gradual, process of national deca- dence.</p>

                        <p>British Chamber of Commerce.- We would draw the attention of
                            manufacturers and mer- chants to the work of the British Chamber of
                            Commerce of Egypt, which was formed in 1896 with the sole onject of
                            assisting British trade in this country. The services of the Chamber are
                            always at the disposal of any member desiring information on trade
                            matters generally, including the question of appointing suitable agents.
                            AS no fee is charged for such advice, it is obviously in the interests
                            of all British traders here to become members, especially when it is
                            remembered that the annual sub- scription is merely the nominal one of 1
                            pound. The latter payment also includes a copy of the monthly journal
                            issued by the Chamber. Home enquirers can obtain further particulars
                            from our London office, 36, New Broad-street, which acts as agents to
                            the Chamber. </p>

                        <p>“Times.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. Balfour’s statement of the decision of the Government not to regard
                            the vote of last Thursday as a proper ground for dissolution or
                            resignation took the form of a reasoned exa- mination of precedents and
                            of constitutional doctrine. He observed that there seems to be in many
                            quarters an idea that when a Govern- ment suffers a defeat of any kind
                            its only constitutional course is to resign. That idea has, no doubt,
                            been sedulously propagated by the Opposition, yet it is scarcely
                            conceivable that it can be seriously entertained by any one possessing
                            the smallest knowledge of the past. Mr. Balfour showed that few, if any,
                            Govern- ments in this country that had existed for four or five years
                            had escaped defeats which were not regarded as entailling their
                            resignation. . . The Opposition, of course, maintain that the
                            circum-tances in this case are such as to invest a defeat inflicted by a
                            trick upon a vote in Supply with such overwhelming importance that it
                            ought at once to be followed by resigna- tion. That is a very natural
                            view to be held by an Opposition which displays, as Mr. Balfour
                            observed, all that avidity for office which it imputes as a crime to the
                            present Ministers. But it is not a conclusive argument. The Op- position
                            had last night an opportunity to prove that the vote of Thursday means
                            that the Ministers have lost the confidence of the House of Commons.
                            They could have gone on with the vote of censure upon Sir Edward Grey’s
                            motion. They elected to withdraw it. The essential point about a defeat
                            is whether it does or does not show that the Government has lost the
                            confidence of the majority. The Opposition have conclusively settled
                            that point in favor of Mr. Balfour.</p>

                        <p>Who ran away last night? There was an opportunity for the House of
                            Commons to have passed a real vote of censure upon the Government, which
                            the Opposition has traduc- ed and slandered in language that has rarely,
                            if ever, been employed in political controversy in this country. On the
                            showing of their own leaders any division adverse to the Go- vernment is
                            a vote of censure, and therefore to have voted against and to have
                            defeated Sir Alexander Acland-Hood’s motion for the
                            adjournment—explicity moved to give the Opposition an opportunity to
                            divide—would have been followed by the immediate resigna- tion of this
                            “unspeakable” and “perjured” Ministry. What did these loose-tongued
                            politi- cians do? They ran away, because they knew they would be beaten
                            hopelessly in the Lobby, And yet, because by a clever and not illegitim-
                            ate stratagem they stole a march on the Go- vernment on Thursday, they
                            say—though not one of them believes it—that Mr. Balfour has lost the
                            confidence of the House of Commons. If their statement were true they
                            could force a resignation, or a dissolution, or both, to- morrow. As we
                            have observed, the statement is not true. It is the cant of the whole
                            business that sickens one.</p>

                        <p>The Prime Minister based his defence or precedents. These prove nothing.
                            There are precedents for all three courses which were open to him— for
                            resignation and for dissolu- tion, as well as for “proceeding without
                            refer once to the incident.” Each case must be judged on its merits, and
                            precedents are of no value except in connection with all the circum-
                            stances.</p>

                        <p>The expected has happened. Mr. Balfour being offered resignation or
                            humiliation, has chosen the humiliation. The vote of Thursday is to be
                            as though it had not been. The appeal at the Foreign Office is to be
                            forgotten. Most Ministers are only prepared to sacrifice their ease and
                            comfort for the public good. This one will go one better. He will
                            sacrifice his, honor. Like the medieval mystic, he is prepared to
                            abandon not only happiness, but even bis soul’s salvation so long as the
                            world is saved.</p>

                            No doubt the “unsought volunteers of death” greatly in- creased by this
                            practice the sanctity attached to the surviving members of their caste,
                            and no doubt there will be a lump in the “Daily Telegraph's” throat
                            to-day as it speaks of Mr. Balfour’s moral loveliness. But the point is
                            whether all these saintly men are not getting in the country’s way with
                            their saintliness, whether the Premier, with all his charm and
                            ingenuity, does not overrate the country’s need for sacred cats and
                            under- rate its need for profane, Vulgar firemen.</p>

                        <p>“TEMPS.”</p>
                        <p>Mr. Balfour, it is said, has stated a thousand times that he would not
                            resign while he had a majority. He still has a majority. His defeat was
                            accidental; it was not decisive. Yet, it was not astonishing that he
                            should be beaten. His Government is weak. It is weak because it is old.
                            The end may not come now, but it is not very far off. Sometimes a change
                            of domes- tic policy in England involves a change of external policy. In
                            this case it almost certainly will not.</p>

                        <p> “Times”</p>
                        <p>The sudden meeting of the Kaiser and the Tsar on board their yachts off a
                            little island in the Baltic is certainly dramatic, and was doubtless
                            intended to be dramatic by one of the chief actors. Nobody can suspect
                            the Em- peror Nicholas of any desire for display, or of skill in
                            devising coups de theatre which are intended to impress the European
                            public. The Emperor William, on the other hand, has repeatedly shown
                            that he has an irrepressible taste for exhibitions of the sort, and some
                            ingenuity in devising them. . . . . . . That the Emperor Nicholas II.
                            should gladly take an opportunity of pouring forth his woes into the
                            bosom of a man of his own rank, who professes profound friendship for
                            him and for his people, can cause but little surprise to those who
                            remember the character of the Tsar.</p>

                        <p>“Standard,”</p>
                        <p> We cannot for one moment imagine that the purpose of the meeting was to
                            devise some common scheme for checking what has been called by the
                            Kaiser “the yellow peril.” However slow to learn the Tsar may be, he has
                            discovered by bitter experience the futility and the fatuity of
                            incurring the resentment of the new nationality in the Far East. But
                            that German finance may help Russian states- manship in overcoming one
                            of the obstacles to the conclusion of a lasting peace may well be
                            admitted. Those who wish well to Russia, and who have the strongest
                            faith in the recu- perative power of that great people, cannot conceal
                            from themselves that it will emerge from the disastrous struggle so
                            crippled and exhausted as to render it for a long time an almost
                            inappreciable factor in diplomatic com- binations. </p>

                        <p>The meeting can only be regarded as either a monumental gaucherie or an
                            event of the very highest significance in European politics. And yet it
                            is not easy to sustain either theory.</p>

                        <p>It would, we believe, be a mistake to attri- bute extreme importance to
                            the meeting of the Kaiser and the Tsar which has just taken place. It is
                            true, that the Emperor William, who is an excellent stage-manager,
                            surrounded it with every circumstance of privacy, and even mys- tery,
                            but we have known less exalted per- sonages do the same thing when they
                            had nothing more important to communicate than a tip for the Derby.
                            Neither Sovereign had his Foreign Minister with him, and, in the
                            circumstances, we are justified in assuming that the Imperial
                            conversation was confined to comparatively unexciting topics.</p>

                        <p>“Evening Standard.” </p>
                        <p>If either of the monarchs had been a wiser man, they would have arranged
                            to keep apart. The Tsar will inevitably be represented as a ruler asking
                            alien counsel as to the govern- ment of his realm; the Kaiser will be
                            criti- cised as an officious person anxious to run more of the earth’s
                            surface than it has pleased Providence to set him over. That both

                        <p>mises are perfectly correct does not make it any the more expedient that
                            they should be made the common talk of every capital. The German Emperor
                            already has so many fingers in so many pies that his subjects begin to
                            view with apprehension the possible intrusion of a carving knife; while,
                            from the point of view of the Tsar’s subjects, the conference almost
                            amounts to an abdication, without the compensations which that step
                            would involve for every thinking subject of Nicho- las II.</p>

                        <p>We can only speculate as to what the subject-matter of the interview may
                            be. Sweden and Norway is one suggestion, but for our part we feel pretty
                            confident that it is the Far East which has brought the Tsar and the
                            Kaiser together—at the latter’s invitation, so we are told.</p>

                        <p>“Echo de Paris.”</p>
                        <p>We ought to be more and more watchful, for Germany pursues her
                            anti-French policy with remarkable tenacity, and it is always the
                            Anglo-French understanding which is aimed at. One must suppose that the
                            under- standing is, indeed, formidable, since Germany is so anxious to
                            break it at any cost.</p>

                            disquiering Great Britain, he entered by the same step into a sort of
                            alliance with Germany, and those of our diplomatists and politicians who
                            in their schemes of foreign policy have not reckoned with the

                        <p>The meeting of the two Emperors is an im- portant event... In accepting
                            the interview which was proposed to him the Tsar showed that he is above
                            all preoccupied with the in- ternal situation of his Empire, and desired
                            to discuss matters with a ruler who is able to give him useful

                            rise to justifiable suspicions here, and that it is not enough to
                            reassure M. Rou- vier in a private interview in order that the country —
                            which to-morrow perhaps will know nothing of M. Rouvier’—should recover

                            advancing on Europe, it is all the more matter for congratulation that
                            the initiative should be taken by the representative of the neighbouring

                            to the machina- tions of England, and since France has chosen to
                            associate herself with England’s policy it is natural that Russia should
                            recollect the old intimate relations existing between her and Germany.
                            The fears entertained in Paris and London, where it is considered the
                            meeting between the two Emperors is a danger to the entente cordiale,

                            adoption of the resolutions, said that the directors had considered many
                            propositions, and had not succeeded in finding one offering the required
                            inducements. The country they proposed to operate in was the Sudan, the
                            resources of which had attracted much atten- tion. Under the scheme, it
                            was proposed to join hands with the Mysore Reefs and General Exploration
                            Company, Limited, and to carry on prospecting operations for gold on
                            terri- tory embracing some 1,000 square miles, in which area there had
                            already been located two ancient mining centres of some magnitude. As
                            the scheme did not fall within the powers conferred by the memorandum of
                            association, it was proposed to liquidate, and to form a new company, to
                            be called the New Options Ex- ploration, Limited, with a capital of
                            £5,000 in 50,000 shares of 2s. each, and having memo- randum of
                            association which would enable it to carry on exploration work in any

                            a practical man of the world. He would not go on a dream quest. There
                            are, he asserts, positive facts to go upon, and he concludes from them
                            that treasure of considerable value is to be had. He has asked for three
                            months from the syndicate in which to pursue the quest.</p>
                        <p> Meantime he is going ahead. A photograph of the bottom, over which he is
                            at present working with the salvage steamer Beaver, shows a considerable
                            swell or mound of sand corresponding to the space likely to be occupied
                            by a vessel of the bulk of the Admiral of Florence. Over this sandbank
                            there is a depth of water of about seven fathoms ; in the sur- rounding
                            area there is an almost uniform depth of nine fathoms. The hypothesis is
                            that this formation is caused by an accumulation on, and around, the
                            sunken ship. Captain Burns is satisfied that this theory is correct,
                            because ever since they began working relics in the shape of broken
                            scabbards, boarding hooks, pieces of guns, a pistol, and other curios,
                            in- teresting in themselves, but of little value, have been found among
                            the sand and pebbles.</p>
                        <p>Among the recent finds, was a well-pre- served blunderbuss, the barrel of
                            which is covered down to the muzzle with wood of very fine quality and
                            as fresh as when the ship went down. The weapon measures 35 inches in
                            length, and the bore is two inches. Other finds are a pistol of small
                            bore, two pieces of lead with 25 per cent. of silver, and a small lamp-
                            stand with three reflectors.</p>

                        <p>POSITION OF THE VESSEL.</p>
                        <p>According to the chart of the ground which Captain Burns has had
                            prepared, the Spaniard lies bow down and stern up. In the latter part of
                            the ship he expects to find the gold. He is therefore trying to find it.
                            He estimates that to do so he will require to dig through twenty feet of
                            sand. This, with a digger, would be a simple matter, but in order to
                            avoid damag- ing any valuable objects that may be there he is employing
                            a sand pump and divers. The pump is a centrifugal one, capable of
                            discharg- ing 120 tons per hour. It is worked from the deck of the
                            steamer Beamer, and discharges through a boxed-in sieve on the stern of
                            the vessel.</p>
                        <p>The diving has been entrusted to Mr. James Gush, of Greenock, whose
                            father Was one of the most famous divers of the West Coast. His work,
                            and that of his assistants, is to keep a clear passage for the action of
                            the pump below water by the removal of all big obstructions, keeping, at
                            the same time, a sharp look-out for “relics.” That this work is being
                            well done is shown from the number of articles already secured. Much of
                            the digging the divers have to do with their hands, much as children dig
                            for shell fish. They would prefer to make a clearance by the use of
                            shot, but the material is much too soft for shot to have any effect.</p>

                        <p>LEGAL QUESTIONS INVOLVED.</p>
                        <p>A rather important question is likely to emerge, touching on the right of
                            the syndicate or of the Duke of Argyll, from whom the gold-seekers are
                            said to hold a charter, to carry on the operations. Admitted that the
                            Crown gifted to the Argylls the sunken ship and all it contains, does
                            that right carry power to work, as they are doing, on the foreshore of
                            Tobermory? The pumping is being done directly in front of the pier. The
                            proprietors of the pier hold that the foreshore is theirs. How far their
                            claims in this respect may carry them one cannot say, but they mean,
                            should anything of value be got, to put forward a plea that their share
                            in the property is not a negligible quantity. People are also asking if
                            the Crown had the right to bestow on the Argylls the salvage of the
                            blown-up ship. These matters are only subject for idle speculation at
                            pre- sent, but should the syndicate come, upon bullion of value they may
                            easily become of practical interest. It is also pointed out that Spain
                            was not at war with Scotland at the time the Armada was destroyed. She
                            did not go to that country as an invader, but as a friend, and in search
                            of hospitality, which was accorded her. That there was treachery did not
                            give England the right to rob a Scottish guest—for the gold belonged to
                            the Spaniards. Is it not theirs yet?</p>
                        <p>All this is, of course, by the way, but it may serve to show that even
                            when Captain Bums and his friends come upon the treasure their troubles
                            may not be over. They will be asked to prove their right to it.</p>

                        <head type="sub">OUTCRY IN RUSSIA</head>
                        <p>A hubbub appears to have been made in Russia because Turkey has added a
                            few guns to the so-called defences of the Bosphorus, the Ottoman
                            entrance-way to the Black Sea But more cry has been raised than is
                            necessary. As a matter of fact, Turkey is not re-arming her forts. When
                            the Potemkin was running amuck and nobody knew where she would draw up,
                            Abdul was warned that her crew might attempt to have a picnic in his
                            river. Where- fore orders were issued for the forts to be strengthened
                            and manned, and for the "Navy” to prepare to give battle to the
                            mutineers should they attempt to invade. Accordingly a couple of rounds
                            per gun were served out to the artillerymen, who slept around their
                            pieces at night ready to spring to action at any mo- ment; searchlights
                            were kept playing from Kavak, where pilotage begins, right down to where
                            the brown river empties itself into, the Black Sea.</p>

                        <p> At the same time attempts were made to turn the alleged warships into a
                            fleet in being ; but the effort ended in disaster. Steam was got up in
                            the few gunboats and the tor- pedo craft ; but without exception they
                            all broke down and had to be towed back. Some new torpedo-boats recently
                            acquired by the Sultan were ordered out; but they stayed where they
                            were, the builders’ representa- tives refusing to let them be used, as
                            they have not yet been paid for! The Turkish war vessels are not things
                            to be feared. Officials and men are not paid salaries, and they follow
                            the example set by the higher authorities and help themselves. This the
                            naval ratings have done by stealing and selling the brasswork from the
                            engine-rooms and elsewhere, portions of machinery, gun- sights and such
                            things. From which it will be seen that the vessels are not too well
                            fitted to go to sea and stay there, and that the Golden Horn is not well
                            regulated.</p>
                        <p>As for the forts, they do not strike the expert passing up the river
                            within biscuit-toss of them as being extra formidable. On each flank at
                            the entrance to the Bosphorus there is a masonry work. They are the
                            flowers of the fortifications; but their guns are obsolete. Then on
                            either bank along up the river are other works at intervals—weak and
                            ancient erections, armed with equally ancient guns, almost without
                            exception muzzle-loaders, possibly rifled, possibly not. They have the
                            huge breech and narrow nose that marked the guns of the days when Russia
                            and Turkey were at each other's throats, and it is probable that the
                            majority of them were never fired since, they were installed in their
                            emplacements many years ago, and that their mouths had forgotten the
                            taste of powder when the charges were rammed into them a few weeks ago
                            in readiness for the Russian invaders.</p>
                        <p> There are only two vessels in his palace- lined waterway that are well
                            kept, if we except the mercantile vessels, the visiting yachts, and the
                            warships of the Powers. They are the Sultan’s two pleasure ships. One of
                            them, an exact replica of the old Victoria and Albert, was presented to
                            Abdul by our late Queen ; the other is a gorgeous steam yacht of about
                            500 tons, built to the Sultan’s order some years ago. He does not trust
                            them to his own people, who would carry them away bit by bit in lieu of
                            wages ; they are in charge of Englishmen, probably the only employes who
                            get their pay, although the cheques may come in irregularly. The yachts
                            are anchored off the Palace, and are emblems of the Sultan’s splendour;
                            but they are never used and are rotting as they swing at their
                            buoys.</p>

                        <p>That it is possible to make profits in Africa, even in bad times, and
                            when everybody is grumbling, is shown by the satisfactory report of the
                            New African Company. We hold no brief for this particular undertaking,
                            but its name is mentioned because the details of the report fully bear
                            out our contention of long age, viz: that the Dark Continent has greater
                            poten- tialities of wealth than either Europe, Asia, or America. It is
                            because it is a dark continent as regards its population that it is
                            still so far behind. But things move more rapidly now- a-days than they

                            en 1903. Pour ces raisons, les previsions de l’exeroico oourant ont ete

                        <p>(From our Correspondent.)</p>
                        <p>Paris, July 25.</p>
                        <p>The subject uppermost in the minds of politicians in this country at the
                            present moment is the unexpected developments of the mission with which
                            the Tsar has en- trusted M. Witte. According to trustworthy reports
                            which have reached Paris, Russia is not only desirous of making her
                            peace with Japan, but is anxious, to contract an alliance with the
                            nation that has humiliated her. She is even willing to pay a war
                            indemnity if this can be brought about, a condition which we have
                            all-along been informed was one to which Russia would never submit. The
                            fact Great Britain—and which she is reported to have recently renewed on
                            closer terms than before—does not appear to be any barrier in the eyes
                            of the Tsar to an alliance be- tween his people and those of the Mikado.
                            On the contrary, if England can be included in the combination that will
                            only render the "entente” all the more powerful, and as France would
                            also be a party to it the result would be an alliance that would ensure
                            the peace of the world for an indefinite period. It will be remarked
                            that Germany does not figure in the new grouping.</p>

                        <p>Concerning the new Anglo-Japanese treaty, it is stated here that it will
                            comprise more distinct and explicit engagements than before. Japan is to
                            protect and foster Bri- tish interest in the Chinese seas, and Eng- land
                            will withdraw a portion of the powerful fleet which she keeps in the
                            Pacific. In re- turn, England will support the political and economical
                            action of Japan in Manchuria, Corea, and China. As soon as the war is
                            over Japan will send a number of her officers to China to reorganise the
                            Chinese army, and England will support her in the accom- plishment of
                            this scheme against the preten- sions of other Powers, especially
                            Germany.</p>

                        <p>The cost of living abroad, especially in France, is a question upon which
                            wide vari- ance of opinion exists. In a recent article on the subject,
                            M. A. de Foville, the well-known economist, uses England as a standard
                            of comparison, and says that there is no doubt that the English, on the
                            average, have one- third more to spend than the French, and, all things
                            being equal, more money is earned in England than in France. Further,
                            the cost of living in England is far less than it is in France. The
                            contrary was formerly the case. Butter in France costs 1s. 2 1/2d. to
                            2s. 6d. per lb., cheese from 1s to 1s. 8d. per lb., and fowls from 2s.
                            to 4s. each. Milk can be had from 3d. per quart, bread 2d. per lb., and
                            meat from 1Od. to 1s. 6d. per lb. Fruit, which is more plentiful and
                            earlier than in England, costs about the same in both countries; bananas
                            and oranges, which Algiers exports by millions, cost a penny and
                            twopence each. Coffee, of better quality than is common in England,
                            costs in France 1s. 8d. to 2s. 6d. per lb. Tea, which is not usually as
                            good as in England, is dearer, and costs from 2s. 6d. to 4s. for
                            ordinary quality ; and sugar 4d. per lb. Coal in Paris is worth £2 8s.
                            to £3 4s. per ton, and in many houses heat is a great rarity. In London
                            two boxes of matches are given for a halfpenny, but in France each box
                            costs a penny (packets of five hundred cost 4d). and they are bad and
                            ill-smelling. Drugs and medicine are almost prohibitively expensive.</p>

                        <p>M. de Foville presents the balance sheet of four average families. The
                            first family, with an income of £400 per annum, represents a Parisian
                            household : father, mother, two child- ren attending school, and a
                            servant. The second family, with an income of £320, repre- sents a
                            provincial household consisting of a father, mother, two children, and a
                            servant. The third family, with an income of £160, is a Parisian
                            household, consisting of father, mother, a small child, and no servant.
                            And one last is that of a workman's family at Reims, consisting of
                            father, mother, two children, five and ten years of age, the family
                            disposing of a parse of £83 per year. The first family expends £350, and
                            has a balance of £50 for pleasures, doctors, and so forth ; the second
                            family expends £250, and has £70 left, the third, £135, and has a
                            balance of £25 ; and the fourth. £63, with a balance of £20. In the ease
                            of the third family the food consists of coffee, bread and butter for
                            break- fast ; at midday, meat, vegetables, and dessert; at four o’clock
                            the mother and child have chocolate and bread : and at six o’clock there
                            is a dinner of soup, vegetables, and dessert. This is certainly an
                            excellent show- ing for the money at the disposal of the
                            housekeeper.</p>

                        <p> M de Foville puts his finger on the reason for this successful
                            housekeeping when he says that it lies in the "innate inclination, one
                            might say the passion, for economy. With a few francs the little
                            Parisienne, who may be hungry many days during the year, is able to make
                            herself a hat and frock which many wealthy women might envy. And it is
                            with the table as it is with the toilette. The art of utilising the
                            remnants is an art essentially French, whether it be ribbons or ragouts.
                            The spirit of economy is as common in our country as it is rare in
                            England. Fathers and mothers in France consider themselves the debtors
                            of their children, and even the bachelors think they should leave
                            something behind.”</p>

                        <p>A former quarter-master of the Farfadet named Hourdel, who has been
                            interviewed at Havre, where he is now employed, throws an interesting
                            light upon one of the causes of the</p>
                        <cb n="2"/>
                        <p>loss of that submarine. This he attributes largely, if not entirely, to
                            the familiarity with and consequent contempt for danger on the part of
                            both the crews and the officers of sub- marines.</p>

                        <p>He explains that it was the custom of the Farfadet to leave the manhole
                            open until the last possible moment, so as to avoid the feel- ing of
                            discomfort from the outrush of air, and that the leas; thing—a grain of
                            sand in the mechanism, for instance—might easily prevent the closing of
                            the manhole, and so sink the boat. Of course, the doors of the manhole
                            should be closed, he said, before the plunge, but in practice they very
                            rarely are.</p>

                        <p>Hourdel was one of the original crew of the Farfadet when she was
                            launched at Rochefort in 1901, and remained with her for nine months. He
                            says that he "much prefers life on a submarine to life on a warship,
                            cruiser, or torpedo-boat. It is quite pleasant under water for twelve
                            hours at a time without re- newing the air, and even at a few feet from
                            the surface you feel neither rocking nor rolling.”</p>

                        <p>Victor Hugo seems to have lived every where. He began his married life in
                            a street very like the slums ; he finished in the neigh- bourhood of the
                            Etoile. Youthful enthusiasts went in procession on the festival of St.
                            Victor- Hugo’s name day—to a house in the Rue de la Tour-d’Auvergne,
                            where he lived at the moment of his banishment by the Government of the
                            Second Republic. In apartments on the first floor, overlooking the
                            courtyard, Hugo had his residence for a year. The Hugo Pilgrims planted,
                            not a weeping willow such as De Musset asked for, but a small bust in
                            the courtyard. The very concierge who answered the poet’s “Cordon, s’il
                            vous plait!" fifty years ago is still at his post, hale and hearty, and
                            full of Hugo reminiscences, and a neighbour of the great man’s is also
                            still a "locataire.” Paris despite its dissipations has its just pro-
                            portion of nonogenarians.</p>

                        <p>The death of Arton, of the Panama scandal, has filled the papers with
                            stories of his career. It is now clear enough that he was hard pressed
                            for money, and that this induced him to drink the poisoned cup. Arton
                            was a "noceur” of the most pronounced type. The seamy side of Paris he
                            knew as well as his own (or other people’s) pockets. Shut out from the
                            "monde,” he consoled himself with the "demi- monde.” A great ball that
                            he gave will live in memory. In the midst of it he hurried away to
                            purchase, at twelve o’clock at night in a jeweller’s in the Rue de la
                            Paix, a diamond necklace of great price. It was destined to be- deck a
                            demi-mondaine whose beauty had at- tracted him. Curiously enough, Arton
                            dressed like a funeral mute—the "long-sleever,” frock coat and black
                            trousers, and he never altered even with the temperature as it is now.
                            Per- haps he was in training for really hot weather —elsewhere.</p>
                        <p>Deroulede’s house at Croissy-les-Roses, a riverine suburb of Paris, has
                            been the Mecca of numerous pilgrimages. The whole neigh- bourhood was
                            disappointed, with the exile, at his non-arrival. There had been a
                            hurried tidy- ing up of the garden, a cutting of belated hay, and a
                            wrestling with great weeds : a luncheon had been prepared, the guests
                            invited, whilst sentimental hearts had poured in flowers and bouquets
                            for M. Deroulede and his sister. An aged dame of the village even bore
                            two em- broidered pincushions as her contribution to the fete. But the
                            flowers have withered and the provisions have grown stale ; it is only
                            the pin-cushions which are unaffected by the exile’s failure to come up
                            to time. It was in this house that Deroulede was arrested in the month
                            of August six years ago. It was here, also, that his uncle, Emile
                            Augier, died. The younger Dumas drove his pony carriage and pair over
                            from Marly to have a final interview with the dramatist. When Deroulede
                            really returns and the calf is killed and eaten in proper season, then
                            the villa will be, like Socrates’ abode, too small to hold his
                            friends.</p>
                        <p>The “Temps” gives some details of the colli- sion which occurred recently
                            between French and Germans on the Congolese frontier, in which several
                            Senegalese sharpshooters were killed. It says:-</p>
                        <p>“The frontier between the Congo and the Cameroons being an imaginary
                            line, it is pos- sible that Missoum-Missoum, where the French post was
                            attacked, which is marked as French on French maps, may be marked as
                            German on the German maps. The native sergeant in com- mand of the
                            French troops replied to the Ger- man lieutenant that he was awaiting
                            orders. The German officer seems at least to have shown excessive
                            nervousness, for he fired first on the black sergeant who was advancing
                            alone to meet him. The excuse offered by the lieute- nant that the negro
                            appeared ready to use his weapon does not seem justified, for so little
                            did the Senegalese troops expect an attack that they had their rifles
                            slung across their backs.</p>
                        <p>"The German detachment killed four of them and seriously wounded others.
                            An agent of the N’Goko Sangha Company, whom the lieutenant afterwards
                            asked to withdraw, re- plied that the proofs produced were not con-
                            vincing, and that he should remain where he was. The German detachment
                            then retired. In consequence of this an official Franco German Mission
                            has been appointed fo delimit the frontier. Whatever its decision, it is
                            certain that the N’Goko-Sangha Company, jn whose employment the sergeant
                            and the men killed were, is entitled to an indemnity.”</p>

                        <p>Eighty young American women paid a flying visit to Paris front London
                            eight-and-forty</p>
                        <cb n="3"/>
                        <p>hours ago. They confided to the reporter that they were looking for
                            husbands. In the mean- time they took in as much of Paris as they could,
                            not forgetting the Morgue ; it is to be hoped they were not looking for
                            "him” there. These eighty daughters of Columbia are tra- velling Europe
                            under the aegis of a newspaper and with all their expenses paid. It is
                            remark- able the number of their compatriots ‘doing” Paris at this
                            moment. An average of 2,500 Americans register every month at the
                            ‘Herald” office here. It is to be assumed that does not absorb the whole
                            clan of travelling Americans, but the figures in themselves are
                            sufficiently striking. It is a merciful dispensa- tion of Providence for
                            the Rue de la Paix and and the Avenue de l’Opera that when the Parisian
                            goes out the American comes in. The July tourist from across the
                            Atlantic is the golden bridge from June to October for the jeweller and
                            dressmaker.</p>
                        <p>The day is still afar off, no doubt when eighty beauteous young women of
                            France, shepherded by the “Figaro” or the “Patrie,” will flatter the
                            male breasts of Cheapside and the Strand ; but a commencement has been
                            made. An anonymous donor has placed a purse, worth £600, at the yearly
                            disposition of the Sorbonne for the use of young French women. They are
                            to travel the countries of Europe and America, visiting those centres
                            where they may be supposed to gain the greatest culture by contact with
                            the educated native. Thus, in the States, they will pat themselves into
                            touch with the women’s universities. It is an interest- ing and novel
                            scheme for France, and points the way to great developments, As an
                            instance of the hold that foreign languages now have upon this nation,
                            one may notice the outcry raised this week over the proposal to render
                            optional living tongues in-the examination for teachers, if the
                            Frenchman is not a born linguist, he is beginning to regret that he
                            isn’t —which is already half-way to being one.</p>

                        <p>The theatre of St Anne has just opened its doors for the summer season.
                            You will not find such a theatre on the Boulevards, and I doubt if the
                            Automedon of the taximeter ever heard of it. It is certainly a theatre
                            of a somewhat special sort. Its audience are all mad people. St. Anne is
                            an insane asylum on the outskirts of the city. In the summer a little
                            theatre is set up in the great courtyard of the institution and every
                            Sunday evening plays are given for the delectation of the inmates. They
                            take kindly to the entertainment and even applaud in the right place.
                            The theatre plays its part in mental treatment in several of the
                            asylums. At the Asilo de Villejuif, artistes from the Paris theatres
                            beguile the evenings of the patients, and at Charenton the same humane
                            ideas prevail. Salpetriere, the famous hospital for female hysterics,
                            has its costume halls and entertainments, in contrast to the old regime,
                            whereof a print exists to show its horrors. The picture represents the
                            wretched women shut np in cages like wild beasts, their food being
                            thrust in between the bars on the end of forks.</p>

                        <p>An amusing little incident happened this week at the Etoile station of
                            the Paris "tube,” underneath the Arc de Triomphe. M. Lupine, the Prefect
                            of Police, ran fop a train after the whistle had been blown. The guard,
                            however, slammed the carriage door, and M. Lepine was left upon the
                            platform. The station master, who had seen the incident, telephoned down
                            the line, and when the train got to its jour- ney’s end the guard was
                            reprimanded. "I only did my duty," said the man, "and I deserve no
                            reprimand." "But surely you recognised M. le Prefect’s face?” "Of course
                            I did. And that was another reason for me to prevent him from breaking
                            it,” And M. Lupine thought so too, and sent the man a present for his
                            attention to duty.</p>

                        <p> London, July 25.</p>
                        <p>Second Lieutenant E. T. W. M’Causland, 1st Battalion Royal Berkshire
                            Regiment, Dublin, has been placed on duty with the draft which is now
                            being prepared by the 1st Battalion for the 2nd Battalion in Egypt. The
                            draft will leave England for Alexandria about the 27th of September.</p>

                        <p>Captain Herbert Gordon,Leicester Regiment, who recently took up the
                            duties of Assistant Adjutant General of the Egyptian Army, has had close
                            on sixteen years’ military experience. He has the reputation of being a
                            splendid organiser, and no doubt his new appointment will give him
                            opportunities of exercising his well-known capacities. He has done duty
                            with The Khedive’s army since November, 1900.</p>

                        <p>The recent change in the redistribution of the fleet has resulted in the
                            bringing up of the battle squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet to nine
                            powerful ships, modern in every respect. It is intended to keep the
                            battle squadron at yhat strength for the present. The Channel Fleet will
                            be raised to fifteen battleships, and the Atlantic Fleet to nine
                            battleships, exclu- sive of the cruisers and smaller ships. In con-
                            sequence of these changes the contemplated North Sea Squadron will not
                            be formed—just now. All that Germany has gained by her policy of
                            aggression towards England is the concentration of a naval force within
                            striking distance of her own shores. Any mischief that the German navy
                            was capable of doing has been discounted by the action of that
                            country.</p>

                        <p>The United States and Canada have their question of alien immigration,
                            and it is, of course, a far larger one than ours. The visitors from
                            Eastern and South-Eastern Europe are pouring across the Atlantic by the
                            hundred thousand every season. The “Hungarians,” as they are called
                            generically in the States, pro- bably furnish the second largest
                            contingent, coming next after the Italians, and being long ahead of the
                            British, Germans, and Scandi- navians. These people are not all Magyars,
                            though many of them are; others, however, are Bohemians, Gallicians, and
                            Ruthenians, Rou- manians, Serbs, Dalmatians, and Bulgarians. This
                            conglomeration is beginning to colonise whole tracts of the mining and
                            fanning regions of Pennsylvania and Ohio, and is now also spreading
                            itself into Canada.</p>
                        <p>The sudden shifting of a large population brings evils of its own. These,
                            in the present case, have attracted the attention of a young Hungarian
                            nobleman, who is also a dignitary of the Catholic Church, Monsignor
                            Count Vay de Vaya. The Count, who is not yet thirty, has had an
                            interesting career. He is a mem- ber of a great aristocratic family, a
                            society favorite in Vienna, Pesth, and Agram—where his cousin is the Ban
                            or Governor—and was for some time in the diplomatic service, where a
                            brilliant career lay before him. He threw it up to enter the priesthood,
                            and to become a missionary in the remote places of the earth. He went to
                            Eastern Asia, to China, Korea, and Japan, to ameliorate the conditions
                            of the Christians in those countries. The political troubles which led
                            to the war interfered with his work, and the Count returned and looked
                            into the condition of his countrymen emigrat- ing to the West. He took a
                            number of trips in the great Canard steamers which carry the steerage
                            passengers in huge drafts from Fiume. On one occasion he found himself
                            with 2,400 persons on board one of these vessels, and he delivered a
                            notable sermon to nearly the whole company, who assembled on the upper
                            deck and swarmed over rails, boats, and deck houses to listen to him.
                            The Count Is a wonderful linguist. He speaks most of the dialects of
                            South-Eastern Europe, as well as English, French, German, Italian,
                            Spanish, Latin and a few other languages. His English is as nearly
                            perfect as that of any foreigner can be, and considerably better than
                            that of most natives. </p>
                        <p> MAGYAR EMIGRANTS.</p>
                        <p>In the United States and Canada, the apos- tolic protonotary has found
                            abundant scope for his energy. The condition of many of the Hungarian
                            emigrants is deplorable, not so much in the material as in the spiritual
                            and intellectual sense. The Hungarian or Slav immigrant when he leaves
                            his village, driven to the West by the ambition to better himself, or
                            the mere pressure of want, has many good qualities. He is usually simple
                            in his tastes, frugal in his habits, affectionate in his family
                            relations, and naturally religious. Count Vay de Vaya believes that they
                            are in great danger of losing many of these qualities in their new
                            homes. They leave their priests behind, them and the traditions and
                            customs of the old village life. There is a flourishing and powerful
                            Roman Catholic Church in America, but it is long before these new
                            settlers come into touch with it, for its priests speak a language which
                            the immigrants do not understand. They lose their faith, they become
                            Anarchistical, Socialis- tic, and mere materialists ; they become self-
                            indulgent, insubordinate, and riotous, and are looked at askance by
                            their fellow citizens. The Italians often return to their native country
                            when they nave made a little money; the Hungarians remain, and many
                            thoughtful people in America are inclined to regard them as a social and
                            economic danger. Count Vay de Vaya is endeavouring to mitigate these
                            perils by establishing missions among his countrymen in the mining and
                            agricultural regions of the West—to keep them in touch with the
                            Churches, and so to bridge over the transition stage, when they have
                            abandoned their old habits and ideals and have not yet acquired those of
                            Anglo- Saxondom. He has keen passing through London, after one of his
                            tours of inspection, and speaks somewhat hopefully of his enter- prises.
                            He has preached to the factory workers in New York ; and has made a
                            close examina- tion of the immigrant position in Canada, with the
                            encouragement of the Dominion Government. He has also been to Washing-
                            ton, and finds that President Roosevelt is deeply Interested in his
                            attempts to prevent the foreign labourer becoming a mere indus- trial
                            machine, without hope, faith, or. reve- rence. It is work of the more
                            importance since it seems, to quote Count Vay de Vaya, as if we were in
                            face of a veritable Volker- winderwag, a shifting of the population,
                            such as hardly has a parallel in modem times.</p>

                        <p>A BROKEN-DOWN SYSTEM.</p>
                        <p>This is a condition (or disease) to which doctors give many names, but
                            which few of them really understand. It it simply weakness—a break-down,
                            as it were, of the vital forces that sustain the system. No matter what
                            may be its causes (for they are almost numberless), its symptoms are
                            much the same; the more prominent being sleeplessness, sense of
                            prostration or weariness, depression of spirits and want of energy for
                            all the ordinary affairs of life. Now, what alone is absolutely
                            essential in all such cases is increased vitality—vigour--</p>
