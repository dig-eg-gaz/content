                    <p>The most interesting event at home last week was the military debate which
                        took place in the House of Commons yesterday week. We must confess that the
                        more we hear of our Army and its reformers the less we like the look of the
                        whole affair. Mr. Arnold-Forster himself is in some ways the least
                        convincing champion and apologist of his own department He had in the House
                        of Commons a difficult task, to answer—as effectively as might be- </p>

                    <p>criticism directed from almost every quarter on almost every, point of Army
                        organisation and administration. It is impossible to take note of all the
                        criticism, but in endeavouring to take a bird’s-eye view of the situation we
                        are brought up sharp by the volume of dissatisfaction. Vague and discursive
                        as was the criticism in the House of Commons, thus defeating its own end to
                        some extent, and making easier the position of Mr. Arnold Forster as
                        spokesman for the Government, it is an immediately striking fact that after
                        so many years of tinkering and so many changes of Ministers and schemes, our
                        organisation should still be in a wonderfully fluid condition and our
                        readiness for offence and défense on land so extremely questionable, that
                        many who are given to thinking about such trifles as national policy and
                        Imperial security in preference to devoting all their brain power to the
                        latest music-hall success or the last society scandal, are unable to sleep
                        very quietly o’nights for anxiety. No smooth and smug defence from the
                        Ministerial benches, however effective from the Parliamentary point of view,
                        can blind our eyes to a state of affairs that has become deplorable, or
                        reassure us with comfort that is all on paper. </p>

                        Commons yesterday week, is the question of Artillery Rearmament. On this
                        question Mr. Arnold-Forster made certain definite statements which were
                        received with cheers by a House touched to sympathy by his able and spirited
                        defence. We will not again go into the whole story. We will content
                        ourselves with repeating that none of the new batteries were ordered until
                        October of last year, when twenty-one batteries were put in hand after the
                        indictment brought by the London Press against the Department. This pill for
                        an earthquake was followed in December—when the agitation had spread and the
                        whole English Press was thunderously calling for immediate action—by the
                        completion of the necessary orders. It would be interesting to have chapter
                        and verse for Mr. Arnold-Forster’s assertion. In the highest interests of
                        the nation we want to know where these guns of April were manufactured and
                        why, if their manufacture can be proved, Mr. Arnold-Forster did not still
                        the agitation before it had well began, as he could so easily have done, by
                        the production of proof of so reassuring a statement. </p>
                    <p>Mr. Arnold-Forster has convinced us that he is most hard-working, earnest,
                        and self-sacrificing. His personal devotion to duty has never been called in
                        question. We are persuaded that he has done his level best and that be has
                        ideas which are good. But the Army is suffering from a disease of ideas.
                        What it wants is practical application, fewer doctors, less diagnosis, and a
                        more continuous treatment. It is something to know that the War Office is
                        inclined to hold its hands with regard to the new rifle. For neither Lord
                        Roberts nor Mr. Arnold-Forster was very successful in combating the
                        objection to its continued supply to the whole Army. Experi ments in
                        Somaliland are not a perfect answer to the volume of criticism in England,
                        and it is a senseless policy to waste millions of money until the return is
                        sure, so long as the present weapon is not—like the present field-gun—
                        hopelessly obsolete. </p>
                    <p>Perhaps the best suggestion made in the course of the debate was Colonel
                        Welby’s suggestion that the Government and Opposition should confer amicably
                        to work out a scheme of national defence, and should pledge them selves to
                        see that it was continuously carried into effect. That sounds Utopian. But
                        it should be capable of realisation with a little real patriotism, and
                        mutual consideration for the good of the country and the Empire. Meanwhile
                        it would be to the good if Mr. Arnold-Forster and Mr. Balfour, who is
                        equally responsible, could manage to get a clearer grasp of the essential
                        foots with which they have to deal.</p>

                        175 votes after rejecting, by 250 to 201 votes, an amendment by Mr. Buchanan
                        demanding a reduction in the national expenditure. (Reuter.) </p>

                    <p>DECREASE ON LAST YEAR. </p>
                    <p>London, March 2. The Naval Estimates amount to £33,389,000 compared with
                        £36,889,000 for 1904-05. This decrease is mainly on new constructions and
                        repairs. It is partly due to the fact that the latter figure includes two
                        cruisers bought-from Chili. The decrease in the repairs is due to the
                        elimination of vessels of small fighting value. It is proposed to begin the
                        construction during 1905-06 of one battleship, 4 armoured cruisers, 6 ocean
                        and 12 coastal destroyers and 11 submarines. (Reuter.) </p>

                        train from Cairo station at 9.45 a.m. direct to the Alexandria quays, thus
                        very considerably facilitating the embarkation. </p>
                    <p>Suez Canal.—On the 27th and 28th inst. 29 vessels passed through the Canal.
                        Of these, 22 were British, 3 German, 1 Norwegian, 1 Dutch, 1 Egyptian, 1

                    <p>Sudan Giraffes.—The pair of giraffes, which Colonel Mahon sent from Kordofan
                        to the Zoological Society at London are doing very well in the “Zoo.” They
                        are a splendid pair (G. C. antiquorum). From these animals much is hoped for
                        in the way of re-establishing their illustrious race in Regent’s Park. </p>

                        the Egyptian State Railways for the accommodation of his clients, Shepherd's
                        Hotel made a record this week, when 445 visitors were put up there on Monday

                        Benevolent Society, will be celebrated on the 13th inst. There will be an
                        extraordinary general meeting of the members of the society on that day,
                        which will be followed by a grand banquet at the New Khedivial Hotel at

                        Consul-General, will be present. </p>
                    <p>Orient-Pacific Line.—The S.S. “Orient,” of the Orient-Pacific Line,which is
                        now pleasure cruising, is to sail from Alexandria on the 8th inst., about 4
                        p.m., on the return trip to Marseilles, calling at Malta and Syracuse. The
                        steamer has ample room for any passengers who may wish to avail themselves
                        of this opportunity, the fare being the ordinary first-class fare to
                        Marseilles of £16.0.0, with the opportunity of calling at two ports not
                        touched by these steamers in the ordinary course. </p>
                    <p>Alexandria Museum.—A considerable number of important additions to the
                        treasures of the Alexandria Museum have been made recently. Among them are
                        some fine heads in terra cotta of a grotesque type and of Hellenic
                        workmanship. While demolishing the old fortifications two beautiful marble
                        statues were found. They are both headless, but the workmanship is
                        exquisite, and they are of considerable importance in the histoty of
                        Alexandrian art. They represent Eros and Dionysus and evidently formed part
                        of a larger group. The spot where this discovery was made is being carefully
                        excavated with a view to further finds. </p>

                    <p>A very important land company will shortly be launched in England and in
                        Egypt simultaneously. It is styled the “Egyptian Estates, Limited.” The
                        capital will be £500,000. The company is supported by very powerful
                        financial people in London, and the directors are men well-known in
                        connection with Egyptian affairs. There is no underwriting commission and no

                    <p>M. PUGNO’S RECITALS. </p>
                    <p>M. Raoul Pugno gave his last concert at Cairo on Wednesday night at the Savoy
                        Hotel. It was from first to last a thorough treat: well-chosen, fine music,
                        worthy rendering, and a most unusual technique and touch. The first item,
                        Bach’s Italian Concert, was above all superb ; we must say that the rapidity
                        of the presto gioioso was unusual ; but that is a point of view rather than
                        a criticism. The Beethoven again induces this argument ; M. Pugno made it
                        wonderful, but there was a certain individuality about his rendering which,
                        was hard to accept at first notice ; one is not sure whether to like it or
                        wish for it. The Schumann is a fine, vigorous piece, and with all the
                        romance of the composer ; M. Pugno entered into it wholly. He was perhaps
                        most interesting in the four Chopin pieces, 1st, 2nd and posthumous
                        Impromptus (and the first and last of these three are pure magic) and a
                        Scherzo : all these were exactly suited to him ; only once was his
                        personality difficult, in certain very marked passages in the ‘posthume’ :
                        these he took with some degree of suddenness, of accuracy in rhythm which
                        does not seem to, agree with the character ; one expects the phrases to flow
                        more. The “Fileuse” was a marvel ; ho played with-it, and us, and made the
                        swift soft flying notes float in the air. His own compositions, a waltz and
                        an impromptu, show character, and are exactly suited to his playing,
                        especially the latter. The most extra ordinary piece of playing was the last
                        item, the Xlllth Liszt Rhapsody ; in that he was “electric,” and made his
                        bearers almost gasp at moments ; one could hardly realize the passages, as
                        they came and went,—only a general sense remained of whirling, lightest,
                        swiftest sound. M. Raoul Pugno is indeed an unusual pianist—and musician.
                        One hardly need talk of dexterity aud light touch and skill ; he seems to
                        have left all that behind, to grasp his music and “scatter” that music at us
                        ; it may be called a “tour de force,” but the force is too natural to be
                        anything but mesmeric. </p>
                    <p>To comment upon a performance which calls for nothing but unstinted praise is
                        to reduce criticism to a nullity.lt was with feelings such as these that we
                        listened to M. Raoul Pugno’s second and unfortunately last concert last
                        night at the New Khédivial Hotel. While most exponents of music are to a
                        certain extent biassed by their nationality, M. Pugno’s interpretations are
                        as unlimited as they are true and thorough. Each item of his widely-chosen
                        programme elicited more enthusiastic applause than the preceding one. The
                        concert opened with Bach’s "Concerto Italien,” of which the first movement,
                        an Allegro Animato, convinced us that his breadth of power and delicacy of
                        touch yielded in nothing to his perfect execution. The Andante molto
                        espressivo was justly appreciated and was followed by a Presto gioioso which
                        was brilliantly performed. With Such a master at the key-board it would ill
                        become us to evince surprise, but we must own to having been impressed
                        beyond our expectation by the sympathy and depth of feeling displayed in the
                        Beethoven Sonata in Re minor, the Adagio of which was rendered with great
                        tenderness. The second part was devoted to Schumann’s “Carnaval de Vienne.”
                        In the Allegro movement the effect produced was that of an orchestra such as
                        we have rarely heard. The Intermezzo met with long and deserved applause. In
                        Chopin M. Pugno was, if anything, at his best. The “Impromptu in Lab" was
                        played with great vigour, the speed in parts well-nigh baffling the ear. The
                        “Impromptu Posthume” and the “Scherzo in Si b mineur” showed more than ever
                        his commanding powers to the unbounded satisfaction of his audience. M.
                        Pugno’s delicacy of touch painted an emotional picture of Mendelssohn's “La
                        Filense. ” “La Chaise” was played with great Verve and was highly
                        appreciated. Of M. Pugno’s own compositions we preferred the second, which
                        suggested Chopin, while the “Valse lente” was light and pretty. The “Xlllth
                        Rhapsodie” of Liszt was given with fire and passion, and concluded one of
                        the most comprehensive and best-rendered programmes which Alexandria has
                        ever had the good fortune to enjoy. </p>

                    <head>Clearing of the Sphinx</head>
                    <p>MR. COVINGTON’S PROJECT. </p>
                    <p>Readers of the “Gazette” who are interested in antiquities will be glad to
                        hear that Mr. Dow Covington, the well-known Egyptologist, has been given
                        liberal offers of assistance by the authorities of several well-known
                        American museums and not a few rich fellow-countrymen for his scheme for
                        clearing the Sphinx from the sand drift which has accumulated around it
                        during the last few years. Mr. Favarger and Mr. Charles Royle, who are
                        associated in the project with Mr. Covington, have prepared a most
                        interesting plan showing the nature of their scheme. </p>
                    <p>The Sphinx itself is to be completely cleared, and a passage starting from
                        the now buried fore-paws will be driven right down to the edge of the
                        cultivated land. This will involve the clearing away of three native houses
                        dose to the cultivation and the removal of thousands of tons of sand, and
                        the total cost of the operation is estimated at 20,000 dollars. It is Hoped
                        that as soon as an executive committee can be organised to deal with the
                        details of the scheme, it will obtain the necessary financial support. Much
                        indeed has been promised, as we have already stated, as soon as the
                        committee has been formed and has prepared a statement of the details of the
                        expenditure. </p>
                    <p>It must not be imagined that those who aid the scheme will go unrewarded. The
                        Antiquities Service has entered into an agreement with the promoters of the
                        scheme whereby one-half of the objects discovered in the course of the
                        excavations are to be divided among those who have given their help, the
                        rest becoming the property of the Government. The antiquarian importance of
                        the scheme is very great and it is not going-too far to say that it may at
                        last solve the question of the age of the Sphinx. Professor Maspero believes
                        the Sphinx to be pie-dynastic, other renowned Egyptologists assign it to the
                        IVth or to the Xllth dynasties, and there is a difference of 3,000 years
                        between the earliest and the latest estimates. Even if no clue is found we
                        shall know one thing,—that there is nothing to find, and there are
                        possibilities of amazing discoveries. We hope to give our readers further
                        information about Mr. Covington’s project in the near future. </p>

                    <p>Puccini’s Manon Lescaut, which was produced for the first time 15 years ago,
                        still remains the masterpiece of the young Italian school. The performance
                        of this opera last night, thanks to Sig. Pagani, was a success. The tenor
                        was in splendid voice and gave an admirable interpretation of the
                        exceedingly trying rôle of Chevalier des Grieux. He takes really high notes
                        without the slightest difficulty, and gave us last night two “Do di petto”
                        one after the other. We learn that Sig. Pagani has just been engaged by the
                        Lisbon Opera House for a number of performances of Lohengrin, after which he
                        will sing again with Signora Bellincioni in one of the biggest theatres in
                        Europe, at her own request Signora Bassich was not quite at ease in the
                        title rôle, but Signori Borrioni and Vaccârî were good in their respective
                        parts. To-night, Rigoleltô will be given. </p>

                    <head>QUESTIONS MUNICIPALE </head>
                    <p>Les agissements de la Delegation </p>
                    <p>M. Alderson ayant posé le dilemme “ou les conseillers municipaux seront
                        autorisés à assister à titre consultatif aux séances de la Délégation, ou
                        bien je maintiendrai ma démission”, la Commission apurement et simplement
                        voté pour cette dernière alternative et retranché de son sein le membre
                        récalcitrant. </p>
                    <p>Sans rechercher ce que cette conduite peut avoir de contraire aux habitudes
                        de nos édiles et à la correction de leur manières, hâtons-nous de dire
                        qu’elle est profondément contraire à l’esprit de la loi. </p>
                    <p>La question qui se pose, en effet, est celle-ci : la Commission avait-elle le
                        droit d’accepter la démission d’un elu du peuple uniquement parce qu’il
                        réclamait ’admission des conseillers municipaux aux séances de la Délégation
                        ? </p>
                    <p>Non, certes. Et. le bon sens le plus élémentaire le démontre en l’absence
                        même d’un texte : la Délégation n’est autre que le mandataire de la
                        Commission et à ce titre de mandant celle-ci a évidemment droit de contrôle
                        sur son mandataire. Mais le texte existe d’ailleurs qui donne aux
                        conseillers ce droit de contrôle. Il ne pent être plus explicite “Tout
                        membre de la Commission peut à tout moment prendre connaissance, dans le-
                        bureau meme de la Délégation, de toutes pièces dont il a fait la demande au
                        secrétaire.” On oppose, il est vrai, l’art. 36, ainsi conçu : “La Délégation
                        pourra inviter à ses réunions tout membre de la commission , ou toute autre
                        personne qu’elle croira utile pour avoir des renseignements ou des
                        éclaircissements”. Mais de ce que la Délégation peut inviter à assister à
                        ses séances, cela ne veut pas dire qu’elle peut empêcher d’exercer 5/16, le
                        cours a clôturé à 2 9/32.On a fait plus un contrôle, lorsque, surtout il y a
                        un texte Nombreuses transactions également en Sait explicite qui l’autorise. </p>
                    <p>Quoiqu’il en soit, la Commission, par son vote du 1er mare dernier, a' décidé
                        qu’aucun membre étranger à la Délégation n’avait le droit d’assister aux
                        séances de celle-ci. </p>
                    <p>Est-ce bien la Commission qui a décidé cela ! N’est-ce pas plutôt la
                        Délégation elle-même ! </p>
                    <p>Si des dix-huit conseillers qui étaient présents à la séance du 1er mare nous
                        déduisons les membres de la Délégation, il restait 9 voix seulement, dont
                        deux ont protesté et une s’est abstenue. Ce sont donc en définitive six
                        membres indépendants contre trois qui ont accepté la démission d’un de leurs
                        collègues. Ce vote est donc nul de plein droit, comme ayant eu lieu sans le
                        quorum nécessaire. </p>
                    <p>Il était de rigueur, en effet, d’exclure du vote les membres de la
                        Délégation, comme directement intéressés dans l’affaire. L’article 28 du
                        décret est catégorique à cet égard : "Les membres de la Commission ne
                        peuvent prendre part à des délibérations relatives aux affaires dans
                        lesquelles ils ont intérêt, soit en leur nom personnel soit comme
                        mandataires.” On ne pourrait imaginer rien de plus précis. La Délégation ne
                        veut pas de contrôle. M. Alderson en exige un et propose à cet effet
                        l’admission des conseillers aux séances de la Délégation. </p>
                    <p>Celle-ci, étant directement intéressée dans la question, n’avait donc pas le
                        droit de voter. En le faisant elle a violé la loi. </p>
                    <p>En admettant même qu’il n’y ait pas eu de texte de loi explicite pour
                        empêcher la Délégation de prendre part au vote, la question était de celles
                        qu’il n’appartient pas plus à la Commission qu’à la Délégation de trancher.
                        Cest au Gouvernement à interpréter ses décrets et en L'occurrence il était
                        autant sinon plus indiqué de s’adresser à lui que dans la question des
                        maisons ouvrières. L’article 33 du décret le dit formellement : “Les lois,
                        décrets ou règlements ne peuvent faire l’objet des délibérations de la part
                        de la Commission Municipale. Les mesures prescrites par les lois, décrets et
                        règlements, ou par arrêtés ministériels sont applicables purement et
                        simplement.” </p>
                    <p>Le texte de loi, qui donne à tout membre de la Commission le droit de prendre
                        connaissance à tout moment dans le bureau même de la Délégation de toutes
                        les pièces qu’il juge à propos, lui donné à plus forte raison celui
                        d’assister aux séances à simple titre consultatif. La loi est donc claire,
                        Messieurs les délégués ; il n’y a qu’à l’appliquer. </p>
                    <p>Lorsqu’un collègue en réclame l’application, Vous l’acculez à la
                        démission—mais le Gourer-renient , qui a reconnu au public un droit de
                        Contrôle sur les affaires municipales (voir le rapport de Lord Cromer), ne
                        voudra pas sanctionner une décision qui refuse ce droit à un élu du peuple —
                        décision d’aillenrs contraire à la loi et aux règlements. Z. </p>

                    <p>Le 8 octobre 1903, ce dernier publiait un long article sur les théâtres où il
                        était dit entre autres “Le théâtre de l’Abbassieh eu état de faillite ferme
                        ses portes ces jours-ci.” </p>

                        en écrivant “que le mot faillite n’avait pas été employé dans son sens

                    <p>Se référant aux conclusions de la défense, la Cour déboute l’appelant de sa
                        demande et le condamne aux frais. Elle estime que l’erreur commise était
                        sans conséquence dommageable, qu’elle était dégagée de toute intention mal
                        veillante et que d’ailleurs elle se trouvait suffisamment réparée par
                        l’insertion de la rectification. </p>

                    <p>Le marché des valeurs a débuté faible ce matin, mais plus tard, la confiance

                    <p>C’est l’Investment qui a eu les honneurs de la matinée. Après avoir fluctué

                    <p>Le reste du marché a été à peu près insigni- fiant : la Daïra remonte,
                        cependant, a 25/8 et la Delta Light à 14 1/2. </p>

                    <head>THE RAILWAY COMMISSION. </head>
                    <p>TEXT OF THE REPORT. </p>
                    <p>(Continued). </p>
                    <p>PORT OF ALEXANDRIA. </p>
                    <p>We have had the advantage of conferences with the members of the Chamber of
                        Commerce of Alexandria, the chief merchants of that city, the Port and
                        Customs Authorities, as well as with those responsible for the working of
                        the railways. </p>
                    <p>After considering carefully the whole of the evidence laid before us, we are
                        of opinion that the Administration of the Port of Alexandria should be
                        separated from that of the Railways, though of course some common action
                        will be necessary under any scheme, for working of harbour lines traffic and
                        the harbour station. </p>
                    <p>But port business qua shipping is not railway business proper ; it is very
                        technical and difficult, and appears to us to withdraw the attention of the
                        Administrators from the essential functions of the railway—which is to move
                        passengers and goods. </p>
                    <p>From the figures laid before us, it appéars absolutely necessary to extend
                        the shipping facilities of Egypt in some way or, if the railways are not to
                        continue in a state of chronic block, but it has been impossible for us to
                        decide whether this could be done at. once by employing more lighters at
                        Alexandria, by extension of the quays, or by the opening of other ports. </p>
                    <p>It would need more knowledge than we possess, and much closer investigation
                        of the whole position than is possible for us in the time available, to
                        recommend any particular scheme, but we reiterate our opinion that some
                        relief at the ports is of vital necessity. </p>
                    <p>If the figures laid before us are accurate, there can be no doubt that money
                        spent to effect this object will be financially justified, entirely apart
                        from the proposed Railway Loan. As a temporary relief we think that part, at
                        any rate, of the large wharf allocated to the railway and other coal in the
                        very centre of the Port of Alexandria might be given up, and much coal be
                        stacked further inland. </p>
                    <p>In concluding our general remarks it may be interesting to give certain
                        comparisons with the Report of the Commission on the Egyptian State Railways
                        made in 1887, the figures being reduced to pence per mile. </p>
                    <p>1st class ; 2nd class ; 3rd class</p>
                    <p>1887... ... ... ... ... 1.85 ; 1.23 Lower Egypt 0.7 1/2</p>
                    <p>Upper Egypt 0.6</p>
                    <p>1904(1 to 50 kilom.) ... 2.0 1.0 All Egypt 0.50</p>
                    <p>This table shows that in 2nd and 3rd class fares, which constitute nearly 90%
                        of the total, there has been a very sensible reduction of tariff. For longer
                        distances the reduction is even greater, but as the average distance
                        travelled in Egypt is only 29 miles, the above figures are fairly accurate. </p>
                    <p>In 1887 the 3rd class passengers earned about 2l% of the total gross receipts
                        of the railway, in 1903 they earned 27.5 per cent. </p>
                    <p>In 1887 the 3rd class passengers formed 80 per cent, of the total numbers :
                        in 1903 they form 90 per cent. The figures show at any rate that this
                        traffic is very valuable, and we have elsewhere expressed our opinion that
                        it is even yet capable of increase. </p>
                    <p>Per open mile the gross passenger receipts in 1887 were L.E.482, in 1903 they
                        reached L.E. 700. </p>
                    <p>We desire to add that the punctuality of the passanger service has greatly
                        improved, and, considering the long lengths of single line, the lack of
                        fences, and the fair speed of passenger trains, it may be considered as
                        remarkably good.</p>
                    <p>The gross receipts per goods train mile in 1887 were 9s/11d, in 1903 9s/9d ;
                        and per open mile L.E. 827 and L.E. 928 respectively. in the interval very
                        considerable reductions in rates have been made, which accounts for the
                        figures not showing even greater improvement. </p>

                    <head>THE NILE FENS.</head>
                    <p>BY D. G. HOGARTH.</p>
                    <p>The fenland of the Nile is not visited by the thousands who seek their
                        pleasure winter by winter in Egypt. As they enter from Alexandria a corner
                        of it slips by as the train gathers speed for the run to Damanhour, and all
                        the later wonders of the valley seldom efface that first impression of the
                        Delta—the long vista of level mere under the sunset, and copper-green fields
                        and anthill villages outlined against an amber sky. The contrary corner can
                        be seen from a hurricane-deck between Port Said and Ismailia, where the
                        silent stretches of marsh open on the right hand, relieved by flocks of
                        long-legged birds which wade far out, or trail like wisps of smoke across
                        the sun. But that is all the tourist sees. He never leaves the beaten tracks
                        to explore the Fens, and no one since Heliodorus has described anything but
                        the fringe of them. </p>
                    <p>A LAND APART. </p>
                    <p>They form a land apart from the rest of Egypt, very difficult to penetrate or
                        to traverse even by boat, and inundated by stagnant Waters of the great
                        river, which are dammed by a broad belt of dunes, and contaminated with
                        drainage of salt soils and the insetting sea. On the seaboard itself lies an
                        almost continuous chain of vast lagoons, and tor a long day's journey south
                        of these the land will still be found deep marsh, rotten with the
                        overflowing of disused canals and lost arms of the Nile, almost trackless,
                        and only now beginning to undergo here and there the first process of
                        reclamation. </p>
                    <p>THE FEN FELLAH. </p>
                    <p>In their present state, as might be expected, the fens have very few
                        inhabitants ; and perhaps none of the sparse settlements, now found within
                        their southern fringe, are much older than the nineteenth century. For
                        almost without exception these have grown up round isolated farmsteads, and
                        still bear the names of local owners of land who were living far to
                        southward not above a generation or two ago. When the Egyptian population
                        under the rule of the last Mameluke Beys was not the half of its present
                        figure, there was little temptation to attempt the conquest of saline and
                        water-logged soils ; and local tradition remembers a not distant epoch—not
                        more distant than Mohamed Ali’s day—when all the district was a secure, if
                        uncomfortable, refuge for the broken men who would avoid the tax-gatherer
                        and the conscription-officer had deserted from the battalions that the
                        inexorable Pasha was for ever sending to the conquest of Arabia, the Sudan,
                        or Syria, The repute of the northern marshes remained what it had been in
                        the filth century after Christ, when Heliodorus described, in the opening
                        scene of his </p>
                    <p>'AETHIOPIC ROMANCE,’</p>
                    <p>an amphibious outlawed society living there by fishing and raiding ; and some
                        trace of this state of things is still to be discerned in the timid and
                        farouche manner which characterises even now the inhabitants of the few
                        older hamlets. Here alone in modern Egypt fellahi women habitually bar the
                        outer door at sight of a stranger, and children run to hide among the reeds
                        or brushwood, and even grown men met in the way, hold aloof like Bedawis
                        till informed of your character and purpose. Although the animal is
                        certainly not now to be found there, many natives asserted to me that they
                        had seen the wild boar in past years, and twice I came on traditions even of
                        the hippopotamus, traditions held by simple men, who can hardly have derived
                        them from foreign sources. And why not from their fathers ? For there is
                        historical record of a hippopotamus having been killed in the Northern Delta
                        in 1818. </p>
                    <p>ANCIENT PROSPERITY. </p>
                    <p>Despite, however, the discouraging face of feu has not always been the
                        desolation it now is ; and it was the knowledge that it had had a more
                        populous past which took me there in the spring of 1903. The maps of it, all
                        imperfect and sketchy as they are, show a number of ill-defined spots whose
                        names are prefaced by kum or tell, sure indication of sites of ancient
                        towns. For the past three years there has been found in Crete proof on proof
                        of communication with Egypt, and where better than in the Northern Delta
                        should its traces be sought beyond the sea ? To be sure nothing reminiscent
                        of Ægean culture had been found in the Lower Delta up to that time; but
                        there remained this unexplored marsh-land, I looked up the authorities. They
                        supplied nothing, not even a mediæval or modern description of the region.
                        All travellers had passed it by and betaken themselves to the higher valley.
                        So I had to go, as to an unknown land, and see for myself ; and, if in the
                        event the things I had hoped to find were not forthcoming, others appeared
                        by the way which I had not been led to expect. To visit the marsh land you
                        may leave the </p>
                    <p>‘BERARI' RAILWAY,</p>
                    <p>which traverses mid-Delta from Dessouk on the one Nile to Sherbin on the
                        other, at any point, but preferably at Kafres Sheikh or Belkas, for thence
                        roads have been made northward towards the limit of habitation. That is soon
                        reached so far as the great flats are concerned, lying between the three or
                        four main waterways, which are old Nile-arms. But along the farther course
                        of these a few tiny clusters of huts maybe seen to northward. Lower Delta
                        hamlet are built up of mud into such fantastic pepper pot forms as will
                        throw off the frequent rains of the Delta, and, seen afar, suggest nothing
                        so ranch as structures of gigantic building insects. Thereafter nothing lies
                        ahead but the great saline flats, upon which vision is limited only by the
                        curvature of the earth. Their monotonous surface is varied by great tracts
                        of inundation, which dry slowly as the spring ad vances, leaving broad
                        plains reticulated like a crocodile’s hide, and always most treacherous
                        where seeming most dry ; for under their thin </p>

                    <p>superficial cake of mud, white with efflorescent salts, lie depths of black
                        saturated sand. . Elsewhere the level is broken by soapy sand-hummocks,
                        heaped round and over shrubs or clumps of reeds ; and among these pool
                        succeeds to slough and slough to pool, and the going for many miles is, at
                        best, worse than that on loose chalk-land at the breaking of a long frost.
                        There is a </p>
                    <p>SENSATION OF DEATH</p>
                    <p> in all this spongy land, which exudes water and salt round your heel ; and
                        nothing serves to dispel it—not the many birds, shocking in their tameness
                        as the beasts seen by Alexander Selkirk ; not the myriad insects which
                        assail the traveller who is luckless enough to ride down-wind ; not the
                        teeming life of the ditches ; not the half-wild buffaloes, strayed from
                        southern farmsteads, which you may startle from their wallows and send
                        soughing knee-deep through the slime ; not even that vivifying force of
                        Egypt, the ruffling north wind, tirelessly bowing the strident reeds. Yet
                        with all its monotony and deadness the land exhilarates the traveller ; for
                        the breeze blows hard and clear off the sea and the salt lagoons to
                        northward—hard and clear, in Stevenson’s phrase, as through the rigging of a
                        ship—and the flats have the mysterious attraction which is common to all
                        great levels of free horizon. (To be continued). </p>

                    <head>THE COTTON MARKET. </head>
                    <p>Kearsley and Cunningham’s Weekly Report. </p>
                    <p>Liverpool, 23 Fébruary. The amount of business in Egyptian cotton has been
                        very limited this week, prices however, in sympathy with Futures, are 1/8
                        per lb. dearer for both Brown and Upper Egyptian. Spinners report the Yam
                        Market as very unsatisfactory. </p>
                    <p>In Futures a moderate business has been done; the. following are the closing
                        quotations:-Feb. 6.62 Apl. 6.44 June 6.36 Aug. 6.32 Mar. 6.52 May. 6.38 July
                        6.33 Nov. 6.23 </p>
                    <p>AMERICAN FUTURES. The Market this week has been fairly active, and prices at
                        one time showed a material advance, but subsequently a sharp reaction
                        occurred, and to-day’s closing values are only 2 @4 points above those of
                        last Thursday. The chief features have been the contracted light movements
                        of the crop,and a fresh very large business in Manchester, where spinners
                        and manufacturers have sold their production for many months ahead. An
                        apparent possibility of peace in the near future between Russia and Japan
                        has also exercised a favorable influence; with, however, better better
                        weather conditions in the cotton area there are signs of an increased
                        movement to the ports ; if this should materialise we look lor a more
                        marked" reaction in prices, for today’s rates are still something like 1/2
                        per lb. higher than the lowest touched in December and January. — The latest

                    <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette. </p>
                    <p>Sir,—Will you please allow me space in your esteemed paper to bring to the
                        notice of the authorities the very great inconvenience, annoyance, and loss
                        of time and money caused to visitors and the public through the former
                        sending telegrams, and asking for replies, on which no signatures or address
                        is appended. At the bottom of the telegraph forms there is printed
                        “Signature of Sender” and “Address,” so naturally enough visitors believe
                        that in writing the details there, the same would appear on their telegrams,
                        and they, therefore, do not sign immediately under the text as well. The
                        telegraph forms should, in my opinion, contain a “Nota Bene” to the effect
                        that the sender is to sign his name and address under the text if he wishes
                        the same to be transmitted.—I am, etc., </p>

                    <head>THE KIDNEYS MAKE YOU UNFIT FOR WORK. </head>
                    <p>It is the constant strain of every-day duties that makes backache and lame
                        back for both men and women. The salespeople standing on their feet for
                        hours at a time, reaching to high shelves and lifting heavy rolls of goods ;
                        the housekeepers in the house, with their thousand-and-one duties crowding
                        upon them ; the women in the rush and bustle of business life — is it any
                        wonder that they get tired ? Is it any wonder that aching backs tell the
                        story of sick kidneys ? </p>
                    <p>The kidneys were never intended to stand hard strains. When they have more
                        work forced upon them than they can take care of, backache comes, and lame
                        back, headaches, rheumatism, irritable, nervous feelings, and distressing
                        urinary troubles. And after awhile, if help isn’t sent to the suffering
                        kidneys Diabetes, Dropsy, or the dreaded Bright’s Disease develops. </p>
                    <p>But there is a cure for every form of kidney trouble, a sure, never-failing
                        cure — Doan’s backache kidney pills — the one remedy that is absolutely
                        certain ; the one remedy that is for the kidneys and bladder only and that
                        does not purge the bowels. </p>
                    <p>Doan’s backache kidney pills are for sale by all chemists and druggists for
                        P.T. 13 per box, or P.T. 71 for 6 boxes ; or they may be had by post from
