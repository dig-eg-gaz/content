                    <p>Every telegram that arrives confirms more and more the completeness of the
                        Japanese victory. The capture of Admirals Rodjestvensky, Niebogatoff, and
                        Foelkersam, with thousands of prisoners, and the extraordinary way in which
                        the Japanese fleet has escaped scatheless from the might combat, serve to
                        show the thoroughness of Japan's naval success. It would be premature to
                        hazard a conjecture as to the immediate consequences of Admiral Togo's
                        prodigious victory. Even now the Tsar may hesitate to decide for peace,
                        while it is improbable that the revolutionary movement will become
                        immediately stronger than heretofore. But that the main issues of Saturday's
                        fight for the world at large will be enormous it is easy to foretell, and to
                        find a historical parallel we must go farther back than 1805, for such a
                        world-historical sea-fight deserves to be compared not with an international
                        combat such as was Trafalgar, but with an intercontinental event such as
                        Salamis. Even yet perhaps Europe scarecely recognises how prodigious an
                        influence this rise of a new Power on the edge of Asia, in the ocean which
                        must decade by decade increase in importance till its freedom will preoccupy
                        all maritime nations as the freedom of the Atlantic does now, will exercise
                        on her policy, her ambitions, and her commerce. Throw away all apprehensions
                        about the "yellow peril," leave China out of the calculation as sunk in
                        irredeemable dotage, assume Japan to stand alone, and still Europe has to
                        reckon with a Power which ten years hence will have twice Togo's fleet, and
                        which has proved that wherever she can land, an army double its strength
                        must be called out to render defeat of the defenders improbable. Of the
                        ideas, aspirations, and ultimate plans of that Power nothing, it may be
                        said, is known ; but of her capacities and her strength we now at least know
                        something. We know that she can keep a secret for years, that her people
                        will fight to the death at the word of command, that she has the European
                        belief in science, and that she counts among her statesmen and soldiers men
                        of the intellectual capacity to control and guide huge masses of trained men
                        to any end she has decided on. No King thinks that he can conquer Japan ; no
                        statesman imagines that he can set aside her vote in the Pacific or the
                        Indian Ocean as a negligible quantity. She may not govern China, but all the
                        long-devised European plans for gaining dominant influence in China or in
                        the Archipelago must, without her permission, be abandoned. No State can
                        hope to make of Kiaochow a capital, or to announce that the valley of the
                        Yangtze River is closed except to her own traders. The "open door" has a
                        terrible guardian, all Asia a potential advocate, whose voice if lifted, say
                        in protest that yellow men and white men must be treated alike, must at
                        least be heard.</p>
                    <p>Tremendous as the blow is to Russia, and far-reaching as its consequences
                        must be, we hesitate to believe that the Tsar, unless coerced by the
                        volutionary forces, will make peace. His army has apparently recovered from
                        the defeat at Mukden and doubtless he believes that the continuation of the
                        struggle, howbeit hopeless, will involve less danger for his dynasty than a
                        peace on severe terms. It will not shock the Army or paralyse diplomatic
                        action, and, besides, it evades some dangers. While there is no peace---
                        even if there be only an armed truce instead of a victory---no indemnity can
                        be asked for, and the thought of the indemnity galls the ruling group at St.
                        Petersburg as scarcely any territorial cession would do. The cession of
                        Manchuria, and the relinquishing of all claim to Korea, will not diminish
                        the resources of Russia, while the payment of a hundred millions will weaken
                        them further in their weakest place. Therefore the hopeless struggle will
                        continue indefinitely until the complete erosion of the established state of
                        things in Russia. The extraordinary rapidity with which events are passing
                        blind us to their real significance. Only a few months ago Russia seemed one
                        of the most formidable and deep-rooted of the Great Powers. After Great
                        Britain, she was the largest owner of the surface of the blobe. Her vast
                        land possessions</p>
                    <cb n="6"/>
                    <p>were on the eve of a development which was believed to be unparalleled in
                        modern history. She appeared to have gained her desire, a warm-water port,
                        and the commerce of the Far East was about to fall into her hands. Her
                        diplomacy was dreaded by all, and seemed to have been crowned with a
                        singular success. To the ordinary spectator she appeared to have been
                        pursuing for generations one policy, biding her time in patience, and
                        striking relentlessly when the moment arrived. Russia, we were told, was the
                            <hi rend="italic">beau ideal</hi> of an Imperial Power. She had no
                        captious democracy, no critical and independent Press, to tie her hands or
                        compromise the continuity of her work. Her great bureaucracy were inspired
                        by a single aim, and passed it on unweakened to their successors. Her
                        methods, to be sure, were somewhat Machiavellian, for her conscience was not
                        bound by promises, and the policy of encroachment had been raised by her to
                        the rank of a fine art. But it seemed justified by its results, for other
                        nations grumbled but submitted, since there was believed to wait behind her
                        Ministers the glacier-like power of a resolute and undivided nation. It was
                        left to Japan to put this hypothesis to the test. Once upon a time, as the
                        story goes, a certain King rode out unclothed among his people, and the
                        obsequious crowds applauded the beauty of his Majesty's garments. But a
                        child who was watching suddenly cried out: "Why, he has nothing on!" and at
                        the word every one's eyes were opened, and the nation proceeded to revise
                        its constitution. Russian diplomacy has some resemblance to that Monarch. It
                        succeeded because no one dared to question it, but when the question came it
                        went down like a house of cards. It is strange that our democratic Western
                        world should so long have held its breath in admiration of a game of bluff
                        which, according to its creed, could have no intrinsic strength. The first
                        lesson for the spectator is that the day is past when success can be won
                        merely by military diplomacy. It needs only to be questioned to collapse,
                        and the issue is transferred to that other field on which the strength of a
                        people is more radically tested.</p>
                    <p>So also, with Russia's military and naval power. A few months ago she was
                        thought to have not only a splendid navy but the second or third finest Army
                        in the world, an Army trained on the most scientific lines, officered by
                        experts, and armed with the latest weapons. Being a military autocracy, it
                        was believed that she could make war with her whole soul, regardless of any
                        difficulties which a democratic regime might interpose in its conduct.
                        Numerically she vastly excelled her rival; she had more and better guns ;
                        she had greater available wealth ; and though she had to fight six thousand
                        miles from her capital, yet she had so developed Eastern Siberia and
                        Manchuria as to have created an advanced base cloes to the enemy. In Port
                        Arthur she had an impregnable fortress, fortified with a strength and
                        ingenuity hitherto unknown in war. She had a larger navy than Japan, and an
                        indefinite capacity for increasing it which was denied to the other.
                        Morever, she was a military Power of old experience ; she had generals
                        trained under Skobeleff ; while Japan was in war a <hi rend="italic"
                            >parvenu</hi>, with no record behind her save a trivial contest with
                        China. What has been the result of the past sixteen months! The Russian
                        soldiers have fought with all their traditional courage and obstinacy, and
                        more than one of their leaders have shown high qualities of generalship.
                        Russia is still a great military Power, but the prestige is gone. Japan has
                        succeeded by science, intelligence, a purer patriotism, and therefore a more
                        indomitable spirit. The materialism which had been creeping over Western
                        Europe, the creed which believed only in great armaments and big battalions,
                        has, we believe, received a shattering blow. Victory in war, as in other
                        things, falls to the stronger spirit.</p>
                    <p>In Russia herself wer are faced with the same disillusionment. A year ago men
                        spoke of her as an impregnable bureaucracy, under competent administration,
                        broadly based upon popular acquiescence. Liberalism in Russia, we were told,
                        was a vain thing, since nobody wanted it. The semi-divine prestige of the
                        Tsar was the keystone of the Constitution, and this personal loyalty,
                        combined with the well-known Slav fatalism and patience, would make her in
                        war a crusading Power of irresistible strength. Afew months' war gives us no
                        proof of such assurances. We find no such fire of patriotism as inspires the
                        armies of Oyama ; the Russian fights splendidly, but as a machine, with a
                        dull and homesick fidelity. We find, on the contrary, a growing antipathy
                        towards the war, based upon the terrible demands made upon the people in
                        life and property. Were the nation really roused, all such grievances would
                        be forgotten in the patriotism which desired above all things to win battles
                        for its country. But the nation is not at war at all, but only its
                        Government ; and since that Government has no part in the national life, the
                        Russian people look upon the contest as a gladiatorial combat which does not
                        really concern time, though they are called to sacrifice their all in the
                        arena. At the same time, the people are awakening to self consciousness, and
                        are struggling in the throes of a new life. The strikes in every province,
                        the St. Petersburg massacre, the petitions of the educated classes, are
                        serious enough in themselves, but their significance is not an isolated
                        thing. The war has been a chemical process, and from the crucible there
                        seems to be emerging a new national spirit. Will the destruction of the
                        fleet force the Tsar and his incompetent bureaucracy to resist the claims of
                        this new national force? They may, but it will go hardly with Russia if they
                        do. For they will continue to wage war, while the Russian people will
                        continue to look on ; and it is very clear that only when the national
                        spirit is in arms can a nation win victories.</p>

                    <p>Tokio, May.30.</p>
                    <p>Despatches from Admiral Togo show that immediately the news was received that
                        the Russians had been sighted, early on Saturday morning, the combined
                        Japanese squadrons started the attack. The weather was line but a heavy sea
                        was running. The enemy was encountered near Okoshima Island to the
                        south-eastwards ot Tsu-Shima. The Russians were defeated and several ships
                        were sunk, comprising, according to prisoners captured subsequently, the
                        “Borodina," the “Emperor Alexander III," “Zemtchug,” and three others. The
                        damage to the Japanese fleet is insignificant.</p>
                    <p>The destroyer and torpedo flotillas delivered the attack after sunset. The
                        main Japanese force continued the pursuit and attacked, on Sunday to the
                        north eastwards of Okoshima, a group consisting of the “Imperator Nicholas
                        I,” the “Orel,” “Admiral Seniavin,” “Admiral Apraxen,” and “lzumrud.” The
                        “lzumrud" withdrew but the remaining ships of the force surrendered. The
                        Japanese fleet was undamaged. Admiral Niebogatoff and 2,000 prisoners were
                        taken. All other vessels which Admiral Togo reports as sunk or captured are
                        from reports of commanders not under his immediate command, who captured
                        over 1,000 prisoners. It is not clear whether the names given include three

                        to be known as “Egypt, Limited," we hear that the biggest New York issuing
                        house is one of the largest guarantors in connection with the two million
                        pounds mortgage bank, which Egypt, Limited, intends floating.</p>
                    <p>The land of which Egypt, Limited, has the refusal is estimated to yield ton
                        per cent. on the total capitalisation of the company for fifteen years. At
                        the end of this period Egypt, Limited, will have assets worth over £750,000,
                        or, in other words, three times the capitalisation of the company.</p>
                    <p>Egyptian Options has a new Egyptian oompany on the cards, connected with the
                        acquisition of land near Damietta. This company is taking offices both in
                        Alexandria and in Cairo.</p>
                    <p>In October or November next, the British-Egypt Syndicate, Limited, will
                        appear on the scene. This syndicate will promote a company with a
                        capitalisation of £200,000 to be called Egyptian Industries, Limited. The
                        board will comprise at least two well-known names connected with banking in
                        London. The larger portion of the capital of the British Egyptian Syndicate
                        has already been subscribed in Egypt.</p>
                    <p>In order to compensate for the recent loss of Mr. Charles Cammell, one of the
                        directors of the Egyptian Trust and Investment, Limited, his son-in-law, Mr.
                        H. W. Wilson, nephew of Sir Alexander Wilson, has consented to join the
                        board of Egypt, Limited. This gentleman is one of the directors of Messrs.
                        Cammell, Laird and Company, who built one of Admiral Togo’s battleships
                        which contributed to the recent victory in the Korean Straits.</p>
                    <p>By way of diversion to the various land, trust, and bank companies, which are
                        now being floated wholesale for the sake of developing Egypt, it is not out
                        of the way to mention a great company, which is to find gold in the
                        Mediterranean sea off Alexandria, and which is to be floated in London. This
                        company will work the continuous gold-finding process, invented by Mr.
                        Snell. This promotion is being made after careful investigation by such
                        well-known scientific men as Professor Sir William Ramsay, F.R.D., Professor
                        Liversedge, Mr. N. D. Littlefield, and F. S. Rawson, C.E.M.I.E.E. It is
                        estimated that every ton of sea water yields about half a grain of gold. The
                        working expenses are only about 25 per cent. of that. When this company
                        starts at Alexandria the shareholders will always be able to inspect the
                        working, which will be carried on night and day.</p>
                    <p>A correspondent writes :—</p>
                    <p>It is sincerely to be hoped that the Egyptian investor will bo careful in his
                        selection of new companies to place his savings in. I cannot understand why
                        the Egyptian Government and Lord Cromer do not stop the wild speculation.
                        Lord Cromer paid so much attention to safeguarding the interests of both the
                        Egyptian and foreign investors in connection with the promotion of mining
                        companies in Egypt and the Sudan, that he is not likely to countenance the
                        indiscriminate flotation of an enormous amount of limited liability
                        companies connected with Egypt, when it is a notorious fact that in many
                        oases these companies are being launched without any genuine, definite
                        object The name of Baring bears such a high reputation in the city of London
                        that one word of caution from his lordship would be enough to guide the
                        careless investor in regard to the prospects of many of the companies now
                        being placed wholesale before the public.</p>

                    <p>The case of brigandage at Biahmo in the Fayoum, which occurred on the night
                        of the 5th May and of which full reports have been given in the “Egyptian
                        Gazette,” is still the subject of official inquiry.</p>
                    <p>The latest reports which have been received by the Ministry of the Interior
                        inform us that the evidence pointed to certain natives of Nawamis village,
                        Beni Souef Moudirieh, being guilty of the crime and to part of the stolen
                        property being in their possession. The police officials therefore proceeded
                        to this village and arrested the suspected men. On searching their houses
                        and those of their relatives the police found some of the jewellery which
                        had been stolen, and which was identified by the victim of the attack, as
                        belonging to him.</p>
                    <p>During the inquiry one of Said Suliman’s (the victim’s) women-servants
                        identified one of the men who had been arrested, and declared that he had
                        called her out when the theft was being committee. The wife of another of
                        the accused persons, in whose possession some of the stolen goods had been
                        found, confessed that these were her husband’s share of the spoil, and also
                        named seven of the arrested men (13 in all) and affirmed that they had been
                        with her husband when the goods had been divided.</p>
                    <p>It further transpired that another of the accused had met a silversmith who
                        pays visits to the villages of these parts to buy old jewellery and that he
                        had offered to sell some of the stolen jewellery to this man.</p>
                    <p>The omdeh of the village deposed that some of the accused were absent from
                        their homes on the night of the crime. Furthermore, one of the villagers, in
                        giving evidence, said that he and his wife were walking towards the village
                        from the Fayoum they saw several of the accused walking in the direction of
                        Biahmo.</p>
                    <p>The charge is evidently well established against most of the accused men, and
                        but little doubt of their guilt remains. The inquiry is still being
                        continued, and it is hoped that further evidence will reveal the guilt of
                        the arrested band and furnish information which will lead to the rest of the
                        stolen property being recovered.</p>

                        International Judicial Commission are being blocked by the representatives
                        of Denmark and Spain. These countries have an infinitesimal interest and

                        Alexandria Municipality, who is of course of Syrian origin. The interests of
                        Denmark in Egypt are as unimportant as those of Spain. The cantankerous
                        conduct of the representatives of these Powers in blocking measures on which
                        England, France, and other Great Powers are in accord is a striking and

                    <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                    <p>Dear Sir, — In your issue of yesterday "Humanitarian” protests against the
                        creation of a pigeon shooting club on the grounds of the Alexandria Sporting
                        Club, urging that the sport is a cruel one, and one that is being abandoned
                        in England chiefly owing disapprobation of Queen Alexandra.</p>
                    <p>Might I be allowed to point out, firstly, that we are not in England, and
                        secondly, that there are many members of the Sporting Club who are not
                        English, and who consequently have other ideas on the subject In Spa and
                        Ostend and Monte Carlo any Englishman who protested against the existence of
                        the famous pigeon clubs there would scarcely obtain a hearing. Why, then,
                        should the non-English members of Alexandria be prevented from shooting
                        pigeons, and in what way is pigeon shooting more cruel than running a fox to
                        death with a pack of hounds or setting two greyhounds after a miserable hare
                        ? — Yours obediently, “Pigeon.”</p>
                    <p>Alexandria, May 30.</p>
                    <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                    <p>Sir,—I should like to call your attention to one aspect of this question
                        which has not been touched upon in the two letters yon have published.
                        Potting aside the purely humanitarian point of view, is it fair to
                        introduce, for the amusement of a small minority, a “sport” which cannot be
                        earned on without destroying the pleasure and enjoyment of a large
                        propor-tion of the members ? Speaking for myself (and probably most other
                        lady members will agree with me), I could certainly no longer go there with
                        any pleasure when the shooting is taking place, knowing as I should that
                        every report would mean the death knell of some poor little bird, or still
                        worse, that it should flutter about wounded, to be finally caught and
                        tortured, as it certainly would be in this country. Some may disagree with
                        me and think that it is mere sentimentality to condemn pigeon shooting, but
                        at any rate there can be no excuse for introducing it into a general club
                        such as the Sporting— practically the only general recreation ground in
                        Alexandria—especially in view of the fact that there are already other
                        places in the neighbourhood where people can indulge in this form of “sport"
                        without giving pain to others.</p>
                    <p>Finally, I should like to know whether this question is to be decided by the
                        committee without any reference to the opinions of the members as a body ?—I

                    <head type="item"><hi rend="italic">(Continued from Saturday.)</hi></head>
                    <p>A large part of the work of every Medical Mission is carried on among
                        out-patients, and to afford a glimpse of that branch of the work let me
                        quote from one of our nurses who has charge of the nursing in the
                        out-patients department. After mentioning two reasons for dwelling in
                        Egypt--primarily, to preach the Gospel, secondarily, to heal the sick--she
                        goes on to say : "If time and space permitted, we could tell you much that
                        would interest you. Many hundreds have this year received healing at the
                        hands of our doctors, while others have been less fortunate, disease only
                        offering a steady resistance to all treatment. We have had during the hot
                        weather some anxious cases in the village. I was asked by the doctor go to a
                        house where a little boy was lying seriously ill with acute pneumonia. The
                        friends, as is so often the case, preferred to let the patient lie in a heap
                        on the floor rather than disturb him, to administer anything the doctor may
                        have ordered. I meant only to stay a short time, but the day wore on and I
                        saw that there would be no chacne for the recover if left to the friends. I
                        went away at 9 p.m. after seeing our faithful Sudanese nurse installed by
                        his side for the night. Thus we continued for ten days, but although
                        everything possible was done night and day, the child eventually died. It
                        was with sorrowful hearts that Gameela and I left the house at one early
                        dawn. The last night of vigil was a sad one as we vainly watched for the
                        least sign of improvement. The hour before dawn arrived when the mosque was
                        overlpooking the patient's house was dimly lighted and a hopeless kind of
                        voice winged through the air the call to prayer, reminding the Moslem world
                        of their allegiance to the Faith, which, according to their belief, is to
                        reign supreme when all other creeds fail. The window of the room in which
                        this poor little suffering form lay commanded a view of the interior of the
                        mosque, and you can imagine how we wrestled in prayer for the recovery of
                        the child, the healing of whom we, in our ignorance, felt was to bring glory
                        to God---but He ordered otherwise, and the result of our work is yet to be
                        seen.</p>
                    <p>"Here in Old Cairo, during the summer months we go on from day to day with a
                        temperature akin to a nice warm oven, and oh! how dirty the people are. An
                        old woman is crouched down before me, the personification of dirt. She holds
                        firmly to her lowly seat upon the floor, saying : "I will not leave this
                        spot until I have given you the history of my life." The history, which we
                        already well know, is prefaced by a few remarks such as : "I beseech you to
                        be careful." "Lighten the weight of your hand upon my wound." "I am very
                        needy." "Yes, my sister, your greatest need at the present moment is a
                        bath." "A bath!" exclaims the old lady. "Why do you wish my spirit to leave
                        my body so soon? I should die at once." "Now take this piece of paper to the
                        window from which you took your number, and you will receive in return a
                        bottle of "eye-drops." Use them as I have told you and be sure you don't
                        forget the bath." With this parting injunction, she passes out through one
                        door, but only to creep in through another, crying out : "Oh lady! lengthen
                        your patience. It is very necessary that you have patience, for does not the
                        healing of my eye depend upon the use I make of the contents of this bottle?
                        What am I to do with it?" Then again the same instructions must be given, in
                        spite of the fact that a crowd of eye-operations are waiting to be dressed,
                        and there are many more patients to follow from the waiting room."</p>
                    <p>The excellent work of our Armenian assistant, Dr. Abkar Dermarkarian, a
                        graduate of the Beyront medical school, deserves special mention. His sphere
                        of work lies in the eye department of our dispensary, and the fact that over
                        a thousand eye-operations have been performed at his hand during the past
                        twelve months gives some idea of the value of his services.</p>
                    <p>Throughout the history of the Old Cairo Medical Mission the treatment of
                        Egyptian anemia (anchylostomiasis) has been one of its leading features.
                        During the past year there has been a remarkable increase in the number of
                        these patients, which has risen to 1,253, more than doubling the number for
                        1903. All of these patients remain with us for a little over three weeks and
                        during that time receive regular daily instruction, while a magical lantern
                        service is held especially for them once a week. The minds of these people
                        are frequently very dense and ignorant, yet one has often been impressed,
                        especially at the lantern addresses, by their attention and evident
                        appreciation of the Gospel messages.</p>
                    <p>Reference has been made to the payment of fees by patients. Perhaps this
                        needs some explanation :– The "fellaheen" have become relatively so
                        "well-off" under equitable rule that it has of late years become
                        increasingly plain that the only right course is to charge patients a small
                        fee for medicine and operations in the dispensary, and food and treatment in
                        hospital, except of course in cases of real poverty. In spite of a gradual
                        increase in these fees, far more have come for admission, and so much so,
                        that, although a fee of over £1 is not often paid, we have this year, as was
                        mentioned above, been able to meet all expenses of upkeep, and to have a
                        balance in hand. Of course we cannot be said to be "self-supporting" while
                        the missionaries are supported from "home," and in view also of the initial
                        outlay, and heavy expenses without return, in previous years. While we send
                        those are very well off to be treated privately by English physicians or

                        the Government Medical School, but also right from the point of view to the
                        subscribers to the society's funds. Morever in regard to the missionary
                        aspect of the work we may say that, numbers having gone up by leaps and
                        bounds, the Gospel has been preached to far more hearers.</p>
                    <p>It would, I suppose, be difficult to find another labouring class so well off
                        as is that of Egypt now, and so we are able to do what is possible to few,
                        if any, other medical missions.</p>
                    <p>The number of patients attending dispensary has been altogether out of
                        proportion to the bed capacity of the hospital. Many whom it has been
                        impossible to turn away have had to be content with the floor, and many have
                        been refused admission for want of room. This lack of sufficient ward
                        accommodation has also caused serious inconvenience to doctors and nurses.
                        Thus the need for extra accommodation is urgent, but we are thankful to say
                        that it will be soon be supplied, for what has been dreamed of and longed
                        for throughout the ear will shortly be an accomplished fact---a new hospital
                        for women and children. This projected hospital which will set free all the
                        present accommodation for men, is to be built with funds specially
                        subscribed in memory of the life and work of the late Mrs. Pain, who died at
                        Old Cairo in December, 1903, and after whom it is to be named.</p>
                    <p>In issuing this account of the work we wish to take the opportunity of
                        thanking the English surgeons and physicians resident in Cairo for their
                        unfailing kindness, and the valuable professional help they most readily
                        have given us at various times ; and finally once cannot close without
                        striking a note of praise and thankfulness to God for the measure of success
                        He has granted in our medical work. More than once or twice prayer has been
                        answered in the case of patients whose condition seemed almost hopeless. May
                        He, who in His mercy has graciously restored the body in so many cases,
                        stretch out His hand of power in His own good time to heal many souls.</p>

                        <head type="sub">To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette</head>
                        <p>Dear Sir,––A few weeks ago the writer of "Under the Mosquito Net" alluded
                            to a remark I made to him to the effect that the American missionaries
                            in Egypt "do a lot of harm." Will you kindly allow me to explain what I
                            meant by saying this, otherwise a false impression may be created in the
                            minds of many people, who do not understand how these missionaries can
                            work harm. I will tell you. The intention of the Americans when they
                            commenced work in Egypt 50 years ago was to convert Mohamedans to
                            Christianity. They did not succeed, in fact they could not. So, as they
                            did not want to confess their failures and go back empty-handed, they
                            set to work to convert Copts! Now the Copts were as good Christians as
                            themselves, althought at that time they were much behind-hand in
                            education. Here was the missionaries' opportunity and they were quick to
                            seize it. But they have gone too far in their efforts to Westernise the
                            Copt, and Canon Oldfield has seen this as clearly as I do although,
                            perhaps, not being a Copt, he cannot feel so deeply about it as I do
                            myself. The Americans want to change the ancient Coptic form of worship
                            to that of Western Presbyterianism, taking no account of the fact that
                            the latter is totally unsuited to the Eastern mind, and so persistently
                            have they worked on those lines that those ducated by them now call
                            themselves Protestants, and take no interest in and give no help to
                            Coptic charities. This was very noticeable when the Coptic Patriarch was
                            collecting money for the Khartoum Cathedral. In my town many
                            "Protestants" (who were formerly Copts) refused to help, while in a near
                            village a Moslem lady gave L.E. 100! I repeat, the American missionaries
                            do a lot of harm, which is not any degree counterbalanced by the good
                            they do in other ways, such as educating the children, providing medical
                            necessities, and so on. I hope if attention is directed to this, that
                            the prejudice that unfortunately exists in the minds of some peopl
                            against the Coptic Egyptians may be removed, for an Unseen Hand has
                            undoubtedly preserved the Coptic Church through many centuries of bad
                            treatment and I feel sure that there is still a great future before it,
                            spite of all the attempts of the missionaries to reduce its influence,
                            if not to destroy it altogether. They cause divisions in families which
                            bring about great misery in many cases, and their treating the Copts as
                            if they were not already followers of Christ causes the Moslems to ask,
                            "How can the followers of one leader be so unfriendly and not in
                            sympathy with one another? Surely there must be something wrong
                            somewhere." For one of the great causes of the success of the Mohamedan
                            religion is the unity and love for one another that it teaches. Before
                            missions to Mohamedans can hope to succeed in Egypt the missionaries
                            must show that all sections of Christians are at one in Christ, and that
                            is what they have not hitherto done. Let them work <hi rend="italic"
                                >with</hi> the Copts instead of against them, and then there may be
                            some hope of their reaching the Moslems, and bringing them to see the
                            the beauty and power of the Christian religion.</p>

                        <head type="sub">To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</head>
                        <p>Dear Sir, --I am not often in the habit of trespassing upon your valuable
                            paper, and it is with reluctance I do so now, but I am forced to bring
                            to the notice of the public large, the disgraceful system which the
                            majority of the missionaries to the Jews who are sent here from Europe
                            adopt in order to convert the Jews to Christianity.</p>
                        <p>I have been a missionary to the Jews in Egypt for about 25 years and in
                            London for a good number of years previously, and am thoroughly
                            experienced with them, knowing their language and religion, their lives,
                            their good and bad habits, the latter of which predominate in the lower
                            classes, and I think that I have a right to speak to younger men who
                            have not had as much experience as myself, especially when I know them
                            to be in the wrong.</p>
                        <p>By <hi rend="italic">bribing</hi> the Jews with money they get them to
                            attend their meetings. The mere mention of money to poor men makes them
                            have an itching palm, and they say "where is your meeting?" They go and
                            listen, and if there are signs of more money to be had they get
                            converted to Christianity. Are they converted? Of course not, they will
                            be backsliders as soon as they leave the meeting, but they come back
                            again and get more money. In order to enrich themselves they sell the
                            Bibles which have been given to them (and which probably never have been
                            opened) ; they then go and join their intimate friends near the Fort
                            Napoleon, who are nearly all dealers in human flesh (commonly called
                            pimps), where they drink and play towla and dominoes, explaning to their
                            friends how they have made a fool of the Christian missionary who has,
                            instead of converting them to Christianity, only supplied them with
                            means to hasten them faster to the devil. But this is not the only
                            thing, the missionaries write home to their society stating what a grand
                            time they have had and how many converts they have made, for the more
                            they report the more money does the unfortunate society send out to them
                            to continue their progressive (?) work. This money is some of it
                            collected by little boys and girls belonging to the Sunday schools in
                            England who go from door to door, generally only getting halfpence and
                            pence, often in the coldest weather, risking their lives for the
                            purpose. This money is collected and sent out the foreign missionaries,
                            and see how it is wasted! absolutely thrown away in drink, and devoted
                            to a far different purpose than that for which it was collected. I
                            remember a Jew once coming to me begging for food and clothing as well
                            as lodging. As he was 70 years of age and seemed wretchedly poor I took
                            him in, after I had made certain enquiries as to where he had come from,
                            etc. I endeavoured to find him employment that would suit his years, and
                            during frequent conversations with him found he knew the Bible more
                            thoroughly than many missionaries whom I had come across. I asked him if
                            he was not a Christian, and he replied in the negative, stating that he
                            was a Russian Jew, but was desirous of being converted and baptised as a
                            Christian. I told him he had better wait a while and think it well over,
                            as I was not wishful for him to become a Christian and then return
                            immediately to be a Jew again. I never converted him, for he let slip
                            that he had already been baptised as a Christian years ago in the
                            Orthodox Church in Russia. He was endeavouring to obtain money from me
                            by becoming a Christian, but I knew all these little games too well to
                            be imposed upon. The rich Jews provide for their poor, as I think
                            everyone will know, consequently before these poor Jews are helped by
                            the Christians, the circumstances of the case should be thoroughly
                            looked into, and then food and clothing given, not money. The Jews have
                            one good hospital, where there are 5 or more doctors to attend to the
                            sick, and if any are too ill to attend, the doctors go to the patients'
                            houses, give them medicine, food, clothing, milk, pay their rent if they
                            cannot afford to do so, and all this gratis. The excuse given by the
                            missionaries by giving money to the Jews for attending their meetings is
                            charity! Is it charity when they give money (which in plain language is
                            a bribe) to be spent in drink, instead of education, food and clothing?
                            Not Christ's charity!</p>
                        <p>Another Jew came here from Jerusalem, who informed a worker that 9 years
                            ago he sold his religion and became a Christian, because he was informed
                            that the missionary would get him employment, which he did. When the
                            employment was finished he threatened preaching against Christianity.
                            Not a genuine convert, this. Time, trouble, money wasted, a situation
                            given as a bribe, and ridicule as a result. Such will always be the
                            result when a man does not get the true word of God in his heart, but
                            receives money only to say that he is a Christian and was converted at
                            such a place. One can hardly believe it, for it seems so outrageous, but
                            it is true, nevertheless. Such people only come for loaves and
                            fishes.</p>
                        <p>I could go on to multiply instances of this nature, but that I should
                            occupy too much of your valuable space. They all go to illustrate the
                            dodges practised in order to deceive the trusting missionaries, who, if
                            they are genuine, God-fearing men, must know in their own heart of
                            hearts that they are doing wrong. But they must show a result of their
                            work abroad, how their money has been spent ; and this is how it is
                            done. The people in England do not know under what circumstances the
                            money is spent and think the missionaries out here, judging by the
                            reports of the converts and promises of converts, are remarkably clever.
                            What a delusion!</p>
                        <p>When Jews have told me at what price they have been bought to change
                            their religion (which is never really changed) and I have seen how the
                            money was spent, I as a Christian have been ashamed of my co-workers.
                            They make an exhibition of themselves, and a laughing</p>
                        <cb n="4"/>
                        <p>stock of their religion. I bear offeence to no man ; I am writing this ––
                            and for the truth of every word I can vouch –– for the benefit of the
                            young missionaries to the Jews who perhaps may think they have been
                            acting for the best, but they could not further the progress of real
                            work <hi rend="italic">less</hi> than they have been doing. Let them now
                            change their method, and let us all do our best to preach the Gospel of
                            Divine love in the way he would desire us to and to live such lives
                            ourselves that others may see that it is good to be one of us, who live
                            with and for the Lord.</p>

                    <head type="sub">PROFESSOR PETRIE'S REPORT</head>
                    <p>Prof. Fliners Petrie writes as follows to the "Times" :––</p>
                    <p>Sir, –– The earlier part of the work of this expedition, at Wady Maghara, has
                        been already stated in the "Times" (January 1905), but the later part of the
                        work at Sarabit el Khadem has proved much the longer and more important.
                        This temple is situated in the desert, at a distance of five days' camel
                        journey from Suez. Though discovered in the middle of the eighteenth
                        century, no visitors to this temple have stayed more than a day or two, and
                        scarcely any digging had been done in the ruins. The difficulties of
                        providing for a camp in so remote a wilderness had prevented serious work
                        there ; and it required a good deal of arrangement to keep a party of over
                        30 workers during several weeks that were occupied in the excavations and
                        copying. This work was undertaken for the Egypt Exploration Fund by myself
                        and party ; and after the excavating was finished Mr. Currelly made an
                        examination of the <hi rend="italic">nawqmis</hi> or beehive tombs of Sinai,
                        and also reopened the study of Pithom for the Egyptian Research Account.</p>
                    <p>The temple of Sarabit el Khadem –– "the heights of the fortress" stands on
                        the edge of a plateau, many hundreds of feet above the desert valley which
                        lies to the north of it. The whole plateau is deeply divided by precipitous
                        gorges, so that it is reduced to a row of tongues of land. To ascend the
                        plateau from its edge is difficult, and too tedious for daily work ; to live
                        on the plateau is impractical, as it is beyond the reach of camel transport
                        for water ; a valley was therefore chosen which winds gradually upward from
                        the south, and is not on any map or record hitherto made, though well known
                        to the Bedawin. At the head of this valley the camp was pitched ; and a
                        climb of a few hundred feet every day, up the natural staircase of the
                        sandstone mountain side, led the workers to the temple site.</p>
                    <p>The neighborhood was evidently sacred from early times. The ridge on which
                        the temple was built is crowded with stone pillars, both natural and
                        wrought, usually in connexion with a small shelter of rough stones. The
                        system of visiting sacred sites in order to obtain oracular dreams is
                        familiar in Syria, and extended to Asia Minor and Egypt. Such a dream was
                        commemorated by setting up a pillar as a memorial, of which a well-known
                        case is that in the story of Jacob. Thus these Bethel stones are found
                        usually in the stone shelter used by the pilgrim, which is sometimes a mere
                        wind-break of a few loose stones, and sometimes a tolerable wall. But in no
                        case are tehse shelters grouped together in the manner of huts for regular
                        habitation. Some of the pillars or Bethel stones have Egyptian inscriptions
                        of the XIIth dynasty, showing how early the system prevailed ; but most of
                        them are natural blocks set on end. Such a system is quite unknown in
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>The centre of worship here was a rock cave about 15ft. long and 9ft. wide,
                        which was dedicated by the Egyptians to the goddess Hathor, but that name
                        was commonly applied to any foreign goddess, and it is probably here a
                        substitute for a local divinity of the native tribes. This cave was found to
                        contain two large altars dedicated under Senusert III. and Amenemhat III. of
                        the XIIth dynasty. It had been supposed that this cave had been a tomb, as
                        there was an inscription for a high official on the side wall ; but the same
                        official inscribed the later of these two altars for the goddess, showing
                        that this cave was then a shrine. And it was usual for the high officials in
                        charge of the expeditions to place their names as prominently at those of
                        the Kings, on all the monuments here. The front of this cave was at the same
                        period covered with a facing of carved stone ; and a portico was added to
                        it, enclosed in front by a row of great steles. These steles, and about a
                        dozen more, were all records of the mining expeditions ; they are blocks of
                        the local sand stone, 8ft. to 12ft. high, bearing the date and Royal titles,
                        the names of the chief of the expedition and of his party, often up to 50 or
                        even to 100, and the totals of the soldiers, workmen, sailors, sculptors,
                        artists, smelters, &amp;c., who formed the expedition, together with the
                        lists of animals and provisions. These records will give a thorough view of
                        the arrangement of these expeditions, when they are analysed and
                        compared.</p>
                    <p>In front of this shrine was a great place of burnt offerings. Over more than
                        100ft. in length extended a bed of white ashes, up to a foot and a half
                        thick. No bones were found in this bed, but only some pieces of pottery,
                        which seem to be of the XIIth Dynasty. Such a great mass of burning is quite
                        unknown in Egyptian temples. Beside this some small cylindrical altars of
                        stone were found in the cave and in the court, one with burning on the top
                        of it ; probably these were for offering incense.</p>
                    <p>After this age, about a thousand years later, Thothmes III., and his
                        co-regent, Queen Hatshepsut, built much here, over the bed of burnt ashes. A
                        court for ablutions was added, having a stone basin in the midst and four
                        pillars around it, each with faces of the goddess Hathor. This court has
                        exactly the arrangement of the <hi rend="italic">hanafiyeh</hi> of a mosque,
                        and it shows that the mosque type is at least 2,000 years older that Mohamed
                        ; this is another instance of how the most prominent practices of Islam were
                        taken over from older customs. A later <hi rend="italic">hanafiyeh</hi>
                        court was added by Rameses IV. Of the same age are several courts and
                        chambers, and a pylon in Egyptian style which formed a front to the whole
                        group.</p>
                    <p>Later Kings gradually added a long line of chambers before the pylon.
                        Tahutmes IV., Amenhotep II. and III., Sety I., and Rameses II. all made
                        additions. These chambers were</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>all small, and apparently entirely roofed in. They seem most probably to have
                        been intended to accommodate pilgrims who came to sleep before the shrine,
                        seeking oracular dreams. One chamber was partly occupied as a workshop, and
                        two large chisels of bronze were found amid the material there. It is very
                        strange how all of these chambers were built with a stone lining and then
                        completely buried outside in a heap of loose blocks, so that they had no
                        external walls. They thus formed an artificial prolongation of the sacred
                        cave, a plan and nature of construction quite unknown in ancient Egypt. This
                        temple, then, though built and inscribed by Egyptiaus, is entirely on a
                        foreign model ; the Bethels around it, the enormous mass of ashes of burnt
                        sacrifices, the <hi rend="italic">hanafiyeh</hi> courts, and the
                        subterranean chambers, apparently for pilgrims, all belong to Semitic rather
                        than Egyptian worship. We have here the only Semitic temple preserved to us,
                        and its arrangements will need careful study in relation to early Semitic
                        worship.</p>
                    <p>The purpose of the Egyptian expeditions was further ascertained. Not only
                        Wady Maghara but also Sarabit of Khadem were visited solely for turquoises.
                        The ferruginous band under which the turquoises are found lies between the
                        same varieties of sandstone at both places. In the Wady Nasb the base of the
                        sandstone resting on the black granite is exposed, and this was the source
                        of copper. In the bottom of the Wady Nasb lies a mass of copper slag about
                        500ft. long, nearly as wide, and 6ft. or 8ft. thick. The ore was probably
                        brought here from various mines in the valley, in order to use the fuel
                        which grew by the spring in this spot.</p>
                    <p>The great mass of Egyptian inscriptions were copied in full-size facsimile,
                        the only satisfactory way of recording such monuments. About 250
                        inscriptions were thus reproduced, of all sizes up to many square yards in
                        area. These will be all published, with the plans, by the Exploration Fund ;
                        and, beside this work for students, I will also issue separately a more
                        popular volume describing and illustrating the country and its antiquities,
                        and discussing the questions of its climate and Biblical history.</p>
                    <p>The smaller monuments which could be removed on camel-back were brought away
                        and about 50 inscriptions and sculptures will be exhibited. The Arabs say
                        that about 18 years ago a traveller removed the upper part of a statue, if
                        so, it is much to be hoped that it may be traced, as the lower part of a
                        statue of Rameses has been found which may rejoin it. A great quantity of
                        offerings to the goddesss were deposited here ; bangles, tablets with heads
                        and with cats drawn on them, wands, sistra, and ornaments. These bore the
                        names of various Kings of the XVIIIth-XXth dynasties, from Amenhotep I. to
                        Rameses VI. ; and though none of them can be rejoined completely, they show
                        the profusion of decorative objects which crowded the temple until its
                        desolation in the twelfth century B.C. The most beautiful and valuable piece
                        is a portrait head of Queen Thyi from a statuette. The burial place of her
                        parents, it will be remembered, was lately found by Mr. Quibell and Mr.
                        Theodore Davies, as described in "The Times." This portrait of the Queen is
                        the first that has been found in the round, and is one of the finest style
                        of her period. It will be shown in London, but has to be returned to the
                        Cairo Museum.</p>
                    <p>After exhausting the small grant made by the Exploration Fund, Mr. Currelly
                        explored further for the Research Account. The rubbish heaps at the Convent
                        of St. Catharine proved unfruitful, owing to the winter snows soaking the
                        earth and destroying any documents which might have been thrown away there.
                        The small stone structures called <hi rend="italic">nawamis</hi> were found
                        to be made with great regularity and exactitude, and they do not belong to
                        any late period. They seem to be for the burials of a people who were
                        accustomed to well-constructed tombs, and who had more civilisation than is
                        likely to have arisen in these valleys, probably immigrants from Egypt at
                        some early date. After this Mr. Currelly made some examination of buildings
                        at Pithom which have been described as store chambers. He found that they
                        were part of the substructure of a great fort, similar to the forts of
                        Nankratis and Daphnae. It will be a matter of great interest to see further
                        whether this type of fort (which is only yet known in Greek sites) was an
                        old Egyptian form. The age of the building must be ascertained, and the
                        connexion of it with the temple and other structures. The annual exhibition
                        of the discoveries will be held at University College, Gower-street, as
                        usual during July.</p>
                    <p>Owing to the heavy expenditure of the last few years, the committee of the
                        Egypt Exploration Fund have been obliged to renounce the idea of excavating
                        any fresh site before finishing the work on Deir al Bahr, in 1907 or later.
                        The Fund is therefore withdrawn from my work, which it has supported for
                        nine years past. I am therefore obliged to adapt the Egyptian Research
                        Account, which I am intending to maintain in Egypt next winter. A small
                        committee will administer the Research Account, and all support for my work
                        must be addressed to the secretary, Egyptian Research Account. University
                        College, Gower-street, London, W.C. All objects found will be presented, as
                        hitherto, to public museums.</p>

                    <head>A STORY</head>
                    <p>A story with a moral comes from Uganda. A lion, thinking it about time to
                        lunch, seized a white man, and bit at him. His teeth went through a bottle
                        of whiskey, which the man was carrying in his pocket, and this gave him such
                        a shock that he turned tail. The moral is obvious. Do not be a teetotaller.
                        If this man had been a teetotaller, he would have been eaten. It is better
                        to be drunk than eaten.</p>

                        <p>A match was played between the above teams at Suez on 24th inst. The
                            E.T.C., winning the toss, elected to bat first, and compiled a score of
                            87 ; thanks chiefly to the batting of Messrs. Toms and Nosworthy, the
                            latter making his runs in four strokes. The naval men, although starting
                            badly by losing three wickets for six runs, managed to come off
                            victorious, which was due to a fine stand by Rev. Lester and Mr. Benn.

                        Regiment, and Lieutenant C. H. T. Lucas, Royal Berkshire Regiment.</p>
                    <p>The swift and very severe punishment which followed the "ragging" case on the
                        cruiser "Kent" (Captain Gamble) will no doubt put an end to the pranks of
                        the "young gentlemen" aboard ship. A middy who had been tried by a mock
                        court-martial and sentenced to a caning in a degrading manner, resented the
                        infliction of the caning, and in the course of the proceedings he whipped
                        out a revolver and shot one of the chief aggressors in the mouth. The
                        youngster who protected himself from an insult has been withdrawn by his
                        parents from the Navy, all the others immediately concerned have been
                        punished, and the captain placed on half-pay.</p>
                    <p>According to the present arrangements, the 3rd Battalion Royal Warwickshire
                        Regiment –– which is largely composed of Birmingham men –– will embark on
                        the hired transport "Dunera" at Gibralltar on the 13th of June en voyage for
                        the Cape. The battalion, which is commanded by Lieutenant Colonel P. R.
                        Mockler, with Major F. G. F. Browne second in command, will proceed to
                        Standerton in the Transvaal on arrival at Durban about the 4th of July.</p>
                    <p>To-day at Chatham the first-class battleship "Africa" was launched. The
                        "Christening" ceremony was gracefully performed by the Marchioness of
                        Londonderry in the presence of a large and fashionable assembly. The
                        "Africa" is of the "King Edward VII.," type. She measures 457 feet in
                        length, has a beam of 78 feet and a displacement of 16,350 tons. Her engines
                        are of 18,000 h.p., and her armament will include four 12-inch guns of the
                        much criticised wire round type, mounted in pairs in hooded barbettes, four
                        9.2 guns on the corners of the superstructure, ten 6-inch guns in the
                        maindeck central battery, fourteen 12-pounders, the same number of
                        3-pounders, two maxims, and four 18-inch submerged torpedo tubes. When in
                        commission as a private ship she will carry a crew of 777 officers and men.
                        The waterline is protected by a 9 inch belt and the barbettes and other gun
                        positions are heavily armoured. The central battery is after the design of
                        that of the Japanese battleship Mikasa.</p>
                    <p>The rumours which have been current for some time past regarding the removal
                        of the Royal Engineers from Chatham have been much exaggerated. So far as
                        can be gathered, the authorities are merely looking for some more desirable
                        training ground than can be found at Chatham ; and for some time past
                        inquiries in this direction have been made in Wales and elsewhere. Salisbury
                        has now been fixed upon as most likely to fulfil the rquired conditions. But
                        the move will hardly be felt at Chatham. The School of Military Engineering
                        will be retained as the headquarters and depot of the dismounted branches of
                        the corps, while the mounted services will remain at Aldershot as
                        before.</p>
                    <p>Discussing Imperial Defence, the "Spectator" maintains that we want a system
                        which shall be ready to mete not only the emergencies of a given moment, but
                        those now invisible. This proposition, translated into action, "means a
                        regular professional army of about the strength that we possess to-day. It
                        means a militia and yeomanry encouraged and improved by better handling at
                        the War Office and with appropriate reserves. It means a volunteer force in
                        which every man shall be admitted who desires to be admitted, and in respect
                        of whom his corps shall receive a grant suitable to the amount of time and
                        trouble he can give to training. It means, finally, the education of every
                        youth in the nation up to the age of seventeen in physical training of a
                        military character, including the use of the rifle. With compulsory service
                        the State should have nothing to do. She only wants willing hands. What
                        however, she has a right to do, and ought</p>
                    <cb n="5"/>
                    <p>to do, is to make it impossible for any man in the hour of her need to say to
                        her :–– 'I am ready to fight for you and die for you, but as you never took
                        the trouble to give me any instruction in art of war, I can only offer you a
                        maimed and useless service.'</p>
                    <p>"This is the army that we need. This is the army which will safeguard the
                        nation, whether Mr. Balfour's assurances that invasion is impossible turn
                        out to be true or false. It is an army which will enable us to meet a raid
                        or a real invasion, or at a great Imperial crisis to pour troops overseas as
                        we poured them during the Boer War, but to pour them far more effectively.
                        It is an army designed not merely to meet visible contingencies, but those
                        which are for the moment invisible. It organises, for whatever work it may
                        be required, the willing manhood of the nation."</p>
                    <p>It is notorious that the establishment of a new order of things, founded on a
                        recognition of the fact that the prevention of disease is the primary and
                        vital function of the medical service of the army, was, says the "British
                        Medical Journal," so vehemently opposed by the medical authorities that the
                        strongest pressure from high quarters was needed to bring it into being. How
                        little they have even now taken to hear the teaching of our terrible
                        experience in South Africa is shown by the readiness with which they fall
                        back into the old ways as soon as any scare that galvanises them into an
                        appearance of activity dies out. Only one "modern instance" need be
                        cited.</p>
                    <p>Three years ago the Advisory Board recommended that lectures on military
                        sanitation should be given to the cadets at Woolwich and Sandhurst and to
                        the officers going through the special course of training at the Staff
                        College. It can scarcely be denied that at the present day an intelligent
                        grasp of the sanitary problems which must inevitably arise in a campaign is
                        an essential part of the training of an officer ; it is indeed the want of
                        such knowledge in military commanders of the old school that has been the
                        cause of immense waste of life and terrible disasters. These courses have
                        been given during the last two years, and it speaks well for the
                        intelligence of the future officers of the British army that they were
                        thoroughly interested in the subject and fully appreciated the value of the
                        lectures. Now the War Office, for no apparent reason, has reduced the
                        lectures to a number that makes anything like an adequate treatment of the
                        subject impossible.</p>
                    <p>It is the old, old story. South Africa is forgotten, and Manchuria is a long
                        way off ; why, then, trouble about things as to which Parliament and the
                        public are like indifferent? … But the men are to whose hands is entrusted
                        the defence of the country seem to be smitten with blindness in regard to
                        the health of the fighting machines under their direction.</p>

                        writes :</p>
                    <p>"I find that Peruna is an excellent medicine especially for catarrhal
                        affections and all diseases leading to consumption, bronchial troubles or
                        stomach troubles. It also acts as a preventative and keeps the system in a
                        healthy condition so that it easily throws off disease. It is an excellent
                        tonic and a great appetizer and as a large number of those who have been
                        using it speak very highly of its curative powers, I am satisfied that my
                        opinion of it is correct, and that it is deserving of high praise."</p>
                    <p>–– J. H. Hipplegate.</p>
                    <p>Peruna is the remedy for catarrh. Almost everybody knows that by hearsay and
                        thousands know it by experience.</p>
                    <p>Catarrh in its various forms is rapidly becoming a national curse. An
                        undoubted remedy has been discovered by Dr. Hartman. This remedy has been
                        thoroughly tested during the past forty years. Peruna cures catarrh in all
                        phases and stages. There is no remedy that can be substituted.</p>
                    <p>If you do not derive prompt and satisfactory results from the use of Peruna,
                        write at once to Dr. Hartman, giving a full statement of your case, and he
                        will be pleased to give you his valuable advice gratis.</p>

                    <p>For special directions everyone should read "The Ills of Life," a copy of
                        which surrounds each bottle. Peruna is for sale by all chemists and
                        druggists at five shillings per bottle or six bottles for twenty-five

                    <head type="sub">A CHEERFUL SHIP'S COMPANY SINCE USING VI-COCOA</head>
                    <head type="sub">Mr. W. CATERER, 3 Mess, H.M.S. "FORMIDABLE," Gibraltar, writes
                        :––</head>
                    <p>"I have the pleasure of writing to you to express our opinion as regards to
                        your valuable Vi-Cocoa. We have had rather arduous times since we left
                        Portsmouth, a month ago, having had to coal ship four times, being mostly
                        night work. Whilst in the collier shovelling and hauling bags about we have
                        become very tired and languid, and when we get a little time to have our
                        meals we have made a nice drop of Vi-Cocoa, which is both refreshing and
                        nourishing, and when we turn to our work we seem as though we could carry on
                        with our work for a much longer time without feeling fatigued. Of course we
                        could not do so if we had not take, Vi-Cocoa.</p>
                    <p>We all use it in this mess everymorning, as we find it more sustaining than
                        the ordinary ship's cocoa which the Service allows us. We have recommended
                        it to all our shipmates. There is a lot of remarks passed by several of the
                        ship's company about all our messmates being so bright and cheerful, and
                        they ask us the reason as we all belong to what is called in this ship as
                        the comical party and we tell them that Vi-Cocoa makes us like it, and they
                        say they will give it a trial.</p>
                    <p>"You are at liberty to publish this letter of praise as you please."</p>
                    <p>You must have read the striking testimony that is being published daily
                        respecting the merits of Vi-Cocoa. And yet you have not tried it. We advise
                        you do so at once.</p>
                    <p>Dr. Tibbles' Vi-Cocoa can be obtained in 6d. tins from all grocers ; or the
                        Proprietors will send you free a dainty smaple tin upon receipt of a
                        postcard to 60 Bunhill Row, London. E.C. a sking them to do so.</p>

                        <p>Les animaux importes a Alexandrie sont transportes en general par des
                            bateaux speciaux, dans lesquels les properietaires ne se preoccupent que
                            d'une chose : faire penetrer le maximum d'animaux dans un endroit donne
                            sans songer aux regles les plus elementaires de l'hygiene ; pour eux le
                            betail est une merchandise que l'on doit pouvoir, a l'instar du coton,
                            "presser" a volonte. Aussi, qu'arrive-t-il? C'est que ces malheureuses
                            betes entassees dans la cale tres obscure, non aeree ou les soins les
                            plus vulgaires de proprete font completement defaut, respirent un air
                            vicie qui corrompt les muscles quand il n'occasionne pas d'accidents
                            mortels.</p>
                        <p>On comprend que l'Administration soit a peu pres entierement desarmee ;
                            les mesures de protection devraient etre prises au port expediteur.</p>
                        <p>Le mode de debarquement se pratique d'une facon scandaleuse : presque
                            toujours les moutons sont attaches 6 on 7 ensemble par un membre
                            posterieur et hisses de la cale a terre ou sur les maones ; quant aux
                            boeufs ou buffles, une corde leur est passee autour de la tete a la base
                            des cornes et ils sont descendus a quai de la meme maniere qu'une
                            marchandise quelconque, balle de coton, sac de farine, etc.; bien peu
                            d'animaux, sont regulierement debarques, c'est-a-dire avec une sorte de
                            tablier passant sous la poitrine pour se replier sur le dos, d'ou un
                            crochet permet a la grue d'operer convenablement le dechargement. La
                            Municipalite subventionnant la Societe protectrice des animaux pourrait
                            attirer son attention sur ce point qui est plus particulierement de sa
                            competence.</p>
                        <p><hi rend="italic">Insuffisance de la nourriture</hi></p>
                        <p>Les animaux, pendant toute la duree de la traversee, au moins ceux de
                            provenance syrienne, observent un jenue absolu; ni nourriture solide ou
                            liquide; si bien que la mer etant agitee (le fait s'est presente il y a
                            deux mois a peine) ces malheureuses betes sont obligees de faire de
                            l'autophagie pendant une duree de 8 jours quelquefois, mais qui n'est
                            jamais inferieure a 72 heures! Ici encore il est profondement
                            regrettable que l'administration ne puisse efficacement intervenir ;les
                            sanctions feraient completement defaut.</p>
                        <p>Mais ou l'on peut agir, je pense, c'est en obligeant les proprietaires a
                            donner, dans les parcs quarantenaires, une ration d'entretien</p>
                        <cb n="2"/>
                        <p>suffisante ; on pourrait prier l'administration interessee de bien
                            vouloir imposer une quantite de nourriture qu'on lui laisserait
                            naturellement le soin de fixer elle-meme. Cette question avait ete
                            soumise a son appreciation pendant le cours de l'annee 1900 sur la
                            proposition de la Municipalite ; je pense qu'il y a lieu de revenir de
                            nouveau a la charge.</p>

                            insuffisant pour permettre aux animaux de se refaire des fatigues d'un
                            voyage aussi penible: quatre jours pleins devraient au moins etre
                            exiges. Cette question est reglee par des accords internationaux que
                            seul le gouvernment pourrait porter devant le Conseil quarantinaire.</p>

                        produite par les fortes realisations qui ont eu lieu. La cloture a donc ete
                        calme, mais une reprise est certaine au premier signe de soutien venant du
                        dehors.</p>

                        aussi nous est venu un peu plus calme.</p>

                    <dateline>Paris, May 25.</dateline>
                    <p>An article published in the "Lanterne" brings home to us the fact that, at
                        the end of a few short months, M. Loubet's term of office as President of
                        the French Republic will have expired. A little known man, M. Loubet's
                        election came as a surprise to most Frenchmen, and only those moving in the
                        inner circles of the political world could tell the story of the intrigues
                        which led up to the choice of so unfancied an outsider. But well has it
                        turned out for the Republic that such a selection was imposed, for during
                        the six years that M. Loubet has dignified the high office of Chief of the
                        State France has become stronger and more self-confident, and has regained
                        much of the moral influence in the world's councils of which the disasters
                        of "l'annee terrible" had deprived her. Cooler-headed and more patient than
                        Carnot, utterly free from the ostentation of Felix Faure, M. Loubet has
                        known how to reconcile conflicting political interests and close up the
                        Republican ranks. When he entered the Elysee, France was in the throes of an
                        agitation which threatened to end in civil war ; thanks to his choice and
                        support of able and fearless Ministers, that danger is past and the Republic
                        stands, for the first time in its history, on really solid foundations. M.
                        Loubet has more than once expressed the keen delight with which he looks
                        forward to the time when he may lay down the cares of office and again
                        become a private citizen, and if he allows himself to be nominated for a
                        second term, it will be because his friends have persuaded him that in such
                        a course his duty to the country lies.</p>
                    <p>Rumour is again busy with the alleged approaching resignation of M. Delcasse.
                        Such an event is, no doubt, possible ; but it seems reasonable to look for
                        the most obvious explanation of the present revival of the report to the
                        disappointment of the Socialists at their recent failure in the Chamber to
                        score any points off Government over the question of French neutrality in
                        the Far East. From the standpoint of French interests in Morocco, it is much
                        to be hoped that M. Delcasse means to stick to his post. While there are
                        rumours (apparently made in Germany) that the Moors have rejected all the
                        proposals of the French Ambassador, the German Envoy has arrived at Fez, has
                        had prompt audience of the Sultan, and has been very well received. Mr.
                        Lowther has also arrived, and for the time being, the members of the various
                        Missions appear to be exchanging the preliminary courtesies before
                        proceeding to enter upon the diplomatic conflict which will make Fez one of
                        the most interesting spots on the world's surface for the student of
                        international affairs during the coming summer. As I have already remarked,
                        this summer is likely to be a warm one at the Court of Sultan
                        Abdul-Aziz.</p>
                    <p>In discussing the question of neutrality in the Far East, M. de Lanessan says
                        in "Le Siecle" that the forbearance shown by the French Government with
                        regard to the Russian Admiral during the last five or six months could not
                        fail to arouse complaints and protests from Japan. "In fact, such has been
                        the case, and we have been compelled to give them immediate satisfaction,
                        and to own that we did wrong. Would it not have been wiser and better not to
                        have exposed ourselves to such a humiliation? No cause of disagreement
                        existed between Japan and France. Our relations with the Japanese in the Far
                        East have always been excellent, as they always have been in Paris. Why,
                        then, did we offend the interests and amour propre of a country with which
                        it is to our great advantage to maintain only friendly relations? And all of
                        this has happened, it must not be forgotten, because our diplomacy has never
                        dared to speak in St. Petersburg in the only language which is fitting in
                        France: that is, the language of a royal and faithful ally, but the
                        language, at the same time, of a nation which is conscious of its own
                        interests, of its power, and of its dignity."</p>
                    <p>Events in Morocco and the Far East have awakened public attention here to the
                        need of a strong navy, and the "Temps" has opened its columns to
                        correspondence on the subject. The most interesting letter yet received is
                        signed by M. Edouard Lockroy, some time Minister of Marine. The letter is
                        remarkably because it rejects many of the theories on which French naval
                        engineers have worked for many years, and admits that the principle which
                        has guided British naval constructors is sound. M. Lockroy points out that,
                        owing to the rise of the United States and Japan as naval Powers, the old
                        ideas, which has governed the designs of French warships, that future
                        battles for supremacy on the seas must be fought out in European waters, is
                        exploded, and that the limited range of action of French ships, due to their
                        small coal capacity, unfits them for the duties they may be called upon to
                        perform.</p>
                    <cb n="2"/>
                    <p>Very concisely M. Lockroy lays it dodwn that the foreign policy of the
                        country necessitates a fleet with a wide range of action ; that strategy
                        requires speed and tactics gun power. In order to combine these three
                        essential elements, he argues, it is necessary to increase the tonnage and
                        cost of vessels, and the country must be prepared to spend 40 millions of
                        francs on a single ship if she would have a navy capable of holding its own
                        in a modern sea fight. The ex-Minister of Marine then goes on to make some
                        interesting comparisons between the cost of warship building in France and
                        in other European countries. He finds that France pays more per ton for new
                        construction than any other nation, and gets less for it in the way of speed
                        and efficiency. For instance, the "Charlemagne", which displaces 4,000 tons
                        less than the "Majestic", cost 2 millions of francs more to build. The
                        amount paid in wages in England per ton displacement is one-tenth less than
                        in France, though the workmen are better paid in the former country. There
                        is a greater difference still in the cost of material, England paying
                        four-tenths less than France per ton of displacement.</p>
                    <p>The passing of the bill for the separation of Church and State during the
                        existence of the present Parliament becomes more and more improbable every
                        day, as the interminable discussion on sub-section 4 drags out its weary
                        length. At the present rate of progress the bill cannot be voted in time for
                        it to be sent to the Senate before the commencement of the vacation in July,
                        and when the Chambers meet again in October they will be fully occupied in
                        dealing with the Budget for 1906, which must be voted before the dissolution
                        in March next. The balance of public opinion is in favor of the measure, and
                        deputies who owe their seats to Separatist votes dare not risk them by open
                        opposition to the bill. But, as I have pointed out before, there is a
                        curious unwillingness on the part of many members of Parliament to be
                        responsible for its passing into law, and progress is delayed as much by
                        professed supporters as by avowed opponents. Now, too, the intimate
                        relations which are evidently being established between Germany and the
                        Vatican have given pause to many, and people are asking themselves whether
                        Germany is not already preparing to take the place of the eldest child of
                        the Church, which France would vacate by tearing up the Concordat. It
                        becomes necessary to answer the question –– Will French influence suffer in
                        consequence? As a reply is not easy to find, the result will probably be
                        that Church and State will not be separated during the existence of the
                        current Parliament.</p>
                    <p>M. Combes and his sequestration law have left to the French Law Courts a
                        heritage of litigation for which he and they little bargained. In
                        sequestrating the property of the property of the monastic congregations, no
                        account was taken of the position of those members who had taken with them
                        private property on the understanding that their future was provided for in
                        the common life of the body. Now they are deprived of that provision, and
                        the question arises as to their rights. Among the brothers of the Christian
                        schools alone, five hundred different suits for restitution have been
                        entered, which would occupy one court for a year and a half at least. As it
                        is probable that at least an equal number of such cases will arise in every
                        congregation affected, the outlook seems to be little less than
                        appalling.</p>
                    <p>There is no extravagance in the supposition that the recent sitting of the
                        Academy of Medicine in Paris may turn out to be the most remarkable meeting
                        in the history of medicine. For some time past, the most eminent
                        bacteriologists have been devoting all their energies to the discovery of
                        the microbe of a certain disease, which is hereditary beyond all other
                        diseases, which simulates almost every known complaint, is the chief cause
                        of nervous and arterial lesions, and is responsible for the infliction of
                        more misery upon the guilty and upon the innocent than any other disorder
                        which afflicts mankind. For long the bacillus eluded all research, but it
                        has at last been tracked down and identified as spirochaete pallida, a long,
                        pale, infinitesimal, and evenascent being which offers peculiar difficulties
                        for the observer, both from its minuteness and from the fact that it is
                        specifically refractory to staining for miscroscopic purposes. The
                        identification is a triumph of bacteriological skill, and it is hard to
                        over-estimate its possible results to the human race. The discovery of the
                        microbe is not, as have unfortunately learned in the case of tubercolosis,
                        always the same thing as the discovery of the anti-toxin, but is the first
                        and greatest step in that direction, and that is no reason why the Schaudinn
                        bacillus, as it is called after its discoverer, should prove more
                        intractable than the bacilli of small-pox, anthrax, hydrophobia, diphtheria,
                        and splenic fever. To conquer the disease which it produces would be not
                        merely to relieve a vast amount of suffering, often cruelly undeserved, but
                        to rescue humanity from the most degenerating influence to which it is
                        subjected, and to deliver thousands yet
                    <cb n="3"/>
                     unborn from a curse which poisons the very springs of life.</p>
                    <p>Excessive competition being one of the roundabout ways to mutual
                        understanding, Marseille and Genoa are beginning, after a long course of
                        cut-throat tactics, to wonder whether a more comfortable live and let live
                        policy could not be devised. Many are beginning to say aloud that
                        accommodation is quite possible, and M. Meline, the leader of French
                        Protectionists, is heading the movement in France. He urges that the two
                        cities, laying aside their strife, should agree on proposals which their
                        united pressure would compel the Governments of the two countries to accept.
                        Such are the sweet uses of retaliation.</p>
                    <p>Not content with the Forty Immortals of the Palais Mazarin, France is now, it
                        seems, to have another Academie Francaise, one devoted to the cult of "Le
                        Sport." The first twenty members of the "Academie Sportive" have been
                        elected by the readers of a motoring journal, and the elect will now proceed
                        to co-opt another score of persons. The twenty already chosen are rather
                        curious specimens of "Sport," as it is understood in the land whence our
                        neighbours have borrowed the word. They include eight motorists, two
                        balloonists, and a novelist. As to racing, hunting, shooting, cricket,
                        football, running, rowing, swimming, tennis, or golf, they are not
                        represented at all, so far. What the functions of the Sporting Immortals
                        will be ; but then there are actually irreverent persons who fail to
                        perceive the utility of even the wearers of the "palmes vertes" themselves.
                        We shall watch the completion of the sacred number, and the development of
                        their programme, with feelings of sportive interest.</p>
                    <p>The splendid reception given in Paris to a representative body of British
                        medical men is a symptom not only of the sympathy of French people with all
                        movements that make for the good of mankind but also of their disposition

                    <head>THE NILE AS A COMMERCIAL RIVER</head>
                    <p>The Alexandria correspondent of the "Times" Engineering Supplement says that
                        there is evidence that the question of fluvial navigation upon the Nile is
                        beginning to engage the serious attention of engineers and public men in
                        Egypt. Sir Hanbury Brown has recently, in an admirable series of papers,
                        illustrated the more prominent defects of the Nile and its branches as
                        commercial waterways. He has shown that the Government, in perfecting the
                        irrigative power of the Nile, has to a large extent neglected the river's
                        navigable resources. Nor does the situation of the Government, with its
                        valuable possession of the State railways, allow it to view the Nile as
                        anything but a formidable competitive route, likely at any moment to assume
                        undesirable proportions. This being so, Nile development becomes a question
                        principally of private enterprise, one, moreover, in which British capital
                        and enterprise are largely interested, because they are bound sooner or
                        later to be called upon to aid in the opening up the great waterway, if,
                        indeed, they do not attempt it upon their own initiative. It is fitting,
                        therefore, that private enterprise should be made acquainted with the early
                        stages of the subject.</p>
                    <p>Quite recently in Cairo, at an interesting conference, M. Leroux, the
                        president of the Societe des Sucreries et Raffineries d'Egypte, summed up
                        the chief bearings of the case by saying that the efficiency of the Nile for
                        commercial navigation would begin as soon as easy and unfailing
                        communication was assured between the capital and the sea. This primary <hi
                            rend="italic">desideratum</hi> can only be secured by the remodelling
                        and improvement of the main junction canals ––<hi rend="italic"> i.e.</hi>,
                        the Behera and the Mahmoudieh ––an operation which lies solely within the
                        competence of the Government. The result would be to have a waterway
                        navigable at all season for vessels of fair tonnage.</p>
                    <p>M. Leroux calculates the amount of merchandise that would pass the first year
                        from and into Cairo alone at 2 ½ million tons ; but this estimate may be
                        reckoned to be rather an under than an over statement of what might be
                        expected. To cope with even this volume of traffic would necessitate
                        extensive quayage space along the banks of the Nile in the neighbourhood of
                        the Embabeh railway bridge. In fact a port, well equipped with modern
                        appliances, and provided with spacious warehouses, would have to be created,
                        together with a dock or docks roomy enough to berth river vessels and
                        steamers of the largest dimensions.</p>
                    <p>Gradually, as traffic increased, it might reasonable be expected of the
                        Government that the reaches of the Nile upstream of Cairo would be
                        successively be rendered fit for navigation, until an unrivalled artery of
                        communication stretched from Alexandria to Assouan, bearing all but a
                        fraction of the entire agricultural produce of Upper and Lower Egypt.</p>
                    <p>Despite the disadvantages at present prevailing, two or three companies are
                        alreading trading in the river transport of freight between Cairo and
                        Alexandria. It needs but the provision of improved navigation to stimulate
                        capital, calling into being busy wharves where there are now lifeless banks,
                        and increased flotillas of steam cargo boats to superseded the unwieldy <hi

                    <p>Mr. H. R. Hall, M.A., of the Egypt Exploration Fund, delivered an interesting
                        lecture last week, in the lecture-room of the Society of Arts, London, on
                        recent discoveries in Thebes. The lecture was illustrated by a series of
                        lantern slides, and by articles found in the course of the excavations. Mr.
                        Hall described a temple, the oldest in the district, which has just been
                        brought to light. It dated from the Eleventh Dynasty, or about 2500 B.C.,
                        and was probably a funeral temple or an antechamber to the tomb of King
                        Mentuhetep III. This tomb still remained undiscovered. Mr. Hall's
                        description was extremely lucid, and gave eloquent testimony to the valuable
                        work which the Egypt Exploration Fund is doing.</p>

                    <head>GAMBLING IN CORFU</head>
                    <p>The Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior of Greece, M. Th. P.
                        Delyannis, has sent a telegram to the Prefect of Corfu, with reference to a
                        scheme to create a gaming establishment in the island, informing him that as
                        the realisation of such a scheme would necessarily bring serious
                        developments (as Corfu would then be regarded as an international centre of
                        gaming), the Greek Government considers it necessary to announce public
                        beforehand that the establishment of a gambling-place in a Greek island, or
                        in any other section of the Greek kingdom, would be repugnant to the
                        conscience of the Greek people, and consequently neither the present nor any
                        other Greek Government could even think of permitting or tolerating the
                        existence of such a resort.</p>

                    <p>The foreign editor of the "Revue de Paris," M. Victor Berard, publishes in
                        its issue for May an interesting statement about the foreign policy of the
                        German Emperor. We quote from the "Times" translation :–– "During the last
                        ten years in which I have been professor at the Ecole Superieure de Marine,
                        twenty or thirty of my pupils have repeated to me textually the same
                        phrases, not dropped from the Imperial lips in private intercourse, but
                        uttered with the emphasis of gesture in the circle of official
                        representations. And always the Emperor expounded the imperious reasons
                        necessitating a Franco-German "entente"…..The object was always a crusade
                        either of the Continent against the United States or against yellow Asia. .
                        . . .Always against something or some one. William II. undertook to federate
                        the whole of Europe or a part of Europe, as a matter of fact –– his "hatred
                        of England" being betrayed almost unconsciously in his most insignificant
                        utterances –– Continental Europe."</p>

                        paper. It describes a "garden party" given by the Governor-General : ––
                        "Dans les splendides jardins anglais du gubernatorial "Palace" tout le
                        high-life Algerois, toute la gentry s'etaient donne rendez-vous jeudi

                    <head>WOMAN AND MARRIAGE</head>
                    <p>"Woman," a woman's paper informs us, "is being convinced by degrees that
                        marriage does not of iteself alone guarantee happiness." If you wish to see
                        women throughly insulted go to the papers written for women. Where else
                        would anyone dare to imply that woman was sufficiently idoitic to believe
                        that marriage "of itself alone" guaranteed anything? The oracle continues :
                        "She is learning by experience and observation that it is possible to be as
                        happy without man's love as with it, if she can only think so." This seems a
                        sort of Christian Science. You are as happy with the tooth-ache as without
                        it, "if you can only think so." Even this is it with the love of man.</p>
