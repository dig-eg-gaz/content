                <head>TOGO'S VICTORY.</head>
                <p>Every telegram that arrives confirms more and more the completeness of the
                    Japanese victory. The capture of Admirals Rodjestvensky, Niebogatoff, and
                    Foelkersam, with thousands of prisoners, and the extraordinary way in which the
                    Japanese fleet has escaped scatheless from the might combat, serve to show the
                    thoroughness of Japan's naval success. It would be premature to hazard a
                    conjecture as to the immediate consequences of Admiral Togo's prodigious
                    victory. Even now the Tsar may hesitate to decide for peace, while it is
                    improbable that the revolutionary movement will become immediately stronger than
                    heretofore. But that the main issues of Saturday's fight for the world at large
                    will be enormous it is easy to foretell, and to find a historical parallel we
                    must go farther back than 1805, for such a world-historical sea-fight deserves
                    to be compared not with an international combat such as was Trafalgar, but with
                    an intercontinental event such as Salamis. Even yet perhaps Europe scarecely
                    recognises how prodigious an influence this rise of a new Power on the edge of
                    Asia, in the ocean which must decade by decade increase in importance till its
                    freedom will preoccupy all maritime nations as the freedom of the Atlantic does
                    now, will exercise on her policy, her ambitions, and her commerce. Throw away
                    all apprehensions about the "yellow peril," leave China out of the calculation
                    as sunk in irredeemable dotage, assume Japan to stand alone, and still Europe
                    has to reckon with a Power which ten years hence will have twice Togo's fleet,
                    and which has proved that wherever she can land, an army double its strength
                    must be called out to render defeat of the defenders improbable. Of the ideas,
                    aspirations, and ultimate plans of that Power nothing, it may be said, is known
                    ; but of her capacities and her strength we now at least know something. We know
                    that she can keep a secret for years, that her people will fight to the death at
                    the word of command, that she has the European belief in science, and that she
                    counts among her statesmen and soldiers men of the intellectual capacity to
                    control and guide huge masses of trained men to any end she has decided on. No
                    King thinks that he can conquer Japan ; no statesman imagines that he can set
                    aside her vote in the Pacific or the Indian Ocean as a negligible quantity. She
                    may not govern China, but all the long-devised European plans for gaining
                    dominant influence in China or in the Archipelago must, without her permission,
                    be abandoned. No State can hope to make of Kiaochow a capital, or to announce
                    that the valley of the Yangtze River is closed except to her own traders. The
                    "open door" has a terrible guardian, all Asia a potential advocate, whose voice
                    if lifted, say in protest that yellow men and white men must be treated alike,
                    must at least be heard.</p>
                <p>Tremendous as the blow is to Russia, and far-reaching as its consequences must
                    be, we hesitate to believe that the Tsar, unless coerced by the volutionary
                    forces, will make peace. His army has apparently recovered from the defeat at
                    Mukden and doubtless he believes that the continuation of the struggle, howbeit
                    hopeless, will involve less danger for his dynasty than a peace on severe terms.
                    It will not shock the Army or paralyse diplomatic action, and, besides, it
                    evades some dangers. While there is no peace--- even if there be only an armed
                    truce instead of a victory---no indemnity can be asked for, and the thought of
                    the indemnity galls the ruling group at St. Petersburg as scarcely any
                    territorial cession would do. The cession of Manchuria, and the relinquishing of
                    all claim to Korea, will not diminish the resources of Russia, while the payment
                    of a hundred millions will weaken them further in their weakest place. Therefore
                    the hopeless struggle will continue indefinitely until the complete erosion of
                    the established state of things in Russia. The extraordinary rapidity with which
                    events are passing blind us to their real significance. Only a few months ago
                    Russia seemed one of the most formidable and deep-rooted of the Great Powers.
                    After Great Britain, she was the largest owner of the surface of the blobe. Her
                    vast land possessions</p>
                <cb n="6"/>
                <p>were on the eve of a development which was believed to be unparalleled in modern
                    history. She appeared to have gained her desire, a warm-water port, and the
                    commerce of the Far East was about to fall into her hands. Her diplomacy was
                    dreaded by all, and seemed to have been crowned with a singular success. To the
                    ordinary spectator she appeared to have been pursuing for generations one
                    policy, biding her time in patience, and striking relentlessly when the moment
                    arrived. Russia, we were told, was the <hi rend="italic">beau ideal</hi> of an
                    Imperial Power. She had no captious democracy, no critical and independent
                    Press, to tie her hands or compromise the continuity of her work. Her great
                    bureaucracy were inspired by a single aim, and passed it on unweakened to their
                    successors. Her methods, to be sure, were somewhat Machiavellian, for her
                    conscience was not bound by promises, and the policy of encroachment had been
                    raised by her to the rank of a fine art. But it seemed justified by its results,
                    for other nations grumbled but submitted, since there was believed to wait
                    behind her Ministers the glacier-like power of a resolute and undivided nation.
                    It was left to Japan to put this hypothesis to the test. Once upon a time, as
                    the story goes, a certain King rode out unclothed among his people, and the
                    obsequious crowds applauded the beauty of his Majesty's garments. But a child
                    who was watching suddenly cried out: "Why, he has nothing on!" and at the word
                    every one's eyes were opened, and the nation proceeded to revise its
                    constitution. Russian diplomacy has some resemblance to that Monarch. It
                    succeeded because no one dared to question it, but when the question came it
                    went down like a house of cards. It is strange that our democratic Western world
                    should so long have held its breath in admiration of a game of bluff which,
                    according to its creed, could have no intrinsic strength. The first lesson for
                    the spectator is that the day is past when success can be won merely by military
                    diplomacy. It needs only to be questioned to collapse, and the issue is
                    transferred to that other field on which the strength of a people is more
                    radically tested.</p>
                <p>So also, with Russia's military and naval power. A few months ago she was thought
                    to have not only a splendid navy but the second or third finest Army in the
                    world, an Army trained on the most scientific lines, officered by experts, and
                    armed with the latest weapons. Being a military autocracy, it was believed that
                    she could make war with her whole soul, regardless of any difficulties which a
                    democratic regime might interpose in its conduct. Numerically she vastly
                    excelled her rival; she had more and better guns ; she had greater available
                    wealth ; and though she had to fight six thousand miles from her capital, yet
                    she had so developed Eastern Siberia and Manchuria as to have created an
                    advanced base cloes to the enemy. In Port Arthur she had an impregnable
                    fortress, fortified with a strength and ingenuity hitherto unknown in war. She
                    had a larger navy than Japan, and an indefinite capacity for increasing it which
                    was denied to the other. Morever, she was a military Power of old experience ;
                    she had generals trained under Skobeleff ; while Japan was in war a <hi
                        rend="italic">parvenu</hi>, with no record behind her save a trivial contest
                    with China. What has been the result of the past sixteen months! The Russian
                    soldiers have fought with all their traditional courage and obstinacy, and more
                    than one of their leaders have shown high qualities of generalship. Russia is
                    still a great military Power, but the prestige is gone. Japan has succeeded by
                    science, intelligence, a purer patriotism, and therefore a more indomitable
                    spirit. The materialism which had been creeping over Western Europe, the creed
                    which believed only in great armaments and big battalions, has, we believe,
                    received a shattering blow. Victory in war, as in other things, falls to the
                    stronger spirit.</p>
                <p>In Russia herself wer are faced with the same disillusionment. A year ago men
                    spoke of her as an impregnable bureaucracy, under competent administration,
                    broadly based upon popular acquiescence. Liberalism in Russia, we were told, was
                    a vain thing, since nobody wanted it. The semi-divine prestige of the Tsar was
                    the keystone of the Constitution, and this personal loyalty, combined with the
                    well-known Slav fatalism and patience, would make her in war a crusading Power
                    of irresistible strength. Afew months' war gives us no proof of such assurances.
                    We find no such fire of patriotism as inspires the armies of Oyama ; the Russian
                    fights splendidly, but as a machine, with a dull and homesick fidelity. We find,
                    on the contrary, a growing antipathy towards the war, based upon the terrible
                    demands made upon the people in life and property. Were the nation really
                    roused, all such grievances would be forgotten in the patriotism which desired
                    above all things to win battles for its country. But the nation is not at war at
                    all, but only its Government ; and since that Government has no part in the
                    national life, the Russian people look upon the contest as a gladiatorial combat
                    which does not really concern time, though they are called to sacrifice their
                    all in the arena. At the same time, the people are awakening to self
                    consciousness, and are struggling in the throes of a new life. The strikes in
                    every province, the St. Petersburg massacre, the petitions of the educated
                    classes, are serious enough in themselves, but their significance is not an
                    isolated thing. The war has been a chemical process, and from the crucible there
                    seems to be emerging a new national spirit. Will the destruction of the fleet
                    force the Tsar and his incompetent bureaucracy to resist the claims of this new
                    national force? They may, but it will go hardly with Russia if they do. For they
                    will continue to wage war, while the Russian people will continue to look on ;
                    and it is very clear that only when the national spirit is in arms can a nation
                    win victories.</p>

                <p>Tokio, May.30.</p>
                <p>Despatches from Admiral Togo show that immediately the news was received that the
                    Russians had been sighted, early on Saturday morning, the combined Japanese
                    squadrons started the attack. The weather was line but a heavy sea was running.
                    The enemy was encountered near Okoshima Island to the south-eastwards ot
                    Tsu-Shima. The Russians were defeated and several ships were sunk, comprising,
                    according to prisoners captured subsequently, the “Borodina," the “Emperor
                    Alexander III," “Zemtchug,” and three others. The damage to the Japanese fleet
                    is insignificant.</p>
                <p>The destroyer and torpedo flotillas delivered the attack after sunset. The main
                    Japanese force continued the pursuit and attacked, on Sunday to the north
                    eastwards of Okoshima, a group consisting of the “Imperator Nicholas I,” the
                    “Orel,” “Admiral Seniavin,” “Admiral Apraxen,” and “lzumrud.” The “lzumrud"
                    withdrew but the remaining ships of the force surrendered. The Japanese fleet
                    was undamaged. Admiral Niebogatoff and 2,000 prisoners were taken. All other
                    vessels which Admiral Togo reports as sunk or captured are from reports of
                    commanders not under his immediate command, who captured over 1,000 prisoners.
                    It is not clear whether the names given include three unnamed vessels which the
                    prisoners state to have boon sunk on Saturday.</p>
                <p>Admiral Togo’s last despatch, received on Monday morning, states that the
                    engagement is still in progress. (Reuter.)</p>

                <p>The Navy Department has received official news from Tokio that the flagship “Nyaz

                    “Imperator Nicholas,” which were captured.</p>
                <p>Admirals Rodjestvensky and Foelkersahm are prisoners. (Havas.)</p>

                <p>General Kazbel, commander of the fortress of Vladivostok, telegraphed to the Tsar
                    yesterday the news of the disaster. It is inferred from this that some Russian
                    ship or ships have escaped and arrived at Vladivostok.</p>
                <p>The hospital-ship “Orel” and a torpedo-boat have reached Vladivostok.</p>
                <p>The reports that Admiral Rodjestvensky has reached Vladivostok on board a

                    arrived there, and confirms the news of the sinking of the “Knyaz Suvaroff"
                    though it is not explicitly said that Admiral Rodjestvensky was on board. Until
                    now the Russian Admiralty has not been informed of the escape of any other
                    vessel. (Reuter.)</p>

                    brought to Maizuru.</p>

                    have been sunk with the exception of the "Orel” and "Imperator Nicholas I.,”
                    which have been captured, (Reuter.)</p>

                    the house and name of the Street in which they live indicated on their
                    correspondence. Should by any chance a street be unnamed, then the quarter of
                    the town in which it is situated must be indicated. Attention to these
                    instructions is imperative to avoid delay and errors in the delivery of

                <p>A Mummy Specialist.— One of the greatest authorities on the Egyptian mode,of

                    Gannal, who died in Paris last week in his seventy-eighth year. His father was
                    the chemist who invented the modern method of embalmment, and who died in 1852.
                    Dr. Gannal improved upon his father’s process of injection to a remarkable
                    extent. He was the author of a notable volume on real and apparent death. The
                    deceased also wrote a treatise on burial and cremation, and contributed numerous
                    papers to scientific periodicals on embalmment as practised by the Egyptians and
                    other ancient people, on premature burials, and kindred subjects.</p>

                <head>THE EGYPTIAN BOOM.
                    MORE NEW COMPANIES.
                    AN APPEAL TO LORD CROMER.</head>
               
                <p>The recent unprecedented booming of Egypt continues. Among the new companies,
                    whose scene of action is to be in Egypt, are a number of cold storage companies.
                    Some of the prospectuses of these companies are already out in London.</p>
                <p>We may mention that Mr. Tilden-Smith, who is well-known in connection with West
                    Australian companies, is promoting a trust company for Egyptian business.</p>
                <p>We hear that the Rt. Hon. Sir James Ferguson, late Postmaster General, has joined
                    the board of directors of a new company, which is being formed to acquire a
                    large area of land in the neighbourhood of Alexandria, bringing in a total of
                    L.E. 30,000 per annum. The capitalisation of this company will be £300,000,
                    divided into 299,000 ordinary shares of £1 each and 20,000 founder’s shares of
                    one shilling each. A well-known firm of London brokers are guaranteeing £100,000
                    towards the underwriting of this company. Sir Westby Perceval will probably be
                    one of the colleagues of the Rt. Hon. Sir James Ferguson.</p>
                <p>In connection with the forthcoming flotation of the great industrial company to
                    be known as “Egypt, Limited," we hear that the biggest New York issuing house is
                    one of the largest guarantors in connection with the two million pounds mortgage
                    bank, which Egypt, Limited, intends floating.</p>
                <p>The land of which Egypt, Limited, has the refusal is estimated to yield ton per
                    cent. on the total capitalisation of the company for fifteen years. At the end
                    of this period Egypt, Limited, will have assets worth over £750,000, or, in
                    other words, three times the capitalisation of the company.</p>
                <p>Egyptian Options has a new Egyptian oompany on the cards, connected with the
                    acquisition of land near Damietta. This company is taking offices both in
                    Alexandria and in Cairo.</p>
                <p>In October or November next, the British-Egypt Syndicate, Limited, will appear on
                    the scene. This syndicate will promote a company with a capitalisation of
                    £200,000 to be called Egyptian Industries, Limited. The board will comprise at
                    least two well-known names connected with banking in London. The larger portion
                    of the capital of the British Egyptian Syndicate has already been subscribed in
                    Egypt.</p>
                <p>In order to compensate for the recent loss of Mr. Charles Cammell, one of the
                    directors of the Egyptian Trust and Investment, Limited, his son-in-law, Mr. H.
                    W. Wilson, nephew of Sir Alexander Wilson, has consented to join the board of
                    Egypt, Limited. This gentleman is one of the directors of Messrs. Cammell, Laird
                    and Company, who built one of Admiral Togo’s battleships which contributed to
                    the recent victory in the Korean Straits.</p>
                <p>By way of diversion to the various land, trust, and bank companies, which are now
                    being floated wholesale for the sake of developing Egypt, it is not out of the
                    way to mention a great company, which is to find gold in the Mediterranean sea
                    off Alexandria, and which is to be floated in London. This company will work the
                    continuous gold-finding process, invented by Mr. Snell. This promotion is being
                    made after careful investigation by such well-known scientific men as Professor
                    Sir William Ramsay, F.R.D., Professor Liversedge, Mr. N. D. Littlefield, and F.
                    S. Rawson, C.E.M.I.E.E. It is estimated that every ton of sea water yields about
                    half a grain of gold. The working expenses are only about 25 per cent. of that.
                    When this company starts at Alexandria the shareholders will always be able to
                    inspect the working, which will be carried on night and day.</p>
                <p>A correspondent writes :—</p>
                <p>It is sincerely to be hoped that the Egyptian investor will bo careful in his
                    selection of new companies to place his savings in. I cannot understand why the
                    Egyptian Government and Lord Cromer do not stop the wild speculation. Lord
                    Cromer paid so much attention to safeguarding the interests of both the Egyptian
                    and foreign investors in connection with the promotion of mining companies in
                    Egypt and the Sudan, that he is not likely to countenance the indiscriminate
                    flotation of an enormous amount of limited liability companies connected with
                    Egypt, when it is a notorious fact that in many oases these companies are being
                    launched without any genuine, definite object The name of Baring bears such a
                    high reputation in the city of London that one word of caution from his lordship
                    would be enough to guide the careless investor in regard to the prospects of
                    many of the companies now being placed wholesale before the public.</p>

                <p>The case of brigandage at Biahmo in the Fayoum, which occurred on the night of
                    the 5th May and of which full reports have been given in the “Egyptian Gazette,”
                    is still the subject of official inquiry.</p>
                <p>The latest reports which have been received by the Ministry of the Interior
                    inform us that the evidence pointed to certain natives of Nawamis village, Beni
                    Souef Moudirieh, being guilty of the crime and to part of the stolen property
                    being in their possession. The police officials therefore proceeded to this
                    village and arrested the suspected men. On searching their houses and those of
                    their relatives the police found some of the jewellery which had been stolen,
                    and which was identified by the victim of the attack, as belonging to him.</p>
                <p>During the inquiry one of Said Suliman’s (the victim’s) women-servants identified
                    one of the men who had been arrested, and declared that he had called her out
                    when the theft was being committee. The wife of another of the accused persons,
                    in whose possession some of the stolen goods had been found, confessed that
                    these were her husband’s share of the spoil, and also named seven of the
                    arrested men (13 in all) and affirmed that they had been with her husband when
                    the goods had been divided.</p>
                <p>It further transpired that another of the accused had met a silversmith who pays
                    visits to the villages of these parts to buy old jewellery and that he had
                    offered to sell some of the stolen jewellery to this man.</p>
                <p>The omdeh of the village deposed that some of the accused were absent from their
                    homes on the night of the crime. Furthermore, one of the villagers, in giving
                    evidence, said that he and his wife were walking towards the village from the
                    Fayoum they saw several of the accused walking in the direction of Biahmo.</p>
                <p>The charge is evidently well established against most of the accused men, and but
                    little doubt of their guilt remains. The inquiry is still being continued, and
                    it is hoped that further evidence will reveal the guilt of the arrested band and
                    furnish information which will lead to the rest of the stolen property being
                    recovered.</p>

These countries have an infinitesimal interest and hardly any subjects here, the only Spanish subject known to us besides a few officials and monks being H. E.

The cantankerous conduct of the representatives of these Powers in blocking measures on which England, France, and other Great Powers are in accord is a striking and humorous commentary on Egypt’s situation.</p>

                <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                <p>Dear Sir, — In your issue of yesterday "Humanitarian” protests against the
                    creation of a pigeon shooting club on the grounds of the Alexandria Sporting
                    Club, urging that the sport is a cruel one, and one that is being abandoned in
                    England chiefly owing disapprobation of Queen Alexandra.</p>
                <p>Might I be allowed to point out, firstly, that we are not in England, and
                    secondly, that there are many members of the Sporting Club who are not English,
                    and who consequently have other ideas on the subject In Spa and Ostend and Monte
                    Carlo any Englishman who protested against the existence of the famous pigeon
                    clubs there would scarcely obtain a hearing. Why, then, should the non-English
                    members of Alexandria be prevented from shooting pigeons, and in what way is
                    pigeon shooting more cruel than running a fox to death with a pack of hounds or
                    setting two greyhounds after a miserable hare ? — Yours obediently,
                    “Pigeon.”</p>
                <p>Alexandria, May 30.</p>
                <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                <p>Sir,—I should like to call your attention to one aspect of this question which
                    has not been touched upon in the two letters yon have published. Potting aside
                    the purely humanitarian point of view, is it fair to introduce, for the
                    amusement of a small minority, a “sport” which cannot be earned on without
                    destroying the pleasure and enjoyment of a large propor-tion of the members ?
                    Speaking for myself (and probably most other lady members will agree with me), I
                    could certainly no longer go there with any pleasure when the shooting is taking
                    place, knowing as I should that every report would mean the death knell of some
                    poor little bird, or still worse, that it should flutter about wounded, to be
                    finally caught and tortured, as it certainly would be in this country. Some may
                    disagree with me and think that it is mere sentimentality to condemn pigeon
                    shooting, but at any rate there can be no excuse for introducing it into a
                    general club such as the Sporting— practically the only general recreation
                    ground in Alexandria—especially in view of the fact that there are already other
                    places in the neighbourhood where people can indulge in this form of “sport"
                    without giving pain to others.</p>
                <p>Finally, I should like to know whether this question is to be decided by the
                    committee without any reference to the opinions of the members as a body ?—I am,
                    etc., M.S.</p>

                        <head type="item"><hi rend="italic">(Continued from Saturday.)</hi></head>
                        <p>A large part of the work of every Medical Mission is carried on among
                            out-patients, and to afford a glimpse of that branch of the work let me
                            quote from one of our nurses who has charge of the nursing in the
                            out-patients department. After mentioning two reasons for dwelling in
                            Egypt--primarily, to preach the Gospel, secondarily, to heal the
                            sick--she goes on to say : "If time and space permitted, we could tell
                            you much that would interest you. Many hundreds have this year received
                            healing at the hands of our doctors, while others have been less
                            fortunate, disease only offering a steady resistance to all treatment.
                            We have had during the hot weather some anxious cases in the village. I
                            was asked by the doctor go to a house where a little boy was lying
                            seriously ill with acute pneumonia. The friends, as is so often the
                            case, preferred to let the patient lie in a heap on the floor rather
                            than disturb him, to administer anything the doctor may have ordered. I
                            meant only to stay a short time, but the day wore on and I saw that
                            there would be no chacne for the recover if left to the friends. I went
                            away at 9 p.m. after seeing our faithful Sudanese nurse installed by his
                            side for the night. Thus we continued for ten days, but although
                            everything possible was done night and day, the child eventually died.
                            It was with sorrowful hearts that Gameela and I left the house at one
                            early dawn. The last night of vigil was a sad one as we vainly watched
                            for the least sign of improvement. The hour before dawn arrived when the
                            mosque was overlpooking the patient's house was dimly lighted and a
                            hopeless kind of voice winged through the air the call to prayer,
                            reminding the Moslem world of their allegiance to the Faith, which,
                            according to their belief, is to reign supreme when all other creeds
                            fail. The window of the room in which this poor little suffering form
                            lay commanded a view of the interior of the mosque, and you can imagine
                            how we wrestled in prayer for the recovery of the child, the healing of
                            whom we, in our ignorance, felt was to bring glory to God---but He
                            ordered otherwise, and the result of our work is yet to be seen.</p>
                        <p>"Here in Old Cairo, during the summer months we go on from day to day
                            with a temperature akin to a nice warm oven, and oh! how dirty the
                            people are. An old woman is crouched down before me, the personification
                            of dirt. She holds firmly to her lowly seat upon the floor, saying : "I
                            will not leave this spot until I have given you the history of my life."
                            The history, which we already well know, is prefaced by a few remarks
                            such as : "I beseech you to be careful." "Lighten the weight of your
                            hand upon my wound." "I am very needy." "Yes, my sister, your greatest
                            need at the present moment is a bath." "A bath!" exclaims the old lady.
                            "Why do you wish my spirit to leave my body so soon? I should die at
                            once." "Now take this piece of paper to the window from which you took
                            your number, and you will receive in return a bottle of "eye-drops." Use
                            them as I have told you and be sure you don't forget the bath." With
                            this parting injunction, she passes out through one door, but only to
                            creep in through another, crying out : "Oh lady! lengthen your patience.
                            It is very necessary that you have patience, for does not the healing of
                            my eye depend upon the use I make of the contents of this bottle? What
                            am I to do with it?" Then again the same instructions must be given, in
                            spite of the fact that a crowd of eye-operations are waiting to be
                            dressed, and there are many more patients to follow from the waiting
                            room."</p>
                        <p>The excellent work of our Armenian assistant, Dr. Abkar Dermarkarian, a
                            graduate of the Beyront medical school, deserves special mention. His
                            sphere of work lies in the eye department of our dispensary, and the
                            fact that over a thousand eye-operations have been performed at his hand
                            during the past twelve months gives some idea of the value of his
                            services.</p>
                        <p>Throughout the history of the Old Cairo Medical Mission the treatment of
                            Egyptian anemia (anchylostomiasis) has been one of its leading features.
                            During the past year there has been a remarkable increase in the number
                            of these patients, which has risen to 1,253, more than doubling the
                            number for 1903. All of these patients remain with us for a little over
                            three weeks and during that time receive regular daily instruction,
                            while a magical lantern service is held especially for them once a week.
                            The minds of these people are frequently very dense and ignorant, yet
                            one has often been impressed, especially at the lantern addresses, by
                            their attention and evident appreciation of the Gospel messages.</p>
                        <p>Reference has been made to the payment of fees by patients. Perhaps this
                            needs some explanation :– The "fellaheen" have become relatively so
                            "well-off" under equitable rule that it has of late years become
                            increasingly plain that the only right course is to charge patients a
                            small fee for medicine and operations in the dispensary, and food and
                            treatment in hospital, except of course in cases of real poverty. In
                            spite of a gradual increase in these fees, far more have come for
                            admission, and so much so, that, although a fee of over £1 is not often
                            paid, we have this year, as was mentioned above, been able to meet all
                            expenses of upkeep, and to have a balance in hand. Of course we cannot
                            be said to be "self-supporting" while the missionaries are supported
                            from "home," and in view also of the initial outlay, and heavy expenses
                            without return, in previous years. While we send those are very well off
                            to be treated privately by English physicians or surgeons in Cairo, we
                            regard the refusal to treat absolutely freely, shy but the</p>
                        <cb n="2"/>
                        <p>very poor, as not only fair and just to those native medical men trained
                            in the Government Medical School, but also right from the point of view
                            to the subscribers to the society's funds. Morever in regard to the
                            missionary aspect of the work we may say that, numbers having gone up by
                            leaps and bounds, the Gospel has been preached to far more hearers.</p>
                        <p>It would, I suppose, be difficult to find another labouring class so well
                            off as is that of Egypt now, and so we are able to do what is possible
                            to few, if any, other medical missions.</p>
                        <p>The number of patients attending dispensary has been altogether out of
                            proportion to the bed capacity of the hospital. Many whom it has been
                            impossible to turn away have had to be content with the floor, and many
                            have been refused admission for want of room. This lack of sufficient
                            ward accommodation has also caused serious inconvenience to doctors and
                            nurses. Thus the need for extra accommodation is urgent, but we are
                            thankful to say that it will be soon be supplied, for what has been
                            dreamed of and longed for throughout the ear will shortly be an
                            accomplished fact---a new hospital for women and children. This
                            projected hospital which will set free all the present accommodation for
                            men, is to be built with funds specially subscribed in memory of the
                            life and work of the late Mrs. Pain, who died at Old Cairo in December,

                        <p>In issuing this account of the work we wish to take the opportunity of
                            thanking the English surgeons and physicians resident in Cairo for their
                            unfailing kindness, and the valuable professional help they most readily
                            have given us at various times ; and finally once cannot close without
                            striking a note of praise and thankfulness to God for the measure of
                            success He has granted in our medical work. More than once or twice
                            prayer has been answered in the case of patients whose condition seemed
                            almost hopeless. May He, who in His mercy has graciously restored the
                            body in so many cases, stretch out His hand of power in His own good
                            time to heal many souls.</p>

                        <head type="sub">To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette</head>
                        <p>Dear Sir,––A few weeks ago the writer of "Under the Mosquito Net" alluded
                            to a remark I made to him to the effect that the American missionaries
                            in Egypt "do a lot of harm." Will you kindly allow me to explain what I
                            meant by saying this, otherwise a false impression may be created in the
                            minds of many people, who do not understand how these missionaries can
                            work harm. I will tell you. The intention of the Americans when they
                            commenced work in Egypt 50 years ago was to convert Mohamedans to
                            Christianity. They did not succeed, in fact they could not. So, as they
                            did not want to confess their failures and go back empty-handed, they
                            set to work to convert Copts! Now the Copts were as good Christians as
                            themselves, althought at that time they were much behind-hand in
                            education. Here was the missionaries' opportunity and they were quick to
                            seize it. But they have gone too far in their efforts to Westernise the
                            Copt, and Canon Oldfield has seen this as clearly as I do although,
                            perhaps, not being a Copt, he cannot feel so deeply about it as I do
                            myself. The Americans want to change the ancient Coptic form of worship
                            to that of Western Presbyterianism, taking no account of the fact that
                            the latter is totally unsuited to the Eastern mind, and so persistently
                            have they worked on those lines that those ducated by them now call
                            themselves Protestants, and take no interest in and give no help to
                            Coptic charities. This was very noticeable when the Coptic Patriarch was
                            collecting money for the Khartoum Cathedral. In my town many
                            "Protestants" (who were formerly Copts) refused to help, while in a near
                            village a Moslem lady gave L.E. 100! I repeat, the American missionaries
                            do a lot of harm, which is not any degree counterbalanced by the good
                            they do in other ways, such as educating the children, providing medical
                            necessities, and so on. I hope if attention is directed to this, that
                            the prejudice that unfortunately exists in the minds of some peopl
                            against the Coptic Egyptians may be removed, for an Unseen Hand has
                            undoubtedly preserved the Coptic Church through many centuries of bad
                            treatment and I feel sure that there is still a great future before it,
                            spite of all the attempts of the missionaries to reduce its influence,
                            if not to destroy it altogether. They cause divisions in families which
                            bring about great misery in many cases, and their treating the Copts as
                            if they were not already followers of Christ causes the Moslems to ask,
                            "How can the followers of one leader be so unfriendly and not in
                            sympathy with one another? Surely there must be something wrong
                            somewhere." For one of the great causes of the success of the Mohamedan
                            religion is the unity and love for one another that it teaches. Before
                            missions to Mohamedans can hope to succeed in Egypt the missionaries
                            must show that all sections of Christians are at one in Christ, and that
                            is what they have not hitherto done. Let them work <hi rend="italic"
                                >with</hi> the Copts instead of against them, and then there may be
                            some hope of their reaching the Moslems, and bringing them to see the
                            the beauty and power of the Christian religion.</p>

                        <head type="sub">To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</head>
                        <p>Dear Sir, --I am not often in the habit of trespassing upon your valuable
                            paper, and it is with reluctance I do so now, but I am forced to bring
                            to the notice of the public large, the disgraceful system which the
                            majority of the missionaries to the Jews who are sent here from Europe
                            adopt in order to convert the Jews to Christianity.</p>
                        <p>I have been a missionary to the Jews in Egypt for about 25 years and in
                            London for a good number of years previously, and am thoroughly
                            experienced with them, knowing their language and religion, their lives,
                            their good and bad habits, the latter of which predominate in the lower
                            classes, and I think that I have a right to speak to younger men who
                            have not had as much experience as myself, especially when I know them
                            to be in the wrong.</p>
                        <p>By <hi rend="italic">bribing</hi> the Jews with money they get them to
                            attend their meetings. The mere mention of money to poor men makes them
                            have an itching palm, and they say "where is your meeting?" They go and
                            listen, and if there are signs of more money to be had they get
                            converted to Christianity. Are they converted? Of course not, they will
                            be backsliders as soon as they leave the meeting, but they come back
                            again and get more money. In order to enrich themselves they sell the
                            Bibles which have been given to them (and which probably never have been
                            opened) ; they then go and join their intimate friends near the Fort
                            Napoleon, who are nearly all dealers in human flesh (commonly called
                            pimps), where they drink and play towla and dominoes, explaning to their
                            friends how they have made a fool of the Christian missionary who has,
                            instead of converting them to Christianity, only supplied them with
                            means to hasten them faster to the devil. But this is not the only
                            thing, the missionaries write home to their society stating what a grand
                            time they have had and how many converts they have made, for the more
                            they report the more money does the unfortunate society send out to them
                            to continue their progressive (?) work. This money is some of it
                            collected by little boys and girls belonging to the Sunday schools in
                            England who go from door to door, generally only getting halfpence and
                            pence, often in the coldest weather, risking their lives for the
                            purpose. This money is collected and sent out the foreign missionaries,
                            and see how it is wasted! absolutely thrown away in drink, and devoted
                            to a far different purpose than that for which it was collected. I
                            remember a Jew once coming to me begging for food and clothing as well
                            as lodging. As he was 70 years of age and seemed wretchedly poor I took
                            him in, after I had made certain enquiries as to where he had come from,
                            etc. I endeavoured to find him employment that would suit his years, and
                            during frequent conversations with him found he knew the Bible more
                            thoroughly than many missionaries whom I had come across. I asked him if
                            he was not a Christian, and he replied in the negative, stating that he
                            was a Russian Jew, but was desirous of being converted and baptised as a
                            Christian. I told him he had better wait a while and think it well over,
                            as I was not wishful for him to become a Christian and then return
                            immediately to be a Jew again. I never converted him, for he let slip
                            that he had already been baptised as a Christian years ago in the
                            Orthodox Church in Russia. He was endeavouring to obtain money from me
                            by becoming a Christian, but I knew all these little games too well to
                            be imposed upon. The rich Jews provide for their poor, as I think
                            everyone will know, consequently before these poor Jews are helped by
                            the Christians, the circumstances of the case should be thoroughly
                            looked into, and then food and clothing given, not money. The Jews have
                            one good hospital, where there are 5 or more doctors to attend to the
                            sick, and if any are too ill to attend, the doctors go to the patients'
                            houses, give them medicine, food, clothing, milk, pay their rent if they
                            cannot afford to do so, and all this gratis. The excuse given by the
                            missionaries by giving money to the Jews for attending their meetings is
                            charity! Is it charity when they give money (which in plain language is
                            a bribe) to be spent in drink, instead of education, food and clothing?
                            Not Christ's charity!</p>
                        <p>Another Jew came here from Jerusalem, who informed a worker that 9 years
                            ago he sold his religion and became a Christian, because he was informed
                            that the missionary would get him employment, which he did. When the
                            employment was finished he threatened preaching against Christianity.
                            Not a genuine convert, this. Time, trouble, money wasted, a situation
                            given as a bribe, and ridicule as a result. Such will always be the
                            result when a man does not get the true word of God in his heart, but
                            receives money only to say that he is a Christian and was converted at
                            such a place. One can hardly believe it, for it seems so outrageous, but
                            it is true, nevertheless. Such people only come for loaves and
                            fishes.</p>
                        <p>I could go on to multiply instances of this nature, but that I should
                            occupy too much of your valuable space. They all go to illustrate the
                            dodges practised in order to deceive the trusting missionaries, who, if
                            they are genuine, God-fearing men, must know in their own heart of
                            hearts that they are doing wrong. But they must show a result of their
                            work abroad, how their money has been spent ; and this is how it is
                            done. The people in England do not know under what circumstances the
                            money is spent and think the missionaries out here, judging by the
                            reports of the converts and promises of converts, are remarkably clever.
                            What a delusion!</p>
                        <p>When Jews have told me at what price they have been bought to change
                            their religion (which is never really changed) and I have seen how the
                            money was spent, I as a Christian have been ashamed of my co-workers.
                            They make an exhibition of themselves, and a laughing</p>
                        <cb n="4"/>
                        <p>stock of their religion. I bear offeence to no man ; I am writing this ––
                            and for the truth of every word I can vouch –– for the benefit of the
                            young missionaries to the Jews who perhaps may think they have been
                            acting for the best, but they could not further the progress of real
                            work <hi rend="italic">less</hi> than they have been doing. Let them now
                            change their method, and let us all do our best to preach the Gospel of
                            Divine love in the way he would desire us to and to live such lives
                            ourselves that others may see that it is good to be one of us, who live
                            with and for the Lord.</p>

                        <head type="sub">PROFESSOR PETRIE'S REPORT</head>
                        <p>Prof. Fliners Petrie writes as follows to the "Times" :––</p>
                        <p>Sir, –– The earlier part of the work of this expedition, at Wady Maghara,
                            has been already stated in the "Times" (January 1905), but the later
                            part of the work at Sarabit el Khadem has proved much the longer and
                            more important. This temple is situated in the desert, at a distance of
                            five days' camel journey from Suez. Though discovered in the middle of
                            the eighteenth century, no visitors to this temple have stayed more than
                            a day or two, and scarcely any digging had been done in the ruins. The
                            difficulties of providing for a camp in so remote a wilderness had
                            prevented serious work there ; and it required a good deal of
                            arrangement to keep a party of over 30 workers during several weeks that
                            were occupied in the excavations and copying. This work was undertaken
                            for the Egypt Exploration Fund by myself and party ; and after the
                            excavating was finished Mr. Currelly made an examination of the <hi
                                rend="italic">nawqmis</hi> or beehive tombs of Sinai, and also
                            reopened the study of Pithom for the Egyptian Research Account.</p>
                        <p>The temple of Sarabit el Khadem –– "the heights of the fortress" stands
                            on the edge of a plateau, many hundreds of feet above the desert valley
                            which lies to the north of it. The whole plateau is deeply divided by
                            precipitous gorges, so that it is reduced to a row of tongues of land.
                            To ascend the plateau from its edge is difficult, and too tedious for
                            daily work ; to live on the plateau is impractical, as it is beyond the
                            reach of camel transport for water ; a valley was therefore chosen which
                            winds gradually upward from the south, and is not on any map or record
                            hitherto made, though well known to the Bedawin. At the head of this
                            valley the camp was pitched ; and a climb of a few hundred feet every
                            day, up the natural staircase of the sandstone mountain side, led the
                            workers to the temple site.</p>
                        <p>The neighborhood was evidently sacred from early times. The ridge on
                            which the temple was built is crowded with stone pillars, both natural
                            and wrought, usually in connexion with a small shelter of rough stones.
                            The system of visiting sacred sites in order to obtain oracular dreams
                            is familiar in Syria, and extended to Asia Minor and Egypt. Such a dream
                            was commemorated by setting up a pillar as a memorial, of which a
                            well-known case is that in the story of Jacob. Thus these Bethel stones
                            are found usually in the stone shelter used by the pilgrim, which is
                            sometimes a mere wind-break of a few loose stones, and sometimes a
                            tolerable wall. But in no case are tehse shelters grouped together in
                            the manner of huts for regular habitation. Some of the pillars or Bethel
                            stones have Egyptian inscriptions of the XIIth dynasty, showing how
                            early the system prevailed ; but most of them are natural blocks set on
                            end. Such a system is quite unknown in Egypt.</p>
                        <p>The centre of worship here was a rock cave about 15ft. long and 9ft.
                            wide, which was dedicated by the Egyptians to the goddess Hathor, but
                            that name was commonly applied to any foreign goddess, and it is
                            probably here a substitute for a local divinity of the native tribes.
                            This cave was found to contain two large altars dedicated under Senusert
                            III. and Amenemhat III. of the XIIth dynasty. It had been supposed that
                            this cave had been a tomb, as there was an inscription for a high
                            official on the side wall ; but the same official inscribed the later of
                            these two altars for the goddess, showing that this cave was then a
                            shrine. And it was usual for the high officials in charge of the
                            expeditions to place their names as prominently at those of the Kings,
                            on all the monuments here. The front of this cave was at the same period
                            covered with a facing of carved stone ; and a portico was added to it,
                            enclosed in front by a row of great steles. These steles, and about a
                            dozen more, were all records of the mining expeditions ; they are blocks
                            of the local sand stone, 8ft. to 12ft. high, bearing the date and Royal
                            titles, the names of the chief of the expedition and of his party, often
                            up to 50 or even to 100, and the totals of the soldiers, workmen,
                            sailors, sculptors, artists, smelters, &amp;c., who formed the
                            expedition, together with the lists of animals and provisions. These
                            records will give a thorough view of the arrangement of these
                            expeditions, when they are analysed and compared.</p>
                        <p>In front of this shrine was a great place of burnt offerings. Over more
                            than 100ft. in length extended a bed of white ashes, up to a foot and a
                            half thick. No bones were found in this bed, but only some pieces of
                            pottery, which seem to be of the XIIth Dynasty. Such a great mass of
                            burning is quite unknown in Egyptian temples. Beside this some small
                            cylindrical altars of stone were found in the cave and in the court, one
                            with burning on the top of it ; probably these were for offering
                            incense.</p>
                        <p>After this age, about a thousand years later, Thothmes III., and his
                            co-regent, Queen Hatshepsut, built much here, over the bed of burnt
                            ashes. A court for ablutions was added, having a stone basin in the
                            midst and four pillars around it, each with faces of the goddess Hathor.
                            This court has exactly the arrangement of the <hi rend="italic"
                                >hanafiyeh</hi> of a mosque, and it shows that the mosque type is at
                            least 2,000 years older that Mohamed ; this is another instance of how
                            the most prominent practices of Islam were taken over from older
                            customs. A later <hi rend="italic">hanafiyeh</hi> court was added by
                            Rameses IV. Of the same age are several courts and chambers, and a pylon
                            in Egyptian style which formed a front to the whole group.</p>
                        <p>Later Kings gradually added a long line of chambers before the pylon.
                            Tahutmes IV., Amenhotep II. and III., Sety I., and Rameses II. all made
                            additions. These chambers were</p>
                        <cb n="2"/>
                        <p>all small, and apparently entirely roofed in. They seem most probably to
                            have been intended to accommodate pilgrims who came to sleep before the
                            shrine, seeking oracular dreams. One chamber was partly occupied as a
                            workshop, and two large chisels of bronze were found amid the material
                            there. It is very strange how all of these chambers were built with a
                            stone lining and then completely buried outside in a heap of loose
                            blocks, so that they had no external walls. They thus formed an
                            artificial prolongation of the sacred cave, a plan and nature of
                            construction quite unknown in ancient Egypt. This temple, then, though
                            built and inscribed by Egyptiaus, is entirely on a foreign model ; the
                            Bethels around it, the enormous mass of ashes of burnt sacrifices, the
                                <hi rend="italic">hanafiyeh</hi> courts, and the subterranean
                            chambers, apparently for pilgrims, all belong to Semitic rather than
                            Egyptian worship. We have here the only Semitic temple preserved to us,
                            and its arrangements will need careful study in relation to early
                            Semitic worship.</p>
                        <p>The purpose of the Egyptian expeditions was further ascertained. Not only
                            Wady Maghara but also Sarabit of Khadem were visited solely for
                            turquoises. The ferruginous band under which the turquoises are found
                            lies between the same varieties of sandstone at both places. In the Wady
                            Nasb the base of the sandstone resting on the black granite is exposed,
                            and this was the source of copper. In the bottom of the Wady Nasb lies a
                            mass of copper slag about 500ft. long, nearly as wide, and 6ft. or 8ft.
                            thick. The ore was probably brought here from various mines in the
                            valley, in order to use the fuel which grew by the spring in this
                            spot.</p>
                        <p>The great mass of Egyptian inscriptions were copied in full-size
                            facsimile, the only satisfactory way of recording such monuments. About
                            250 inscriptions were thus reproduced, of all sizes up to many square
                            yards in area. These will be all published, with the plans, by the
                            Exploration Fund ; and, beside this work for students, I will also issue
                            separately a more popular volume describing and illustrating the country
                            and its antiquities, and discussing the questions of its climate and
                            Biblical history.</p>
                        <p>The smaller monuments which could be removed on camel-back were brought
                            away and about 50 inscriptions and sculptures will be exhibited. The
                            Arabs say that about 18 years ago a traveller removed the upper part of
                            a statue, if so, it is much to be hoped that it may be traced, as the
                            lower part of a statue of Rameses has been found which may rejoin it. A
                            great quantity of offerings to the goddesss were deposited here ;
                            bangles, tablets with heads and with cats drawn on them, wands, sistra,
                            and ornaments. These bore the names of various Kings of the XVIIIth-XXth
                            dynasties, from Amenhotep I. to Rameses VI. ; and though none of them
                            can be rejoined completely, they show the profusion of decorative
                            objects which crowded the temple until its desolation in the twelfth
                            century B.C. The most beautiful and valuable piece is a portrait head of
                            Queen Thyi from a statuette. The burial place of her parents, it will be
                            remembered, was lately found by Mr. Quibell and Mr. Theodore Davies, as
                            described in "The Times." This portrait of the Queen is the first that
                            has been found in the round, and is one of the finest style of her
                            period. It will be shown in London, but has to be returned to the Cairo
                            Museum.</p>
                        <p>After exhausting the small grant made by the Exploration Fund, Mr.
                            Currelly explored further for the Research Account. The rubbish heaps at
                            the Convent of St. Catharine proved unfruitful, owing to the winter
                            snows soaking the earth and destroying any documents which might have
                            been thrown away there. The small stone structures called <hi
                                rend="italic">nawamis</hi> were found to be made with great
                            regularity and exactitude, and they do not belong to any late period.
                            They seem to be for the burials of a people who were accustomed to
                            well-constructed tombs, and who had more civilisation than is likely to
                            have arisen in these valleys, probably immigrants from Egypt at some
                            early date. After this Mr. Currelly made some examination of buildings
                            at Pithom which have been described as store chambers. He found that
                            they were part of the substructure of a great fort, similar to the forts
                            of Nankratis and Daphnae. It will be a matter of great interest to see
                            further whether this type of fort (which is only yet known in Greek
                            sites) was an old Egyptian form. The age of the building must be
                            ascertained, and the connexion of it with the temple and other
                            structures. The annual exhibition of the discoveries will be held at
                            University College, Gower-street, as usual during July.</p>
                        <p>Owing to the heavy expenditure of the last few years, the committee of
                            the Egypt Exploration Fund have been obliged to renounce the idea of
                            excavating any fresh site before finishing the work on Deir al Bahr, in
                            1907 or later. The Fund is therefore withdrawn from my work, which it
                            has supported for nine years past. I am therefore obliged to adapt the
                            Egyptian Research Account, which I am intending to maintain in Egypt
                            next winter. A small committee will administer the Research Account, and
                            all support for my work must be addressed to the secretary, Egyptian
                            Research Account. University College, Gower-street, London, W.C. All
                            objects found will be presented, as hitherto, to public museums.</p>

                        <p>A story with a moral comes from Uganda. A lion, thinking it about time to
                            lunch, seized a white man, and bit at him. His teeth went through a
                            bottle of whiskey, which the man was carrying in his pocket, and this
                            gave him such a shock that he turned tail. The moral is obvious. Do not
                            be a teetotaller. If this man had been a teetotaller, he would have been
                            eaten. It is better to be drunk than eaten.</p>

                        <p>A match was played between the above teams at Suez on 24th inst. The
                            E.T.C., winning the toss, elected to bat first, and compiled a score of
                            87 ; thanks chiefly to the batting of Messrs. Toms and Nosworthy, the
                            latter making his runs in four strokes. The naval men, although starting
                            badly by losing three wickets for six runs, managed to come off
                            victorious, which was due to a fine stand by Rev. Lester and Mr. Benn.

                        <p>London, May 20.</p>
                        <p>The following officers are seconded for service in the Egyptian Army,
                            Captains G. G. M. Blomfield and D. V. H. Bengough, Royal Warwickshire
                            Regiment, and Lieutenant C. H. T. Lucas, Royal Berkshire Regiment.</p>
                        <p>The swift and very severe punishment which followed the "ragging" case on
                            the cruiser "Kent" (Captain Gamble) will no doubt put an end to the
                            pranks of the "young gentlemen" aboard ship. A middy who had been tried
                            by a mock court-martial and sentenced to a caning in a degrading manner,
                            resented the infliction of the caning, and in the course of the
                            proceedings he whipped out a revolver and shot one of the chief
                            aggressors in the mouth. The youngster who protected himself from an
                            insult has been withdrawn by his parents from the Navy, all the others
                            immediately concerned have been punished, and the captain placed on
                            half-pay.</p>
                        <p>According to the present arrangements, the 3rd Battalion Royal
                            Warwickshire Regiment –– which is largely composed of Birmingham men ––
                            will embark on the hired transport "Dunera" at Gibralltar on the 13th of
                            June en voyage for the Cape. The battalion, which is commanded by
                            Lieutenant Colonel P. R. Mockler, with Major F. G. F. Browne second in
                            command, will proceed to Standerton in the Transvaal on arrival at
                            Durban about the 4th of July.</p>
                        <p>To-day at Chatham the first-class battleship "Africa" was launched. The
                            "Christening" ceremony was gracefully performed by the Marchioness of
                            Londonderry in the presence of a large and fashionable assembly. The
                            "Africa" is of the "King Edward VII.," type. She measures 457 feet in
                            length, has a beam of 78 feet and a displacement of 16,350 tons. Her
                            engines are of 18,000 h.p., and her armament will include four 12-inch
                            guns of the much criticised wire round type, mounted in pairs in hooded
                            barbettes, four 9.2 guns on the corners of the superstructure, ten
                            6-inch guns in the maindeck central battery, fourteen 12-pounders, the
                            same number of 3-pounders, two maxims, and four 18-inch submerged
                            torpedo tubes. When in commission as a private ship she will carry a
                            crew of 777 officers and men. The waterline is protected by a 9 inch
                            belt and the barbettes and other gun positions are heavily armoured. The
                            central battery is after the design of that of the Japanese battleship
                            Mikasa.</p>
                        <p>The rumours which have been current for some time past regarding the
                            removal of the Royal Engineers from Chatham have been much exaggerated.
                            So far as can be gathered, the authorities are merely looking for some
                            more desirable training ground than can be found at Chatham ; and for
                            some time past inquiries in this direction have been made in Wales and
                            elsewhere. Salisbury has now been fixed upon as most likely to fulfil
                            the rquired conditions. But the move will hardly be felt at Chatham. The
                            School of Military Engineering will be retained as the headquarters and
                            depot of the dismounted branches of the corps, while the mounted
                            services will remain at Aldershot as before.</p>
                        <p>Discussing Imperial Defence, the "Spectator" maintains that we want a
                            system which shall be ready to mete not only the emergencies of a given
                            moment, but those now invisible. This proposition, translated into
                            action, "means a regular professional army of about the strength that we
                            possess to-day. It means a militia and yeomanry encouraged and improved
                            by better handling at the War Office and with appropriate reserves. It
                            means a volunteer force in which every man shall be admitted who desires
                            to be admitted, and in respect of whom his corps shall receive a grant
                            suitable to the amount of time and trouble he can give to training. It
                            means, finally, the education of every youth in the nation up to the age
                            of seventeen in physical training of a military character, including the
                            use of the rifle. With compulsory service the State should have nothing
                            to do. She only wants willing hands. What however, she has a right to
                            do, and ought</p>
                        <cb n="5"/>
                        <p>to do, is to make it impossible for any man in the hour of her need to
                            say to her :–– 'I am ready to fight for you and die for you, but as you
                            never took the trouble to give me any instruction in art of war, I can
                            only offer you a maimed and useless service.'</p>
                        <p>"This is the army that we need. This is the army which will safeguard the
                            nation, whether Mr. Balfour's assurances that invasion is impossible
                            turn out to be true or false. It is an army which will enable us to meet
                            a raid or a real invasion, or at a great Imperial crisis to pour troops
                            overseas as we poured them during the Boer War, but to pour them far
                            more effectively. It is an army designed not merely to meet visible
                            contingencies, but those which are for the moment invisible. It
                            organises, for whatever work it may be required, the willing manhood of
                            the nation."</p>
                        <p>It is notorious that the establishment of a new order of things, founded
                            on a recognition of the fact that the prevention of disease is the
                            primary and vital function of the medical service of the army, was, says
                            the "British Medical Journal," so vehemently opposed by the medical
                            authorities that the strongest pressure from high quarters was needed to
                            bring it into being. How little they have even now taken to hear the
                            teaching of our terrible experience in South Africa is shown by the
                            readiness with which they fall back into the old ways as soon as any
                            scare that galvanises them into an appearance of activity dies out. Only
                            one "modern instance" need be cited.</p>
                        <p>Three years ago the Advisory Board recommended that lectures on military
                            sanitation should be given to the cadets at Woolwich and Sandhurst and
                            to the officers going through the special course of training at the
                            Staff College. It can scarcely be denied that at the present day an
                            intelligent grasp of the sanitary problems which must inevitably arise
                            in a campaign is an essential part of the training of an officer ; it is
                            indeed the want of such knowledge in military commanders of the old
                            school that has been the cause of immense waste of life and terrible
                            disasters. These courses have been given during the last two years, and
                            it speaks well for the intelligence of the future officers of the
                            British army that they were thoroughly interested in the subject and
                            fully appreciated the value of the lectures. Now the War Office, for no
                            apparent reason, has reduced the lectures to a number that makes
                            anything like an adequate treatment of the subject impossible.</p>
                        <p>It is the old, old story. South Africa is forgotten, and Manchuria is a
                            long way off ; why, then, trouble about things as to which Parliament
                            and the public are like indifferent? … But the men are to whose hands is
                            entrusted the defence of the country seem to be smitten with blindness
                            in regard to the health of the fighting machines under their
                            direction.</p>

                            or stomach troubles. It also acts as a preventative and keeps the system
                            in a healthy condition so that it easily throws off disease. It is an
                            excellent tonic and a great appetizer and as a large number of those who
                            have been using it speak very highly of its curative powers, I am
                            satisfied that my opinion of it is correct, and that it is deserving of
                            high praise."</p>

                        <head type="sub">Mr. W. CATERER, 3 Mess, H.M.S. "FORMIDABLE," Gibraltar,
                            writes :––</head>
                        <p>"I have the pleasure of writing to you to express our opinion as regards
                            to your valuable Vi-Cocoa. We have had rather arduous times since we
                            left Portsmouth, a month ago, having had to coal ship four times, being
                            mostly night work. Whilst in the collier shovelling and hauling bags
                            about we have become very tired and languid, and when we get a little
                            time to have our meals we have made a nice drop of Vi-Cocoa, which is
                            both refreshing and nourishing, and when we turn to our work we seem as
                            though we could carry on with our work for a much longer time without
                            feeling fatigued. Of course we could not do so if we had not take,
                            Vi-Cocoa.</p>
                        <p>We all use it in this mess everymorning, as we find it more sustaining
                            than the ordinary ship's cocoa which the Service allows us. We have
                            recommended it to all our shipmates. There is a lot of remarks passed by
                            several of the ship's company about all our messmates being so bright
                            and cheerful, and they ask us the reason as we all belong to what is
                            called in this ship as the comical party and we tell them that Vi-Cocoa
                            makes us like it, and they say they will give it a trial.</p>
                        <p>"You are at liberty to publish this letter of praise as you please."</p>
                        <p>You must have read the striking testimony that is being published daily
                            respecting the merits of Vi-Cocoa. And yet you have not tried it. We
                            advise you do so at once.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Tibbles' Vi-Cocoa can be obtained in 6d. tins from all grocers ; or
                            the Proprietors will send you free a dainty smaple tin upon receipt of a
                            postcard to 60 Bunhill Row, London. E.C. a sking them to do so.</p>

                            <p><hi rend="italic">Defectuosites du transport et du
                                debarquement.</hi></p>
                            <p>Les animaux importes a Alexandrie sont transportes en general par des
                                bateaux speciaux, dans lesquels les properietaires ne se preoccupent
                                que d'une chose : faire penetrer le maximum d'animaux dans un
                                endroit donne sans songer aux regles les plus elementaires de
                                l'hygiene ; pour eux le betail est une merchandise que l'on doit
                                pouvoir, a l'instar du coton, "presser" a volonte. Aussi,
                                qu'arrive-t-il? C'est que ces malheureuses betes entassees dans la
                                cale tres obscure, non aeree ou les soins les plus vulgaires de
                                proprete font completement defaut, respirent un air vicie qui
                                corrompt les muscles quand il n'occasionne pas d'accidents
                                mortels.</p>
                            <p>On comprend que l'Administration soit a peu pres entierement desarmee
                                ; les mesures de protection devraient etre prises au port
                                expediteur.</p>
                            <p>Le mode de debarquement se pratique d'une facon scandaleuse : presque
                                toujours les moutons sont attaches 6 on 7 ensemble par un membre
                                posterieur et hisses de la cale a terre ou sur les maones ; quant
                                aux boeufs ou buffles, une corde leur est passee autour de la tete a
                                la base des cornes et ils sont descendus a quai de la meme maniere
                                qu'une marchandise quelconque, balle de coton, sac de farine, etc.;
                                bien peu d'animaux, sont regulierement debarques, c'est-a-dire avec
                                une sorte de tablier passant sous la poitrine pour se replier sur le
                                dos, d'ou un crochet permet a la grue d'operer convenablement le
                                dechargement. La Municipalite subventionnant la Societe protectrice
                                des animaux pourrait attirer son attention sur ce point qui est plus
                                particulierement de sa competence.</p>
                            <p><hi rend="italic">Insuffisance de la nourriture</hi></p>
                            <p>Les animaux, pendant toute la duree de la traversee, au moins ceux de
                                provenance syrienne, observent un jenue absolu; ni nourriture solide
                                ou liquide; si bien que la mer etant agitee (le fait s'est presente
                                il y a deux mois a peine) ces malheureuses betes sont obligees de
                                faire de l'autophagie pendant une duree de 8 jours quelquefois, mais
                                qui n'est jamais inferieure a 72 heures! Ici encore il est
                                profondement regrettable que l'administration ne puisse efficacement
                                intervenir ;les sanctions feraient completement defaut.</p>
                            <p>Mais ou l'on peut agir, je pense, c'est en obligeant les
                                proprietaires a donner, dans les parcs quarantenaires, une ration
                                d'entretien</p>

                            <p>suffisante ; on pourrait prier l'administration interessee de bien
                                vouloir imposer une quantite de nourriture qu'on lui laisserait
                                naturellement le soin de fixer elle-meme. Cette question avait ete
                                soumise a son appreciation pendant le cours de l'annee 1900 sur la
                                proposition de la Municipalite ; je pense qu'il y a lieu de revenir
                                de nouveau a la charge.</p>

                                insuffisant pour permettre aux animaux de se refaire des fatigues
                                d'un voyage aussi penible: quatre jours pleins devraient au moins
                                etre exiges. Cette question est reglee par des accords
                                internationaux que seul le gouvernment pourrait porter devant le

                        <p>Cotons.—Il y a eu changement d'allure sur toute la ligne, l'avant-bourse
                            de Liverpool n'ayant pas ete de nature a relever le marche de la
                            lourdeur produite par les fortes realisations qui ont eu lieu. La
                            cloture a donc ete calme, mais une reprise est certaine au premier signe
                            de soutien venant du dehors.</p>
                        <p>Graines de coton.—Le disponible n'ayant pas bouge du nouveau d'hier et
                            les vendeurs s'etant presentes en grand nombre, la reaction a ete
                            sensible. Hull aussi nous est venu un peu plus calme.</p>

                <p>Paris, May 25.</p>
                    <p>An article published in the "Lanterne" brings home to us the fact that, at
                        the end of a few short months, M. Loubet's term of office as President of
                        the French Republic will have expired. A little known man, M. Loubet's
                        election came as a surprise to most Frenchmen, and only those moving in the
                        inner circles of the political world could tell the story of the intrigues
                        which led up to the choice of so unfancied an outsider. But well has it
                        turned out for the Republic that such a selection was imposed, for during
                        the six years that M. Loubet has dignified the high office of Chief of the
                        State France has become stronger and more self-confident, and has regained
                        much of the moral influence in the world's councils of which the disasters
                        of "l'annee terrible" had deprived her. Cooler-headed and more patient than
                        Carnot, utterly free from the ostentation of Felix Faure, M. Loubet has
                        known how to reconcile conflicting political interests and close up the
                        Republican ranks. When he entered the Elysee, France was in the throes of an
                        agitation which threatened to end in civil war ; thanks to his choice and
                        support of able and fearless Ministers, that danger is past and the Republic
                        stands, for the first time in its history, on really solid foundations. M.
                        Loubet has more than once expressed the keen delight with which he looks
                        forward to the time when he may lay down the cares of office and again
                        become a private citizen, and if he allows himself to be nominated for a
                        second term, it will be because his friends have persuaded him that in such
                        a course his duty to the country lies.</p>
                    <p>Rumour is again busy with the alleged approaching resignation of M. Delcasse.
                        Such an event is, no doubt, possible ; but it seems reasonable to look for
                        the most obvious explanation of the present revival of the report to the
                        disappointment of the Socialists at their recent failure in the Chamber to
                        score any points off Government over the question of French neutrality in
                        the Far East. From the standpoint of French interests in Morocco, it is much
                        to be hoped that M. Delcasse means to stick to his post. While there are
                        rumours (apparently made in Germany) that the Moors have rejected all the
                        proposals of the French Ambassador, the German Envoy has arrived at Fez, has
                        had prompt audience of the Sultan, and has been very well received. Mr.
                        Lowther has also arrived, and for the time being, the members of the various
                        Missions appear to be exchanging the preliminary courtesies before
                        proceeding to enter upon the diplomatic conflict which will make Fez one of
                        the most interesting spots on the world's surface for the student of
                        international affairs during the coming summer. As I have already remarked,
                        this summer is likely to be a warm one at the Court of Sultan
                        Abdul-Aziz.</p>
                    <p>In discussing the question of neutrality in the Far East, M. de Lanessan says
                        in "Le Siecle" that the forbearance shown by the French Government with
                        regard to the Russian Admiral during the last five or six months could not
                        fail to arouse complaints and protests from Japan. "In fact, such has been
                        the case, and we have been compelled to give them immediate satisfaction,
                        and to own that we did wrong. Would it not have been wiser and better not to
                        have exposed ourselves to such a humiliation? No cause of disagreement
                        existed between Japan and France. Our relations with the Japanese in the Far
                        East have always been excellent, as they always have been in Paris. Why,
                        then, did we offend the interests and amour propre of a country with which
                        it is to our great advantage to maintain only friendly relations? And all of
                        this has happened, it must not be forgotten, because our diplomacy has never
                        dared to speak in St. Petersburg in the only language which is fitting in
                        France: that is, the language of a royal and faithful ally, but the
                        language, at the same time, of a nation which is conscious of its own
                        interests, of its power, and of its dignity."</p>
                    <p>Events in Morocco and the Far East have awakened public attention here to the
                        need of a strong navy, and the "Temps" has opened its columns to
                        correspondence on the subject. The most interesting letter yet received is
                        signed by M. Edouard Lockroy, some time Minister of Marine. The letter is
                        remarkably because it rejects many of the theories on which French naval
                        engineers have worked for many years, and admits that the principle which
                        has guided British naval constructors is sound. M. Lockroy points out that,
                        owing to the rise of the United States and Japan as naval Powers, the old
                        ideas, which has governed the designs of French warships, that future
                        battles for supremacy on the seas must be fought out in European waters, is
                        exploded, and that the limited range of action of French ships, due to their
                        small coal capacity, unfits them for the duties they may be called upon to
                        perform.</p>
                <cb n="2"/>
                <p>Very concisely M. Lockroy lays it dodwn that the foreign policy of the country
                        necessitates a fleet with a wide range of action ; that strategy requires
                        speed and tactics gun power. In order to combine these three essential
                        elements, he argues, it is necessary to increase the tonnage and cost of
                        vessels, and the country must be prepared to spend 40 millions of francs on
                        a single ship if she would have a navy capable of holding its own in a
                        modern sea fight. The ex-Minister of Marine then goes on to make some
                        interesting comparisons between the cost of warship building in France and
                        in other European countries. He finds that France pays more per ton for new
                        construction than any other nation, and gets less for it in the way of speed
                        and efficiency. For instance, the "Charlemagne", which displaces 4,000 tons
                        less than the "Majestic", cost 2 millions of francs more to build. The
                        amount paid in wages in England per ton displacement is one-tenth less than
                        in France, though the workmen are better paid in the former country. There
                        is a greater difference still in the cost of material, England paying
                        four-tenths less than France per ton of displacement.</p>
                    <p>The passing of the bill for the separation of Church and State during the
                        existence of the present Parliament becomes more and more improbable every
                        day, as the interminable discussion on sub-section 4 drags out its weary
                        length. At the present rate of progress the bill cannot be voted in time for
                        it to be sent to the Senate before the commencement of the vacation in July,
                        and when the Chambers meet again in October they will be fully occupied in
                        dealing with the Budget for 1906, which must be voted before the dissolution
                        in March next. The balance of public opinion is in favor of the measure, and
                        deputies who owe their seats to Separatist votes dare not risk them by open
                        opposition to the bill. But, as I have pointed out before, there is a
                        curious unwillingness on the part of many members of Parliament to be
                        responsible for its passing into law, and progress is delayed as much by
                        professed supporters as by avowed opponents. Now, too, the intimate
                        relations which are evidently being established between Germany and the
                        Vatican have given pause to many, and people are asking themselves whether
                        Germany is not already preparing to take the place of the eldest child of
                        the Church, which France would vacate by tearing up the Concordat. It
                        becomes necessary to answer the question –– Will French influence suffer in
                        consequence? As a reply is not easy to find, the result will probably be
                        that Church and State will not be separated during the existence of the
                        current Parliament.</p>
                    <p>M. Combes and his sequestration law have left to the French Law Courts a
                        heritage of litigation for which he and they little bargained. In
                        sequestrating the property of the property of the monastic congregations, no
                        account was taken of the position of those members who had taken with them
                        private property on the understanding that their future was provided for in
                        the common life of the body. Now they are deprived of that provision, and
                        the question arises as to their rights. Among the brothers of the Christian
                        schools alone, five hundred different suits for restitution have been
                        entered, which would occupy one court for a year and a half at least. As it
                        is probable that at least an equal number of such cases will arise in every
                        congregation affected, the outlook seems to be little less than
                        appalling.</p>
                    <p>There is no extravagance in the supposition that the recent sitting of the
                        Academy of Medicine in Paris may turn out to be the most remarkable meeting
                        in the history of medicine. For some time past, the most eminent
                        bacteriologists have been devoting all their energies to the discovery of
                        the microbe of a certain disease, which is hereditary beyond all other
                        diseases, which simulates almost every known complaint, is the chief cause
                        of nervous and arterial lesions, and is responsible for the infliction of
                        more misery upon the guilty and upon the innocent than any other disorder
                        which afflicts mankind. For long the bacillus eluded all research, but it
                        has at last been tracked down and identified as spirochaete pallida, a long,
                        pale, infinitesimal, and evenascent being which offers peculiar difficulties
                        for the observer, both from its minuteness and from the fact that it is
                        specifically refractory to staining for miscroscopic purposes. The
                        identification is a triumph of bacteriological skill, and it is hard to
                        over-estimate its possible results to the human race. The discovery of the
                        microbe is not, as have unfortunately learned in the case of tubercolosis,
                        always the same thing as the discovery of the anti-toxin, but is the first
                        and greatest step in that direction, and that is no reason why the Schaudinn
                        bacillus, as it is called after its discoverer, should prove more
                        intractable than the bacilli of small-pox, anthrax, hydrophobia, diphtheria,
                        and splenic fever. To conquer the disease which it produces would be not
                        merely to relieve a vast amount of suffering, often cruelly undeserved, but
                        to rescue humanity from the most degenerating influence to which it is
                        subjected, and to deliver thousands yet</p>

                    <p>unborn from a curse which poisons the very springs of life.</p>
                    <p>Excessive competition being one of the roundabout ways to mutual
                        understanding, Marseille and Genoa are beginning, after a long course of
                        cut-throat tactics, to wonder whether a more comfortable live and let live
                        policy could not be devised. Many are beginning to say aloud that
                        accommodation is quite possible, and M. Meline, the leader of French
                        Protectionists, is heading the movement in France. He urges that the two
                        cities, laying aside their strife, should agree on proposals which their
                        united pressure would compel the Governments of the two countries to accept.
                        Such are the sweet uses of retaliation.</p>
                    <p>Not content with the Forty Immortals of the Palais Mazarin, France is now, it
                        seems, to have another Academie Francaise, one devoted to the cult of "Le
                        Sport." The first twenty members of the "Academie Sportive" have been
                        elected by the readers of a motoring journal, and the elect will now proceed
                        to co-opt another score of persons. The twenty already chosen are rather
                        curious specimens of "Sport," as it is understood in the land whence our
                        neighbours have borrowed the word. They include eight motorists, two
                        balloonists, and a novelist. As to racing, hunting, shooting, cricket,
                        football, running, rowing, swimming, tennis, or golf, they are not
                        represented at all, so far. What the functions of the Sporting Immortals
                        will be ; but then there are actually irreverent persons who fail to
                        perceive the utility of even the wearers of the "palmes vertes" themselves.
                        We shall watch the completion of the sacred number, and the development of
                        their programme, with feelings of sportive interest.</p>
                    <p>The splendid reception given in Paris to a representative body of British

                <div type="item"><head>THE NILE AS A COMMERCIAL RIVER</head>
                    <p>The Alexandria correspondent of the "Times" Engineering Supplement says that
                        there is evidence that the question of fluvial navigation upon the Nile is
                        beginning to engage the serious attention of engineers and public men in
                        Egypt. Sir Hanbury Brown has recently, in an admirable series of papers,
                        illustrated the more prominent defects of the Nile and its branches as
                        commercial waterways. He has shown that the Government, in perfecting the
                        irrigative power of the Nile, has to a large extent neglected the river's
                        navigable resources. Nor does the situation of the Government, with its
                        valuable possession of the State railways, allow it to view the Nile as
                        anything but a formidable competitive route, likely at any moment to assume
                        undesirable proportions. This being so, Nile development becomes a question
                        principally of private enterprise, one, moreover, in which British capital
                        and enterprise are largely interested, because they are bound sooner or
                        later to be called upon to aid in the opening up the great waterway, if,
                        indeed, they do not attempt it upon their own initiative. It is fitting,
                        therefore, that private enterprise should be made acquainted with the early
                        stages of the subject.</p>
                    <p>Quite recently in Cairo, at an interesting conference, M. Leroux, the
                        president of the Societe des Sucreries et Raffineries d'Egypte, summed up
                        the chief bearings of the case by saying that the efficiency of the Nile for
                        commercial navigation would begin as soon as easy and unfailing
                        communication was assured between the capital and the sea. This primary <hi
                            rend="italic">desideratum</hi> can only be secured by the remodelling
                        and improvement of the main junction canals ––<hi rend="italic"> i.e.</hi>,
                        the Behera and the Mahmoudieh ––an operation which lies solely within the
                        competence of the Government. The result would be to have a waterway
                        navigable at all season for vessels of fair tonnage.</p>
                    <p>M. Leroux calculates the amount of merchandise that would pass the first year
                        from and into Cairo alone at 2 ½ million tons ; but this estimate may be
                        reckoned to be rather an under than an over statement of what might be
                        expected. To cope with even this volume of traffic would necessitate
                        extensive quayage space along the banks of the Nile in the neighbourhood of
                        the Embabeh railway bridge. In fact a port, well equipped with modern
                        appliances, and provided with spacious warehouses, would have to be created,
                        together with a dock or docks roomy enough to berth river vessels and
                        steamers of the largest dimensions.</p>
                    <p>Gradually, as traffic increased, it might reasonable be expected of the
                        Government that the reaches of the Nile upstream of Cairo would be
                        successively be rendered fit for navigation, until an unrivalled artery of
                        communication stretched from Alexandria to Assouan, bearing all but a
                        fraction of the entire agricultural produce of Upper and Lower Egypt.</p>
                    <p>Despite the disadvantages at present prevailing, two or three companies are
                        alreading trading in the river transport of freight between Cairo and
                        Alexandria. It needs but the provision of improved navigation to stimulate
                        capital, calling into being busy wharves where there are now lifeless banks,
                        and increased flotillas of steam cargo boats to superseded the unwieldy <hi

            <div type="item"><head>THE OLDEST TEMPLE IN THEBES</head>
            <p>Mr. H. R. Hall, M.A., of the Egypt Exploration Fund, delivered an interesting lecture
                    last week, in the lecture-room of the Society of Arts, London, on recent
                    discoveries in Thebes. The lecture was illustrated by a series of lantern
                    slides, and by articles found in the course of the excavations. Mr. Hall
                    described a temple, the oldest in the district, which has just been brought to
                    light. It dated from the Eleventh Dynasty, or about 2500 B.C., and was probably
                    a funeral temple or an antechamber to the tomb of King Mentuhetep III. This tomb
                    still remained undiscovered. Mr. Hall's description was extremely lucid, and
                    gave eloquent testimony to the valuable work which the Egypt Exploration Fund is
                    doing.</p></div>
            <div type="item"><head>GAMBLING IN CORFU</head>
                <p>The Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior of Greece, M. Th. P. Delyannis,
                    has sent a telegram to the Prefect of Corfu, with reference to a scheme to
                    create a gaming establishment in the island, informing him that as the
                    realisation of such a scheme would necessarily bring serious developments (as
                    Corfu would then be regarded as an international centre of gaming), the Greek
                    Government considers it necessary to announce public beforehand that the
                    establishment of a gambling-place in a Greek island, or in any other section of
                    the Greek kingdom, would be repugnant to the conscience of the Greek people, and
                    consequently neither the present nor any other Greek Government could even think
                    of permitting or tolerating the existence of such a resort.</p>

            <div type="item"><head>THE KAISER AND ENGLAND</head>
            <p>The foreign editor of the "Revue de Paris," M. Victor Berard, publishes in its issue
                    for May an interesting statement about the foreign policy of the German Emperor.
                    We quote from the "Times" translation :–– "During the last ten years in which I
                    have been professor at the Ecole Superieure de Marine, twenty or thirty of my
                    pupils have repeated to me textually the same phrases, not dropped from the
                    Imperial lips in private intercourse, but uttered with the emphasis of gesture
                    in the circle of official representations. And always the Emperor expounded the
                    imperious reasons necessitating a Franco-German "entente"…..The object was
                    always a crusade either of the Continent against the United States or against
                    yellow Asia. . . . .Always against something or some one. William II. undertook
                    to federate the whole of Europe or a part of Europe, as a matter of fact –– his
                    "hatred of England" being betrayed almost unconsciously in his most
                    insignificant utterances –– Continental Europe."</p></div>
            
            <div type="item"><head>ALGERIAN FRENCH</head>
            <p>The following specimen of French as she is wrote reaches us from an Algiers paper. It
                    describes a "garden party" given by the Governor-General : –– "Dans les
                    splendides jardins anglais du gubernatorial "Palace" tout le high-life Algerois,
                    toute la gentry s'etaient donne rendez-vous jeudi dernier. Les tramways de
                    Mustapha superieur etaient pris d'assaut. Des buffets abondamment pourvus de
                    plum-cake, de plum-puddins, de sherry-brandy, de sodas, de whisky furent
                    devalises par les invites assoiffes et affames. Shoking! On dansa le boston ;
                    mais le cake-walk fut exclu de cette fete tres smart et tout-a-fait reussie.</p></div>
            <div type="item"><head>WOMAN AND MARRIAGE</head>
            <p>"Woman," a woman's paper informs us, "is being convinced by degrees that marriage
                    does not of iteself alone guarantee happiness." If you wish to see women
                    throughly insulted go to the papers written for women. Where else would anyone
                    dare to imply that woman was sufficiently idoitic to believe that marriage "of
                    itself alone" guaranteed anything? The oracle continues : "She is learning by
                    experience and observation that it is possible to be as happy without man's love
                    as with it, if she can only think so." This seems a sort of Christian Science.
                    You are as happy with the tooth-ache as without it, "if you can only think so."
                    Even this is it with the love of man.</p></div>
