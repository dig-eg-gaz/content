                    <head>ISLAM IN INDIA. </head>
                    <p>Mobamedanism is still a great force in India It is the faith of one person
                        out of every five in the country, write* Mr. Sidney Low in ''The Standard."
                        The King rules more than half the Mohamedan population of the world, the
                        Sultan of Turkey coming a very long way behind him. There is one
                        province—that of the North-West Frontier—which is almost entirely Mohamedan,
                        the Hindus being an unimportant minority. In the Punjab Mohamedans an
                        numerous, and they are to be found scattered everywhere down to the extreme
                        sooth, especially in the towns. In Eastern Bengal there are some
                        twenty-eight millions of them, and here they increase more rapidly than the
                        Hindus; for the Mussulman, with his varied diet, has a better physique than
                        the pulse and grain-feeding Brahmanists, and, moreover, be does not believe
                        in child marriages, nor does he think it wrong for widows to re-marry. The
                        high and growing proportion of the Mohamedan population in Bengal is one of
                        the hard nuts for the Bengalis to crack. It is also an elementary fact which
                        is not generally appreciated. By race these Bengal Mohamedans are akin to
                        the Hindus, and that, indeed, is true of the great majority of their
                        co-religionists outside the Frontier province. Most of them are descended
                        from Hindus who were converted daring the long period of Moslem role. They
                        exist as a standing argument against the modern doctrine which ascribes
                        everything to race, and nothing to environment, education, social
                        conditions, and custom. Islam has developed the character of the Indian
                        Mohamedan somewhat at the expense of hi* intellect He is simpler, braver,
                        more mas-online, more devout, in a rough, practical, straightforward
                        fashion, hot he is less subtle, less ingenious, less acute, and far less
                        capable of assimilating the methods of modern educa-tion. He makes a
                        first-rate soldier, a good policeman, inspector, or watchman, and be does
                        fairly well in any post when courage, fidelity, and a certain self respect
                        and requisite he has a distinct aptitude for trade, and as a shopkeeper be
                        is frequently very successful. He is a convenient man to bare a butler or
                        personal servant, for in the tint place be is in moderation honest, and
                        secondly, he is not under the tyranny of caste rules, and can serve food to
                        a Christian without a qualm. Bat the Hindu beats him at the office and the
                        desk, and in the class-room. This is one of the reasons why there ought not
                        to be direct appointments to the higher Civil Service by competitive
                        examination in India. It is quite certain that in this contest the babu and
                        the Brahman would beat the Mohamedan out of the field. Most Indian
                        Mussulmans cherish in their hearts some memory of the days when their
                        fathers were the masters of India, and they believe that, if ever the
                        English power were shaken, they would regain their old predominance. In the
                        meanwhile the Mohamedans will endure being the subjects of a Christian race,
                        whose character they respect, and whose religion they can understand. But to
                        The feebler tribes of idol-worshippers, as they consider them, they protest
                        indignantly that it would be an outrage to ask them to yield obedience. </p>

                            accompanied by a crowd of servants, who Carried luncheon baskets and
                            wine cases, and had lunch on top of the big Pyramid. The whole party
                            returned afterwards to Mena House Hotel and had dinner there. </p>

                        <head>Murder Will Out. </head>
                        <p>On the 25th of last month, on the occasion of the holding of the weekly
                            market at El Ham- mam, a murder was committed at some dis- tance from
                            that village, a Bedeuin having been found shot in the head. The police
                            took the matter in hand, but until yesterday no trace of the murderer
                            could be found. Yesterday was again the market day and a polioe officer
                            belonging to the Mariout district who was on duty there received
                            information to the effect that the murderer, a Bedouin like his victim,
                            was to be found at Sidi Gaber. He at once proceeded by train in company
                            with his informant, who pointed the man out near Sidi Gaber caraool. The
                            murderer was thereupon arrested and in bis possession was found a new
                            revolver with six chambers loaded, besides twelve rounds of ammunation.
                            It appears that the man, knowing his viotim to possess a large sum of
                            money, had followed him after the fair and, taking the opportunity of
                            his being asleep in a field, had shot him through the head, afterwards
                            taking a sum of about £70 off the body. </p>

                        plant has reached a depth of 400 feet with a first borehole, and that

                        of the town, as the level of the water in the bore-well rises to a

                        natives who were witnesses of the accident attacked the driver and conductor
                        of the tram and beat them unmercifully, causing them severe injuries. A
                        native, aged 65 years, was bathing in the sea yesterday near the Alexandria
                        Slaughterhouse, when he was carried out of his depth by the waves and was
                        drowned. His body was recovered. </p>

                    <p>The celebration of the anniversary of the declaration of Greek independence
                        on Saturday last will long be remembered by the Greek oolony at Alexandria,
                        for the occasion was made use of for laying the foundation-stone of an
                        institution which is destined to be one of the finest educational
                        establishments in Egypt. The former president of the Hellenic com-munity of
                        Alexandria, the late Mr. Constantino Salvago, left a bequest in bis will for
                        the purpose of founding a polytechnic here. After his death the bequest was
                        largely increased by the generosity of Mr. Salvago's widow and two sons. A
                        large plot of land was bought ourside Rosetta-gate, in front of the
                        cemeteries, and yesterday afternoon the foun-dation stone of the institution
                        was laid by Mrs. Argentina Michel Salvago, in the presence of a great
                        concourse of members of the Greek colony and representatives of the other
                        European colonies. </p>
                    <p>A large tent was set up for the occasion, where a sumptuous buffet was
                        prepared. At 4.30 o'olock the ceremony began with a thanksgiving service,
                        conducted by the Greek Orthodox Patriarch'Photius I., assisted by all his
                        clergy. The Patriarch, at the conclusion of the service, invoked the
                        blessing of the Most High on the new school by sprinkling holy water, and
                        finished an eloquent harangue with an account of the many acts of generosity
                        by which the Greek colony of Alexandria had benefited owing to the
                        munificence of its wealthy members. </p>
                    <p>After the Patriarch Mr. Paleologos Georgiou, the headmaster of the Hellenic
                        community's sohools, read from a parchment document the formal bequest of
                        the donors, which was afterwards signed by Photius I, Mohamed Bey Hafez,
                        Acting Governor of Alexandria, Mr. N. Scotidis, Hellenic Consul-General, Mr.
                        E. B. Gould, H.B.M.'s Consol General for the City and Port of Alexandria,
                        Schiess Pacha, Vice-President of the Alexandria Municipality, Chataway Bey,
                        Administrator of the Alexandria Municipality, Mr. Emmanuel Benachi and Mr.
                        Michael Sinadino, the President and Vice-President of the Hellenic
                        community, Messrs. Michael and Steffy Salvago, Mrs. Constantino Salvago, and
                        Mrs Argentina Miohel Salvago. The parchment was looked in a metal tube and
                        placed in the orifice of the foundation-stone together with a copy of thp
                        "Egyptian Gazette" and the "Harmonia" of the day's date, besides some
                        specimens of oar- rent Egyptian coins. Mrs. Argentina Michel Salvago then
                        advanced and, after christening the stone with the contents of two bottles
                        of champagne, received a beauti- fnlly-chased silver trowel, a mallet, and a
                        hammer, presented by the well-known Italian engineer, Signor Diamanti, and
                        then proceeded to declare the stone "well and truly laid." </p>
                    <p>A buffalo was then brought forward and sacrificed on the foundation-stone.
                        The beast was afterwards cat up and its flesh distributed to the poor. The
                        fine band of the Alexandria Hellenic community played meanwhile a choice
                        selection of music, and the stone was lowered into its position amidst the
                        acclamations of the assembled multitude. The President of the Hellenic
                        commnnity, Mr. Emmanuel Benachi, then made an eloquent speech wherein he
                        called to mind the good deeds of the benefactors of the Greek colony of
                        Alexandria, such as the late George Averoff and the late Constantine
                        Salvago, whose noble example was to-day being followed by the surviving
                        members of the family of his predecessor, the late president of the
                        community. Mr. Benschi then declared that the Hellenic colony was shortly to
                        benefit by another act of generosity, for Mr. George Zervudaohi has decided
                        to build at his own expense a Normal College here. </p>
                    <p>The speaker went on to announce that be would follow Mr. Zervndachi's example
                        by endowing the Hellenio oolony with an orphanage. At these unexpected
                        announcements there was a great outburst of cheering and the crowd rent the
                        air with their acclamations of pleasure at these acts of generosity. </p>
                    <p>Mr. N. Scotidis, Hellenic Consul-General at Alexandria, then prononnoed a
                        brilliant speech, thanking the donors of these splendid gifts in the name of
                        the Greeks of Alexandria. He .begged the wealthy members of his race to
                        follow these magnifioent precedents, and to set an example of generosity and
                        public spirit whereby the Hellenic commnnity throughout Egypt would ever
                        march in the van of progress. </p>
                    <p>Mr. Miohel Salvago thanked all the speakers on behalf of his mother, his
                        brother, and himself, declaring that be was merely obeying the orders given
                        by his late father in his will, and be hoped that he and his family wonld
                        hereafter follow the example set by his father in doing other works for the
                        good of his compatriots in Egypt's commercial capital. </p>
                    <p>After another explosion of cheering the Pat-riarch Photius I., accompanied by
                        the head master of the Hellenic community's schools, walked among the long
                        files of pupils of the schools, who formed a cordon between the speakers and
                        guests and the crowd. His Beatitude addressed words of enoonragement and
                        commendation to the youths, urging them to work bard and follow in the path
                        of virtue. The buffet was then thrown open and a handsome repast was
                        partaken of and the memorable ceremony came to an end. </p>
                    <p>Afterwards a procession was formed of the pupils, beaded by their band, mi
                        the headmaster and professional staff, who went to the Greek quarter and
                        played a selection of music outside the houses of Messrs. Benachi, Sinadino,
                        Salvago, and Zervodaohi. </p>

                    <p>Pour completer les renseignements que nous avons donnes hier sur les Egyptian
                        Markets, il nous faur exposer les raisons de la plus-value extraordinaire
                        acquise par les terrains dans laqulle la Societe est interessee dans toute
                        l'Egypte.</p>
                    <p>Ces terrains, sur lesquels la Societe a establises marches etaient situes
                        hors des villes ; or, par le fiar de l'extension prise par celles-ci, ils se
                        trouvent actuellement soit pres du centre, soit aux abords immediats des
                        cites, ce qui a enormement a augmente leur valeur.</p>
                    <p>A Benha, par exemple, la Compagnie a deja sobete un terrain "extra muros"
                        pour etablir son marche. L'ancien sera loti et vendu a des conditions tres
                        avantageuese. Il en sera de meme pour les terrains ou les marches sont
                        etablis dans les autres villes importantes de l'interieur.</p>
                    <p>On concoit des lors les benefices considerables que la Societe est appele a
                        realiser de ce chef.</p>

                    <head> EGYPTIAN COTTON IN SIND. </head>
                    <p>(Plot the "Times of Indu").</p>
                    <p>Endeavours to introduce foreign varieties of</p>
                    <p>cotton into this country have hitherto proved</p>
                    <p>generally unsuccessful. If in some exceptional</p>
                    <p>circumstances they did well at the first sowing,</p>
                    <p>they rapidly deteriorated and the experiments</p>
                    <p>proved to be failures. In most cases, however,</p>
                    <p>they did not grow at all. So uniform, indeed,</p>
                    <p>has been the failure of efforts to introduce new</p>
                    <p>varieties of cotton that the attempt had been</p>
                    <p>declared practically hopeless, and hybridization</p>
                    <p>among the indigenous varieties was Supposed</p>
                    <p>to offer the only prospect of improvement in</p>
                    <p>the crop. It is especially gratifying, therefore,</p>
                    <p>to learn from the report of the Bombay Department of Agriculture that the
                        cultivation</p>
                    <p>of Egyptian cotton in Sind has fairly passed</p>
                    <p>the stage of experiment; and may be expected,</p>
                    <p>if it continues as well as it has done during the</p>
                    <p>last two years, to give an outturn of not less</p>
                    <p>than 100,000 balos in the course of a few years.</p>
                    <p>The experiment was first made in the year</p>
                    <p>before last of sowing Egyptian cotton in the</p>
                    <p>spring so as to enable it to mature before the</p>
                    <p>advent of the winter frosts. Last year the</p>
                    <p>Deputy Director obtained and distributed ten</p>
                    <p>tons of Egyptian seed to select zemindars on</p>
                    <p>the Jamrao Canal An area of about 1,506</p>
                    <p>acres was sown with the seed. The yield has</p>
                    <p>been very satisfactory, both in quality and in</p>
                    <p>staple, and the zemindars are said to</p>
                    <p>anxious to extend its cultivation on a large</p>
                    <p>scale. As it is probable that this seed may</p>
                    <p>retain its superiority of staple if Egyptian</p>
                    <p>methods are closely followed, it is proposed to</p>
                    <p>restrict the cultivation to those zemindars who</p>
                    <p>undertake to sow it under supervision and</p>
                    <p>whose lands can be practically supervised. No</p>
                    <p>signs of deterioration have been observed in</p>
                    <p>the oropof theseoond year, and it is worthy</p>
                    <p>of note that while the local indigenous variety</p>
                    <p>suffered severely from attacks of bollwornr the</p>
                    <p>imported Egyptian variety were almost immune. The two Egyptians that have
                        proved</p>
                    <p>most successful so far are the Abbassi aud the</p>
                    <p>Mitaffiffi. Of the two the former is the more</p>
                    <p>valuable and arrangements have therefore</p>
                    <p>been made to export the seed of the Mitaffiffi</p>
                    <p>grown this year, aud to import a sufficient</p>
                    <p>consignment of Abbassi seed from Egypt. The</p>
                    <p>successful introduction of Egyptian cotton</p>
                    <p>means so much to the mill industry that the</p>
                    <p>results of the current year will be watched with</p>
                    <p>the greatest expectation.</p>

                    <p>On the 6th June next, Brevet-Colonel S. G. Bird, D.8.O., Royal Dublin
                        Fusiliers, will vacate the command of the 1st Battalion in Egypt, to the
                        regret of all ranks. Colonel Bird got his first commission in the old 102nd
                        Royal Madras Fusiliers—now the'1st Battalion of the gallaqt "Dabs"—in 1874,
                        was promoted captain in 1881, major in 1892, and lieutenant-oolonel in June,
                        1902. He was adjutant of a militia battalion from 1886 to 1889, and also of
                        the Ceylon Volunteer Light Infantry from 1889 till 1894. He was with the
                        Dublins in the South African War, including the opening action of the
                        campaign at Talana Hill; Lombard's Kop; the operations in the Orange Free
                        State, operations in the Transvaal, west of Pretoria; and for some time he
                        was Commandant at Krugersdorp (mentioned twice in despatches, D.S.O.,
                        Qaeen*8 medal with four clasps, King's medal with two clasps). It if
                        anticipated that Major and Brevet-Lieutenant-Colonel A. W. Gordon, second in
                        command of the 2nd Batt. Buttevant, will get the step; Major A' H.Rutherford
                        will become second-in-command ofthe let Battalion, and the majority will go
                        to Captain R. A. Booth, 2nd Battalion.</p>
                    <p>Captain W. N. Gordon, Royal Garrison Artillery, has been transferred Lorn No.

                        have been selected to go on the Commission which is to enquire into the
                        Mediterranean Fever, which has auoh baneful effects on our naval and
                        military forces in that water.'</p>
                    <p>It is persistently rumoured that Mr. Haldane intends to reduce the Army by
                        20,000 men in the near future, despite the official utterances on the
                        8ubjeot. "More brains" and "smaller battalions" is to be the new article of
                        faith in Pali Mall if rumour is to be trusted. The Service members of the
                        House are much exercised over the contemplated redaction of one little Army,
                        and the now strong Labour Party, however opposed to militarism and taxation,
                        are averse to anything that would turn 20,000 men into the already crowded
                        labour market It is said that Mr. Haldane has made good progress amongst the
                        members of the Army Connoil in favour of his scheme.</p>
                    <p>There is no better-known "salt" than Captain John A. Take, who has been
                        selected for the command of the cruiser Monmouth, which will be commissioned
                        next week toreplace the Andromeda on the China Station. Captain Tuke, who
                        has served on the blue in all parts of the world, joined the Queen's Navy in
                        July, 1870, was promoted lieutenant in 1881, commander in 1895, and captain
                        on the last day of 1901. He was a sub-lieutenant on the Pioneer in the Niger
                        Expedition of 18.79, and was with the expedition to the oapital of the Emir
                        of Nussa, and participated in the operations round and the bombardment of
                        the town of Nussa (mentioned in despatches); was lieutenant in the Northum-
                        berland during the Egyptian War of 1882 (medal, and the Khedive's star). He
                        held the appointment of Master of the Fleet for the Coronation Naval Review,
                        1902. He is.no stranger to the China Station, having been commander and
                        navigating officer of the battle- ship Centurion, flagship o? Sir E. H.
                        Seymour, K. C. B., when he oommauded the station, 1898-1901. Latterly
                        Captain Take was in oommand of the gunnery ship Undaunted, and the Theseus,
                        tender to the gunnery ship Cambridge, Devonport.</p>
                    <p>The cruiser Hyaointh, ex-flagship of the East Indies Squadron, which is on
                        the passage home from the East, will undergo an extensive refit at Devonport
                        before she again hoists the pennant. The sum of £28,635 will b&amp; expend-
                        ed on her, and some alterations will be made in her armament. The Hyacinth
                        was commissioned as flagship of the squadron on the Sflst July, 1902, to
                        relieve her sister cruiser Highflyer. Since going to the East, the
                        Hyacinth's crew took part in the operations against the Mad Mullah in
                        Somaliland, andfrom her was landed a party which captured Illig just two
