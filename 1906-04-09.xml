                <head>MONDAY, APRIL 9, 1906. ISLAM IN INDIA. </head>
                <p>Mobamedanism is still a great force in India It is the faith of one person out of
                    every five in the country, write* Mr. Sidney Low in ‘'The Standard." The King
                    rules more than half the Mohamedan population of the world, the Sultan of Turkey
                    coming a very long way behind him. There is one province—that of the North-West
                    Frontier—which is almost entirely Mohamedan, the Hindus being an unimportant
                    minority. In the Punjab Mohamedans an numerous, and they are to be found
                    scattered everywhere down to the extreme sooth, especially in the towns. In
                    Eastern Bengal there are some twenty-eight millions of them, and here they
                    increase more rapidly than the Hindus; for the Mussulman, with his varied diet,
                    has a better physique than the pulse and grain-feeding Brahmanists, and,
                    moreover, be does not believe in child marriages, nor does he think it wrong for
                    widows to re-marry. The high and growing proportion of the Mohamedan population
                    in Bengal is one of the hard nuts for the Bengalis to crack. It is also an
                    elementary fact which is not generally appreciated. By race these Bengal
                    Mohamedans are akin to the Hindus, and that, indeed, is true of the great
                    majority of their co-religionists outside the Frontier province. Most of them
                    are descended from Hindus who were converted daring the long period of Moslem
                    role. They exist as a standing argument against the modern doctrine which
                    ascribes everything to race, and nothing to environment, education, social
                    conditions, and custom. Islam has developed the character of the Indian
                    Mohamedan somewhat at the expense of hi* intellect He is simpler, braver, more
                    mas-online, more devout, in a rough, practical, straightforward fashion, hot he
                    is less subtle, less ingenious, less acute, and far less capable of assimilating
                    the methods of modern educa-tion. He makes a first-rate soldier, a good
                    policeman, inspector, or watchman, and be does fairly well in any post when
                    courage, fidelity, and a certain self respect and requisite he has a distinct
                    aptitude for trade, and as a shopkeeper be is frequently very successful. He is
                    a convenient man to bare a butler or personal servant, for in the tint place be
                    is in moderation honest, and secondly, he is not under the tyranny of caste
                    rules, and can serve food to a Christian without a qualm. Bat the Hindu beats
                    him at the office and the desk, and in the class-room. This is one of the
                    reasons why there ought not to be direct appointments to the higher Civil
                    Service by competitive examination in India. It is quite certain that in this
                    contest the babu and the Brahman would beat the Mohamedan out of the field. Most
                    Indian Mussulmans cherish in their hearts some memory of the days when their
                    fathers were the masters of India, and they believe that, if ever the English
                    power were shaken, they would regain their old predominance. In the meanwhile
                    the Mohamedans will endure being the subjects of a Christian race, whose
                    character they respect, and whose religion they can understand. But to The
                    feebler tribes of idol-worshippers, as they consider them, they protest
                    indignantly that it would be an outrage to ask them to yield obedience. </p>

                    Constantinople says that well-informed Turk- ish circles attribute the Saltan’s
                    obstinancy over the Tabah affair to the suggestions of Germany, who is trying to
                    persuade him to ask for the arbitration of The Hague Tribunal, thus reopening
                    the whole Egyptian question, with a prospect of the ultimate recovery of the
                    province. Our contemporary "Al Mokattam” states that Turkish poets are now

                    which invitation the Royal couple accepted. It is rumoured that the Khedive will

                    a small afternoon party at Koubbeh, the guests being T.R.H. the Archduke Joseph
                    and the Arch- duchess Augusta, the Archduke’s Chamberlain and physician, and the
                    lady-in-waiting of the Archduchess, Count Koziebrodski, the Austro- Hungarian
                    Minister, General Thurneyssen Pacha, A.D.C., and Mme Baltazzi Stockan and her
                    daughter, in all, with the Khedive, 10 per¬sons. The party first drove round the
                    stables and admired the Khedive’s fine stud, then drove over to the fields to
                    watch the horses eating bersim, and subsequently proceeded to Monstourouh, the
                    other pro-perty of the Khedive, close to Koub- beh, where tea bad been prepared.
                    Afterwards the Khedive accompanied his guests back to Koubbeh. It was a
                    delightful afternoon, and on Saturday morning, when General Thurneys¬sen Pacha
                    went to the station to see the Archduke off on behalf of the Khedive, the
                    Archduke and Archduchess asked him to present the expression of their
                    thankfulness to the Khecfive for the pleasant afternoon they had passed with
                    him. The Khedive has made a gift of a thorough¬bred Arab to the Archduchess. THE

                    probability be published in the near future. The Hag has been a thorough success
                    from every point of view—save that of some of the Bedonins—and not a single
                    Egyp¬tian pilgrim, soldier or official, has fallen a victim to the lawless
                    tribes of the Hedjaz. THE HEDJAZ RAILWAY. We bear that the Ottoman authorities
                    are pushing this railway forward as rapidly as pos sible S. of Qala’ at Medawara
                    towards Tebonk. The line will pass through Tebouk and Qala” at El Akbdar and
                    will then enter a depression with easy gradients and free from any great
                    engineering difficulties till Medina is reached. Herr Meissner, the able German
                    engineer, to whom the construction of the line is mainly due, has been recently
                    on a visit to railhead On the 25th of last month, on the occasion of the holding
                    of the weekly market at El Ham- mam, a murder was committed at some dis- tance
                    from that village, a Bedeuin having been found shot in the head. The police took
                    the matter in hand, but until yesterday no trace of the murderer could be found.
                    Yesterday was again the market day and a polioe officer belong¬ing to the
                    Mariout district who was on duty there received information to the effect that
                    the murderer, a Bedouin like his victim, was to be found at Sidi Gaber. He at
                    once proceeded by train in company with his informant, who pointed the man out
                    near Sidi Gaber caraool. The murderer was thereupon arrested and in bis
                    possession was found a new revolver with six chambers loaded, besides twelve
                    rounds of ammunation. It appears that the man, know¬ing his viotim to possess a
                    large sum of money, had followed him after the fair and, taking the opportunity
                    of his being asleep in a field, had shot him through the head, afterwards taking
                    a sum of about £70 off the body. Spend your Holidays at Mena, The management of

                    Railway Company was held in Paris last week, when the question of the Cronier
                    bills was discussed. It was unanimously acknowledged that the Board of Directors
                    did not act against the statutes by discounting there bills with the reserve
                    funds of the company, although it was admitted that the operation was attended
                    with disastrous results. At the meeting of the Seciete Generale, held the same
                    day, the Cronier bills were also men¬tioned; but before the question could be
                    developed, the chairman announced that the managing director of the Société
                    Generale had already resigned the directorship of the unfor¬tunate Egyptian
                    Sugar Refineries, as well as of other ventures, and would in future devote
                    himself exclusively to the steadily-increasing affairs of the bank. PORT SUDAN
                    AND KHARTOUM WATER SUPPLY. Some time ago the Artesian Boring and Prospecting
                    Company received from the Sudan Government the contract for the installation of
                    water supplies by means of artesian wells to the towns of Khartoum and Port
                    Sudan. With regard to the latter place they have just received a telegram . from
                    their residing engineer informing them that up-to-date their steam-driven
                    “Express Boring’’ plant has reached a depth of 400 feet with a first bore¬hole,
                    and that already this artesian well is able to supply a certain quantity of
                    fresh water to the inhabitants of Port Sadan. There seems to be no doubt that
                    the source of the water comes from the mountains situated in the neighbourhood
                    of the town, as the level of the water in the bore-well rises to a con¬siderable
                    height above the sea level If, how. ever, the output is not sufficient further
                    borings are intended to be made in order to ensure all the necessary supply of
                    water which may eventually be required. With regard to Khartoum, the company’s
                    installation for the supply of fresh water to the whole. town, also by means of
                    artesian wells, is on the point of being finished, by means of wells driven to a
                    depth between 250 and 350 feet. In the course of the works the company have
                    encountered stratas of excellent Nubian sandstone, which will ensure a supply of

                    ALEXANDRIA BONDED WAREHOUSE CO. LTD A CHAPTER OF ACCIDENTS. A native boy, while
                    playing with some other boys in the Mohatrem Bey quarter yesterday, was run over
                    by a passing cart and succumbed a few hours afterwards to bis injuries. A native
                    youth of 17 was run overby a tram- car yesterday on the Mex line, while he was
                    attempting to cross the rails. He was promptly taken to hospital, bat expired a
                    short time after wards. Some natives who were witnesses of the accident attacked
                    the driver and conductor of the tram and beat them unmercifully, causing them
                    severe injuries. A native, aged 65 years, was bathing in the sea yesterday near
                    the Alexandria Slaughter¬house, when he was carried out of his depth by the
                    waves and was drowned. His body was recovered. The celebration of the
                    anniversary of the declaration of Greek independence on Satur¬day last will long
                    be remembered by the Greek oolony at Alexandria, for the occasion was made use
                    of for laying the foundation-stone of an institution which is destined to be one
                    of the finest educational establishments in Egypt. The former president of the
                    Hellenic com-munity of Alexandria, the late Mr. Constan¬tino Salvago, left a
                    bequest in bis will for the purpose of founding a polytechnic here. After his
                    death the bequest was largely in¬creased by the generosity of Mr. Salvago’s
                    widow and two sons. A large plot of land was bought ourside Rosetta-gate, in
                    front of the cemeteries, and yesterday afternoon the foun-dation stone of the
                    institution was laid by Mrs. Argentina Michel Salvago, in the pre¬sence of a
                    great concourse of members of the Greek colony and representatives of the other
                    European colonies. A large tent was set np for the occasion, where a sumptuous
                    buffet was prepared. At 4.30 o’olock the ceremony began with a thanks¬giving
                    service, conducted by the Greek Ortho¬dox Patriarch'Photius I., assisted by all
                    his clergy. The Patriarch, at the conclusion of the service, invoked the
                    blessing of the Most High on the new school by sprinkling holy water, and
                    finished an eloquent harangue with an account of the many acts of generosity by
                    which the Greek colony of Alexandria had benefited owing to the munificence of
                    its wealthy members. After the Patriarch Mr. Paleologos Georgiou, the headmaster
                    of the Hellenic community’s sohools, read from a parchment document the formal
                    bequest of the donors, which was afterwards signed by Photius I, Mohamed Bey
                    Hafez, Acting Governor of Alexandria, Mr. N. Scotidis, Hellenic Consul-General,
                    Mr. E. B. Gould, H.B.M.’s Consol General for the City and Port of Alexandria,
                    Schiess Pacha, Vice-President of the Alexandria Municipality, Chataway Bey,
                    Administrator of the Alex¬andria Municipality, Mr. Emmanuel Benachi and Mr.
                    Michael Sinadino, the President and Vice-President of the Hellenic community,
                    Messrs. Michael and Steffy Salvago, Mrs. Constantino Salvago, and Mrs Argentina
                    Miohel Salvago. The parchment was looked in a metal tube and placed in the
                    orifice of the foundation-stone together with a copy of thp “Egyptian Gazette”
                    and the “Harmonia” of the day’s date, besides some specimens of oar- rent
                    Egyptian coins. Mrs. Argentina Michel Salvago then advanced and, after
                    christen¬ing the stone with the contents of two bottles of champagne, received a
                    beauti- fnlly-chased silver trowel, a mallet, and a hammer, presented by the
                    well-known Italian engineer, Signor Diamanti, and then proceeded to declare the
                    stone “well and truly laid.” A buffalo was then brought forward and sacrificed
                    on the foundation-stone. The beast was afterwards cat up and its flesh
                    distributed to the poor. The fine band of the Alexandria Hellenic community
                    played meanwhile a choice selection of music, and the stone was lowered into its
                    position amidst the acclamations of the assembled multitude. The President of
                    the Hellenic commnnity, Mr. Emmanuel Benachi, then made an eloquent speech
                    wherein he called to mind the good deeds of the benefactors of the Greek colony
                    of Alexandria, such as the late George Averoff and the late Constantine Salvago,
                    whose noble example was to-day being followed by the surviving members of the
                    family of his predecessor, the late president of the com¬munity. Mr. Benschi
                    then declared that the Hellenic colony was shortly to benefit by another act of
                    generosity, for Mr. George Zervudaohi has decided to build at his own expense a
                    Normal College here. The speaker went on to announce that be would follow Mr.
                    Zervndachi’s example by endowing the Hellenio oolony with an orphan¬age. At
                    these unexpected announcements there was a great outburst of cheering and the
                    crowd rent the air with their acclamations of pleasure at these acts of
                    generosity. Mr. N. Scotidis, Hellenic Consul-General at Alexandria, then
                    prononnoed a brilliant speech, thanking the donors of these splendid gifts in
                    the name of the Greeks of Alexandria. He .begged the wealthy members of his race
                    to follow these magnifioent precedents, and to set an example of generosity and
                    public spirit whereby the Hellenic commnnity throughout Egypt would ever march
                    in the van of pro¬gress. Mr. Miohel Salvago thanked all the spea¬kers on behalf
                    of his mother, his brother, and himself, declaring that be was merely obeying
                    the orders given by his late father in his will, and be hoped that he and his
                    family wonld hereafter follow the example set by his father in doing other works
                    for the good of his compatriots in Egypt’s commercial capital. After another
                    explosion of cheering the Pat-riarch Photius I., accompanied by the head master
                    of the Hellenic community’s schools, walked among the long files of pupils of
                    the schools, who formed a cordon between the speakers and guests and the crowd.
                    His Beatitude addressed words of enoonragement and commendation to the youths,
                    urging them to work bard and follow in the path of virtue. The buffet was then
                    thrown open and a hand¬some repast was partaken of and the memorable ceremony
                    came to an end. Afterwards a procession was formed of the pupils, beaded by
                    their band, mi the head¬master and professional staff, who went to the Greek
                    quarter and played a selection of music outside the houses of Messrs. Benachi,
                    Sina¬dino, Salvago, and Zervodaohi. Among the decisions of the Council of
                    Ministers held on Saturday afternoon are the following Mr. Kirkwood James is
                    appointed to study a project for the drainage of Cairo. A new railway station is
