                            also in contact with him on the centre and right. It is not yet clear
                            which wing is demonstrating, and which will deliver the main blow ,but
                            it is evident from Linievitch’s preparations that he intends to accept a

                        <p>With reference to the British S.S. "Calchas” which was seized by the
                            Russians on the 26th July 1901, the Supreme Prize Court has decided to
                            confiscate the cotton and the wooden beams and to ascertain the
                            destination of the parts of machinery which were on board by enquiring
                            of the owners, and to release the steamer and the rest of the cargo. It
                            upheld the legality of the seizure of the steamer in order to prevent
                            pecuniary claims. An interesting point of the judgment is that cotton
                            was pronounced contraband. (Muter.)</p>

                            inst., at the Mouled of Sitt Dimiana, near Belkas, while some of the
                            natives were taking part in a tournament on horseback, two pairs of
                            horsemen left at the same time from opposite ends—which is contrary to
                            custom —with the result that two of the horsemen riding in opposite
                            directions collided violently. Both riders were thrown from their
                            mounts. One of them was able with assistance to walk off the field, but
                            the other was rendered unconscious and had to be carried into a tent.

                        Minieb, and Assouan :—</p>
                    <p>"Locusts having been observed in your province, your most earnest attention
                        is called to the necessity of awaking the liveliest interest on the part of
                        the mamours and their subordinates, the omdehs,sheikhs and the whole of the
                        population.</p>

                        worm.</p>
                    <p>"The most important measure now is to see that each place on which the
                        locusts have settled even for a short time is carefully observed and marked,
                        so that a search may be instituted for eggs immediately.</p>
                    <p>“Inform every one that eggs collected and brought to a markaz or police port
                        will be paid for at the rate of 100 milliemes per oke</p>
                    <p>“100 P.T. reward will be paid to every person who firs’, reports a spot where
                        eggs have been laid.</p>
                    <p>“It must be clearly understood that the danger to the cultivation is not from
                        the locusts which have now arrived, but from their young, which, it the eggs
                        laid are not promptly destroyed, will be hatched in from 20 to 30 days’
                        time, and it must be remembered that each female locust lays nearly 300
                        eggs.</p>
                    <p>"You are requested to call the attention of your mamours to the decree of
                        16-6-1891, which must be rigidly applied as required, both for the purpose
                        of searching for eggs, and later for the destruction of the young
                        locusts.</p>
                    <p>“Attention is also called to the decree of 26 April last year, authorising
                        moudirs and mamours to plough up any land on which eggs are deposited in
                        sufficient numbers to constitute a public danger.</p>

                    <p>“Any crops which are already ripe should be cut first, and care must be
                        taken, after ploughing, to harrow or otherwise break op the large clods of

                    <dateline>Luxor, Friday.</dateline>
                    <p>Since last I wrote you, the smallpox epidemic here has abated, and according
                        to report there have been no new cases the last two days. Miss Gibson, of
                        whom I wrote you last week, succumbed to the malady. The other Europeans
                        that were attacked have recovered.</p>
                    <p>There was a serious accident between here and Armant yesterday. The axle of a
                        truck of a goods train broke, through the truck being overladen, derailing
                        seven tracks that were behind it, which all went to pieces. Fortunately
                        there were no casualties, only one man, a mussaffer, was slightly injured.
                        This accident would, however, have caused a serious hindrance to the
                        traffic, but owing to the able management here, men and material were at
                        once on the spot, and the line was soon cleared and repaired, with no delay
                        whatever to the trains.</p>

                        <head>PROPOSED NURSING HOME</head>
                        <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                        <p>Sir,—I quite agree with the leader as well as the letter re opening a
                            Nursing Home in Alexandria, and I go so far as to say that it is a
                            disgraceful thing that there should be four of these establishments in
                            Cairo and not one here. Our English resident community is now very large
                            and there are numbers of single men and single young women earning their
                            bread in this city who, when ill, have to accept the shelter of foreign
                            hospitals and also to be satisfied with the attendance either of foreign
                            doctors or foreign nurses. But I see no practical suggestions have been
                            made as to how to start such an institution, and for the very reason
                            that those suggestions should proceed from the principal doctors of each
                            community of Alexandria. I can well understand that the large European
                            hospitals would greatly regret losing their ten-francs-a-day patients;
                            but I cannot understand why the doctors should not hail with delight an
                            arrangement which would certainly put more money into their pockets. If
                            the leading medical men of our city would join hands, as was proposed by
                            Drs. Mackie and Zancarri years ago, the Nursing Home would soon be
                            established. Funds would be forthcoming for building and furnishing
                            purposes, and such a home would of course be self-supporting if each
                            doctor sent his private patients there instead of to the big hospitals.
                            If Dr. Milton, after a very short sojourn in Cairo, was able to run a
                            Nursing Home of his own, it seems to me absurd to say that there could
                            be any possible difficulty in the way of starting such an establishment
                            in Alexandria.—Yours faithfully,</p>

                        <head>ALEXANDRIA SCHOOLBOYS’ RACE</head>
                        <p>On Saturday morning,commencing at 6o'clock, a race was run from Sidi
                            Gaber to Alexandria for one silver and two bronze medals. Ten boys
                            entered for the race, all of them pupils of the Scotch School. Till the
                            Sporting Club was reached the whole of the runners kept pretty well
                            together,.but at this point Pace (14) took the lead, which he kept till
                            he reached the Rond Point turning. Here he slowed up suddenly, and was
                            soon overtaken by the brothers Benveniste, who had kept together all the
                            way. Eventually, R Benvpoista (15) came in first, having covered the
                            distance in 18 minutes. His elder brother(17), though rather exhausted,
                            was not very far behind him, while about 30 yards separated the second
                            and third.</p>
                        <p>Orfanelli took his ease till reaching Ibrehimieh, being the last but one
                            to pass the Casino, then he began to put on speed. At the comer of
                            Rosetta-road be caught up Kasheer (15),having then three others in front
                            of him. Little by little he lessened the distance between himself and
                            Pace (14) and, passing him, finished third. Had the race been a little
                            longer he would probably have won. Of the ten competitors, five finished
                            Within 20 minutes, via, R Benveniste, J. Benveniste, A Orfanelli, Pace,
                            and Kasheer. This is good running when we consider the distance, and
                            that all the competitors were mere boys.</p>
                        <p>It is proposed to have another race in about three months' time, but the
                            plan and exact date are not yet fixed.</p>

                    <head>OUR PARIS LETTER.</head>
                    <byline>(From Our Correspondent).</byline>
                    <p>Paris, May 15.</p>
                    <p>It is pleasant to be able to note the fact that the anxiety Which has
                        undeniably prevailed in diplomatic circles, during the past few days, with
                        regard to the question of neutrality in Indo-China has given place to a
                        perceptible feeling of relief. The fear lost, in spite of that extraordinary
                        Asiatic capacity which thE Japanese have for possessing their souls in
                        patience, public opinion should have compelled the Government of Tokio to
                        take some action that must have led straight up to what we have all feared,
                        seems to be disappearing as the hulls of Rodjestvensky's battleships sink
                        below the horizon, to the immense relief of the perturbed French officials
                        at Saigon. Not that one feels justified in shouting very loud just yet, for
                        it is even now somewhat premature to assort that we are out of the wood.
                        Nevertheless, it is, by this time, at least certain that the French are
                        thoroughly on their guard, and that the Russians are aware that there is not
                        much more to be hoped for from the benevolence of French neutrality.</p>
                    <p>Here in Paris we never allow an affair of foreign politics to occupy our
                        minds for any great length of time, especially when the matter in question
                        concerns so far away a topic as the neutrality of France in the Far East. We
                        consider that the Japanese were unnecessarily excited over what was more
                        politeness to Admiral Rodjestvensky, and that the incident is closed since
                        the true, or French, version of the story of the Russian Float in Japanese
                        waters has been sent to Tokio. That which interests Frenchmen far more
                        nearly, and naturally, is the ceremony at the cemetery at Gravelotte, where
                        the Kaiser has been opening a monument in memory of the bravo men who fell
                        in the terrible opening battles of the great war of thirty-live years ago.
                        To the older generation it brings back agonising memories, and to the
                        younger among us it gives occasion for learning of the disasters which
                        befell France in the "anee terrible.” The Paris newspapers have sent their
                        special correspondents to the spot, and the Frenchmen have been received
                        with perfect courtesy by the officials, and have been given excellent places
                        from which to view the ceremony. On the other hand, the population, which is
                        still chiefly French in its sympathies, received the Kaiser without
                        enthusiasm, but with silent civility. Even now after thirty- five years, the
                        wounds are hardly healed, and though all can unite in honoring the brave men
                        who fell, bitter memories are revived, and the annexation of the provinces
                        remains as galling as ever.</p>
                    <p>The point which has chiefly impressed Frenchmen in the Gravelotte
                        commemoration is the silence which was maintained by the German Emperor. The
                        fear that the Kaiser might emulate his recent speeches on Japan and Russia
                        gave rise to a certain amount of "nervosite" on the Boulevards, for if he
                        had delivered himself of an utterance similar to that in which be called the
                        Japanese “the scourge of God, 'or to' that in which he is reported to have
                        ascribed the defeat of the Russians at Mukden to their drunkenness and
                        incapacity, public opinion would most certainly have been seriously
                        inflamed. That he would make a speech was never doubted, and for a day or
                        two before the ceremony argument ran high as to whether the utterance would
                        be warlike or peaceful. It was with a distinct feeling of relief that Paris
                        saw the ceremony pass by in silence, and the Kaiser's abstinence is
                        recognised as being the more remarkable, from the habit be has of speaking
                        out on occasions such as this. There is no doubt that the opening of the
                        Gravelotte monument was looked forward to with some apprehension in Paris,
                        and that everybody is glad, that, when the speeches of Prince Hohenlohe and
                        of the clergy were over, the Kaiser turned towards the audience and put on
                        his helmet without uttering a word.</p>
                    <p>It is fortunate that the race for motor-boats between Algiers and Toulon did
                        not result in overwhelming disaster. A heavy gale, such as arises in the
                        Mediterranean almost without notice, caught the several competitors when
                        they were within a short distance of their goal, with the consequence that
                        one only, the Fiat X , was saved, by being hoisted on to the deck of a
                        destroyer ;and five are certainly lost. The presence of the French cruisers
                        Kleber and Desaix and a division of torpedo-boat destroyers prevented loss
                        of life ; but the fiasco is complete.</p>
                    <p>"Qui facit per alium, facit per se” is a legal maxim in most civilised
                        countries, but French law seems to carry the rule to an extra- ordinary
                        length when it inflicts a heavy fine upon a public man because his
                        man-servant has engaged in a little smuggling. The public man in question
                        was M. Baudry d’Asson and one wonders whether the liability would have
                        seemed so obvious to the authorities if the person concerned had not been a
                        Royalist deputy, whose restless activity is something of an inconvenience to
                        those now in power in France.</p>
                    <p>A smuggling case which is probably unique, even in the strange annals of
                        contraband has just been before the Customs Court of Marseilles. Besides its
                        novelty, the case has a deeper interest as indicating a new danger with
                        which the West is threatened by the insidious East. On board the French
                        steamer "Tourane" there was found a large quantify of opium smuggled, not by
                        any individual in particular, but by the whole ship's company, and the
                        strange spectacle was witnessed of the heavy fine of 2,000 being levied on
                        all, every man in the vessel being mulcted in his proportion, assessed
                        according to the wages scale. The incident of an entire crew turned opium
                        smokers is the more startling as among French ships trading regularly to the
                        East it is not by any means so rare as might be supposed.</p>
                    <p>Thousands of people have been congregating in the village of Ussean, near
                        Chatellerault, since Friday, in the expectation of seeing an attack made by
                        the troops on the house of the gamekeeper named Roy who, after shooting his
                        landlord, barricaded himself in his house ten days ago, and has since set
                        the authorities at defiance.</p>
                    <p>After many consultations in which the aid of the Minister of the Interior and
                        the War Minister had to be invoked, it was decided to blow up Roy’s fortress
                        with melinite cartridges at daybreak on Saturday. Accordingly, the place was
                        surrounded at nine o'clock on Friday night by seven hundred Infantry under
                        the command of a brigadier-general ; but after a long period of suspense it
                        was announced that the attack could not take place, the railway company
                        having declined to convoy the explosives except by goods train, which would
                        not arrive until eight o'clock in the morning. The troops were consequently
                        marched away and the operation was postponed. Roy is seventy years old. In
                        the course of the "siege" he has frequently opened fire with a shot-gun, and
                        has wounded three soldiers and a civilian.</p>
                    <p>A wall of the house was blown in with melinite at three o'clock yesterday
                        morning. Armed gendarmes entered the place at daylight but searched in vain
                        for the criminal, who was ultimately found hiding in a field, and was
                        roughly handled by an indignant crowd before the soldiers rescued him. He
                        complains of internal pains, and says he was hulled out of bed by the
                        explosion.</p>
                    <p>The French Law Courts appear to be suffering from one of the most audacious
                        and prehensile practitioners that Justice has ever tried in vain to deal
                        with. Sticks, umbrellas, over- coats, disappear with the most
                        incomprehensible regularity. A judge has been fain to go home without his
                        hat; but how the hat went, and how the other property continues to go,
                        remains a mystery.</p>
                    <p>The most curious thing about this depredator is his fancy for copies of the
                        Code. It is calculated that his collection must comprise at least thirty
                        copies of this work ; and among them there is the annotated copy of a former
                        Juge d'Instruction, whisked away from the Council Chamber, under his very
                        nose. Usually, your book-collector is none too scrupulous. But to break so
                        much law, and keep so many Codes, is quite unusual.</p>
                    <p>Parisian society is just now much amused with the escapades of a gentleman
                        who, albeit an adventurer, has abundant social credentials. His name, oddly
                        enough, is Count Crayzokski, he is the son of Mustapha Pasha, Viceroy of the
                        Lebanon, and until dismissed was First. Secretary of the Ottoman Legation at
                        The Hague. Then he married an American (heiress, whose businesslike
                        instincts quickly realised the prudence of effecting a judicial separation
                        if her fortune was not to disappear like chaff before the wind of her
                        husband's wild extravagance. After several narrow escapes he has managed to
                        get himself arrested for obtaining a "loan" of £600 for travelling expenses
                        to America to claim a fictitious legacy of large amount, left him by a
                        non-existent uncle. Released on bail, the Turkish Embassy got him away to
                        Constantinople, and now the French judicial proceedings have no further
                        interest for him. His family will pay the piper again.</p>
                    <p>The hats sported by the modern Parisienne are really a bit odd in appearance.
                        A friend of mine recently made her appearance from Monte Carlo, where the
                        hats are even more "advanced.” The next day she was going to lunch with a
                        family of intimate friends, and so she took the precaution of telephoning in
                        advance to say, "Don’t be alarmed by my hat. It certainly does look like a
                        fish in a dish, the whale being carried off from behind by an indignant fowl
                        ; but you needn't laugh, especially if there are strangers.” There were
                        strangers, and on the entry of the unfortunate lady, which took place, as
                        usual when the meal was half over, there was a general yell. The hat, which
                        “en eflet" was shaped like a long narrow dish, with one end tilted over the
                        wearer's nose, and the other supported on an enormous edifice of violet
                        tinted velvet, a long narrow piece of which rested on the dish part of the
                        hat, which was pink, the indignant birds, which were violet and pink, and
                        very tangled, appeared to be biting at the fish and flying backwards way at
                        the time. It was all very complicated, and had a Japanese effect. When they
                        had all—including the servants, an elderly and severe-looking but very sweet
                        mother in-law, and the lady herself—laughed themselves quite hoarse, the hat
                        was declared to be the most awful thing ever seen on human head ; but, the
                        ladies agreed, "we shall have to wear something equally appalling all the
                        summer, and, after all, "she" is at least both original and interesting, for
                        she has left the picture hat, and is now wearing a hat with a story. Let us
                        do the same, and be an interesting clique in London this season." How the
                        new hats, which French women, who are born knowing these things, "pose" just
                        so as to give the needful "effect,” Louis XV., Louis XVI., or Third Empire,
                        as the case may be, will look on English heads is something that interests
                        me, and of which I hope to hare a view before long in London itself.
                        Englishwomen are having a tremendous success here, and one by which those
                        ladies—they exist in every country —who have no assets other than their
                        powers of fascination, would do well to profit.</p>
                    <p>The "demi-monde" no longer exists in exactly the same manner in which it
                        existed in the past; the "grande cocotte” has hardly the time to realise
                        that she is one, when the hour of her dethronement arrives. Unless the old
                        men are greater liars, and the young ones greater sceptic than one can
                        possibly believe, then the unfortunate creatures who where once creatures of
                        pleasure, and their homes a centre of pleasure, no longer exist And those
                        whose beautiful toilettes wore a “travail de luxe” which gave work to
                        hundreds, and pleasure, not only to the wearer, but to her friends as well
                        might as well not exist so much has the difficulty in attaining celebrity,
                        and the difficulty also of keeping away the “huissiers," and other
                        unpleasant people who are lying in wait increased of late. It seems curious
                        that with all this sudden flow of money all the year round, and all the
                        travelling that is done, there should not be more stirring in the “half
                        world,' but perhaps the world has suddenly become virtuous, pushed this
                        way—on the donkey’s tail principle—by the idea of a separation between
                        Church and State. Anent this question, we are well on the war path.</p>

                    <p>London, May 13.</p>
                    <p>This morning, at Buckingham Palace, the King inspected "Z” flattery, R.H.A.,
                        armed with the new 12 1/2 pounder gun, and a battery of R.F.A., armed with
                        the new 18 1/2 pounder field gun.</p>
                    <p>Great preparations are being made for the King of Spain on the occasion of
                        his visit to England next month. The youthful monarch will arrive and embark
                        at Cherbourg on the 5th prox. per the Royal yacht, "Victoria and Albert,"
                        and will be escorted to Spithead by two British cruisers. At Spithead the
                        Channel Fleet will be ready to receive him.</p>
                    <p>Lieutenant Colonel W. S. Kays, King's Royal Rifle Corps, commanding the 2nd
                        Battalion at Bareilly, has been promoted brevet-colonel from to-day. No
                        battalion of the K.R.R.C. will fall vacant this year.</p>
                    <p>Second Lieutenant J. Stuart-Wortley, Scottish Rifles, attached to the
                        Khedive's army, has been promoted lieutenant after two and a-half years
                        service in the Rifles.</p>
                    <p>If an announcement be correct which is made to-day with sufficient
                        circumstance, the Army Council have just tsken a retrograde step which has
                        brought them into line with the worst traditions of the older War Office.
                        This is nothing less than the rejection of the principle of promotion by
                        merit and the approval of seniority as the sole criterion. Nothing could be
                        more fatal to the spirit of keenness and enthusiasm among the younger
                        officers which shows signs of undoubted growth of late. The immediate effect
                        of the Boer War was most encouraging to the ambitious. Proved merit was
                        found to gain recognition and reward, and with the subsequent official
                        announcement that good service and merit would in future largely govern
                        promotion, the hopes of those who really took an interest in their
                        profession rose high. All such aspirations are now dashed to the ground, if
                        the news be correct. We sincerely hope that it may not be, but experience
                        renders one careful of disbelieving almost any fatuity credited to those
                        responsible for our Army organisation.</p>

                    <head>ITALY AND TRIPOLI.</head>
                    <p>The story which was published in the Continental Press about a fortnight ago
                        led to an important speech by Signor Tittoni in the Italian Senate. The
                        rumour was that the Sultan had granted to a French company a concession for
                        the construction and working of the port of Tripoli. The Premier not only
                        denied this story, but he gave a sketch of Italy's policy in the matter,
                        which called for the exercise of the utmost tact. He said that if
                        concessions were granted to any European Powers in the African vilayets,
                        Italy would be breed to take "energetic measures,” but that the Italian
                        Government had no intention at present of occupying territory which belongs
                        to Turkey. The Government, he said, would content itself with commercial
                        penetration, by obtaining advantages for the use of Italian capital and
                        labour, and that it would endeavour to improve the position it has gained in
                        Tripoli. Both England and France have disclaimed all intention of
                        interfering with Italy, and to a certain degree will no doubt accord her
                        their support. But it must not be forgotten that Tripoli is still an
                        integral part of the Ottoman Empire, and that even if the Turks leave Europe
                        their possessions in Asia and Africa will remain to them. However, Signor
                        Tittoni succeeded in getting out of a difficult position without offending
                        anyone, and conveying the impression that Tripoli is bound, before long, to
                        become a colony of the Italian kingdom.</p>

                    <p>Your heroines are always women who “have a right to love,” who are
                        "determined to have their share of love," and who, not finding it in
                        marriage, seek it in adultery. Or they are young girls looking out for
                        husbands, to whom they will soon be unfaithful because they have been unable
                        to "have their share of love with them." All this is terribly tedious. I
                        wonder where your novelists and your dramatic authors go for their models in
                        real life. It is not the drama of love, but the drama of money that is true
                        to life. And why is it that they never mention hunger and thirst, and are
                        always talking of this love which, after all is a function just as banal and
                        animal as thirst and hunger are? We do not think of a man as being unhappy
                        when he is eating. Why, then, should we think of him as being unhappy when
                        he loves?</p>
                    <p>Clearly we and the Japanese have much to unlearn from each other.</p>

                    <head>ROYAL MARRIAGES.</head>
                    <p>Probably the youngest ages at which a royal couple have entered the bonds of
                        matrimony, which were the respective ages of the King of Belgium and his
                        bride when they stood before the altar in 1858. The King’s two daughters'
                        followed their Royal parents’ example with regard to early marriages, both
                        being wedded before they had reached their eighteenth year. The ill-fated
                        Empress of Austria was only just over sixteen years of age when she became
                        the wife of the Emperor Francis Joseph in 1854, her husband being twenty,
                        while one of his daughters had not reached her seventeenth year by three
                        months when she married.</p>
                    <p>It is rather a peculiar coincidence that when the late King Humbert of Italy
                        married Queen Margherita in 1868 their ages corresponded almost exactly with
                        those of the Emperor of Austria and his bride at the time of their marriage.
                        There was just two months difference between the ages of the present Dowager
                        Queen of Italy and the late Empress of Austria, one being sixteen years and
                        four months and the other sixteen years and six months on their respective
                        wedding days. King Humbert, like the Emperor Joseph, was twenty-four at the
                        time of his nuptials.</p>
                    <p>Sixteen was also the age of the wife of the King of Greece at the time of her
                        marriage, her husband being twenty-two.</p>
                    <p>Queen Alexandra was but eighteen when she married the Prince of Wales, who
                        was nearly twenty-two at the time. On the other hand, his Majesty’s
                        brothers, the late Duke of Edinburgh and the present Duke of Connaught, were
                        both twenty-nine years of age. Princess Beatrice had nearly reached her
                        twenty-ninth year when she was wedded to the late Prince Henry of
                        Battenberg. Of the other daughters of our late Queen, Princess Louise (how
                        Duchess of Argyll) married when she was twenty-three, Princess Christian
                        was-twenty, while the late Empress Frederick was only eighteen when she
                        married Prussia's Crown Prince in 1858.</p>

                    <head>TRADE SECRETS GUARDED FOR CENTURIES.</head>
                    <p>There are two trade secrets that the outside world, it seems (says an
                        American journal), will never learn. One is a Chinese secret—the making of
                        the bright and beautiful colour called vermilion, or Chinese red. The other
                        is a Turkish secret—the inlaying of the hardest steel with gold and silver.
                        Among the Chinese and among the Syrians these two secrets are guarded well
                        Apprentices, before they are taken for either trade, most swear a strong
                        oath to reveal nothing of what passes in the workshop. These apprentices,
                        furthermore, must belong to families of standing, must pay a large sum by
                        way of premium and must furnish certificates of good character and honesty.
                        You have seen the demascened stool of course, and you must have seen
                        vermilion or Chinese red. Remember the next time you look at these two
                        things that their secrets have been guarded inviolably, have been handed
                        down faithfully from one generation to another for thousands of years.</p>

                    <p>HALL’S SANITARY WASHABLE DISTEMPER is rapidly superseding wall papers in all
                        tastefully furnished homes. It is made in 70 artistic tints, and only
                        requires the addition of water to make it ready for use. It is quickly and
                        easily applied with a whitewash brush, with half the labour and at one third
                        the cost of paint. HALL’S DISTEMPER ensures cleanliness, and is pleasing to
                        the eye. It appeals alike to artistic and practical house decoration.</p>
                    <p>HALL’S DISTEMPER is of special value in hot climates. Owing to its cool,
                        pleasing colours, great weather-resisting and germ-destroying properties, it
                        lends itself to every kind of wall, wood, brick or stone coating, possessing
                        all the advantages of paint, colour- wash, and disinfectant at one third the
                        cost of oil paint. It never blisters in the hottest sun, and the fact that
                        it can be washed adds greatly to its sanitary advantages.</p>
