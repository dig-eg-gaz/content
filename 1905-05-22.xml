                            <p>With reference to the British S.S. "Calchas” which was seized by the
                                Russians on the 26th July 1901, the Supreme Prize Court has decided
                                to confiscate the cotton and the wooden beams and to ascertain the
                                destination of the parts of machinery which were on board by
                                enquiring of the owners, and to release the steamer and the rest of
                                the cargo. It upheld the legality of the seizure of the steamer in
                                order to prevent pecuniary claims. An interesting point of the
                                judgment is that cotton was pronounced contraband. (Muter.)</p>

                            <p>Mariout. — The canard which has been going the rounds of the Press,
                                to the effect that an arrete of the Mixed Appeal Court has confirmed
                                the Bedouins in possession of land at Mariout, provided they have
                                improved the land, is destitute of any foundation. </p>

                            <p>Riding Accident.—Our Minet el Kaimh Correspondent writes,.—On the
                                afternoon of the 18th inst., at the Mouled of Sitt Dimiana, near
                                Belkas, while some of the natives were taking part in a tournament
                                on horseback, two pairs of horsemen left at the same time from
                                opposite ends—which is contrary to custom —with the result that two
                                of the horsemen riding in opposite directions collided violently.
                                Both riders were thrown from their mounts. One of them was able with
                                assistance to walk off the field, but the other was rendered
                                unconscious and had to be carried into a tent. </p>
                            <p>San Stefano Casino.—The season at San Stefano was successfully
                                inaugurated on Saturday evening by the first grand ball of the year.
                                Although the entrain in the ball room (which by the way was
                                beautifully decorated) was not very great, a large number of members
                                of the fashionable world thronged the adjoining rooms and corridors,
                                while the verandah bore a very animated appearance. The diners were
                                numerous, and the evening being fine, everyone enjoyed the function.
                                The buffet was amply provided with good things and reflected great
                                credit on the management. Yesterday the Casino was largely
                                patronised, on the occasion of the first concert of the season. </p>

                                which is not the Agrotia or But worm, and which does not appear to
                                be the Bodenia Littoralium or ordinary cotton worm, Mr. Willcocks,
                                the entomologist of the Khedivial Agricultural Society, proceeded
                                this morning to Tantah from Cairo to visit the spot with the Moudir
                                and diagnose the precise nature of the worm, which is attacking the
                                leaves and not the root of the young plants.</p>
                            <p>In the meantime some 300 men and boys are busily engaged in picking

                            <p>"Locusts having been observed in your province, your most earnest
                                attention is called to the necessity of awaking the liveliest
                                interest on the part of the mamours and their subordinates, the
                                omdehs,sheikhs and the whole of the population.</p>

                            <p>"The most important measure now is to see that each place on which
                                the locusts have settled even for a short time is carefully observed
                                and marked, so that a search may be instituted for eggs
                                immediately.</p>

                                not from the locusts which have now arrived, but from their young,
                                which, it the eggs laid are not promptly destroyed, will be hatched
                                in from 20 to 30 days’ time, and it must be remembered that each
                                female locust lays nearly 300 eggs.</p>
                            <p>"You are requested to call the attention of your mamours to the
                                decree of 16-6-1891, which must be rigidly applied as required, both
                                for the purpose of searching for eggs, and later for the destruction

                            <p>“Attention is also called to the decree of 26 April last year,
                                authorising moudirs and mamours to plough up any land on which eggs
                                are deposited in sufficient numbers to constitute a public

                            <p>Since last I wrote you, the smallpox epidemic here has abated, and
                                according to report there have been no new cases the last two days.
                                Miss Gibson, of whom I wrote you last week, succumbed to the malady.
                                The other Europeans that were attacked have recovered.</p>
                            <p>There was a serious accident between here and Armant yesterday. The
                                axle of a truck of a goods train broke, through the truck being
                                overladen, derailing seven tracks that were behind it, which all
                                went to pieces. Fortunately there were no casualties, only one man,
                                a mussaffer, was slightly injured. This accident would, however,
                                have caused a serious hindrance to the traffic, but owing to the
                                able management here, men and material were at once on the spot, and
                                the line was soon cleared and repaired, with no delay whatever to
                                the trains.</p>

                            <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                            <p>Sir,—I quite agree with the leader as well as the letter re opening a
                                Nursing Home in Alexandria, and I go so far as to say that it is a
                                disgraceful thing that there should be four of these establishments
                                in Cairo and not one here. Our English resident community is now
                                very large and there are numbers of single men and single young
                                women earning their bread in this city who, when ill, have to accept
                                the shelter of foreign hospitals and also to be satisfied with the
                                attendance either of foreign doctors or foreign nurses. But I see no
                                practical suggestions have been made as to how to start such an
                                institution, and for the very reason that those suggestions should
                                proceed from the principal doctors of each community of Alexandria.
                                I can well understand that the large European hospitals would
                                greatly regret losing their ten-francs-a-day patients; but I cannot
                                understand why the doctors should not hail with delight an
                                arrangement which would certainly put more money into their pockets.
                                If the leading medical men of our city would join hands, as was
                                proposed by Drs. Mackie and Zancarri years ago, the Nursing Home
                                would soon be established. Funds would be forthcoming for building
                                and furnishing purposes, and such a home would of course be
                                self-supporting if each doctor sent his private patients there
                                instead of to the big hospitals. If Dr. Milton, after a very short
                                sojourn in Cairo, was able to run a Nursing Home of his own, it
                                seems to me absurd to say that there could be any possible
                                difficulty in the way of starting such an establishment in
                                Alexandria.—Yours faithfully,</p>

                            <p>On Saturday morning,commencing at 6o'clock, a race was run from Sidi
                                Gaber to Alexandria for one silver and two bronze medals. Ten boys
                                entered for the race, all of them pupils of the Scotch School. Till
                                the Sporting Club was reached the whole of the runners kept pretty
                                well together,.but at this point Pace (14) took the lead, which he
                                kept till he reached the Rond Point turning. Here he slowed up
                                suddenly, and was soon overtaken by the brothers Benveniste, who had
                                kept together all the way. Eventually, R Benvpoista (15) came in
                                first, having covered the distance in 18 minutes. His elder

                                while about 30 yards separated the second and third.</p>
                            <p>Orfanelli took his ease till reaching Ibrehimieh, being the last but
                                one to pass the Casino, then he began to put on speed. At the comer
                                of Rosetta-road be caught up Kasheer (15),having then three others
                                in front of him. Little by little he lessened the distance between
                                himself and Pace (14) and, passing him, finished third. Had the race
                                been a little longer he would probably have won. Of the ten
                                competitors, five finished Within 20 minutes, via, R Benveniste, J.
                                Benveniste, A Orfanelli, Pace, and Kasheer. This is good running
                                when we consider the distance, and that all the competitors were
                                mere boys.</p>
                            <p>It is proposed to have another race in about three months' time, but
                                the plan and exact date are not yet fixed.</p>
