            <div type="item">
                <p>ENTERIC FEVER AND THE ARMY.</p>
                <p>From a military and strategic point of view there can be no doubt that the proper
                    organization, training, and equipment of the British Army in peace with a view
                    to preventing the military disaster which in the past have constantly fallen
                    upon Armies unprepared to meet their onset, is a question of pressing ungenos in
                    the army. In this connection great interest has been aroused, in the army and
                    beyond, by the thorough manner in which the object has been treated by Dr. Leigh
                    Canney in his recent lecture to a large military and medical audience at the
                    Royal United Service Institution Space alone prevents adequate consideration of
                    the important scheme Dr. Leigh Canney has again brought prominently before the
                    army, and we refer our reader, for a detailed report of his scheme to the
                    “Times” of November 9, where three to four columns are occupied by this subject
                    and Dr. Leigh Canney's reply to Sir T. Gallway. That Dr. Leigh Canney was able
                    to produce more evidence from the reports of the Army Medical Department to show
                    that the Army was “sanitarily untrained and unprotected, in an effective sense,
                    both in peace and in war,” will doubtless afford material for serious
                    consideration by the army generally. Snob a condition of the army, if called
                    upon to take the field, cannot, we presume, be in' accordance with the beat
                    endeavors of the Royal A-my Medical Corps, and probably therefore indicate,
                    difficulties either actually experienced or expected by this Corps from those in
                    authority consequent on their neglect to realize the extreme, importance of the
                    mea­sures sanitation demands. The Royal Army Medical Corps, being aware of the
                    frequent difficulties before them in securing the reforms they may desire will
                    nonetheless welcome as an advocate Dr. Leigh Canney, to whom in the past the
                    usual official reply of "entirely im- practicable” has acted only as an
                    incentive to | further efforts to overcome official apathy the result that the
                    "impractical" has been actually carried out within a few months of its declared
                    impracticability. </p>
                <p>We regret, therefore, the tone of 8ir T. Gallway’s letter to the "Time*" both as
                    regards Dr. Leigh Canney's scheme and his reutterance to Sir Fredrick Treves,
                    for both have alike rendered great service to the army. A scheme fashioned so
                    far in advance of anything yet known or practiced in armies—though the Japanese
                    army, two yean after its publication, is found practically adopting its main
                    essentials with very excellent results may naturally arouse opposition at first
                    from those that have not properly studied the data, figures, and facts produced
                    in its support The criticism, however, is doubtless welcomed tending to
                    strengthen the arguments in favor of the, scheme proposed, as far as we are
                    aware.</p>
                <p>Dr. Leigh Canney's scheme has met with practically unanimous approval and strong
                    support from large audiences, military and medical, whenever it has, been
                    considered. It must be remembered that sanitation should not be regarded as the
                    responsible executive duty of any one part of the army alone, such as the Royal
                    Army Medical Corps. Effective sanitation is the duty of the whole army. The
                    training and instruction of the army in methods, the recording of results
                    attained by officers with a view of recognition for success, is the function of
                    a Sanitary Bureau or branch of the R. A. M. C.</p>
                <p>We have observed a tendency amongst officers of the R. A. M. C. to assume that
                    because Dr. Leigh Canney has insisted on the paramount necessity of supplying
                    only sterile water or fluid to armies, as an essential basis of all or any sanit
                    -ry scheme, he therefore recognizes only a waterborne origin or enteric fever.
                    Such interpretation of his opinion would not be in accordance with his published
                    scientific papers. This authority states that “if the liquid avenues, are
                    protected there will be no epidemic; only sporadic cases can occur. If these are
                    isolated the camp will again be free and remain so," and that "if through
                    imperfect protection of the fluid avenues the invasion of enteric is permitted
                    and is fully established, then the subsidiary avenues with become increasingly
                    important." This protection of on Fluid Avenue, in this scheme is secur­ed by
                    sterilization by heat, as being the only absolutely reliable method, and
                    therefore unless this has been done, and by specially trained men, the fluid
                    avenues cannot be considered as closed to the bacillus. The me­thod, of
                    sterilization of drinking water carried out in barracks in India and South
                    Africa stand absolutely condemned by the official reports of the Army Medical
                    Department, as Dr. Leigh Canney points out and states, that "to expect that a
                    poor ignorant outcast Bhisti’ without training is, for a mere pittance, going to
                    interest him, well in the details of the sterile drinking water of your barrack,
                    by order of the regimental authorities,' and what is far more important, conduct
                    you safely through the turmoil of war to the front, and there keep you efficient
                    in the last thing in quixotism," hence Sit T. Gallway could hardly expect to
                    state otherwise than that "all our schemes, for sterilization by boiling or
                    otherwise have had no effect.” Once the army has placed the service of
                    sterilized drinking water beyond discussion this scheme then proceeds to close
                    any suitable remedies, the avenue, by contact, any flies, and possibly by dust,
                    which afford be possible sporadic cases. We cannot follow in detail the mass, of
                    evidence produces by Dr. Leigh Canney in support of each essential condition of
                    his scheme, but it deserves the closest attention from the Army Medical
                    Department and the army generally, for there can be no question that that the
                    control of enteric and allied diseases which form by far the greater proportion
                    of that ‘disease’ which in the experience of the last fifty years of wars, sends
                    the soldier twenty-five times more frequently into hospital than the weapons of
                    the enemy, cannot fail to be of the utmost importance to armies. We trust it may
                    not need another war, and the even greater sani­tary disasters Lord Robert
                    predicts, to bring home to the army the importance of thorough sanitary
                    organization. Meanwhile there is the risk- as the "Times" has recently pointed
                    out "for fear of being 'extreme' they stop short of being efficient"—of partial
                    measures being adopted. The suppression of enteric fever is not to be attained
                    except by thorough, careful, and continuous methods; as Dr. Leigh Canney has
                    stated, “it is a campaign within a campaign."</p>

                <p>Lady Anne Blunt, the wife of Mr. Wilfrid Blunt, arrives at Alexandria this
                    afternoon by the North German Lloyd Schleswig. Mr. Wilfrid Blunt is not coming
                    to Egypt this season owing to illness. His condition, however, has, lately shown
                    considerable improvement.</p>

                    but has prolonged his stay there for another few days.</p>

                <p>LATEST FROM CONSTANTINOPLE.</p>
                <p>Our London Correspondent writes : — The coming marriage between Mr. Percy Wilfrid
                    Maobell, Adviser to the Ministry of the Interior, Cairo, and Countess Victoria
                    Gleichen, better known as Countess Valda, second daughter of the late Prince
                    Victor of H henlobe- Langenbnurg, and of the Princess, who stil1 survives, is
                    now the chief topic of conversation in social circles. The wadding has been
                    fixed for Tuesday, the 5th December, at noon, and will take place at the Chapel
                    Royal, 8t. James’ Palace His Majesty the King has signified his retention of
                    being present.</p>
                <p>The ceremony will be conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury, assisted by the
                    Sub- dean of the Chapel Royal, 8t James's Palace. Archbishop will be
                    particularly attractive to the select few who will be able to gain admit­tance
                    to the chapel, which unfortunately accommodated a very limited number. The
                    service will be fully choral, and Sir Walter Parratt, Mus. Doc., M.V.O., will
                    preside at the organ. Owing to the residence of the Countess at the Palace
                    itself there can, of course, be no procession.</p>
                <p>Mr. Machell has selected the Hon. Harold Willoughby to be his best pan, and the
                    bride will be attended by the following bridesmaids: Miss Lavinia Spencer, and
                    Miss Loelia Ponsonby, and Master Derrick Amory and Master Patrick Holme (nephew
                    of Mr. Machell) will act as pages. The bride will be given away by her brother,
                    Count Gleichen.</p>
                <p>As regards the reception, which will be of a brilliant character, this will take
                    place on Monday' the 4th December, the day before the wadding, in the Armoury,
                    St. James’s Palace. Numerous distinguished guests have been invited.</p>
                <p>On the wedding day itself, in consequence of the small number who can, owing to
                    the smallness of the chapel, be accommodated, there will be no special
                    reception, and the bride and bridegroom will start for their honey­moon on that
                    day.</p>
                <p>It is understood that Mr. Machell will, how­ever, shortly return to Egypt, where
                    he will receive the congratulations of all his friends, and where the Countess,
                    owing not only to her princely birth, but also to her charming personality and
                    her brilliant accomplishments, particularly in music, will be highly
                    appreciated, and where, by right' of birth as well as talent, she will take the
                    highest potboy among the elite of the society of Egypt, and the courtesies due
                    to her exalted rank are sore to be accorded to her. It is truly a notable event
                    in the history of the Civil Service of Egypt.</p>

                    with an enor­mous cachepeigne of tulle and feathers. Mr. and Mrs. Stout were
                    having tea, the latter in a very pretty white frock with much handsome lace
                    insertion, and a small velvet hat Mrs. Carton de Wiart and Miss James were
                    entertaining quite a party, Mr., Mrs. and Miss Joseph being among the party.</p>
                <p>There was the usual small dance at the same hotel during the evening; but not
                    many beyond the hotel visitors were present.</p>
                <p>The band at Mena House Hotel attracted a good many people on Sunday afternoon;
                    and the Pyramids road was thronged with motors and vehicles. The afternoon was

                    bacilli are killed when exposed six hours in the sunlight. He con­siders the

                <p>FUAD PASHA’S SONS.</p>
                <p>Kamel Bey Efferdi, the youngest son of Marshal Fuad Pasha, who is imprisoned in
                    Damascus, arrived hero a few days ago and proceeded to Cairo. Kamel Bey and his
                    brother, Rashid Bey, were military students in Berlin, and after finishing their
                    studies intended to return home. But hearing that by doing so they would
                    probably be exiled, as are their father and eldest brother, the two brothers
                    agreed that one of them should return to Constantinople, and that if he fell
                    into trouble the other brother was to avoid Turkey. Thus Rashid Buy proceeded to
                    the Turkish Capital alone, where he was degraded from his military rank and
                    banished to Konin. Having heard of his brother’s fate Kamel Bey left Berlin for
                    Egypt.</p>

                <p>A NEW HERE8Y.</p>
                <p>The Coptic Patriarch at Cairo has declared himself an opponent of the new heresy
                    which has arisen in Abyssinia. The monks of the Abyssinian monastery of Bislu
                    have taken to teaching the simple folk around them that the doctrine of the
                    Trinity is an error, and that each of the Three Persons is independent of the
                    others in his divine attributes. The Coptic Patriarch at once denounced this
                    teaching as heresy, but Menelik has taken the side of his monks, and a national
                    Abyssinian has just de­clared in favor of three gods.</p>

                    <p>DEATH OF SIR CLINTON DAWKINS.</p>
                    <p>London, December 2.</p>
                    <p>Sir Clinton Dawkins is dead. (Reuter)</p>
                    <p>The announcement of Sir Clinton Dawkins’ death has come as a great shock to
                        the many friends which the late Under Secretary of State at the Ministry of
                        Finance had in this country. He was only 45 years of age and to all
                        appear­ances had a brilliant future before him.</p>
                    <p>Sir Clinton Edward Dawkins, K.C.B., was born 1859, in London, and was
                        educated at Cheltenham and Baliol, where he graduated M A., taking honors in
                        Moderations and Greats. Sir Clinton acted as Private Secretary to Lord Crop
                        of the India Office in 1886, and Private Secretary to Mr. Guschen, when
                        Chan­cellor of the Exchequer, in 1889. He was a representative of the
                        Peruvian Corporation ii Sooth America, 1891; was Under-Secretary for Finance
                        in Egypt, 1895, and Financial Member of the Council of the Governor-General
                        of India, lt-99. He became a partner in Messrs. J. S. Morgan &amp; Co. in
                        1900 and was Chairman of the Committee of War' Office Re-organize- tion,
                        1901. Lord Milner’s famous ‘E gland in Egypt” contains an appendix from Sir
                        Clinton’s pen. He married in 1888, Louise Johnston.</p>

                    <p>At the last meeting of the Royal Numisma­tic Society, held in London on
                        November 16, Mr. J. G Milne communicated a paper on Roman coin-moulds from
                        Egypt, in which be described the use of these moulds and the manner in which
                        coins were e*at in them. This process appears to have been a cire perdue
                        one. The moulds were made from coins of the beginning of the fourth century,
                        mostly struck at the mint of Alexandria. In the course of recent excavations
                        at Oxyrynchus it was ascertained that the proportion of cast coins
                        discovered there was one in five.—In connection with the paper the President
                        and Mr. G.P, Hill exhibited a series of similar moulds, some of which had
                        been found in England, the others coming from Egypt.</p>

                        The issue for the last quarter of 1905 has been brought thoroughly up to
                        date. Lists of officers and of ships have a permanent value from which
                        nothing can detract, but the value of the publication has been considerably
                        enhanced since the incorporation, this year, of the Naval Recorder, which
                        was designed in order to keep readers informed of a larger proportion of the
                        movements and affairs of the Royal Navy than had hitherto been attempted.
                        The “Current History of the Royal Navy,” which is one of >be features, is
                        parked with important events, brief and easily read. A subject of
                        pre-eminent importance alike to the lay English men and the officer is that
                        of commission of ships, and a summary of these has been compiled with
                        evident care. Other records and tables complete the new undertaking, which
                        will no doubt be found of the almost utility and interest.</p>

                        BANKING AND LAND COMPANIES.
                    </head>
                    <p>The following is extracted from the city article of the “Daily Telegraph” of
                        the 25th ulto. Much of it is of course ancient history to many of our
                        readers but as an interesting and succinct resume it deserves reproduction:
                        — During the last twelve months a good deal of attention has been paid to
                        Egyptian bankand land companies which is not surprising when regard is had
                        to the improvement in the condition of the condition of the fellaheen and
                        the increasing prosperity of the country. The progress of Egypt has
                        undoubtedly been hastened by the facilities afforded by the new undertakings
                        but there are signs that, in some instances, speculation had carried things
                        along rather too rapidly, and that a reaction in the near future is highly
                        probable. The oldest of the Egyptian banks it the Bank of Egypt, which was
                        incor­porated in 1856 by Royal charter, and recon­structed and registered as
                        a limited company in 1887. Its capital is £1,000,000, in shares of £15, of
                        which £11 10s per share is called up. The dividends have steadily improved
                        from 9 per cent. For 1*9-4 to 16 percent, for 1904, and the shares now stand
                        at 33, after being as high as 36. The next in seniority is the Anglo-
                        Egyptian Bank, which was registered in 1864, and reconstructed in 188', the
                        capital being £1.500, 000 in shares of £15, of which £5 is paid. This bank’s
                        dividends have risen in the last ten years from 6 per cent to, 12j per cent.
                        For each to the past two financial years ended on Ang. 31, and the shares
                        are quoted at 13}. But these banks have substantial reserve funds, and np to
                        1898 had a practical monopoly of the banking business in Egypt In that year
                        Sir Ernest Cassel came on the scene and started his operations by forming
                        the Irrigation Investment Corporation, with a nominal share capital of
                        £100,000 and power to issue Debenture* or similar securities* for the
                        purpose of acquiring the pay warrants according to Messrs. John Aird and Co.
                        in connection with the great Nile barrage scheme. Egyptian Government Poor
                        per Cent. Irrigation Trust certificates, of which there are £2,590.900
                        outstanding, are well known as «u excellent investment, and are quoted at
                        about: 104.</p>
                    <p>Sir Ernest Castel's next step was, in conjunction with a syndicate comprising
                        Mesers. E Cattani, E. Cronier, and Sanieh Company, and to acquire the Daira
                        Estates from the Egyptian Government, and to form the Diara Sanieh Company.
                        Out of the sales of these lands the whole of the £6,431,570 Daira Sanieh
                        Govern­ment bonds have been redeemed, and the company has made very large
                        profits. The agreement was that the property, or sufficient to pay off the
                        Government bond, should be Bold within seven years, provided the sales could
                        be effected at a net profit of 20 per cent. The capital of the company was
                        £600,000 in 118,000. Ordinary shares of £5 each, and</p>
                    <p>10,000. Deferred shares of £1 each. After pay­ment of 5-per cent, on the
                        Ordinary shares half the surplus goes to the Egyptian Govern­ment, and of
                        the remaining moiety the Or­dinary shares get 60 per cent and the Deferred
                        40 per cent. From 1899 to 1902 the dividend on the Ordinary shares was 3s.,
                        for 1903 it was 4s and in 1904 it was 8s per share. In October last, It will
                        be remembered that after repayment of the Government bunds distributions
                        were made of £ 0 on the Ordinary and £78 on the Deferred. The price of Daira
                        Sanieh Ordinary have ranged from 7 1/2 to 30, the pre­sent price, after
                        deduction of the £ 0 re­cently paid, being 17 3/4, while the Deferred
                        shares, which have fluctuated between 35 and 185, are now quoted at 108, ex
                        the £78 above referred to. It will thus be seen what an enormous success the
                        company has proved. The next company, issued under the auspices of Sir
                        Ernest Cassel, was the National Bank of Egypt, formed as an Egyptian
                        joint-stock company in June, 1898, with a capital of £3,000,000 in shares of
                        £0 each. So far 250,000 shares have Dean issued, and the present quotation
                        is about 25, the highest point having been 28 1/4. The dividend for last
                        year was 7 per cent</p>
                    <p>In May 1902, the Agricultural Bank of Egypt was floated as an Egyptian
                        joint-stock company, to make advances on mortgage to small farmers, and it
                        is practically a subsidiary of the National Bank of Egypt The original
                        capital was £2,500,000, consisting of 125,000 4 per cent. Preference shares
                        of £10 each.</p>
                    <p> Ordinary shares of £5, and 2,000 deferred shares of £5 each. In September
                        last the ordinary capital was doubled by a further issue of 248,000 shares.
                        The fully-paid ordinary shares, which have been as high as 14 ¼ are now
                        quoted at 9 3/8.Various other land, banking, and finance companies have been
                        recently created, mostly of a speculative character, and in which little
                        interest is taken in the London market. Among these may be mentioned the
                        Land Bank of Egypt, with a capital of £500,000 in 97,000 Ordinary and 5,000
                        Founders’ shares of £5 each. This bank was promoted this year by the
                        Anglo-Foreign Banking Company, and the Ordinary shares stand at 8 ½, after
                        being as high as 10, The Union Foncier of Egypt, with a capital of £500.000,
                        was also issued quite recently, and the shares, after being 3 premium, are
                        now nominally 1 premium. Yet another similar concern is the Egyptian Estate
                        and Finance Company, of which 250,000 shares of 1 have been subscribe. Here
                        again after being up to 2, the shares are now quoted about par. It will be
                        noticed that in all the recent quotation prices have fallen considerably
                        from the top and this fact probably explains the uneasiness lately felt
                        concerning the financial position in Egypt. That there is a great future for
                        Egypt no one will den, but, as the chairman of Anglo-Egyptian Bank stated at
                        the meeting, competition is becoming excessive, it will be a pity if
                        financial disaster is courted by the over production of speculative
                        companies</p>

                                <p>“A citizen of no moan city, I beseech this suffer me to speak
                                    unto the people.”</p>
                                <p>Sir,—In quoting the above words, which were spoken by one of the
                                    finest men the world ever produced, I do so in no irre­verent
                                    spirit, although 1 have no pretention to refer them to snob
                                    lofty aims as did their author. A few years since I once read in
                                    your columns, on some question referring. I think, to public
                                    infraction, that we who.use the English language have done more
                                    than any other people to endeavour to make the Book from which I
                                    now quote, the guide of our daily life I sincerely believe that
                                    we have rightly done so; though many people appear to think that
                                    the Bible should only be used on Sunday or quoted only on
                                    religious questions. I think on the contrary that we may often
                                    profit by its teaching, even in the most mundane and frivolous
                                    acts of our lives.</p>
                                <p>Your columns have lately teemed with a correspondence referring
                                    originally to the water supply of Alexandria, during which
                                    several very unpleasant questions have been raked up,such
                                    unsavoury things as stinking lobsters and vomiting dogs, have
                                    been brought on the scene, and the sealed door of past Municipal
                                    shortcomings has been ruthlessly burst open your last
                                    correspondent .“En­trepreneur” gives us some good advice in the
                                    latter part of his letter, but it is clothed in such language as
                                    should suggest to his friends the gift of “The Polite Letter
                                    Writer" as an appropriate off ring for the coming new year; the
                                    necessity for its use might be impressed on the recipient by a
                                    suitable inscription.</p>
                                <p>All this bother seems, strings to say, to be elicited by the
                                    fact, that the town is now for the fir*t £me supplied with clean
                                    water.</p>
                                <p>A few Years ago. I saw in a French paper a very fine cartoon, in
                                    which France was re­presented by a singularly beautiful woman,
                                    of heroic proportions. She appears to have been looking into the
                                    distant futunre on the horizon, but turns her head, with a
                                    scornful expression, to some half-dozen suituors standing behind
                                    her, and says to thorn “Messieurs roes amis, dpargnez-mois, je
                                    vons eu prie ; qaant 5 mes ennemH,—je m’eQ charge I”</p>
                                <p>Modern Alexandria may well make some such rebuke to those who
                                    wrangle around her, like dogs quarrelling over a bone; for
                                    looked upon in the light of the last twenty years, the modern
                                    Alexandrian can now say, and will in a few years be able to say
                                    with still greater truth, that he is a citizen of no mean city.
                                    , We live in a time, and country, of short memories; many of the
                                    most influential people now in Alexandria were only just
                                    emerging from their cradles in 1882, when our town was reduced
                                    to a smouldering mass of ruins, and even their parents had found
                                    it more convenient to be “not at home” for a considerable while.
                                    People who really knew what’ Alexandria was reduced to at that
                                    time are getting scarcer every day.</p>
                                <p>A few days ago I saw a ship in our harbour flying the flag of a
                                    well-known British Admiral who saw all this in 1882. and mast
                                    remember the state of the place as he left; if I had the
                                    pleasure of his acquaintance should like to ask him to look
                                    round, and after taking into consideration that the progress of
                                    the last few years will, if maintained,' put np a fine sea
                                    frontage inside the beautiful quay of our Eastern harbour, to
                                    give his opinion, as to whether the town has or has not made a
                                    very respectable effort of recovery since 1882 and now, more
                                    than at any time since then, the citizens have both the wish to
                                    improve their town, and the means necessary for the purpose.</p>
                                <p>Instead of continuing to abuse each other, in a manner which is
                                    almost a disgrace to your columns, cannot we individually try to
                                    do something for the public good!</p>
                                <p>I love Alexandria for reasons which may not appeal to many
                                    people; I take a melancholy interest in revisiting the spots,
                                    where under varying circumstances, I have seen some of my
                                    friends killed, and, later on, have seen some of the enemies
                                    shot or hang, and I watch with kindly interest every step taken
                                    in the right direction, towards making this city worthy of its
                                    ancient reputation; it may not be in my town, but I feel
                                    confident that this goal will be reached, and not only that, but
                                    it will be accompanied wth the blessings of just laws and a good
                                    Government, such as ancient Alexandria could never boast.</p>
                                <p>Among other friends from whom we want to be saved, are those who
                                    have in the past so freely despoiled our town and country of the
                                    noble relics of antiquity which were its ornament. </p>
                                <p>I do not expect that anything which I may say, will induce the
                                    Venetians to send us back the body of St. Mark, or the column
                                    which they were stole from us; they might pretend that lapse of
                                    centuries gives them some shadowy sort of ownership. Our friends
                                    the French have done us so much good in the past that I do not
                                    much grudge them their obelisk of the Place de la Concordia; I
                                    am prepared to say “requiescat in pace,” but I shall always
                                    consider myself an injured individual, as long as London and New
                                    York profit by those acts of vandalism committed in recent times
                                    by the British and American Governments when they despoiled our
                                    city by the removal of the two Cleopatra needles. I regret to
                                    say that I assisted at the ceremony of the departure of both
                                    these monuments, and although there was no lack of flags flying
                                    and even of people cheering, they seemed to me very melancholy
                                    occasions, and only suggested the noble Roman exclamation, “sic
                                    transit Gloria mundi.”</p>
                    <p>I hear that the climate of the Thames embankment does not suit one of our
                        obelisks very well, perhaps one of your American readers can tell you
                        whether the other fares better in New York.</p>
                    <p>I hope I may live to see the day when these needles shall so prick the
                        conscience of the respective governments, under whose shadow they have found
                        a temporary resting place, that they will cry out “mea culpa” and send them
                        home again.</p>
                    <p>Although modern governments may be susceptible to some such feeling, I doubt
                        if it will go far enough to make them put their hand very far in their
                        pocket to carry out such pions work. There may, however, be a way of getting
                        over this. When all the towns in England and America have more books than
                        they can read, and that time must be fast approaching, here might be a
                        splendid opportunity for some philanthropic and wealthy gentleman to hand
                        his name down to posterity much more effectively than by the means of some
                        common or garden monument in a cemetery. Egypt in, with each succeeding
                        year, taking a more conspisious place on the worlds highway. Surely a neat
                        inscription on the base of one of these needles, when restored to their
                        proper place, i.e. flanking our projected Municipal Palace on the quay of
                        the Eastern harbor, is a thing worth paying for. I do not, for a moment,
                        wish your readers to think that I have invented this idea, it must have been
                        the main factor leading to the construction of the most famous monuments in
                        Egypt.</p>
                    <p>When the modern Athenian feels himself inspired to beautify his city he is
                        generally able to re assure his fellow townsmen, in words that were written
                        some years ago on the occasion of the errection of a sacred edifice not far
                        from Alexandria;-“from the other pockets, far shall come, the useful help,
                        this needful sum.”</p>
                    <p>I hope I have developed my suggestion sufficiently to induce the Municipality
                        to chalk out the proper position for the erection of the two Cleopatra
                        needles, and perhaps they might save time by putting in the foundations.</p>
                    <p>I do not wish it to be thought that I suggest playing the game of bluff,
                        which seems to be the fashion in central Europe just now, or even ask for a
                        new fleet; I would on the contrary base our expectations on entirely
                        different lines;- something more like Long fellows idea when he defends the
                        tyrant of the family,- the baby; by saying in one of the finest lines he
                        ever wrote;-“he ruleth by the divine of helplessness”.</p>
                    <p>Hoping that you will bring this matter to the serious attention of the
                        British and American Governments,</p>
                    <p>I have honor to be,</p>

                        <p>MOSQUITOES IN EGYPT</p>
                    <p>We are pleased to hear that our leader on the "Extermination of the Mosquito”
                        has already induced several people to institute a campaign on their premises
                        against these pests. We can see no reason why the nuisance especially in our
                        ports, should not be entirely abolished by the carrying out of a general
                        crusade against the mosquito. Certainly in Egypt we are not in such a bad
                        state as countries further south. But the abolition of the mosquito would be
                        a great fact to this country. </p>
                    <p>A correspondant writes on this subject giving some extracts from an address
                        on tropical medicine delivered at Leicester by Professor Bryce, FRS in July
                        last:-</p>
                    <p>In all parts of the world practical effect is being given to the newer
                        methods of prophylaxis. From the Federated Malay States there has been
                        published by Dr. Watson shows that in these towns, whilst the number of
                        deaths has been greatly reduced, increase has taken place in the district
                        around, where no anti-malarial operation were undertaken. He further points
                        out that the reduction has not only taken place in malaria, not also in the
                        other diseases due in many instances to the low state of health consequent
                        on malaria. He finally clams, and with justice. ”for the Government of
                        Selanger the honor of being the first British Administration to follow R.ms
                        in an attempt to confer on those entrusted to its care the benefits of his
                        great discovery’”</p>
                    <p>From Hong Kong we have recently received the report of Dr. Atkinson for 1904.
                        He show as the result of antimalarial measures, the following marked
                        decrease in malarial cases. Based upon the admissions into the three
                        hospitals. The total admissions in 1901 were 1,393; in 1902. 816; in 1903,
                        614; and 1904, 490. In Imailia and Havana the result are well known. From
                        Italy, Algeria, Mexico, Brazil, and from many of our own Colonia
                        possessions, most satisfactory reports are being constantly received.</p>
                    <p>A most striking feature of the reports of many of the South American towns is
                        the remarkable decreased of yellow fever as the result of organised
                        campaigns against the Stegomyia. In many places in spite of greatly improved
                        municipal hygiene, yellow fever still made headway, and there were, in
                        consequence, numerous critics found to draw attention to the uselessness of
                        spending money on sanitary reforms.</p>
                    <p>With the discovery of the true cause of the spreading of yellow fever,
                        criticism was soon disarmed by the remarkable reduction in the cases of this
                        disease brought about by getting rid of the mosquito.</p>
                    <p>Although these results are most encouraging and are increasing in number,
                        yet, after all, they form only a small beginning, and there yet remains an
                        immense amount to be accomplished and a vast sea of prejudice and apathy to
                        be got over.</p>
                    <p>At the discussion last year Dr. Stephens stated that he did not believe that
                        one in a hundred laymen in the tropics knew that malaria was a contagious
                        disease, or suspected the source of contagion to reside in the natives
                        around him. That is true in a great measure to day. My experience is, for
                        the most part, amongst those living in and trading with the West Coast, and
                        whilst, undoubtedly, great improvement has taken place in the Gambia, Sierra
                        Leone, and Lagor. There still exists a high percentage mortality; the young
                        and the old trader and the miner are still indifferent, antimalarial
                        measures are talked about but pushed on with, and still the sanitation of
                        our oldest coast towns is a blot on our administration.</p>
                    <p>But, after all, it gives little satisfaction to any ore to complain. The
                        problem is now being grappled with, an increasing number of the medical team
                        officers have been especially trained, increased regard is being paid to the
                        quarters of the white man, the use of the mosquito net is being appreciated,
                        controlled water supplies are coming into practice, and a greatly increased
                        number of investigators both 'at home and in the tropics are focusing
                        attention on the tropics.</p>

                        <hi xml:id="bookmark3">THE DESERT OF SINAI.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>It is perhaps not very generally that “the exact boundary of Egypt towards
                        the Turkish province of Palestine is marked by a straight line which tans
                        from a point of the Mediterranean Sea, a little to the east of El Arish, to
                        the head of the Golf of Akaba." This eastern boundary leaves the desert of
                        Sinai to Egypt, but excludes the little fortress town of Akaba. Nearly the
                        whole of the peninsula of Sinai is mountainous and has been described as “a
                        wilderness of rocks and “mountains, -arid plains and dry beds of “torrents—a
                        great and terrible desert” Ex­ploration and topographical survey have
                        re­vealed marks of an astonishingly early stage of civilization, and else
                        indications of the existence of early forms of religion, far removed from
                        that of wandering Arab tribes. The routes of exodus did not lie entirely
                        outside the pale of civilization. There were importantmines; at least one
                        port of debarkation for ships coming from Egypt; the country was intersected
                        by trade outes which were probably of extreme antiquity. A careful
                        examination of narratives has shown thath the apparent confusion between
                        Horeb and Sinai may be quite cleared away for the names are practically
                        interchangeable; what the northern tribes called Horab and Sinai. Dr.
                        Wrinkler of Berlin derives the name Sinai from the moon goddess Sin, and
                        Horeb (lit the mountain of glowing heat) from the sun, both names thus
                        expressing ancient cosmological conceptions. If this be so, the region of
                        Sinai was from earliest times a place of sanctity. The history of the
                        peninsula is as old as that of Egypt itself. The turquoise mines of Maghara
                        and the copper mines of Sarbut el Khadem were worked by Egyptians more than
                        5,000 years ago. Assuming that Mt. Sanai of the Pentateuch is somewhere in
                        the peninsula between the Gulf of Sinai and the Gulf of Akaba (Prof. Sayce
                        has placed it outside, in the land of Midian), we have a remarkable
                        divergence of opinion amongst critics and trevellers as to the actual
                        mountain named in the Hebrew writings. Is Mt. Sinai of Pentateuche to be
                        identified with Mt. Serbal, Jebel Musa or Jebel Katerina? These are
                        questions to be discussed by experts who have studied the evidence and have
                        personally visited and examined the localities named. After the middle of
                        the 4th century the peninsula was gradually people with Anchorites and
                        numerous Coenobites. On Mt. Serbal and in the Wadi Fitan there were
                        numberless settlements of Anchorites. In the 6th century Justinian built a
                        church half way up Jebel Musa and also constructed a strong fortress at the
                        foot of the mountain. Since this fortress offered protection from the
                        hermits from Wadi Fian and Mt. Serbal gradually found their way to Jebel
                        Musa, which was now regarded as a holy place. With the spread of Islam the
                        Anchorites gradually disappeared, the monastery of the Transfiguration alone
                        maintaining its position. </p>
                    <p>Prof. Flinders Petrie has recently discovered, or refound, and photographed
                        some important inscriptions at Maghara and cleared out a Semetic Temple at
                        Sartutel Khaddem which has given unexpected light on Jewish worship and
                        ritual. </p>
                    <p>We are looking forward to Dr. Ruffer’s lecture tonight on this most
                        interesting and difficult subject, “the Desert of Sinai.” Among the many
                        photographs to be placed on the screen are several of prehistoric houses and
                        rock eut chapels. </p>
                    <p>NEW YORK LIFE INSURANCE CO.</p>
                    <p>“DISGUISING” THE BOOKS.</p>
                    <p>New York, Friday</p>
                    <p>At today’s sitting of the Insurance Investigation Committee, Mr Hughes,
                        counsel for the committee, elicited from a clerk in the financial department
                        of the New York Life Insurance Company to a Boston firm. This loan, witness
                        stated, Mr. Perkins caused to be placed in a fund of which he was a trustee,
                        and further saw to it that there should be no record of this proceeding in
                        the books of the New York Life.</p>
                    <p>After much questioning Mr. Hughs elicited from the witness a statement that
                        he believed the money was used to swell the fund devoted to rewarding agents
                        for results obtained. </p>
                    <p>From the same witness Mr.Hughs learned that Mr. Hamilton, who attended to the
                        company’s interests in regard to State legislation, received over $59,000
                        direct from Messrs. J.P. Morgan and Co., which represented the New York Life
                        Insurance Company’s profits on its interest in the organization of the
                        Unites States Steel Corporation. The company’s participation in the
                        undertaking was disguised so as to appear to be the participation of a
                        subsidiary company. No record of the payment was to be found in the New York
                        Life Insurance Company’s books. </p>
