                                    Mr. Percy Wilfrid Maobell, Adviser to the Ministry of the
                                    Interior, Cairo, and Countess Victoria Gleichen, better known as
                                    Countess Valda, second daughter of the late Prince Victor of H
                                    henlobe- Langenbnurg, and of the Princess, who stil1 survives,
                                    is now the chief topic of conversation in social circles. The
                                    wadding has been fixed for Tuesday, the 5th December, at noon,
                                    and will take place at the Chapel Royal, 8t. James’ Palace His
                                    Majesty the King has signified his retention of being
                                    present.</p>
                                <p>The ceremony will be conducted by the Archbishop of Canterbury,
                                    assisted by the Sub- dean of the Chapel Royal, 8t James's
                                    Palace. Archbishop will be particularly attractive to the select
                                    few who will be able to gain admit­tance to the chapel, which
                                    unfortunately accommodated a very limited number. The service
                                    will be fully choral, and Sir Walter Parratt, Mus. Doc., M.V.O.,
                                    will preside at the organ. Owing to the residence of the
                                    Countess at the Palace itself there can, of course, be no
                                    procession.</p>
                                <p>Mr. Machell has selected the Hon. Harold Willoughby to be his
                                    best pan, and the bride will be attended by the following
                                    bridesmaids: Miss Lavinia Spencer, and Miss Loelia Ponsonby, and
                                    Master Derrick Amory and Master Patrick Holme (nephew of Mr.
                                    Machell) will act as pages. The bride will be given away by her
                                    brother, Count Gleichen.</p>
                                <p>As regards the reception, which will be of a brilliant character,
                                    this will take place on Monday' the 4th December, the day before
                                    the wadding, in the Armoury, St. James’s Palace. Numerous
                                    distinguished guests have been invited.</p>
                                <p>On the wedding day itself, in consequence of the small number who
                                    can, owing to the smallness of the chapel, be accommodated,
                                    there will be no special reception, and the bride and bridegroom
                                    will start for their honey­moon on that day.</p>
                                <p>It is understood that Mr. Machell will, how­ever, shortly return
                                    to Egypt, where he will receive the congratulations of all his
                                    friends, and where the Countess, owing not only to her princely
                                    birth, but also to her charming personality and her brilliant
                                    accomplishments, particularly in music, will be highly
                                    appreciated, and where, by right' of birth as well as talent,
                                    she will take the highest potboy among the elite of the society
                                    of Egypt, and the courtesies due to her exalted rank are sore to
                                    be accorded to her. It is truly a notable event in the history
                                    of the Civil Service of Egypt.</p>

                                <p>The band on Shepheard’s verandah was the usual attraction on
                                    Saturday afternoon. Mrs. Rome was there in one of the very
                                    newest sailor hats—with a wideow crown surround­ed with roses
                                    and perched at an impossible but essentially chic angle with an
                                    enor­mous cachepeigne of tulle and feathers. Mr. and Mrs. Stout
                                    were having tea, the latter in a very pretty white frock with
                                    much handsome lace insertion, and a small velvet hat Mrs. Carton
                                    de Wiart and Miss James were entertaining quite a party, Mr.,
                                    Mrs. and Miss Joseph being among the party.</p>
                                <p>There was the usual small dance at the same hotel during the
                                    evening; but not many beyond the hotel visitors were
                                    present.</p>
                                <p>The band at Mena House Hotel attracted a good many people on
                                    Sunday afternoon; and the Pyramids road was thronged with motors
                                    and vehicles. The afternoon was quite chilly and many people
                                    were wearing fare.</p>

                                <p>A German physician has discovered that the air of the Egyptian
                    desert is about as free from bacterial life as the Polar regime on the high
                    seas. Tubercle bacilli are killed when exposed six hours in the sunlight. He
                    con­siders the desert especially suitable for the cure of rheumatism and
                    patients suffering from kidney diseases.</p>

                    Egypt, Sheikh Yehia, has been dismissed by an Imperial Iradi, and that Shaikh
                    Djemal El-Din Eff. Grand Cadi of the Hedjaz has been appointed to replace him in

                <p>It was the Khedive’s prerogative (“Al Moa- yad" remarks) to select the Grand Cadi
                    of Egypt, who receives his official appointment from the Sultan; but this time

                    after calling the Mahein’s attention to this prerogative.</p>
                <p>We understand that nothing is known offi­cially as to the reason of the Grand

                <p>The Khedive arrived at Sidi Gaber station from Cairo yesterday evening at 8.30
                    o’clock and proceeded to Montazah Palace, where his Highness spent the

                <p>FUAD PASHA’S SONS.</p>
                <p>Kamel Bey Efferdi, the youngest son of Marshal Fuad Pasha, who is imprisoned in
                    Damascus, arrived hero a few days ago and proceeded to Cairo. Kamel Bey and his
                    brother, Rashid Bey, were military students in Berlin, and after finishing their
                    studies intended to return home. But hearing that by doing so they would
                    probably be exiled, as are their father and eldest brother, the two brothers
                    agreed that one of them should return to Constantinople, and that if he fell
                    into trouble the other brother was to avoid Turkey. Thus Rashid Buy proceeded to
                    the Turkish Capital alone, where he was degraded from his military rank and
                    banished to Konin. Having heard of his brother’s fate Kamel Bey left Berlin for
                    Egypt.</p>

                <p>A NEW HERE8Y.</p>
                <p>The Coptic Patriarch at Cairo has declared himself an opponent of the new heresy
                    which has arisen in Abyssinia. The monks of the Abyssinian monastery of Bislu
                    have taken to teaching the simple folk around them that the doctrine of the
                    Trinity is an error, and that each of the Three Persons is independent of the
                    others in his divine attributes. The Coptic Patriarch at once denounced this
                    teaching as heresy, but Menelik has taken the side of his monks, and a national
                    Abyssinian has just de­clared in favor of three gods.</p>

                <p>We much regret to announce the tragic death of Dr. Joseph Sierra, physician to
                    the Egyptian Railway Administration for the last twenty years. Dr. Sierra was in
                    the best of health on Saturday and he spent a portion of the day in settling his
                    private affairs and making preparations for death. He apparently committed
                    suicide on Saturday night by open­ing an artery and on Sunday morning was found
                    dead in his bed. The tragedy is enhanced by the fact that his wife arrived
                    yesterday morning at Alexandria by the Florio-Rubattino steamer. Dr. Sierra was
                    an Italian Jew by origin and was about 62 years of age. He was raised to the
                    rank of Cavaliere some years ago by the King of Italy. The funeral took place
                    this morning and was largely attended, for the doctor was much respected and
                    liked by all classes of the community.</p>

                <p>DEATH OF SIR CLINTON DAWKINS.</p>
                <p>London, December 2.</p>
                <p>Sir Clinton Dawkins is dead. (Reuter)</p>
                <p>The announcement of Sir Clinton Dawkins’ death has come as a great shock to the
                    many friends which the late Under Secretary of State at the Ministry of Finance
                    had in this country. He was only 45 years of age and to all appear­ances had a
                    brilliant future before him.</p>
                <p>Sir Clinton Edward Dawkins, K.C.B., was born 1859, in London, and was educated at
                    Cheltenham and Baliol, where he graduated M A., taking honors in Moderations and
                    Greats. Sir Clinton acted as Private Secretary to Lord Crop of the India Office
                    in 1886, and Private Secretary to Mr. Guschen, when Chan­cellor of the
                    Exchequer, in 1889. He was a representative of the Peruvian Corporation ii Sooth
                    America, 1891; was Under-Secretary for Finance in Egypt, 1895, and Financial
                    Member of the Council of the Governor-General of India, lt-99. He became a
                    partner in Messrs. J. S. Morgan &amp; Co. in 1900 and was Chairman of the
                    Committee of War' Office Re-organize- tion, 1901. Lord Milner’s famous ‘E gland
                    in Egypt” contains an appendix from Sir Clinton’s pen. He married in 1888,
                    Louise Johnston.</p>

                <p></p>
                <p>The following telegram was received on Saturday too late for publication in that
                    day's issue:—</p>
                <p>Normal working has been resumed over bridge at Abou el Nomros station. Passengers
                    will not have to change carriages. Trains are, however, subject to fifteen
                    minutes’ delay.</p>
                <p>COIN MOULDS IN EGYPT.</p>
                <p>At the last meeting of the Royal Numisma­tic Society, held in London on November
                    16, Mr. J. G Milne communicated a paper on Roman coin-moulds from Egypt, in
                    which be described the use of these moulds and the manner in which coins were
                    e*at in them. This process appears to have been a cire perdue one. The moulds
                    were made from coins of the beginning of the fourth century, mostly struck at
                    the mint of Alexandria. In the course of recent excavations at Oxyrynchus it was
                    ascertained that the proportion of cast coins discovered there was one in
                    five.—In connection with the paper the President and Mr. G.P, Hill exhibited a
                    series of similar moulds, some of which had been found in England, the others
                    coming from Egypt.</p>

                <p>Part I. of the Hibeh Papyri is now being printed, and will be issued in June
                    next. The volume consists of papyri of the third century b.c. from mummy
                    cartonnage, including many classical fragments.</p>
                <p>ROYAL NAVY LI8T.</p>
                <p>To anyone in any way connected with the Royal Navy the “Royal Navy List and Naval
                    Recorder” (Witherby &amp; Co.) is invaluable as a book of reference. The issue
                    for the last quarter of 1905 has been brought thoroughly up to date. Lists of
                    officers and of ships have a permanent value from which nothing can detract, but
                    the value of the publication has been considerably enhanced since the
                    incorporation, this year, of the Naval Recorder, which was designed in order to
                    keep readers informed of a larger proportion of the movements and affairs of the
                    Royal Navy than had hitherto been attempted. The “Current History of the Royal
                    Navy,” which is one of >be features, is parked with important events, brief and
                    easily read. A subject of pre-eminent importance alike to the lay English men
                    and the officer is that of commission of ships, and a summary of these has been
                    compiled with evident care. Other records and tables complete the new
                    undertaking, which will no doubt be found of the almost utility and
                    interest.</p>
