                    <p>The official program of the festivities in connection with the visit of the
                        French fleet leaves nothing to be desired. His Majesty the King will review
                        the French Fleet, Admiral Caillard and his gallant and distin guished staff
                        will be his guests, and are specially invited to witness the races for the
                        King’s Cup. Windsor Castle is to be thrown open to our friendly rivals, and
                        we may be sure that our Ruler has still some pleasant surprises in store for
                        his guests. The City of London follows the example of the King ; Portsmouth
                        may be trusted to live up to its reputation, and last but not least, the two
                        Houses will entertain the French officers in Westminster Hall. Six years agp
                        who could have proposed that the centenary year of the Trafalgar would be
                        marked by the fraternisation of the French and British Fleets at Portsmouth
                        following on the friendly visit of a Spanish King to London Yet nothing
                        could be more necessary in the the interests of the peaces of the world,
                        than the “entente cordiale” between two nations whose ideals as to progress
                        and liberty are identical, whose mutual commercial inter ests increase daily
                        and whose ancient quarrels have become a source of mutual respect. Our
                        soldiers and sailors have not always had the best of the give and take. If
                        the British Fleets swept the seas under Nelson and Collingwood, they were
                        well nigh swept from the seas during the later years of the American war,
                        when Guioben and Suffren commanded victor ious squadrons of which any
                        Admiral might have been proud, and though we triumphed under the leadership
                        of the great Iron Duke and the greater Marlborough, the names of Froute noy,
                        Lauffeld, Steinkirk, and neerwinden attest that even the soldiers who swore-
                        and fought- so terribly in Flanders often met their match. Let us,rather,
                        while remembering our victories, forget against whom they were gain ed and
                        while profiting by out defeats cease to underline in our minds the name of
                        the con queror. Thus Crecy and Bovines, Hastings and Waterloo, may became
                        names of peaceful omen. </p>
                    <p>We remember a passage in an English novel - alas! the author;s name has
                        escaped us- that bears on this point. Two Englishmen meet in the one
                        guest-room of a tiny hotel in Ireland. Both eye one another over their pipes
                        and one suddenly exclaimed, “Excuse me, but-er-didn’t we meet last behind
                        the fives courts at X…” “Yes,” replies the other, laugh ing, “and call-over
                        stopped it after the fifth round ;” and the two discuss their old school-
                        days and school quarrels with the greatest good humor in the world. May such
                        be the relations of France and England in the future. They have led a wild
                        and rather quarrelsome youth, they have fought one another out of sheer
                        pugnacity, or out of mutual jealously born of the other’s attentions to
                        various colored enchantresses in Asia and Africa and the Spanish Main, but
                        they are settling down now to a law-abiding and steady middle age. John is
                        ready to admit that Jacques is a right good fellow in spite of his
                        theatrical manner, and Jacques in convinced that John’s reserve hides a warm
                        and friendly heart and both are inclined to think more fondly of Edward the
                        Peacemaker and President Loubet that of William the Conqueror and the Edward
                        who took Calais. Their old war-songs cease to call up memories of battle and
                        Marot;s refrain. “Car France est cimitiere aux Anglsis” and Drayton’s ballad
                        of Agincourt appeal to day to mixed audiences. </p>

                    <head>THE MARSHALL ISLANDS</head>
                    <p>Australian sensitiveness in connection with German aggressiveness in the
                        Marshall Islands is not likely to be blunted by any tranquilising assurance
                        from minor officials. To give strength and validity to such under takings,,
                        it is essential that they should come direct from Prince von Bulow.
                        Australians will want to know, therefore, whether the German Consul at
                        Sydney had the Chan cellor;s authority for stating that the new laws for the
                        government of the insular group will be framed “in accordance with Aus
                        tralians wishes.” Until about 20 years ago, England and Germany had
                        practically the same footing in the islands. But Downing street, fearing
                        that this dual control might breed future complications, as between England
                        and France in the New Hebrides, gravely affronted Australian sentiment by
                        consenting to the establishment of a German Protectorate. It was strictly
                        covenanted, however, that the than “open door,” should remain open. But
                        Teutonio smartness hit on an expedient to close it. The administra tive
                        control, including all fiscal arrange ments was handed over to a private com
                        mercial concern, the Jaluit Company, which at once proceeded to build up a
                        trading mono poly for its own exclusive profit. One method was the
                        imposition of a duty of L3 per ton on exports in Australian vessels ; but to

                    <p>New York, August 5. M. Witte and Baron Rosen paid a visit to President
                        Roosevelt at Oyster Bay, similar to that of Baron Kamoura and M. Takashira
                        last week, with the object of informally eating their respects prior to
                        to-day’s formal reception. It is stated that the question of precedence
                        today has been decided in favor of Japan. (R.)</p>
                    <p>WASHINGTON, August 5. The plenipotentiaries have arrived at Oyster Bay. The
                        envoys were received by President Roosevelt on board the Government yacht

                        Roosevelt yesterday. Mr. Roosevelt gave a lunch to the Russian and Japanese
                        plenipotentiaries. In his toast he expressed an ardent wish for the
                        conclusion of a just and lasting peace. (Haus.)</p>
                    <p>WASHINGTON, August 6. President Roosevelt presented the envoys to each other.
                        A luncheon then followed, at which Mr. Roosevelt proposed a toast to the
                        welfare and prosperity of the two great nations, saying that it was his
                        earnest prayer in the interest of all mankind, that a just and last- ing
                        peace may be speedily concluded. </p>
                    <p>The envoys shook hands cordially when introduced. Before leaving, the
                        Japanese ex- pressed professional gratification at the pleasant meeting.

                    <p>ST. PETERSBURG, August 5. Despite the opposition of the reactionary party,
                        the Council of the Empire which met at Peterhof has decided that no bill
                        rejected by a two-thirds majority shall be submitted for the Tsar’s

                        will decide between the two. This decision is important in solving the

                        sent out in order to observe the forthcoming eclipse of the sun have arrived
                        in Cairo and leave for Assouan this evening, accompanied by Captian Lyons.
                        Captain Lyons will return to Cario on August 31, bu the date of return of
                        the mis- sions is not yet fixed. Another expedition consisting of Russian
                        savants, is due to arrive in Egypt shortly.</p>
                    <p>On August 30 the moon passes exactly between the sun and our earth, and
                        produces the comparatively rare phenomenon of a total eclipse of the
                        sun.</p>
                    <p>It is only on such occasions that the corona or halo of light which surrounds
                        the sun, can be seen at all, and it is in consequence of this fact that
                        astronomers journey to distant parts of the earth from which the eclipsed
                        sun can be observed. </p>
                    <p>For European observers the line of totality of the approaching eclipse is
                        very conveniently placed, so that it can be reached quiet easily and at a
                        small expense. The elliptical shadow of the moon on the earth’s surface
                        moves from Hudson’s Bay to Arabia, so that the path traced out is

                    <p>To observe the corona, therefore it is neces- say to place oneself somewhere
                        on this small strip of the the earth’s surface. After leaving the American
                        continent at Labrador, the shadow sweeps across the Atlantic and strikes
                        Europe near Cape Ortega, in the north-west of Spain, passes over Spanish
                        territory, convenient towns traversed being Oviedo, Valencia, Bur- dos,
                        Ateca, Calatayud, and Castellón. The shadow then crosses the Mediterranean,
                        pass- ing over the islands of Majoroa and Ivisa and cuts the African
                        continent near Philippeville and Callo, in Algeria. in its eastward course
                        it falls on Sfax in Tunia, and numerous coast stated in Tripoli, and towards
                        the end of its career passes over Egypt near Assouan, and finally terminates
                        in Arabia.</p>
                    <p>The facts that the eclipse occurs in the month of Augustm when many people
                        can afford the time to visit Southern Europe, that the track is
                        comparatively near home, that totality last for over three minutes, and fi-
                        nally that this is the only total solar eclipse that can be easily reaches
                        from England for some years to come, account for the great popular interest
                        attached to this event.</p>

                    <p>The non-arrival of the gauge readings from Rosaries since the 20th of the
                        last month is due to the fact that the telegraph office has been closed on
                        account of the illness of th clerk. On Saturday last the office was still
                        closed but the irrigation inspector telegraphed the missing reading of the
                        last month from Slings, a station some thirty miles from Rosaries and we are
                        now able to complete our July table.</p>
                    <p>We can easily understand the inconvenience which would be caused by the
                        illness of a telegraph clerk in such a remote district and the difficulty of
                        replacing him at a moment’s notice, but the Telegraph Administration must
                        have now been aware of the fact for about a fortnight. It is a very serious
                        matter to deprive the public of telegraphic communica- tion to any station
                        for even the shortest period but when a telegraph office is closed for more
                        than a fortnight, merely on account of a clerk’s illness, it would seem that
                        the authorities show a considerable disregard for the public which takes
                        some interest in the Nile flood.</p>

                    <head>HIDDEN TREASURE AT TOUKH EL GARAMOUS.</head>
                    <p>A Tell or mound, close to the village of Touch el Garamous, in the Facous
                        district, has yielded a magnificent treasure to the Antiquities Service. It
                        appears that a few months agate Government authorised a rich proprietor of
                        the neighbourhood to take sebakh from the mound and with that object gangs
                        if villagers not to work to dig outtings into the Tell, which rises some 10
                        metres above the surrounding lines, and a Deauville railways was constructed
                        to remove the loads of sebakh as fast as they were dug out. </p>
                    <p>The Government had prudently inserted a clause in the contract insisting on
                        all the necessary precautions being taken to protect an antiquities that
                        might be discovered during the digging, and the Antiquities Ser- vice posted
                        a ghaffir on the spot who was charge to protect its interests. In August 3
                        the ghaffir was riding over the Tell on a donkey, when the beast suddenly
                        came down heavily. The rider after picking himself up, found that one of the
                        ass’s forelegs had gone through the roof of a vault. He enlarged the opening
                        and saw a treasure; two or three watchers rushed to the spot, the village
                        follow- ed in a body, and the nearest omdeh was sent for. </p>
                    <p>Lord Cromer, in his report for 1904 re- marks that causes have come before
                        him in which omdehs have shown the most praise- worthy tact and presence of
                        mind. The omdeh of Toukh el Garamous Ahmad Effendi And ed Ali, appears to
                        have possessed the ;after virtue in a high degree. Finding the gaffer
                        executing the villagers of desiring to steal the objects in the vault and
                        the villagers accusing the gaffer of having already stolen most of them the
                        omdeh kept the crowd away called up the sheikhs and ordered them to guard
                        the vault for the night wired to the Antiquities Service and the Momour of
                        th earkas and though we cannot guarantee the last item, put the ghaffir
                        under observation. He then took an inventory of the objects discovered.</p>
                    <p>On the evening of the 3rd inst. the native Inspector of the Antiquities
                        Service came up from Faoour. The Inspector from Zagazig followed next day,
                        and the treasure about which the energetic omdah and the sheik had camped
                        all nights put under guard Saab, according to out informants, are the de-
                        tails of this most interesting discovery. If the list of the objects
                        discovered, which we have received is substantially accurate it is obvious
                        that a find of the highest impor- dance and value has been made.</p>
                    <p>Here are some of the principle objects which have been inventoried- 2 silver
                        bowls. one of them gilt, 2 candlesticks, a silver crown a silver figure of a
                        cock, part of the head of a silver statuette covered with gold lead, a pair
                        of gold polished bracelets with the clapse carved in the shape of a bird
                        with a housing face, a bracelet with the figure of Horus on the catch a gold
                        bracelet shaped like a serpents with a red stone set in the head, a golden
                        diadem set with jewels, nine plates of silver a chased silver bowl, 17
                        silver and 118 gold coins, th leather bearing either the head of monarch, or
                        the figures of a bird, etc. etc.</p>
                    <p>We imagine from the appearance of the coins is this list that the treasure
                        will prove to be Roman or Psolemaic. Owing to the absence of all its
                        European inspectors the Antiquities Service at Cario has been unable to
                        furnish us with any information on the subject.</p>

                    <p>Port Said, Sunday. We had here yesterday a large tug, the Oceans on her
                        return voyage from Saborg in Sumatra. This vessel on the 9th May was sighted
                        coming in from the sea, having in tow a large vessel evidently much larger
                        than herself. The Oceans of 115 tons net, and her consort the Tankerville
                        whose tonnage was 2320 had come out form Eastern Europe in 17 days, and
                        although the monsoon is blowing all the time in the Arabian sea, they
                        proceeded and eventually arrived in safety. This tow, both for its length
                        (over 8000 miles) and its freedom form serious accident is well worthy of
                        note. I was informed that all went well on the voyage the tug coaling form
                        her tow as occasions demanded and that but little occurred to mar the

                        <p>London, August 5 Kent beat Surret by ten wickets. Jetta Gloucestershire
                            and Yorkshire Hampshire were abandoned. The rest of the matches for this
                            date were drawn.</p>
                        <p>A.C.C ROYAL BERKSHIRE REGIMENT Played on Saturday last. The regiment won
                            the toss and sent in Capt. Moore and Mr. Strange who made a fair start
                            putting on 23, when the former fell to a fast ball from Maclarei. A
                            collapse followed six wickets going down for 39, and though Capt.
                            Binglay and Pta. Webb added a few by hitting out, that total for the
                            innings was only 13. H.B. Carver was the most successful of the Club
                            bowlers. With an easy task before them, the A.C.C. bataman treated the
                            Regiment’s bowling with a great want of respect, and after Maclaren
                            had left at 16, H.B. Carver and Stacey did what they pleased till the
                            score reached 175, when Carver, in getting back to hook a lob, trod on
                            his wicket. His innings of 101 was marked by great vigour and brilliancy
                            and he gave no chances till he had made 78, when he might have been
                            caught twice and stumped once. Macaulay who came in next, hit extremely
                            freely all round the wicket and was not out when stumps were drawn, with
                            a vigorous 77 to his credit. Stacey, who played with more freedom than
                            usual, carried out his bat for a chanceless 87 the club thus winning
                            easily and decisively. Score-</p>

                    <head>THE HEDJAZ RAILWAY</head>
                    <p>The following letter from Alexandria appears in the latest issue to hand of
                        the “Spectator”- When it was announced that the Ottoman Government had
                        decided to construct a railway from Damascus to the Holy Cities of Islam,
                        British journals, influenced no doubt by pessi- mystic experts, took little
                        to no interest in the scheme. A few German military periodi- cals noted the
                        strategical importance of the railway, and one or two paragraphs appeared in
                        French papers protesting against the injury done to the French Damascus-
                        Mercrib line through the construction of a rival railway by the government
                        which had granted the Campagine des Chemins de fer de la Syria a monopoly of
                        construction in the Hauran. In the Muslem world the news was received with
                        joy by all the supporters of the Pan- Islamic propaganda so sedulously
                        encouraged by Yildizm and subjects of the Sultan vied with one another in
                        their praises of the saga- petty of their Sovereign and subscribed large
                        sums to the funds of the Hamidie Hejaz line. Other Moslems, who looked on
                        the Sultan and his Turks as barbarous naur- pers and longed for an Arab
                        Khalifate, showed less enthusiasm their religious sen- timents were
                        vanquished or at least neu- tralised by their political opinions. A railway
                        might carry multitudes of Hajia to Mecca it would certainly transport
                        thousands of Os- manli soldiers to the Hedjaz and there was no reason why
                        the railway once carried to Mecca should not be prolonged to the Yemen, It
                        has been suggested to me that it was the dread of this result, co-operating
                        with Turkish misgovernment that has made the rising of 1905 in the Yemen and
                        Asir provinces so des- perate and so gusoral. </p>
                    <p>During a brief holiday which I spent in Syria this year I travelled from
                        Damascus to Ma’su the present terminus of the Hedjaz line. I have nothing
                        but praise for the construction of the railways. The German and Italian
                        engineers employed by the Turkish Government are as capable as the are
                        honest and some sections of the line notably in the hills above Amman and on
                        the unfinished branch linking Haifa and Derse, compare very favorably with
                        the line over the Lebanon and some of the Swiss mountain railways. The
                        material is fair but there personnel cannot be described as efficient. The
                        Germans and Italian cannot train the whole staff and a great proportions of
                        the employes are Turkish or Arab soldiers whose ignorance of there work is
                        complete. To clap a stationmaster;s uniform on an ex-non-commis- ioned
                        officer of calvary does not make him an efficient stationmaster; yet that is
                        the policy that the military authorities have followed in the selection of
                        most of their Moslem subordi- notes. the line is at present open for traffic
                        to a paint 475 kilometers south of Damascus and about four days march form
                        the Turkish port of Akabs on the Red Sea. The soldier workmen have completed
                        the embankments and prepared the track for the thirty miles further south,
                        and the survey parties have pushed sixty miles more into the interior of
                        Midian. The German and Italian experts will be polite;y dismissed as soon as
                        the rails near the Holy Cities and Moslem understudies are now being trained
                        who will it is hoped, replace them successfully. I doubt whether the
                        construction of the sec- tons confined to these officials will prove as
                        cheap.</p>
                    <p>I have emphasized the military character of the line, and I must emphasise it
                        again. Although the Damascus-Amman and the Half-Deras sections run through
                        some extreme- ly fertile districts, the line as a whole can never pay. South
                        of Amman a rocky wilderness succeeds a barren steppe and there are a few
                        more desolate countries in the world than Arabia Patras and the interior of
                        Midan. food, forage, and in some places water have to be railed down for th
                        supply of the troops on the line between El Hasa and Ma’an, an d the country
                        for a hundred an fifty miles to the south is equally unproductive. The
                        pilgrim traffic is never likely to do more than balance the damage done to
                        the carriages by thievish or careless Hajia and the wear and tear of the
                        Haj. But in the last week of February and the first fortnight or so of March
                        over twenty thousand soldiers, two-thirds of them Syrian Moslem reservists
                        were untrained at Damascus and Amman an march ed across the desert to Akaba.
                        There were admitted defects in the mobilization an accidents on the railway
                        were only averted say the Turks by the special interposition of the Prophet.

                        Syrian Moslems be risked when the Haifa Dersa section is open to traffic,
                        and the railway material for the purpose of renewing or prolonging the line
                        can be sent op cheaply and rapidly from the coast.</p>
                    <p>Yet a few years and the linking up of the Anatolian lines with the
                        Aleppo-Demascus and Damascus-Hedjaz systems will enable the Otto= man
                        Government to send its best troops from Europe and Anatolia to Demascus,
                        Ma’au or Mecca by rail without the slightest risk of interference form the
                        sea. Today the outlying provinces of the Turkish Empire are at the mercy of
                        any nation that possess a fleet and can transport thirty thousand men to
                        Syria or Arabia, In ten years’ time railway power will enable the Ottoman
                        dynasty to meet the me- nance of sea power with more confidence than in the
                        past. </p>
                    <p>The Sultan of course gets the credit of the Hedjaz Railway scheme with he
                        Moslem world, but I am informed by persons who have had success to sources
                        of information which are closed to the world in general that the real
                        originator or the scheme was General vou der Goltz, whose plans for the
                        defense of the Ottoman Empire included the construction of great strategical
                        lines which would enable the Turk - wish Empire as a potential ally whose
                        interven- ion is the Caucasians might contain large forces loch would
                        otherwise be hurried the Austrian and German frontiers. But the over- throw
                        of the Mosoovite on land and sea has made Russo-Turkish or Russo German war
                        highly improbable and it is possible that the German-trained strength of the
                        Turkish Empire may be employed against another foe when the great railways
                        are ready.</p>
                    <p>There can be no doubt that Germany has to a great extent supplanted us in
                        Turkey. Our snarls and grimaces unaccompanied by mili- tary action during
                        the American massacres were constructed by the Turks with that friendly
                        support and diplomatic cordiality evinced by the German Emperor during those
                        years of horror. Our veiled protectorate over Koweit out presence in wgypt
                        out sympathy with the Macedonian and Armenians do not endear us to the
                        Sultan and since the conclusion of the Anglo-French Agreements the sole
                        opposition we have to face in Egypt is subventioned and supported by the
                        Pan-Islamic leaders at Stamboul.</p>
                    <p>German hostility to Great Britain is no new thing, though we have recognised
                        it rather late in the day. With Turkey hostile to the first Moslem Power in
                        the world, German ambitions might contemplate the possibility of using the
                        Turkish forces to create a formidable diversion during an Anglo-German
                        conflict at Koweit and on the Egyptain border. I am aware that the devotees
                        of sea power proclaim that Egypt is and must remain the prize of the Power
                        tat controls the seas. But the Suez Canal could be blocked with the greatest
                        ease, Ma’An is only fifteen marobes form Ismailia and though the Sinai
                        Peninsula and the desert of El Tih are inhospitable enough, large armies
                        have entered Egypt from the north-east since the dawn of history, and th
                        eTurkish solder re- quires little but bread,water, and cartridges. The
                        concentration of an army is Southern Palestine would not be hard to screen,
                        and even of the first attack proved a total failure, it might well be
                        repeated with greater success. And can we assume that the first attack would
                        val even if the Sudan remained absolutely quite and certain elements in
                        Egypt required do watching 1. The movement on Egypt would be by two or three
                        corps d’ arovee collected in Syria for the catencible purposes of
                        suppressing an Arab or Druse rising; and whatever may be said oft he natural
                        difficulties, Sultan Selim and the Saracen rulers of Egypt and Syria took
                        large and well-equipped armies across the same desert in the past. The
                        difficulty if inducing the Ottoman Government to take the risk would no
                        doubt be considerable, but German influence has made such strides in Turkey
                        that the conclusion of an offensive and defensive alliance between the
                        Kaiser and Sultan Ab- dul-hamid is now a possibility. </p>
                    <p>If ever the rivalry between England and German y comes to a head, it is not
                        unlikely that our great opponents will do her utmost to force us to a land
                        struggle and use Moslem fanaticism as one of her weapons. The Kaiser’s
                        intervention on Morocco has had its effect in the Near East. It has
                        confirmed the impression made by the Imperial visit and the sedulous
                        attentions paid to the Sultan ever since 1890 just as the stories of
                        “British intrigue in Arabia” “British designs on Mecca” . to which the
                        German Press had given a wide circulation have influenced the Pan-Islamic
                        party, which now begins to look on England as an implacable enemy. </p>

                    <head>JAPAN AND AUSTRALIA </head>
                    <head>A NOTE OF ALARAM</head>
                    <p>The progress of the conflict between Japan and Russia has had a greater
                        interest for Aus- tralians then for any other non-Asiatic com- munity, by
                        reason of the proximity of their country to the scene of operations. When
                        Russian obtained possession of Vladivostock grave apprehension s were
                        entertained last in the event of a rupture with Great Britain , it should be
                        made a bare of hostile operation s against the island-continent and those
                        fears were renewed after the seisure of Port Arthur in the termination of
                        war between China and Japan. With its extensive coast lire of about 8,850
                        miles and numerous spacious but unprotected harbors, the Commonwealth is
                        practically at the mercy of a hostile fleet, despite the presence of the
                        Australian Squad- ran and it si al but certain that in the event of a
                        rupture with Great Britain , a landing followed by area occupation, would be
                        effect- ed on the northern coast, while the British was vessels were engaged
                        in defending southern ports. This state of affairs has never serious- ly
                        engaged the attention of either the Aus- tralian Parliaments or people,
                        every movement in the direction of improving the Federal de- fences being
                        regarded as san excuse for increas- ing the public expedenture. </p>
                    <p>Of late, however considerable misgivings have been awakened with regard to
                        the future policy of a victorious Japan towards the Commonwealth. It is
                        admitted that the Australian treatment of Japanese as alien, the Japanese
                        crews of Japanese vessels in Commonwealth ports not being allowed on shore,
                        has created feelings of irritation through- out the land of the Mikado,
                        which, although at present kept under restraint, may occasion trouble after
                        peace has been proclaimed. But this policy of indiscriminate restricted im-
                        migration was entirely the work of the Australian Labour party, which has
                        declared war against the presence of coloured aliens, whether British
                        subjects or otherwise, on Commonwealth shores, even where their labour is
                        essential to the development of local indus- tries, as in Queensland. It is
                        not understood in Japan that the Australian people, as a whole, had no hand
                        or part in the restrictions imposed upon Japanese desirous of visiting
                        Australia. Hence it is simply natural that one complementary expressions
                        respecting the Commonwealth and its residents should be frequently heard
                        among the Japanese people. It would be strange were it otherwise But the
                        Japanese authorities are better informed, and do not appear disposed to move
                        in the matter beyond asking that the law be modified so as to allow the same
                        facilities to Japanese visiting the Commonwealth as are allowed Australian
                        landing at Japanese ports. </p>
                    <p>Meanwhile, a note of alarm is being vigorously sounded by a portion of the
                        Australian Press respecting the future policy of the Japanese Government
                        towards the Commonwealth. It is asserted that the pos- session of Northern
                        Australia, with its many millions of acres of unexplored country and mere
                        handful of white population, is coveted by the Japanese who behold in ti the
                        future source of untold wealth. “It is not a country for the white man” a
                        Japanese magnate is reported to have asserted, “yet rather than allow it to
                        be developed by those most capable of so doing, you prefer it to remain a
                        complete wilderness.” There is much truth on this definition of the
                        dog-in-the-manger policy of the Federal Government, but it is very unlikely
                        that the Japanese authorities have given a thought tot he future of northern
                        Australia. For many years to come Formoss, Korea and countries affording a
                        wider scope for Japanese enterprise that the land of the Southern Cross. But
                        the prophets of evil are not to be cornered. There insist that when the
                        Russians have been driven back into Sibera, the “Yellow Peril” will become a
                        tangible fact. Perhaps the wish is father to the thought. </p>
                    <p>The Japanese in Australia bitterly resent these imputation in the good faith
                        of their fellow countrymen towards what they regard as one of the richest
                        portions of the British Empire, and point out that a rupture with their
                        great ally would be simply playing into the hand of Russia and Germany.
                        Much, however, depends on the action of the Labour Party, both in the
                        Commonwealth and in the States. In their determination to secure “a white
                        Australia” a laudable ambition in some reports the leaders are utterly
                        indifferent to the possibility of complication with other peoples. This is
                        the real danger of the future. “The real policy of Japan,” said a recent
                        visitor, “will be not to speak possession of any port of Australia or
                        Polynesia, but to build up its country and possession of the territories
                        wrested from the grip of the Russian, we shall have more than sufficient to
                        occupy our industrial energies for the next hundred years.” There was
                        considerable truth in these observations. Australians most conversant
                        declare that its trend is in favor of the development of Japan;s commercial
                        and in- dustrial resources rather than the pursuit of a Napoleonic
                        ideal.</p>

                    <p>That famous lady Madame Adam, or Ju- liege, Lambert, who once possessed so
                        much influence, social, and political, in the Thurd Republic, has followed
                        up the publication of her memoirs. by a new volume of much in- terse
                        untitled “Mes sentiments et nos Idées avant 1870.” It is issued by Lemerre,
                        and Madame Adam dates her new series of remini- scenes from the year 1865,
                        when she was in the South of France, on the horse in the Golfe Juan, near
                        Cannes, with her father, Docot Lambert , her mother and the daughter. There
                        Madame Adam was visited by many notabil- ities, including Prosper Merimee
                        and Dr. Mare, a great friend o fM.Thiers. Politics were much discussed at
                        these visits, and it is interesting to note that at this period Thieres as
                        Maure showed, foresaw the daughter looming from the side of Germany, whereas
                        Merimee a staunch Imperialist, refused to believe in any possible diminution
                        of French prestige. An- other strong imperialist, Ales-Dufour, was also a
                        visitor at Madame Adam’s villa, and be too, trusted firmly in that star of
                        Napoleon III. This Aries-Dufour belonged to the Man- chester school, and
                        corresponded with Cobden. He believed in the Universal Exhibition, the
                        fraternity of the nations, and peace societies. In fact, there was as much
                        talk about peace and union in those days as in our own, and Dufour went so
                        far as to call Napoleon III. “Mon Emperor Pacifist” in the face of Madame

                        tion,” replied Dufour, “there will be no more wars. That the conviction of
                        Napoleon III., and it is mine.” </p>
                    <p>At this time, as Madame Adam writes, the exiles Louis Blane, Ledru-Rollin,
                        Eugene Pel- letan, and Edmond Adam were calling upon the Republicans at home
                        to act against the Empire, This was the subject of a remarkable conversation
                        between Prosper Merimes and Madame Adam, Merimes was prophetic in ut-
                        trance, “Do you believe, Juliette Lambert, you who are a sincere Liberal, “
                        he said, “that the Peyrata, the Challemel-Lacours, the Aragos, and the
                        Jacobin descendants, the Brissons, the Ferrys, and the Rancs would give you
                        liberty if they had the Government in their hands. They are the sons of
                        Robespierre, of Saint-Juste of Marat. If ever they get the power they will
                        go to work not only like the Terrorist, but like the Church in its darkest
                        days. They are a church in themselves, these fanatics of anti-clericalism a
                        church smaller than the other, just just as dogmatic. They regard themselves
                        as free intellects, but they are only irritating the others by not accepting
                        their formulas. Between that Church if these and the Church of the clericals
                        I make no distinction. I am free, too, in intel- let. I am a Liberal a
                        sincere anti-clerical but there others- “and here the con- version was
                        interrupted by the arrival of Victor Cousin, who, hearing Merimes’s last
                        words, said, “Oh, I see the black spectre is still with you.” “Oh , no,”
                        said Merimes; “I was talking of the red spectre.” Cousin here complimented
                        Madame Adam on her dress and her good looks. She returned the compliment in
                        another way, whereupon Meri- mer called her a flatterer and said that she
                        might have given the philosopher a few hints as to his own appearance and
                        attire. “And,” say Madame Adam, “Cousin was really slovenly and did little
                        honor to French letters while crowds of spruce Englishmen, brushed and
                        rebrushed were pairing up and down in the croisette.” Thus Madame Adam
                        continues in her chatty way, throwing side lights on many events leading up
                        to the fall of the Second Empire. </p>
                    <p>What is far more interesting are her frag- memtary conversations with with
                        all the most cele- rated people of her time. She has some m valuable pages
                        on George Sand, and gives private views or glimpese of natal men in their
                        shirt-sleeves, as it were. She knew every- body in her time, and was the
                        friend of politicians of opposing factions, of Conserva- tives and Radicals,
                        as well as of the literary and artistic people. Towards the close of the
                        book is an entertaining chapter relating how Madame Adam was boycotted by
                        the ladies at Cannes because she proclaimed herself to be a pagan, and said
                        that she prayed to the divinities of Greece especially in climes of light
                        and sunshine where Nature was most divine. The volume comes down to
                        September, 1870 , when Madame Adma, her husband, and their great Italian
                        friend, Signor Cernnus- ehi who became a neutralised Fenchman because France
                        was vanquished by Germany were weeping together over the defeat of MacMahoun
                        and the capitulation of Sedan. </p>

                    <p>The proposition to gove the Russina peasants more land makes it interesting
                        to note that so far, from the time of the great eneacipation, 159,606
                        members of the Noblemen’s Union have said to petty culturists 24,200,00
                        scres for L62,000,000. This idea of alternately blud- gooming and benefiting
                        the peasants brings to memory a story of Archbishop Benson’s. A friend of
                        his saw brought into a Russian police- court a priest in undress of purple.
                        The magistrates and the police knelt and kissed this hand; then rising the
                        magistrate said, “You nasty drunken beats, so you were drunk again
                        yesterday. I’ll make you remember it this time.” And they led the priest out
                        into the courtyard tore off his clothes, and gave him fifty lashes. When he
                        was brought back , half- fainting, into the court, they all knelt again,
                        kissed his hand, and received his blessing .</p>

                        between Great Britain and Portugal relative to the frontier of their
                        respective spheres of influence in Central Africa, has been issued.</p>

                        to determine the western limits and accordingly King Victor Emmanuel was re-
                        quested to give his decision upon the matter.</p>
