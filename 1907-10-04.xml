                    <head>RECKLESS RHETORIC.</head>
                    <p>Mr. Victor Grayson, one of those members of Parliament who desire to pose as
                        upholders of the rights of the Egyptians to self-government, recently
                        indulged at Hudderfield in a violent attack on Lord Cromer. Referring to the
                        recent money grant made to that distinguished servant of the State, Mr.
                        Grayson said that "the national exchequer had been depleted to fill the maw
                        of an idle and cruel parasite, who was a curse to the race." Never, we
                        imagine, did public speaker offer greater insult to any man, and never was
                        uttered a bigger falsehood or more cruel slander. Surely Mr. Grayson does
                        not think that by using such repulsive phraseology he is helping those whose
                        interests he pretends to have at heart! Surely he can see that by such
                        abusive rhetoric he is harming those whom he would have the world believe he
                        is helping! It is amply evident that such men as Mr. Grayson are but using
                        the advanced Nationalist party of Egypt as a cats-paw to obtain their own
                        end-- a notoriety which would be a disgrace to any man of sincere feeling
                        and true patriotism. The most rapid Anglophobes of this country have never
                        gone so far, even in their most heated moments, to describe Lord Comer as
                        "an idle and cruel parasite," and while decrying his work they confess that
                        it was he who brought riches to the country. Lord Cromer was throughout his
                        career, and is still in his hour of rest, the most devoted friend which
                        Egypt has ever claimed, and during his many years of public life he has
                        proved himself, as a servant to the vast Empire to which he belongs and for
                        which he has striven, unsurpassed in faithfulness. Lord Cromer, lifted the
                        yoke of slavery from the necks of the Egyptians and gave them liberty; he it
                        was who made a bankrupt country rich; to him is due the suppression of
                        bribery and corruption; he is responsible for the reformation of the
                        country's courts and the administration of justice. For such services, for
                        such unparalleled works of wonder, we might say, Lord Cromer is help up to
                        public opprobrium by a youthful M.P., whose ignorance is only deserving of
                        the infants school. But Lord Cromer can afford to disregard the reckless,
                        meaningless rhetoric of an ignorant youth, who has no yet learnt the lesson
                        of self control. He is conscious of the good work which he has done during
                        his long career, and he knows that those of worth and sound judgment, those
                        who have followed the trend of events with an unbiassed mind, and those for
                        whom he has worked are filled with the greatest admiration for his
                        services.</p>

                    <head>GERMANY AND FRANCE.</head>
                    <p>Referring to the telegram which we publish under this heading on page 5, the
                        statement of the German newspaper apparently is due to the allegation made
                        by a French newspaper recently to the effect that Germany, in view of the
                        present unfavourable condition of her money market, is not in a position to
                        bear the cost of a war. The latest mail from Europe brings a leading article
                        from the "Cologne Gazette," which is said to be semi-officially inspired and
                        headed "Preparedness for War," where these statements of the Parisian Press
                        are opposed. The journal says:- "It would be regrettable if by such false
                        reports doubts as to Germany's military power and preparedness for war were
                        to arise. A belief in this readiness is essential to the support of peace;
                        therefore in the interests of peace such attempts to undermine it are very
                        reprehensible. In 1870 the strength of Germany's finances could not be in
                        any way compared with those which, thanks to the economical development and
                        growing wealth of the country, she has at her disposal to-day. What we could
                        do then we can do to-day in increased measure; if we are now in a position
                        to raise the necessary money for our economic aims by ourselves, neither
                        should we be obliged in time of war to appeal to foreign countries. All
                        concern about raising money should be tranquilly left to us We can have
                        nothing against French newspapers warning their fellow-countrymen against
                        investing their money in German stock; they can keep it or not as they like.
                        We can maintain a calm front towards such counsel; but it seems not only
                        useless, but, for general considerations, not a little dangerous to
                        represent Germany's monetary position as so wretched as to annul the aims of
                        national defence."</p>

                        time seemed probable, says the Standard". Those who have followed the matter
                        at all closely will remember that interest has chiefly centred in the
                        affairs of two or three wellknown names in Egyptian circles whose bille were
                        not met at their maturity at various periods during the past few months.
                        Many English and foreign banks were interested in the matter, and although
                        individually the lor, had they arisen, would have been an insignificant
                        affair, the amount collectively would have been quite snbstantial.
                        Throughout, these banks have been seting in concert, and in their interests
                        a solicitor, as reported by our special term of last Friday, recently went
                        out to Egypt to consult with Accountants on the spot (also acting on behalf
                        of the same interests, the object being to determine whe ther it was
                        advisable to conclude arrangements whereby the payment of the bills in
                        question could be prolonged for a given period. This gentleman has now
                        returned, and his report, which was presented to meeting of bankers to-day,
                        is understood to be satisfactory, both as regards the position of the
                        individual firms in question and general financial conditions in Egypt at
                        the present time. It would be pre mature to assume that some loses may not
                        yet have to be faced in connection with the difficulties of the two
                        important firms whose affairs have engaged especial attention but there is
                        now every reason for believing that such lowes will be onder mother than

                    <p>INEFFECTIVE MEASURES </p>
                    <p>The situation in the provincer is alarming, The pinch of famine is already
                        being felt in many places. The Government measures to encourage the import
                        of wheat has had little effect (Renter) </p>
                    <p>Some time ago a Turkish Commission was appointed to inquire into the best
                        means for putting an end to the distress due to exces Rive prices charged
                        for bread, which presten en hardly upon the poorer classes of the popnlation
                        throughout the Empire. As a result of the inquiry the Commission recommend
                        that in order to cope with the difficulty it is essential that for the time
                        being the export of wheat be prohibitel, and further, that the import duty
                        on combe suspended, which recommendations have received the action of the
                        Sultan. It is the oklory, that is to be heard in Turkey every year, and
                        particularly in Constantinople. For some time past the out of living has
                        been steadily rising per ticularly is regards fuel and bread Then, ton, the
                        harvest prospects have falsified all hoper, so that unless steps are taken
                        to deal with the scarcity, famine seems inevitable. But the situation and
                        the cause of all the trouble may be summed up in a certain inci dent which
                        lately took place at the town of Er room, towards the Persian frontier. A
                        few weeks ago two merchants, who were sus pected of cornering wheat, were
                        attacked and killed by an infuriated mob. This is the whole CARE Regards
                        Tarkish distress today. Certain high officials put their heads together, and
                        by the assistance of the middleman, set to work to exploit the consumer. It
                        is so all over Turkey: soch economie manipulations are in themselves a trade
                        which any official, who in Mufficiently intelligent, may practise to his
                        full bent We expend vast amount of sympathy on the Christian subjects of the

                        pensant. But, when the offerer i not a Christian it does not matter. </p>

                    <p>The prophets who braved the public derision by foretelling the formation of
                        political parties in Egypt at no distant date have the laugh on their side.
                        Last spring we were informed that for all practical parposes only one party
                        exist ed in the country-to wit the party which own Mustapha Pasha Kamel as

                        and foot, bag and baggage threatening it with the severe displeasure of the
                        Egyptian people should its statesman refuse to recognise the necessity of
                        instantly falling in with the demands formulated in and out of season by the
                        illustrious Kamel. Today wel are confronted with quite a host of parties.

                        anticipated by the best informed student of Egyptian affairs, and we are
                        still in the dark as to the hot importance of some of the parties which we
                        have mentioned. Any one who questions the average intelligent Egyptian will

                        which we have referred, and of the intelleet and capacity of their leaders,
                        and we therefore give the following summaries of their opinions given by
                        three well informed and highly intelligent young men odnoted and
                        enlightened, whom we recently questioned on this very interesting subject : </p>
                    <p>A declared roundly that Mohamed Bey Wahid represented nobody but a group of
                        young men of fashion who had conceived the idea that their personal
                        interests would be threatened by a triumph of Nationalism. Of Hafiz Effendi
                        Awad le bad little to my wave that he regarded the editor of "Al Minbar" as
                        a mere aspirant to notoriety, the tool of Bheikh Ali Yousef, whose jealousy
                        of the success of Mustapha Pasha Kamel bad never been concaled Sheikh Ali be

                        to Mustapha Praha who had always waged an open cam paign against the Opc

                        decided change since they made the discovery that Nationalism Wax regarded
                        by Karjel Pasha, whose vanity had always overborne both his prudence and his
                        savoir faire, &amp; monopoly to be run by himself and his faithful acolytes
                        and that his own violence and that of his henchmen and gladiators was
                        calculated to involve in a com mon ruin both his own projects and those of
                        wiser men </p>

                        danghter of Sheikh Sudat. He would have been more than human had be borne
                        these insults lightly, and being a man who held strong views as to the
                        danger of the "bag and baggage policy" advocated with threats by Mustapha
                        Pasba, he had protested in his own name and that of his many supporters,
                        among whom the majority if not all of the new "Party of the People" wonld
                        ultimately be reckoned against the rashness of leader, who had no doubt done
                        good work in his day but was too apt to imagine that the appearance of his
                        name in the "Temps" the "Figaro" or the Times," whether the hero of the
                        Egyptian Nationalist struggle or as the villain of a patriotic melodrama,
                        was in itself proof of greatness </p>
                    <p>while positive that Wahid Bey's follow ing was extremely small and doubtful

                        political quickrands and here it would assuredly be engulfed. With his
                        poliey of revolutionary reaction he had no sympathy nor though be praised
                        the talenta did he repose much con fidence in the leadership of Sheikh Aly
                        Yous sef Hafiz Effendi Awad had undoubtedly certain gifts but he was
                        unlikely to carry weight with more than a small section of the population
                        and, though better acquainted than Mustapha Pasha Kamel with the English
                        char acter -- an important consideration this for nationalist leader, lacked
                        his prestige and eloquence. The "People's Party" representeil the common
                        sense of vast number of Egyp tians who mw that nothing was to be gained by
                        threats and bluster, but that moob, perhaps oventual independence or
                        self-rule might be won by the avoidance of the policy of irritating the
                        occupants and by the adoption of X constructive programe of reform. This was
                        the party which was destined to survive; No tonalism had come to stay, but

                    <p>"The Sndan Times" learns from one who is fairly well acquainted with the
                        affairs of Darfor that the slave trade is still practised in that country.
                        He says that there are regular slave-markets where slaves are exhibited for
                        sale, just as it used to be in the past. The pilgrims who go to the Hedjaz
                        Kenerally take along with them a number of male and female slaves on the
                        pretext that they are body servants. On the retom of these pilgrims from
                        Mecca, very few of their slaves return with them. They claim that they had
                        been carried off by disease or had preferred to live for the rest of their
                        lives in the neigh bourhood of the holy places. It is alleged, however, that
                        they are sold in Arabia. We cannot vouch for the accuracy of these state
                        ments, continues our contemporary, but the matter certainly deserves
                        attention. The odions slave trade which has already been success folly
                        stamped out from all other parts of the Sudan shonld not be tolerated in

                    <p>To The Borror Or Ter BGYPTIAN GAZETTE | Sir.- notice that a recent
                        contribution of mine to your columns biss ovoked some eri ticism in the
                        Cairo Nationalist Press. I to marked, in reference to the present political
                        situation in Egypt, that there is always a very striking example before the
                        public wye of an administration runon potely Reyptian me thods without any
                        interference from Europeans, for the manner in which the Wakfs
                        Administration is managed affords an object lesson. </p>
                    <p>Your Nationalist contemporary makes the following rejoinder : </p>
                    <p>"We should like to ask the Oniro Corres pondent of the Rgyptian Gazette" if
                        to his knowledge any Parts and Lighthouses scandals have taken place in the
                        Wakho Administration No ! Thon with what right, or sopported by what
                        Argaments can be spent against this administration </p>
                    <p>"Give the Egyptians a fair triand Britishen will see that they are by moments
                        inferior to Butopeans or Americans. What is more, dals like the recent one
                        in the Ports and Lighthouse Administration (superintended by Englishment !)
                        will not be more frequent than they are to-day, nor perpetrated on snob -
                        wholesale scale as in some Huropean con tries </p>
                    <p>Now to adduce the unfortunate scandal, which have recently been brought to
                        light in the Ports and Lights Administration whexample of English
                        mismanagement of Reyptian sihin is quite beside the point. The terrible
                        state of affnin prevailing in that Administration has been made public
                        because it is unler English control and hause the English Adriers of the
                        Bgyptian Government are determined, far as posible, to stand out the bridens
                        taint of corruption in the various Government departments. Your Nationalist
                        contothporary appears to think that becadise bnch malpro tices bare not been
                        brought to light in regard to the management of the Wakt Administration that
                        it is credit to a purely Egyptian-run depertinent are many friends among the
                        batives and if they say is true about the Wakfs Administration for that that
                        department is in quite as parlous a state as the unfortunate Ports and
                        bighie Administration. But in the one on the red state of things has not
                        been made publiebe Ause it is nonaged as a purely native sondern while in
                        the latter case the light of day has been let in on a festering mass of
                        corruption thanks to the energy of its English administrators. </p>

                    <head>THE EGYPTIANS OF TO-DAY. </head>
                    <p>The receitly published work of the late Haji A. Browne "Bonaparte in Egypt
                        and the Egyptians Today," is the subject of a long and appre iative review
                        in the "Athenaeum," from which we extract the following </p>
                    <p>That the Egyptians are the mildest the most docile and perhaps the politest
                        of all Fastern per ples we agree with the author. That they are also the
                        least warlike may be confidently asset ted. Notwithstanding they can be
                        turbulent upon occasions, especially when they foney they wave nothing to
                        fear, which seems to us cowardly, Occasion, opportunity, is every thing with
                        them and what seems to be in demand at the moment they are ever ready and
                        eager to sipply. There was a clear demand in Barope for Egyptian
                        "Nationalism and the journalists of Cairo and others produced the thing at
                        once, full grown. On this point Haji Abdallah had no illusions. We are toll
                        here plainly that the Egyptians do not desire representative government.
                        That any one should have imagined that they could As a race desire a boon so
                        shotmot, shows the depth of Enlish ignorance of Eastern thought, and the
                        crying need of such a book as this. The ides o labour for nowage, for the
                        common well, is absurd and repugnant to all their notion. They have a
                        proverb to the following efl xet : </p>
                    <p>We ohserve throughout the book a certain tendency in the author to simplify
                        his hypotheses by the mission of some potent factor. The faults o the
                        Egyptian, where todohed upon, are 80 treated us to seem like vir thes; and
                        thus the whole ongs of the recent strained relations between the two races
                        is thrown upon the English, for whom, with the important exception of Lord
                        Cromer, he has fow good words. That a large proportion of our
                        fellow-countrymen deserve to be classified as "oads," when judged by an
                        Oriental stan dard of good breeding, iswe fear true. But it is not fair to
                        judge them solely by that stan dard, and we have noticed in Egypt, among the
                        rising generation, an inclination to view their mien and bearing in a
                        humorous light, which should tend to smooth matters, since the Egyptian is
                        wont to tolerate what makes him laugh. In this connection we must hazard a
                        doubt whether a wish to procure only publie school and university men for
                        posts in Egypt is altogether in accord with wisdom. The youth fresh from
                        those excellent institutions is apt to west, as his natural skin, a look and
                        a man ner, which-though it is not unlikely be may never discover the
                        fact-are not beloved in Egypt. It is commonly the unofficial Englishman who
                        makes himself offensive to the natives, point that is not bere brought out
                        with sufficient cleaness; and if even the most polite and sympathetic of the
                        English residenta do not fraternize with the Egyptians, it is owing, not to
                        racial pride, but to the different views of the two nations m to the statuts
                        of woman, a point which the Haji has not even mentioned. This last is bar to
                        social intimacy, more effectual than the difference of religion. </p>
                    <p>The average Egyptian sees but one thing at a time, and but one aspect of the
                        thing-often only some minor detail. He seems incapable of &amp; general
                        view. This is well stated in the opening pages; but we doubt whether the
                        statement would have any meaning for a reader unacquainted with the folk in
                        question. Take their songs, for instance. The Arabic singer throws out
                        phrase, a note or two, then pauses for applause. The individual notes, the
                        details, are more important than the tone, the whole. And any one stating a
                        problem or a riddle to uneducated Egyptians will be astonished by their
                        evident preoccupation with the mere words. Withal, possessing sense of
                        fictional truth, of the point and teaching of a story, which might be envied
                        by many a European, they take no pleasure in frets. This (the Haji has not
                        mentioned) is a main cause of their failure to comprehend the Englishman,
                        whose sense of fictional truth is often of the dallest. A people dwelling in
                        imagination, short-sighted in its vision of the actual, confronted with the
                        most matter of-fact of human races, clear sighted only for material things:

                    <p>The centenary celebration of the Geological Society of London were opened at
                        the Instite tion of Civil Engineen, Westminster, last Thursday and were
                        attended by delegates from all parts of the world. An interesting feature of
                        the proceedings was the reception held by the President, Sir Archibald
                        Geikio, at which addresses of congratulation were pre sented by the foreign
                        and colonial delegates Bight addresses were received from German
                        Universities and societies, and delegates from the Universities and learned
                        societies of Great Britain also acknowledged the debt which science owed to
                        the Geological Society. An address from the Government o Egypt was presented
                        by Captain H. G. Lyons (Director of the Geological Survey of Egypt), who wid

                    <p>During the reception Mr. C. J. Alford (of the Egyptian Mines Explortion Co.)
                        on behalf of the Institution of Mining and Metallurgy. presented the gold
                        medal of that society to Sir Archibald Geikie, in recognition of the
                        services rendered by Geology to the mining industry </p>
                    <p>THE PRESIDENTIAL ADI RESS. The principal event of the aftertoon session was
                        the delivery of the presidental address by Sir Archibald Geikie. The subject
                        of the ad. dress was "The State of Geology at the Time of the Pormation of
                        the Society." At the outset he said that no more signal proof of the real
                        brotherhood of science could be afforded than by the present assembly of
                        delegates from all parts of the world. Plunging into his historical
                        retrospect, the president traced the progress of knowledge as to the
                        structure and surface of the eatth from the wild, speculations of other days
                        to the mediaeval period in which soclesiastical dogma resisted the progress
                        of inquiry. During the Middle Agen heresy was unpopular as well w dan
                        gerous, but by the end of the eighteenth cen tary the hand of the Church had
                        relaxed its bold. </p>
                    <p>| It had been said that the geologist ought never to forget that the
                        mineralogist was his father. But, if the geologist was to own the
                        mineralogistas his father, he must surely acknow ledge the miner to be his
                        grandfather. For many centuries most of the current knowledge of the rooks
                        and minerals of the earth's crust was gained by those who worked in mines,
                        and when miners established mining schools for the practical training of
                        those who were to follow their craft, they took an important step forward in
                        paving the way for the creation of a sound geology </p>
                    <p>Closing with a eulogy of the society's work, Sir Archibald said that its
                        fellow and foreign members comprised most of the illustrious geologists of
                        the time. To the influence of a few of its lenders was to great extent due
                        the establishment of the Geological Survey in Great Britain na national
                        institution. A century so full of progress alike in the theoretical develop
                        ment and the practical application of geology gave the best augury of
                        advancement in the centary </p>
