                        <p>Tokio, July 28. The last Russian force at Saghalien has been isolated to
                            the south-east of Alexandrovsk and its submission is imminent. This
                            makes the Japanese virtual masters of the whole island. Rejoicings are
                            taking place here. Admiral Kataoka reports that 4 guns fired on the
                            Japanese flotilla from Alexandrovsk (Saghalien). They were quickly
                            silenced. A magazine exploded in town, burning the naval works.

                        a female Sudanese servant found dead at her home at Kom Bakir.</p>

                    <p>ALHAMBRA THEATRE.— There was a large audience last night at the premiere of
                        the new comedy written by M. George Ralli, the well- known local author. The
                        piece, which is entitled Les Surprises de l’Héritage, met with considerable
                        success.</p>

                    <p>A RECALCITRANT FATHER.—We are inform- ed that on Thursday a dog, believed to
                        be mad, bit a girl of 13, named Maria Sayed Hassan, in the leg. The father
                        of the child, a British subject, appears to have objected to the sug-
                        gestion made by the police that she should be immediately taken to hospital
                        for treatment The police communicated with the British Consulate, which
                        immediately informed the father that he must at once comply with the
                        proposal of the police, and allow his daughter to be treated.</p>
                    <p>ANOTHER EGYPTIAN ARRESTED IN SYRIA.— We are informed that Mustafa Efiendi
                        Nafih, the editor of a Tantah contemporary, was recently arrested at
                        Beyrout, where he had arrived en route for the Lebanon. Our unfortunate
                        confrère was accused of (1) agitating for the revival of the Arab Caliphate;
                        (2) being an agent of the Young Turkish Party, and we have no doubt that,
                        had the Ottoman authorities and their informer in Egypt only thought of it,
                        he would have been accused of blasphemy against the Prophet or of a plot to
                        steal the Black Stone itself After keeping their prisoner in an
                        uncomfortable gaol for some days, the police, being unable to discover any
                        proof of his complicity in any plot, let him go free with a warning to be
                        very careful in future.</p>

                        <p>The Customs returns for June, 1905, have just been published. The
                            statistics of the im- ports and exports recorded at the five custom-
                            houses of Alexandria, Port Said, Suez, Da- mietta, and Kosseir, show
                            that the total value of the imports of last month amounted to L.E.
                            1,452,898, against L E. 1,427,029 in the corresponding month of the
                            previous year, while the export totals showed a very large increase,
                            L.E. 1,316,611 against L.E. 998,088 in 1904, an increase of L.E.
                            318,693.</p>
                        <p>Taking the figures for the first six months of the present year we find
                            that the total value of the imports reached L.E. 9,427,286, against L.E.
                            8,680,095 during the correspond- ing months of 1904, showing the large
                            increase of L.E. 747,191. This increase is more than balanced by the
                            falling off in exports, the figures for the first half of the present
                            year being L.E. 9,609,952, against L.E. 11,055,749 in the first half of
                            1904, a difference of L.E. 1,445,797 in favor of the corresponding
                            period of the past year.</p>
                        <p>British imports, in which we include imports from the Mediterranean
                            possessions of Great Britain, amount to L.E. 506,446, including tobacco,
                            against L.E. 452,275 in June, 1904, giving the gratifying increase of
                            L.E. 54,171, while the exports amount to L.E. 512,485 in value, against
                            L.E. 470,650 in June, 1904. During the first six months, January to June
                            inclusive, of 1905, imports from Great Britain reached a total value of
                            L.E. 8,234,204, an increase of L.E. 235,132 on the figures for the
                            corresponding period in 1904, but the decrease in exports to Great
                            Britain is even more marked, amounting as it does to L.E. 701,342. In
                            comparing the import figures of the various Powers which have important
                            commercial relations with Egypt we notice a considerable increase in
                            British imports both during the past month and in the first six months
                            of the year. As for the other Powers, their import figures show a slight
                            decrease for June, 1905, in the case of Germany, Aus- tria-Hungary,
                            Russia, and Turkey, an increase of over 12% in the case of Italy, and
                            slightly improved figures for America, Belgium, France, and Greece. For
                            the first six months of the year imports showed increases in almost
                            every case, the figures for France, L.E. 1,025,631 against L.E. 849,939
                            in the period January 1— June 30, 1904, showing the most remarkable
                            growth.</p>
                        <p>The increase of exports daring the past month is well marked in the case
                            of England (+ LE. 41.784). Germany (+L.E. 59,556), France, America, and
                            Austria-Hungary. Recent events in the Black Sea have no doubt caused the
                            decrease in Russian exports and imports in June. In the first six months
                            of 1905 England comes first in the export list, followed by Germany and
                            France, in the order given, but Turkey is the only country having
                            important commercial relations with Egypt, the exports to which during
                            the above period of 1905 exceed those of the corresponding period of
                            1904.</p>

                        <p>A Ras el Bar correspondent writes : —The steamer, which is under contract
                            to carry the mails, was last year timed to leave Ras el-Bar at 11 a.m.,
                            reaching Damietta a little after 12 noon. This year the steamer leaves
                            Ras el-Bar at 8 a.m., reaches Damietta a little after 9, and passengers
                            who intend leaving for Cairo, Alexandria, and other places have to wait
                            till 1.25 p.m., the time the first train leaves after 7 a.m. On enquiry
                            it will be found that the Governor of Damietta has made an arrangement
                            with the owner of the steamer to leave Ras el-Bar at 8 a.m. (He is
                            staying there with his family and he has to be at his Damietta office at
                            9 a.m.) The con- sequence is that the public is put to great

                        <p>Port Said, Friday. Yesterday, the British steamer Whampca, chartered by
                            the Russian authorities as a hospital ship, arrived from the East,
                            having on board 160 sick and wounded. The whole of this number were in
                            various stages of insanity, some dangerous and in cells, others with
                            merely slight attacks of mental aberration. On the upper deck were built
                            two large steel wire cages, in which, quite open as they were to the
                            gaze of the curious, could be counted between 60 and 70 poor wretches
                            hanging on to the bars and staring at passing boats. Not one of these
                            men but appeared to have been wounded, and I understand they had all
                            been attacked with a severe form of fever, brought on by starvation and
                            innumerable privations, which was the cause of their insanity. The
                            vessel sailed for the Black Sea at 10 p.m.</p>

                        <head>FIRE ON THE MACEDONIA.</head>
                        <p>The morning after the Macedonia had been shifted to the petroleum basin,
                            two selected experts were called to hold a survey and advise as to the
                            best method of dealing with the fire on board. The gentlemen ap- pointed
                            were Comm. Vaquier, of the M. M. Company here, and an engineer. These
                            gentlemen at once advised that the hatches should be opened and that
                            next day the coal be discharged. The general idea held here was that
                            this advice was, to say the least, premature and hardly in agreement
                            with previous like experiences of fires in coal cargoes. The usual
                            method is to close up everything and inject steam or carbonic acid gas,
                            both-of which processes have had consi- derable success in Port Said and
                            elsewhere. The result amply bore out the opinion of many, for by
                            yesterday afternoon clouds of smoke were pouring out of the hatchway,
                            rendering discharge impossible, and soon after wards things got so bad,
                            that the fire, fed as it had been by fresh air since the pre- vious day,
                            had gained such a hold that the only way left to save the ship was to
                            flood the hold. Fortunately, the Canal Com- pany had taken promotions to
                            have the jumps alongside, and these soon flooded the hold and thus
                            averted what night have proved a terrible disaster. The vessel is now
                            quiet and lieing on the bottom, her deck line well above water. The
                            water is being pumped out.</p>

                        <head>CAIRO TRAMWAYS.</head>
                        <p>We understand that, in connection with the concession recently granted to
                            the Cairo Tram- way Company for the extension of their lines, the
                            company will contribute £40,000 towards the cost of construction of the
                            three new Nile bridges, and that an extension of five years has been
                            granted to the company. As we announced yesterday, the Tramway Company
                            have informed the Ministry of Public Works that it is their intention to
                            provide first class cars on all their lines from January 1, 1906. Such
                            an innovation has long been wished for in Cairo, and its necessity has
                            been greatly felt by a large number of Cairo residents. At the present
                            time, first-class cars are only provided on the line which runs from
                            Kasr el-Nil to the Pyramids, and though on other lines one does
                            occasionally meet with compartments reserved for those desirous of
                            travelling first- class, these are small, and the heat in them is so
                            excessive, that it often deters a would- be passenger from entering
                            them.</p>
                        <p>We are unaware of the design upon which these new cars are to be
                            modelled, but the principal point to which attention should be paid as
                            regards the comfort of passengers is that there should be a free
                            circulation of air, so that the car may be kept compara- tively cool. If
                            this be the case, if the cars are comfortable and are kept clean, there
                            is but little doubt that they will be well- patronised and that the
                            company will be well repaid for the extra expenditure. Whilst we are
                            writing on the subject of Cairo tramcars we might point out the
                            necessity for the creation of a bye-law by which somebody would be held
                            responsible for the over-crowding of the trams. The Cairo trams are
                            allowed to become overcrowded to a most dangerous extent,and numbers of
                            people can often be seen standing on the footboard, clinging to any
                            support which they can find. The dislodging of a person in such a
                            position by a sudden jerk is very possible and serious injury might
                            follow. In fact, quite recently a young man travelling on the footboard
                            of a Rod-el-Farag car fell off and was killed, and there are every day
                            many chances of a repetition of such a case. A tram- car should be
                            licensed to hold a certain number of people, as in Europe, and the
                            conductor who is responsible for seeing that this number is not exceeded
                            should be liable to severe punish- ment for any infringement.</p>

                        <p>Suez, Friday. As I wired you this forenoon, the Russian auxiliary cruiser
                            Kuban arrived at Suet this morning from the Far Bast, and will enter the
                            Canal at 10 o’clock this evening for Liban. This huge vessel, formerly a
                            Hamburg-Amerika passenger steamer, has three funnels with two low masts,
                            and is fitted with wireless appara- tus. She flies the naval flag and
                            pennant She carries several quick-firing guns, similar to those fitted
                            to other auxiliary cruisers. Her last victim was the British India
                            steamer Fazilka, which was stopped by her in the Red Sea, south of
                            Daedalus lighthouse, last Tues- day morning. Her papers were overhauled
                            and on being found in order the vessel was released. The Fazilka sailed
                            from Suez Last Saturday bound to Aden, Colombo, Madras, and Calcutta
                            with general cargo and passengers.</p>

                            and was transferred to Alexandria in 1896. Thanks to his efforts the
                            Alexandria Museum contains a first-class collection of the Ptolemaic end
                            Roman coinage of Egypt, which ranks among the richest collec- tions of
                            the kind in the world. Mr. Dutilh published an extraordinary number of
                            brochures on his favorite study, in all of which he dis- placed a wide
                            erudition and a remarkable diligence, happily combined with a no less
                            admirable modesty, and was at all times ready to give information as to
                            the dates, histories or values of coins submitted to him by en- quirers.
                            He was an honorary member of the Egyptian Institute and corresponding
                            member of a number of European numismatic societies. He was a
                            contributor to the "Journal In- ternational de de Numismatique,”
                            published by Svoronos of Athens, to the "Revue Beige de Numismatique”,
                            the "Revista numismatica Italiana,” the “Bulletin de l'Institut
                            Egyptien," and the "Bulletin de la Société Archaeologique d'Alexandrie.”
                            He was 69 years old at the time of his death. His funeral takes place
                            this afternoon at 5 o’clock.</p>

                    <head>CHRONIQUE FINANCIERE</head>
                    <p>L’animation va croissant sur notre marché, grâce à l’abondance du numéraire
                        en Europe et aux facilités que font les banques établies récemment en
                        Egypte, grâce aussi à la fermeté du coton. A moins d'évènements imprévus,
                        tout fait dono prévoir que nous aurons une saison d’été aussi bien remplie
                        que l’an passé, quoique plus surchargée.</p>
                    <p>le chiffre d’affaires a été considérable, sur- tout en National Bank ancienne
                        et nouvelle émission, en Banque d'Athènes, en Hôtels et en Daïra.</p>
                    <p>On donne comme raison de la sou- daine de la National Bank le prochain lance-
                        ment de la Banque Nationale d'Abyssinie dont l’émission serait confiée à la
                        National et dont on fixe la répartition sur la base de 1 action Abyssine
                        contre 6 actions National ; il ne faut cependant accepter ces données
                        qu’avec la plus extrème réserve, attendu que les groupes français et italien
                        sont respectivement inté- ressés pour on quart dans l'affaire. Tout ce qu’on
                        peut dire, c’est qu’il se présente déjà des acheteurs de Banque d’Abyssinie
                        à 1 £ de prime ; mais il n’a pu être traité aucune affaire dans
                        l'incertitude où l’on est encore de la date de l’émission et du nombre
                        d'actions offertes en souscription au public égyptien. Il nous revient en
                        dernière heure que la Banque d'A- byssinie a été traitée à £ 8 de prime hors
                        cor- beills.</p>
                    <p>Influencé par cette prochaine émission, le cours de la National Bank est
                        monté graduel- lement de 26 1/2. à 27 13/32, cours auquel elle clôture.</p>
                    <p>La Nouvelle a exactement suivi les mêmes fluctuations que l'Ancienne. Les
                        spéculateurs semblent même la préférer pour les raisons déjà citées.</p>
                    <p>En Agricole on a fluctué durant tonte la semaine entre 13 15/16 et 14 pour
                        finir ven- deurs à ce dernier prix. La Fondateur est de- mandée à 1035.</p>
                    <p>De 820 au débat les actions Crédit Foncier fléchissent à 815 pour rebondir
                        presque aussi- tôt à 825 1/2. On clôture à 824. Il va suis dire que le
                        groupe du Foncier emploiera tous ses efforts à pousser les cours plus haut
                        pour pré- parer un succès à la prochaine émission d'ac- tions nouvelles à
                        810. Selon las informations recues ces jours derniers, l'émission des
                        obliga- tions 3 1/2 pour cent a rencontré le meilleur accueil à Paris et a
                        été amplement couverte. La Fondateur monte de 8050 à 8350. avec tendance à
                        la hausse.</p>
                    <p>Après avoir fléchi de 9 3/8 à 9 1/4, la Land Bank remonte graduellement
                        jusqu’à “9 7/16 acheteurs.</p>
                    <p>La Cassa di Sconto ouvre à 178, fléchit à 176 1/2, mai reprend vers la fin à
                        181 1/2. La Nouvelle est à 170 1/2.</p>
                    <p>Les transactions en Banque d'Athènes ont été considérables. De 128 1/2 le
                        cours monte à 132, prix auquel on détache coupon (4 frs.) ; ceci ramène le
                        cours à 128, mais la valeur con- tinue sa marche ascendante et atteint 130
                        1/4 ex coupon, ce qui représente une avance de près de 6 francs pour la
                        semaine. La hausse provient du vote en première lecture de la pro- position
                        Pesmazoglu par le parlement hellé- nique. On s'attend à ce que la
                        proposition soit également votée en seconde lecture.</p>
                    <p>Très délaissée d’abord à 28 1/16, la Daïra se raffermit à 28 3/8 pour
                        clôturer à 28 5/16. la Deferred est entre 179 et 181.</p>
                    <p>La Delta light débute à 13, atteint 13 1/4 . et finit à 13 5/32 la Deferred
                        fluctue de 181/2 à 13 3/4 avec affaires restreintes.</p>
                    <p>Les Privilégiées Tramways d’Alexandrie flé- chissent de 162 à 153 pour
                        reprendre en clô- ture à 155. Les Dividendes reprennent aussi de 342 à
                        345.</p>
                    <p>En tendance meilleure, la Ramleh Railway hausse de 7 3/16 à 7 3/8.</p>
                    <p>la Salt and Soda est négligée entre 34/6 et 34/9.</p>
                    <p>L’Alexandria Water est en reprise de 14 7/8 à 15.</p>
                    <p>On a beaucoup échangé de Markets à 22/9. Des milliers d’Estates ont changé de
                        mains à un prix variant de 7/8 à 15/16. On clôture à 29/82 en forte
                        demande.</p>
                    <p>Très fermes au début, les Filatures fléchis- sent de 13/16 à 3/4 la Spinning
                        et de 5/9 à 5 les Cotton Mills.</p>
                    <p>Le groupe des Hotels est toujours en fa- veur :La Nungovich ouvre à 9 7/8 et
                        atteint 10 1/8 pour réactionner légèrement à 10 1/32 en clôture ; l’Upper
                        Egypt monte de 4 5/8 à 4 7/8 et les Egyptian Hotels de 2 1/4 à 2 7/16
                        acheteurs.</p>
                    <p>Sur la rumeur que les pourparlers entre l’Anglo American Nile et la Hamburg
                        America Linie se poursuivent d’une façon satisfaisante, l’Anglo American est
                        poussée de 5 3/8 à 5 3/4. On clôture à 5 5/8.</p>
                    <p>Le Trust, moins en vue, baisse de 1 3/8 à 1 5/16.</p>
                    <p>L’investment fluctue entre 1 5/16 et 1 3/8 pour finir à 1 11/32.</p>
                    <p>Les Building Lands sont demandées entre 4 1/8 et 4 3/16.</p>
                    <p>De 4 5/8 l’Urbaine monte à 4 13/16, en bonne tendance.</p>
                    <p>Délaissée an début à 2 7/16, la Delta Land finit demandée à 2 9/16. Cette
                        société aurait, paraît-il, conclu dernièrement plusieurs affai- res
                        avantageâtes.</p>
                    <p>Sur une rumeur qui tend à démentir le pro- chain lancement d’une société
                        concurrente, la Khédivial Mail reprend de 4 3/16 à 4 5/16 la Privilegiee et
                        de 16/- a 18/6 l’ordinary. La Brasserie des Pyramides fait un bond de 113 à
                        126 pour revenir a 122 en clôture la Privilégiée ; la Dividende monte de 60
                        à 65. La Crown Brewery reste immobile entre 200 et 202 la Privilégiée et 108
                        et 110 la Di- vidende.</p>
                    <p>L’Obligation Crédit Foncier est très sou tenue entre 314 et 315 l'ancienne
                        émission et à 272 la nouvelle.</p>
                    <p>De 1 1/8 l’Oasis monte à 1 1/4 pour réac- tionner en clôture à 1 3/16.</p>
                    <p>Le Comptoir, couvert, comme on le sait. 38 fois, ce qui constitue pour la
                        saison morte ou nous sommes un grand succès, débute a 4 1/2, atteint 4 5/8,
                        mais reactionne a 5/16 a la suite d’importantes réalisations. La Fondateur,
                        pra- tique d’abord au cours de 35 $, tombe pour la meme motif a 22-24 $.</p>
